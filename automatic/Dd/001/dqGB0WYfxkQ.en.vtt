00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.779
 hello today we will be interested 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.500
 made to wake starts to walk in 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.600
 will see times on stop 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.779
 so how are you going to work the cds good 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.890
 well it worked on a pretty good principle 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.529
 simple is the principle of 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.239
 superposition that will give rise to 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.910
 interference since we are going to pass 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.850
 laser light on the surface of a cd 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.910
 and that through interference we 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.250
 will have reading information about the 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.809
 so here you have a small picture to 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:53.289
 both of the lower part these 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.390
 convoys had to yield and then if we 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.460
 look at this picture that were taken 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.920
 under the microscope we realize that we have 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.600
 furrows so in fact it's the way 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.750
 on which will eventually be 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.399
 spiral and on which the light the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.840
 misery will pass and we realize that we 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.890
 has parties that are going to be flat we 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.780
 will call moors 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.400
 it's the same name in English or in 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.600
 French by the way and then what 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.060
 calls pitchs there is no trace 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.659
 no longer in France and we could say 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.939
 possibly hollows and bumps 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.479
 so this is going to be consist of 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.759
 these two language and pitt parties 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.110
 so here it is on the cd we know very 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.650
 although these have a form of 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.470
 spiral and if we look a little bit the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.229
 shape of a groove so we'll have it's 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.600
 flat parts and then it's hollow so 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.270
 we will be 6 years old who will be about 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.070
 the order will do anyway a pitt 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.210
 or a hollow may have a width from to 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.689
 about 5 100 nanometers 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.880
 and then the depth of the hollow will be from to 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.009
 about 100 25 nanometers so we 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.990
 will see why we have this value of 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.950
 125 nanometers she does not come here to 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.530
 nothing so how is it going to work 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.299
 I wanted to represent the top of the cd 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.790
 with the party that have garnished salt that is 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.610
 very very pretty and then below in 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.800
 do we will have 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.380
 the laser that will be moved by the transmitter 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.180
 and the sensor and is at the level of 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.810
 the transmitter so we will see broadcast and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.500
 reception of light by the sensor 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.680
 We're going to have 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.090
 under the varnish so is part flat 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.920
 which is called the landais of time in 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.770
 time can have a pit and then we go 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.600
 to have a hollow etc. then one can 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.510
 to have it's peaks that are more or 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.390
 less long hollow parts more or 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.700
 shorter too and if we see the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.130
 light so she's talking she's 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.780
 thoughtful she comes back but as soon as we 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.720
 go from the pit 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.430
 holland what can happen is 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.590
 we will have 6 laser beam 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.970
 precisely is quite thick a part that 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.360
 think about it and the other part that goes them 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.540
 to touch 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.370
 the land and who will come back and we will have 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.160
 at that moment the two light rays 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.580
 who in coming will not go through the 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.790
 same distance and actually the idea is 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.440
 to have a peak that is equal length to 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.330
 lambda out of four so why lambda 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.060
 four is because at the end of 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.950
 count the path that will make light 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.600
 who is going to make the most way is going to do 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.209
 the same distance as the previous one 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.340
 slower down on four but back 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.070
 will also Finland on 4 so we will 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.959
 have a lambda path difference 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.870
 on two now if you have a 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.510
 coherent signal of which servisair with a 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.580
 signal that is put in front so there we go 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.090
 have two rays emitted in phase with a 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.500
 phase that holds that constant 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.930
 if now lambda shifts on 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.890
 two we are going to have at this moment a 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.450
 interference that is going to be destructive 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.160
 happened to have destructive interference 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.620
 it means that the sensor finally 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.660
 will not receive any information and we will 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.549
 spend at that time of 0.1 or 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.750
 possibly from 1 to 0 so something that 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.329
 does not know that it must be 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.209
 the thickness of the pit 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.860
 so we said we had lambda 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.940
 now the path difference was 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.560
 be equal to lambda on two 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.110
 destructive interference 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.310
 in fact this is what 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:23.230
 this thickness of the pit is the thickness 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.950
 pit depends on the wavelength of the 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.570
 laser for example if we take a laser 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.160
 which has a wavelength of 6,100 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.100
 nanometers 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.580
 the pit must have a thickness of 250 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.770
 nanometers over six years / 4 so as to 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.750
 have a lambda path difference 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.120
 on two and have interference 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.500
 destructive when we pass when we pass 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.600
 by a jump in fact then there are people 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.910
 who think that if we are on the pit or 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.500
 the land the pitou the land are to associate 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:59.440
 at values 0 in fact not at all the the 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.940
 passage 0.1 is not past 1 0 only 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.040
 does that when there is a second gesture they 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.230
 put values ​​here for example if 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.580
 at the level of the python is 1 so 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.800
 we have time that evolves and we 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.380
 precisely records the laser and the 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.510
 sensor records the arrival the show 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.160
 the arrival of the laser as a function of time 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.320
 and regular time intervals on 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.890
 can end up so on the pit at 1 1 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.870
 1 1 and when we have a jump we go 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.810
 have interfering instructive and we're going 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.000
 go to zero and we will stay at 0 on the 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.590
 land as soon as we go from the land and 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.840
 we're going back to the peaks so we're going to have 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.630
 a destructive interfering jump 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:39.760
 we go back one and we stay one until 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:43.570
 next jump so here I have you 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.040
 does a magnification of a task the 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.060
 laser spot under the furrow one must know 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.320
 that by the way the first cd does 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.930
 did not walk saw laser with 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.490
 infrared radiation with spots 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.570
 by the way much bigger and then 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.530
 so wavelengths that were 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:59.020
 not at all that of the laser we see well 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.990
 that here the laser work is quite 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.169
 wide gap there that of a tiny 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:09.790
 part that will be able to pass in in 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:12.160
 the pit in the hollow even as 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.700
 now my dvd cd blu ray what 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.680
 difference 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.370
 so we'll have it here I gave you 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.680
 the image of the laser spot when she 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.450
 arrives on the furrow for a cd wrongly 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.840
 when we go to dvd we notice 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.280
 what then we will use another laser 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.860
 we arrange for the task of the laser 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.319
 much smaller 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.189
 I for a cd so we have a whole system 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:37.889
 of lenses that will try to focus 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:39.810
 to reduce the lola task width 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.090
 of the laser which will allow us to have 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.740
 furrows much smaller and if we 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.659
 the much smaller decision one is 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.449
 able to care to store a lot more 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:51.240
 information now if we go to 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.340
 blu ray blu it's not for nothing it's 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.199
 that we actually use lasers that 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.419
 will emit in the blue then of in 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.889
 to emit in the blue that means 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.860
 change the wavelength that means 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:04.229
 change the thickness of the pit and you can 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.699
 also arrange to further decrease the 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.139
 task 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.979
 the task of the laser so there will be some 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.539
 furrows finer 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:12.750
 to have even finer furrows 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:14.520
 like that allows us to have a more 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.289
 large amount of information stored on 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.279
 the disc 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:22.349
 so to summarize comics the task of 

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:24.169
 laser is less large - wide 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:27.539
 more information stored we take 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:29.729
 the blu ray discs the task of the laser 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:31.620
 is even smaller so furrows 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:33.300
 even less wide which increases the 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.190
 information storage capacity 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.719
 and then we have a wavelength of 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.669
 laser that is shorter with a peak 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:41.940
 less thick which will allow us to 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:45.740
 store more information that's for 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.740
 the short on the cds
