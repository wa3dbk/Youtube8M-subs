00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.670 
I don't think that most Moab's really
represent<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.700> player<00:00:50.879> skill<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:51.680> pretty

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
talking about the class setup because

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.320 
talking about the class setup because
that<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:07.979> pretty<00:01:08.189> much<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.430> most<00:01:08.790> important

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that is pretty much the most important

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.810 
that is pretty much the most important
thing<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.689> setting<00:01:10.229> yourself<00:01:10.530> up<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:10.950> getting

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
thing in setting yourself up for getting

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.539 
thing in setting yourself up for getting
a<00:01:12.000> MOAB<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:13.229> my<00:01:13.350> next<00:01:13.619> mod<00:01:13.770> video<00:01:14.250> I'll<00:01:14.310> put

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
a MOAB so get my next mod video I'll put

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.520 
a MOAB so get my next mod video I'll put
up<00:01:14.640> soon<00:01:14.909> it'll<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.689> upon<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
up soon it'll be more upon like the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.770 
up soon it'll be more upon like the
tactics<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.220> strategies<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.509> will<00:01:18.659> be

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
tactics and strategies but this will be

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.320 
tactics and strategies but this will be
mainly<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.250> class<00:01:20.490> setup<00:01:20.880> because<00:01:21.060> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
mainly on the class setup because that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.850 
mainly on the class setup because that
is<00:01:21.420> probably<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> most<00:01:22.080> important<00:01:22.500> thing<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
is probably the most important thing and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.590 
is probably the most important thing and
setting<00:01:22.979> yourself<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.759> success<00:01:24.150> in

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
setting yourself up for success in

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.690 
setting yourself up for success in
getting<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.869> MOAB<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.530> let's<00:01:26.400> get<00:01:26.490> right<00:01:26.640> into

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
getting a MOAB so let's get right into

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.760 
getting a MOAB so let's get right into
it<00:01:27.000> um<00:01:27.270> you'll<00:01:27.570> notice<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:27.960> using<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.320> ACR

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it um you'll notice I'm using the ACR

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100 
it um you'll notice I'm using the ACR
with<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> silencer<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.240> ACR<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.659> probably

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
with a silencer now the ACR is probably

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.710 
with a silencer now the ACR is probably
one<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> my<00:01:31.470> favorite<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.159> my<00:01:32.369> go-to<00:01:32.640> guns<00:01:33.119> so

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
one of my favorite and my go-to guns so

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.260 
one of my favorite and my go-to guns so
when<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> mob<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.909> think

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
when you are going for the mob I think

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.609 
when you are going for the mob I think
it<00:01:36.360> goes<00:01:36.479> without<00:01:36.630> saying<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.439> pick

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
it goes without saying you want to pick

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.080 
it goes without saying you want to pick
a<00:01:37.650> gun<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.890> you're<00:01:38.070> comfortable<00:01:38.280> with<00:01:38.520> it's

a gun that you're comfortable with it's
just<00:01:39.299> obvious<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:40.020> obviously<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:41.100> know

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
just obvious because obviously you know

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.800 
just obvious because obviously you know
the<00:01:41.430> gun<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.060> how<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.390> well<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:42.720> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810

the gun you know how to do well with it
you<00:01:42.930> know<00:01:42.960> how<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.259> works<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.220> next<00:01:44.399> thing

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you know how it works so the next thing

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.560 
you know how it works so the next thing
I'm<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.939> talking<00:01:45.090> about<00:01:45.329> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
I'm going to be talking about is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.120 
I'm going to be talking about is
probably<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> most<00:01:46.049> important<00:01:46.799> thing<00:01:46.950> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
probably the most important thing in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.429 
probably the most important thing in
setting<00:01:47.430> yourself<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:47.909> success<00:01:48.479> when

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
setting yourself up for success when

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.690 
setting yourself up for success when
going<00:01:49.649> for<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.920> Moab<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.220> that's<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
going for the Moab and that's a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.639 
going for the Moab and that's a
specialist<00:01:51.270> strike<00:01:51.479> package<00:01:51.930> now<00:01:52.170> it's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
specialist strike package now it's

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.810 
specialist strike package now it's
really<00:01:52.860> important<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:53.520> pretty<00:01:53.729> sure

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
really important and I'm pretty sure

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.359 
really important and I'm pretty sure
most<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.720> already<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.369> we're

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
most you know this already but we're

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.800 
most you know this already but we're
going<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> moa<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.270> definitely<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
going for the moa this is definitely the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.810 
going for the moa this is definitely the
strike<00:01:58.049> package<00:01:58.380> 1<00:01:58.590> pick<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.040> each<00:01:59.790> time

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
strike package 1 pick because each time

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.899 
strike package 1 pick because each time
you<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.960> two<00:02:01.259> kills<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:02.130> gain<00:02:02.430> another<00:02:02.610> perk

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
you get two kills you gain another perk

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.249 
you get two kills you gain another perk
and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.210> when<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.390> finally<00:02:03.420> get<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.020> kills

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
and then when you finally get it kills

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.630 
and then when you finally get it kills
you<00:02:04.409> get<00:02:04.560> all<00:02:04.770> upper<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.399> pretty<00:02:05.520> much

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you get all upper so this pretty much

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.730 
you get all upper so this pretty much
turned<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.119> into<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.360> killing<00:02:06.689> machine<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
turned you into a killing machine it

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.130 
turned you into a killing machine it
turned<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> into<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.459> super<00:02:09.000> soldier<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
turned you into a super soldier and the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.390 
turned you into a super soldier and the
only<00:02:10.289> way<00:02:10.500> you're<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.800> lose<00:02:10.920> gunfight

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
only way you're going to lose gunfight

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.850 
only way you're going to lose gunfight
then<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.879> where<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.390> get<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:13.080> either<00:02:13.230> screw

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
then is where you get you either screw

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.410 
then is where you get you either screw
or<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.280> get<00:02:14.430> shot<00:02:14.670> from<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.090> different

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
or you get shot from a different

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.600 
or you get shot from a different
direction<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:16.470> pretty<00:02:16.920> much<00:02:17.070> once<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.460> get

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
direction so pretty much once you get

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.280 
direction so pretty much once you get
all<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.820> perks<00:02:18.000> then<00:02:18.600> it's<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.020> you

kill to get to your first perk and you

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.250 
kill to get to your first perk and you
probably<00:02:44.670> won't<00:02:44.940> even<00:02:45.090> need<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.510> reload<00:02:45.810> to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260

probably won't even need to reload to
get<00:02:46.410> your<00:02:46.530> first<00:02:46.680> kill<00:02:46.950> there<00:02:47.160> are<00:02:47.250> times<00:02:47.490> when

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
get your first kill there are times when

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.910 
get your first kill there are times when
you<00:02:47.790> are<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.300> do<00:02:48.510> but<00:02:49.170> I'm<00:02:49.440> not<00:02:49.590> sure<00:02:49.620> why<00:02:49.890> I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
you are you do but I'm not sure why I

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.500 
you are you do but I'm not sure why I
had<00:02:50.160> slight<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.550> hand<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.120> pretty<00:02:51.300> much

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
had slight of hand it's just pretty much

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.650 
had slight of hand it's just pretty much
my<00:02:51.870> go-to<00:02:52.590> first<00:02:52.980> perk<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.850> guess<00:02:54.450> that's

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
my go-to first perk so I guess that's

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.990 
my go-to first perk so I guess that's
why<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.810> had<00:02:55.050> on<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.290> class<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:55.830> really<00:02:56.130> we

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
why I had on this class but really we

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.340 
why I had on this class but really we
can<00:02:57.239> change<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.570> out<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:57.959> pretty<00:02:58.290> much

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
can change it out for pretty much

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.680 
can change it out for pretty much
anything<00:02:58.709> else<00:02:58.950> extreme<00:02:59.790> conditioning<00:03:00.270> is<00:03:00.420> ok

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
anything else extreme conditioning is ok

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.540 
anything else extreme conditioning is ok
if<00:03:00.870> you're<00:03:00.959> rushing<00:03:01.320> around<00:03:01.410> or<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.370> could

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
if you're rushing around or you could

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.430 
if you're rushing around or you could
switch<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.850> out<00:03:02.970> for<00:03:03.000> scavengers<00:03:03.930> walk<00:03:04.200> right

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
switch it out for scavengers walk right

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.199 
switch it out for scavengers walk right
off<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.680> bat<00:03:04.860> now<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.130> do<00:03:05.310> get<00:03:05.550> scavenge<00:03:06.000> later

because<00:04:47.270> by<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.050> time<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.379> get<00:04:48.560> five<00:04:49.219> or<00:04:49.400> six

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
because by the time you get five or six

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.980 
because by the time you get five or six
kills<00:04:49.879> around<00:04:50.240> there<00:04:50.419> that's<00:04:50.599> when<00:04:50.719> you<00:04:50.779> start

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
kills around there that's when you start

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.529 
kills around there that's when you start
running<00:04:51.080> out<00:04:51.319> of<00:04:51.349> ammo<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:52.240> scavenger<00:04:53.240> allows

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
running out of ammo and scavenger allows

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.480 
running out of ammo and scavenger allows
you<00:04:53.749> to<00:04:53.930> continue<00:04:54.590> streak<00:04:54.889> without<00:04:55.039> a<00:04:55.219> you're

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
you to continue streak without a you're

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.189 
you to continue streak without a you're
not<00:04:55.520> going<00:04:55.789> to<00:04:55.849> be<00:04:55.939> able<00:04:55.969> to<00:04:56.360> continue<00:04:56.840> shriek

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
not going to be able to continue shriek

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.350 
not going to be able to continue shriek
unless<00:04:57.529> you<00:04:57.680> pick<00:04:57.889> up<00:04:58.039> a<00:04:58.159> secondary<00:04:58.789> early<00:04:59.210> on

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
unless you pick up a secondary early on

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.909 
unless you pick up a secondary early on
that<00:04:59.719> is<00:04:59.990> something<00:05:00.259> I<00:05:00.349> definitely<00:05:00.409> recommend

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
that is something I definitely recommend

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.760 
that is something I definitely recommend
doing<00:05:01.340> because<00:05:02.120> you<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:03.050> not<00:05:03.259> rely<00:05:03.560> on

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
doing because you to not rely on

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.709 
doing because you to not rely on
scavenger<00:05:03.979> all<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.550> time<00:05:04.759> but<00:05:05.029> savages

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719 
scavenger all the time but savages

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:07.119 
scavenger all the time but savages
definitely<00:05:06.139> benefit<00:05:06.560> something<00:05:06.889> good<00:05:07.009> to

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.129 
definitely benefit something good to

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.240 
definitely benefit something good to
have<00:05:07.539> but<00:05:08.539> there<00:05:08.689> are<00:05:08.719> times<00:05:09.110> when<00:05:09.560> having<00:05:10.189> a

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
have but there are times when having a

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.670 
have but there are times when having a
secondary<00:05:11.000> weapon<00:05:11.509> that<00:05:11.629> accuses<00:05:11.960> primaries

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
secondary weapon that accuses primaries

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.100 
secondary weapon that accuses primaries
more<00:05:12.949> important<00:05:13.370> because<00:05:13.520> sometimes<00:05:14.330> having

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
more important because sometimes having

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.769 
more important because sometimes having
to<00:05:15.289> collect<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.710> ammo<00:05:16.099> with<00:05:16.879> scavenger<00:05:17.449> can

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:17.779 
to collect the ammo with scavenger can

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:19.209 
to collect the ammo with scavenger can
put<00:05:18.020> you<00:05:18.110> in<00:05:18.229> a<00:05:18.259> bad<00:05:18.409> position<00:05:18.469> and<00:05:19.039> thus

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
put you in a bad position and thus

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.399 
put you in a bad position and thus
getting<00:05:19.430> kills<00:05:19.789> ruin<00:05:20.060> your<00:05:20.180> streak<00:05:20.419> so<00:05:20.659> yeah<00:05:21.379> I

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
try to pick up secondary early on just

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.969 
try to pick up secondary early on just
in<00:05:23.539> case<00:05:23.750> but<00:05:23.779> scavenger<00:05:24.560> is<00:05:24.620> definitely

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
in case but scavenger is definitely

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.399 
in case but scavenger is definitely
