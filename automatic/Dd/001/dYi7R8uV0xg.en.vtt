00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.990
 I'm ready on vacation or fired 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.990
 one could say 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.240
 and with time to 100% to be able 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.890
 to devote to you all the 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.570
 time they need to warm up like this 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.370
 that we are going to encourage 3 3 without more 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.370
 preambles and we put what will happen 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.890
 Y 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.430
 ok putting many times the whole subject of 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.430
 the herd 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180
 ah 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:50.409
 up to the cameras 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.409
 or not 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.610
 a water outlet when we will see 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 girl 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.900
 go 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.290
 I do not understand much much 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.430
 s 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:04.390
 and also 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.460
 but let's continue 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.290
 okay 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.750
 because it has already happened this does not have much 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.519
 but we invite the ball noise I'm going 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.409
 inside the cameras 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.489
 Maybe it's so that certain 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.489
 I do not understand animatronics 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.739
 What else will you achieve now? 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.390
 that there are no lights like fainé is 62 and it 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.069
 it looks a bit like pavement 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.160
 star and just a little bit wider and 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.930
 It does not convince me 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.630

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:40.340

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.660
