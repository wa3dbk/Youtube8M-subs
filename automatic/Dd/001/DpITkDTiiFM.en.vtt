to think that we're going to get these
darker<00:00:51.780> nights<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:53.070> been<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.579> long

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
darker nights back it's been so long

darker nights back it's been so long
that<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.180> barely<00:00:54.570> remember<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.140> time<00:00:55.469> when<00:00:55.800> these

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
that I barely remember a time when these

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.250 
that I barely remember a time when these
used<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> game<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.350> did<00:00:58.859> give<00:00:59.340> a

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
used to be in the game it did give a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.319 
used to be in the game it did give a
greater<00:01:01.260> sense<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.920> atmosphere<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.910> some<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
greater sense of atmosphere to some of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.810 
greater sense of atmosphere to some of
the<00:01:03.449> zones<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.830> believed<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> reason<00:01:05.700> they

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the zones and I believed the reason they

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.190 
the zones and I believed the reason they
changed<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> first<00:01:06.750> place<00:01:06.869> was

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
changed it in the first place was

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.560 
changed it in the first place was
because<00:01:07.229> they<00:01:07.920> had<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:08.880> people<00:01:09.299> playing

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
because they had you know people playing

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
because they had you know people playing
all<00:01:09.780> over<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.110> world<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.770> different<00:01:10.920> time

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
all over the world in different time

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.460 
all over the world in different time
zones<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:12.119> some<00:01:12.540> people<00:01:12.840> could<00:01:12.930> edit<00:01:13.020> play<00:01:13.320> at

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
zones and some people could edit play at

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.649 
zones and some people could edit play at
nighttime<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.400> believe<00:01:14.820> that's<00:01:15.030> why<00:01:15.270> they<00:01:15.479> made

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
nighttime I believe that's why they made

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.200 
nighttime I believe that's why they made
the<00:01:15.689> change<00:01:16.159> not<00:01:17.159> quite<00:01:17.430> sure<00:01:17.460> why<00:01:18.000> they've

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the change not quite sure why they've

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.749 
the change not quite sure why they've
changed<00:01:18.479> their<00:01:18.720> mind<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.170> because

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
changed their mind now because

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.789 
changed their mind now because
technically<00:01:20.759> those<00:01:21.150> those<00:01:21.840> reasons<00:01:22.200> still

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
technically those those reasons still

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.840 
technically those those reasons still
exist<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.729> guess<00:01:24.259> but<00:01:25.259> I'm<00:01:25.560> 41<00:01:26.130> I'm<00:01:26.520> looking

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
exist I guess but I'm 41 I'm looking

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.130 
exist I guess but I'm 41 I'm looking
forward<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> getting<00:01:27.330> these<00:01:27.570> darker<00:01:27.990> nights

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
forward to getting these darker nights

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.710 
forward to getting these darker nights
back<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.070> think<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.060> as<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.540> will

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
back and I think you as you will

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.499 
back and I think you as you will
probably<00:01:31.170> think<00:01:31.409> from<00:01:31.650> seeing<00:01:32.130> these<00:01:32.340> images

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
probably think from seeing these images

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
probably think from seeing these images
it<00:01:33.509> does<00:01:33.840> look<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.200> lot<00:01:34.380> cooler<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.130> if

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
it does look a lot cooler and if

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
it does look a lot cooler and if
anything<00:01:35.549> could<00:01:35.970> go<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.240> little<00:01:36.450> bit<00:01:36.630> darker

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
anything could go a little bit darker

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.130 
anything could go a little bit darker
could<00:01:38.100> go<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> little<00:01:38.460> bit<00:01:38.729> darker<00:01:38.930> but<00:01:39.930> we'll

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
could go a little bit darker but we'll

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
could go a little bit darker but we'll
see<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.590> looking<00:01:40.890> forward<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.220> seeing<00:01:41.549> that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
see so looking forward to seeing that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.600 
see so looking forward to seeing that
