00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
here I got the Traxxas big-bore shocks

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.680 
here I got the Traxxas big-bore shocks
they're<00:00:55.170> really<00:00:55.710> nice<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:57.180> them<00:00:57.390> they're

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
they're really nice I like them they're

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.729 
they're really nice I like them they're
not<00:00:57.840> too<00:00:57.989> much<00:00:58.140> different<00:00:58.440> from<00:00:58.559> your

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
not too much different from your

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.150 
not too much different from your
original<00:00:59.399> ones<00:00:59.579> but<00:01:00.000> they're<00:01:00.210> smoother<00:01:01.160> there

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
original ones but they're smoother there

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
original ones but they're smoother there
have<00:01:02.760> more<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.239> think<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:03.539> might<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
have more I think they might have a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.359 
have more I think they might have a
little<00:01:04.260> more<00:01:04.350> travel<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:04.949> them<00:01:05.040> they<00:01:05.220> don't

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
little more travel in them they don't

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.000 
little more travel in them they don't
feel<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.610> cheesy<00:01:05.909> though<00:01:06.260> it<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:07.890> like

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
feel as cheesy though it I really like

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.340 
feel as cheesy though it I really like
this<00:01:08.189> handling<00:01:09.030> gives<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.960> allows

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
this handling gives it like it allows

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.760 
this handling gives it like it allows
maybe<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.830> little<00:01:10.979> bit<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.250> body<00:01:11.430> roll<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.770> really

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
maybe a little bit of body roll I really

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.320 
maybe a little bit of body roll I really
like<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.250> highly<00:01:14.490> recommend<00:01:15.000> getting<00:01:15.060> these

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
like it I highly recommend getting these

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.929 
like it I highly recommend getting these
shocks<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> also<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.460> Traxxas

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
shocks and then I also got the Traxxas

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.080 
shocks and then I also got the Traxxas
blue<00:01:18.180> aluminum<00:01:18.630> shock<00:01:18.840> caps<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:20.090> thinking

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
blue aluminum shock caps and thinking

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
blue aluminum shock caps and thinking
about<00:01:21.150> these<00:01:21.450> aluminum<00:01:21.840> caps<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.530> won't

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
about these aluminum caps is it won't

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.490 
about these aluminum caps is it won't
strip<00:01:23.549> if<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.330> don't<00:01:24.869> cut<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.200> plastic

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
strip if I don't cut it with plastic

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.440 
strip if I don't cut it with plastic
shocks<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> cap<00:01:26.340> comes<00:01:26.790> off<00:01:27.000> sometimes

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
shocks but the cap comes off sometimes

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.929 
shocks but the cap comes off sometimes
and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.770> your<00:01:28.920> oil<00:01:29.100> gets<00:01:29.340> everywhere<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and then your oil gets everywhere and

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.819 
and then your oil gets everywhere and
that's<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.420> grime<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.990> actually<00:01:31.619> did

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that's all that grime is actually did

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.940 
that's all that grime is actually did
not<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.310> not<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.240> Traxxas<00:01:34.229> shock<00:01:34.439> oil<00:01:34.650> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
not that's not the Traxxas shock oil I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.069 
not that's not the Traxxas shock oil I
actually<00:01:35.670> did<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.420> care<00:01:36.750> about<00:01:36.840> this

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
actually did not really care about this

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.170 
actually did not really care about this
car<00:01:37.320> before<00:01:38.009> I've<00:01:38.430> had<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.850> very<00:01:39.030> long

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
car before I've had this for a very long

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.170 
car before I've had this for a very long
time<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.310> decided<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> good

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
time and I just decided it was a good

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.700 
time and I just decided it was a good
idea<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.600> refill<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.170> vegetable<00:01:43.680> oil

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
idea to refill it with vegetable oil

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.160 
idea to refill it with vegetable oil
which<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> good<00:01:44.729> idea<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.780> can't<00:01:46.020> get

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
which is not a good idea and I can't get

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.690 
which is not a good idea and I can't get
that<00:01:46.350> grime<00:01:46.829> off<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.250> almost<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.549> want

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that grime off there I almost just want

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.850 
that grime off there I almost just want
to<00:01:47.759> buy<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> whole<00:01:48.119> new<00:01:48.149> upper<00:01:48.540> plate<00:01:48.869> because

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
your if you have a brushless set up

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.800 
your if you have a brushless set up
because<00:06:32.100> you<00:06:32.280> don't<00:06:32.460> want<00:06:32.580> to<00:06:32.640> risk<00:06:32.820> a<00:06:33.210> hundred

$180 motor for that but it's nice or

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.320 
$180 motor for that but it's nice or
I<00:06:40.120> don't<00:06:40.300> really<00:06:40.570> care<00:06:40.900> for<00:06:40.960> it<00:06:41.200> too<00:06:41.410> much<00:06:41.620> but

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
I don't really care for it too much but

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.940 
I don't really care for it too much but
it<00:06:43.330> gets<00:06:43.480> the<00:06:43.600> job<00:06:43.630> done<00:06:43.810> and<00:06:44.200> I<00:06:44.320> know<00:06:44.380> the<00:06:44.560> tqi

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
it gets the job done and I know the tqi

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.129 
it gets the job done and I know the tqi
has<00:06:45.280> the<00:06:45.520> temperature<00:06:46.000> setting<00:06:46.270> in<00:06:46.450> there<00:06:46.570> but

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139 
has the temperature setting in there but

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.030 
has the temperature setting in there but
the<00:06:47.200> other<00:06:47.320> thing<00:06:47.440> is<00:06:47.530> I<00:06:47.650> didn't<00:06:47.830> wanna<00:06:47.980> get
