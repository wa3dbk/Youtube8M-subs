00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.000
 and that's all the greenhouse world and privat 4 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.650
 for the 66th episode of severe lab in 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.389
 which we are going to see a two door 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.070
 2 times a little different from 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.160
 that I was able to offer you in 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.340
 previous episodes since this one is 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.600
 well the blocks go up from the bottom then 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.449
 what did I screw up 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.580
 I took a little bit to provide the system have 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.859
 normally it's good here look at the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.149
 door instead of coming your only blocks 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.190
 come from the side and well they come from 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.079
 downstairs it's a different style that I 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.850
 wanted to offer you more is me 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.950
 who created the system at least the idea 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.960
 does not necessarily come from - there due him 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.090
 to be invented but I made sure 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.370
 compact the system to the maximum 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.820
 go see it is rather compact all 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.219
 compact 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.379
 I'll explain that to you 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.329
 ask surely why there is no 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.739
 and not always not and not but everything 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.899
 just because he was in 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.480
 bins at the bins this week then 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.100
 wait i'm thinking this video is 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.260
 released my going out Tuesday 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.810
 I will be on vacation actually at this time 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.580
 there and there will be no time turning 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.340
 simply because he will have had 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.680
 the package - from Saturday I have to leave 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.590
 and we will actually leave on vacation on 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.310
 sunday together with with epa and and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.710
 other friends 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.420
 so we did not have time at all 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.310
 to turn together but do you 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.700
 do not worry it'll come back in two 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.700
 episodes 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.210
 you are not worried we are not 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.840
 is not angry not angry at all you 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.790
 come on he just had a lack of time 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.159
 obvious then to the revisions of the ferry 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.040
 and the guy's week so why am I 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.340
 the impression that it is dark and 7.0 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.899
 maybe ok well you do the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.790
 structuring and so I was talking about the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.049
 I did not explain to you in me 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.600
 will do the system in height while 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.710
 just because nothing and that's the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.509
 simply because it's 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.670
 easier to understand for you the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.350
 door is here the door 2 x 2 so the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.390
 blow if you do it at home you 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.799
 have to do like these finally you 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.189
 must start there 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.119
 pistons here short 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.450
 I do it in the air it's more 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.209
 simple to explain to you ok go this is 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.480
 party to the repeater in rebate 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.769
 face of these two piston pistons duo 1 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.410
 I want to clarify it so we will do 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.510
 a obviously a double piston extender 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.549
 so a quick note on how is 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.319
 run the door and well these four 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.569
 blocks or will they end up this one 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.930
 will end up here this one here and these 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.819
 two here ok ok we agree 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.640
 so we'll have to make sure 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:42.049
 that the red stone face this job there that 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.090
 I just stated flat then and from 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.380
 blow you're going to actually see we're going to do 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.730
 exactly the same on both sides 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.329
 it's a little normal for this style 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.329
 door 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:54.950
 it's completely symmetrical sailing to 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.260
 two laughing peter who will point to this 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.780
 block that contains a little redstone 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.130
 is right below also the other one that 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.840
 will feed this piston and this 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.200
 pleading stone will feed this piston 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.639
 ok we had a block in front of this piston which 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.709
 will feed or not this repeater this one 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.389
 as well 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.840
 then we will do the same 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:19.160
 flat gold side the pistons these two 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.220
 pistons are to be ranked third 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.450
 very important ok we do the same thing 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:30.290
 feeds this piston and this one thanks to 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:35.599
 this place and we do the same thing we put it 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:38.030
 there and that ok now we'll put 2 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.579
 repeater like these here to wait 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.739
 not just at the top level 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.060
 like those who will feed 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.950
 but what have I done there? 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.690
 am wrong ah yes but that's it for 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.099
 that it disturbs me and finally that the enemy 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.280
 below that's how it's better 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:58.060
 here you put 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.540
 two torches that will feed or not 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.880
 this list was called thanks to two of 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.120
 torches just above and you go 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.340
 put 2 pistons that two blocks that go 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.910
 allow to reactivate the double bush 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.060
 extender through this barley 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.010
 ok now we'll get the signal back 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.530
 so we will not recover here we go the 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:25.480
 recover here because we will not have had 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.640
 from this place the fnc 2 repeater 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.669
 like these as just now and 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:37.600
 now what are we going to do is that 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:40.450
 look good painted and on the other side 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.180
 a block and now we will be able 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:47.410
 recover the signal 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:51.370
 thanks to this block and peter series which are 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.910
 both placed at the third grand 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.729
 if I'm not mistaken this too this 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.010
 It's certain 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.510
 in front of these two dispensaries but in 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.930
 face down you go 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.169
 put 2 pistons flat flat why he 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.979
 there is one that is disabled because I 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.360
 did not put the red stone 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:15.640
 here and you will put two blocks 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.030
 redstone that will feed or not this 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.490
 piston and it seems to me that the system 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.789
 is operational in attention you're going 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.789
 to take off 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.480
 when you go rome what i have 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.780
 done that's fine you're going to take off and 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.390
 give c2c torches so that the 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.980
 system be handed initially as he 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.140
 must also in his room and not be good 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.420
 here we put the door quietly 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.980
 and now we'll take care of the button 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:47.710
 the button the button that will be here is 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:53.100
 so we're going to feed here thanks to a 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:56.890
 block 1 piston then a block 1 and peter 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.170
 and the entry and that's it suddenly is what 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.880
 it works is what I do not have you 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.090
 tell bullshit for five 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.040
 minutes and it looks pretty good 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.290
 since it's actually everybody 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.460
 so I actually looked for the error not 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.080
 did not come from the red stone that's all 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.650
 just because I forgot two 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.870
 blue here here just to go 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.490
 powered through his series peter g not du 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.380
 all blunder and I also noticed 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.080
 that I had not put this mouse peter in 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.190
 third notch unlike the others 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.750
 knowing that I had said that 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.180
 do the same on both sides 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.340
 I had forgotten what connects peter who 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.770
 was it guay me and suddenly the 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.510
 system is fully operational 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.940
 operational you only have to 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.970
 conceal everything in order to make sure 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:43.660
 whether it's aesthetically drinkable the 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.740
 rod pd1 go on this we end up 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.290
 for the next episode 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.360
 I wish you a good holiday for 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.130
 those who are on vacation it seems to me 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.140
 that this week there are some who pass 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.490
 the patent good luck guys if you 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.110
 look at me it's very bad 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.450
 sign segun is in the process of revising this 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.720
 is not good, that's what I'm saying 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.450
 if you are finally but against me 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.040
 declines all responsibility 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:09.440
 here 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.440
 it works go hello to you thank you
