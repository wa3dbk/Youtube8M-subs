00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 to give you an idea of ​​my 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.589
 interest in the series not even today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.240
 Tuesday I remembered that on Sunday 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.680
 there was a new chapter because it has 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.470
 taken a little more this video in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.060
 get on 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.820
 honestly I had forgotten about 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.620
 complete has not even realized 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.490
 because it was on my page where I see 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.140
 I usually google google and it has 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.369
 gone out there but not even the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.720
 would have seen to say that they have put 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.880
 new looking wallpaper 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.279
 how it shone and the two falls from my macbook 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.310
 like re lucena and hanny's ass 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.310
 kauam 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.800
 in cash some dragon chapter 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.170
 ball super road number 7 appears 7 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.970
 where the skillful who follow the ship and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.740
 where we see that it is a port of a 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.780
 aggressive way has intentions of 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.900
 destroy the earth and as a psychologist 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.730
 James even trying to give him a 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.710
 little for hair but not what 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.360
 they get it because it 's very strong 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.700
 it became clear I think since it is very very 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.440
 strong and good ends with the most 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.630
 interesting and with the title that puts in 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.729
 the chapter that is vegeta gets angry 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.280
 touches my hands that cocks that's what 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.410
 what happens right at the end or is it very 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.750
 interesting the only thing when we see bg 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.100
 he is really pissed off and with some eyes 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.100
 of videos that has happened to you 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.940
 chapter then a fucking shit but 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.950
 the truth is that he has been entertained 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.840
 without boring fact I swallowed it 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.390
 quietly those 20 minutes when I 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.240
 agreed that it was Sunday and the 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.470
 Tuesday and Sunday there was new chapter 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.470
 because we have gone well 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.450
 started quite a bit in the first chapter 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.100
 that would not be so bad and close ups 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.720
 that are pretty good but there are others 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.700
 in the middle is that the drawing is 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.350
 unacceptable I will put catches of cabaret 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.390
 under the episode to put it here 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.770
 and I'll review it because right now I do not 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.110
 no agreement but we are 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.970
 seeing on the screen that there are faces that 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.770
 there are very very horrible expressions that 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.510
 they may have charged a lot more and that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.920
 completely distort me is no longer the 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.200
 animation is no longer how fast it is going 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.660
 that also takes a little is the drawing in 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.490
 yes they make us very squared xosé 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.530
 I swear appear drawn to the 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.480
 paint or whatever and finish with those 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.240
 lines are horrible that show that 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.950
 distort a lot when it comes to see 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.570
 dragon back that what bothers me 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.400
 completely this seventh episode 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.500
 It has also been quite interesting or 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.580
 has been something worthy as I say chapter 7 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.800
 saying I have at all points 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.330
 videos chapter 7 of a hundred old that gives 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.010
 there's a lot left for us to see something 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.410
 really interesting in dragon ball and 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.300
 the interesting thing about dragon ball nowadays 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.980
 Well, look, it does not catch a little bit 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.720
 with the amount of competition that 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.330
 have the animes 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.980
 but still apart from that in dragonball 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.590
 I will never understand why it is not 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.840
 they transform in super saiyan in plan nothing 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.660
 the more things are put on, they get serious 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.580
 for example you have gottex is strong 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.840
 by itself it is very strong by itself tried 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.610
 hit a punch hits you several 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.200
 punch and he does not do anything bills but 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.640
 when he catches him there because he does not know 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.470
 transform is a moment I think what 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.910
 I have no I do not think I'm not sure that 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.320
 vote can be transformed inclusion 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.510
 super saiyan 3 with simple is super 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.680
 long which means by which 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.690
 it's something that they have given us to understand 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.910
 throughout the series that your power 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.920
 increases three or ten or a hundred times more 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.690
 because you do not transform at that moment 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.250
 and at least he does like that, even though I do not go 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.140
 to be punished because Perez is very strong 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.480
 you do not come in and sometimes it's very strong 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.830
 although later it does not help because it does not 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.240
 what does that do that is there in any 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.810
 situation because you have to conform 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.160
 with your power in a normal way being 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.200
 that you can do those things from a 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.740
 principle is something that shows much more 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.450
 balls just like one that play now 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.000
 although good they go from 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.640
 since the beginning its transformation more 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.069
 strong it is known that the aura is white 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.500
 alone but still had a lot of power 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.890
 he's a person at level 2 and he 's 90 shit and 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.629
 vegetating in the living cells 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.510
 although he passes a little bit what happens to him 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.700
 in this last final chapter that is 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.620
 it was so transformed that it circulated 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.120
 so much that it was very slow but at last 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.519
 at the end I had an incredible brute force 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.230
 because you do not use that is not what makes you 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.360
 missing so that he got pissed he used it 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.010
 a little bit a little bit is not much 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.110
 I do not think it does much to my 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.030
 skills and a little bit to imitate the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.799
 face what I want to see is what 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.420
 will happen later that is because my 9 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.150
 destroy the earth they were going to die all 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.530
 is and such and such I say I do not know now no 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.180
 I have no fucking idea but there are 100 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.739
 episodes at some point you'll have to 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.910
 hit him and they do not go to goal they do not go to 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.010
 fight in the final battle of 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.300
 chapter 10 then I'm hoping that 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.270
 come the moment he arrived he says 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.360
 Look, it's scary, it's easy for me, I get ready 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.919
 I go there I kill the gym and we already 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.680
 We give of hosts or something because that 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.990
 to understand it and goku who knows what 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.980
 is happening and that has the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.440
 transportation that instance of shit 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.730
 I do not know what it is that does not appear that which does not 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.620
 will finish understanding and that I already said in 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.360
 a video has to know the family and 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.219
 dead of disgust are far away 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.560
 training yes but 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.879
 it's a millisecond from one site to another that 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.760
 he does not do it because he does not want to 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.480
 we put 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.480
 cast
