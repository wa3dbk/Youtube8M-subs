the future arrived but we're gonna
actually<00:01:48.270> go<00:01:48.540> over<00:01:48.720> those<00:01:48.870> in<00:01:49.200> part<00:01:50.070> two<00:01:50.430> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
actually go over those in part two of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.040 
actually go over those in part two of
battle<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.150> atom<00:01:51.420> which<00:01:51.540> will<00:01:51.660> be<00:01:51.750> releasing

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
addressed the kind of space-time

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.090

implications<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.690> these<00:03:07.230> original<00:03:07.680> x-men

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
implications of these original x-men

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.770 
implications of these original x-men
being<00:03:08.459> here<00:03:08.730> yeah<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.209> know<00:03:09.299> like<00:03:09.420> if<00:03:09.600> they

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
being here yeah you know like if they

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.039 
being here yeah you know like if they
die<00:03:10.019> we<00:03:10.530> finally<00:03:10.890> know<00:03:11.010> what<00:03:11.130> happens<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:12.049> if

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049

they<00:03:13.320> die<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.590> imagine<00:03:14.310> all<00:03:14.900> reality<00:03:15.900> would

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
they die I imagine all reality would

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.690 
they die I imagine all reality would
just<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.350> instantly<00:03:16.920> change<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.459> some<00:03:17.670> way

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
just like instantly change in some way

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.140 
just like instantly change in some way
right<00:03:18.090> because<00:03:19.700> Scott<00:03:20.700> wouldn't<00:03:20.910> have<00:03:21.060> been

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
right because Scott wouldn't have been

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.330 
right because Scott wouldn't have been
there<00:03:21.299> throughout<00:03:21.480> history<00:03:21.660> yeah<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.709> if<00:03:23.190> you

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
there throughout history yeah and if you

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.060 
there throughout history yeah and if you
look<00:03:23.790> at<00:03:24.000> Bendis<00:03:24.750> who<00:03:24.930> wrote<00:03:25.140> age<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.709> Ultron

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
look at Bendis who wrote age of Ultron

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.400 
look at Bendis who wrote age of Ultron
as<00:03:26.220> well<00:03:26.400> when<00:03:26.880> Hank<00:03:27.120> Pym<00:03:27.390> disappeared<00:03:27.989> that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
as well when Hank Pym disappeared that

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.560 
as well when Hank Pym disappeared that
drastically<00:03:29.010> changed<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.519> future<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.480> it

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
drastically changed the future so it

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.880 
drastically changed the future so it
seems<00:03:30.750> like<00:03:30.810> Scott<00:03:31.200> died<00:03:31.440> should<00:03:31.769> have

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
seems like Scott died should have

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.350 
seems like Scott died should have
immediately<00:03:32.190> drastically<00:03:33.000> changed<00:03:33.330> the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
immediately drastically changed the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.060 
immediately drastically changed the
futures<00:03:33.690> love<00:03:33.900> which<00:03:34.320> gives<00:03:34.590> credence<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.950> the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
futures love which gives credence to the

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.430 
futures love which gives credence to the
fact<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.430> Scott<00:03:35.670> didn't<00:03:36.120> really<00:03:36.660> die<00:03:37.049> right

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
fact that Scott didn't really die right

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.440 
fact that Scott didn't really die right
there<00:03:37.680> he<00:03:38.130> was<00:03:38.280> probably<00:03:38.640> on<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:39.060> brink<00:03:39.330> of

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
there he was probably on the brink of

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.479 
there he was probably on the brink of
dying<00:03:39.690> or<00:03:39.959> something<00:03:40.019> but<00:03:40.560> Christopher<00:03:41.040> Muse

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
dying or something but Christopher Muse

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.699 
dying or something but Christopher Muse
was<00:03:41.700> able<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.030> bring<00:03:42.269> him<00:03:42.420> back

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
was able to bring him back

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.590 
was able to bring him back
yeah<00:03:43.709> they<00:03:43.920> explored<00:03:44.730> his<00:03:44.940> power<00:03:45.269> set<00:03:45.570> a

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
yeah they explored his power set a

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.470 
yeah they explored his power set a
little<00:03:46.049> bit<00:03:46.170> more<00:03:46.610> so<00:03:47.610> I'm<00:03:47.970> really<00:03:48.180> starting

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
little bit more so I'm really starting

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.400 
little bit more so I'm really starting
to<00:03:48.510> think<00:03:48.600> he<00:03:48.780> might<00:03:48.930> be<00:03:48.959> able<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.200> bring

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
to think he might be able to bring

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.500 
to think he might be able to bring
people<00:03:49.650> back<00:03:49.680> from<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.160> dead<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:51.060> would<00:03:51.329> be

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
people back from the dead that would be

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.530 
people back from the dead that would be
pretty<00:03:51.840> awesome<00:03:52.130> just<00:03:53.130> makes<00:03:53.820> Scott's<00:03:54.209> team
