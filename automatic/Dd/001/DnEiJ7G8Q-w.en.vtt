you can see that when you turn to light
you<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.380> dewy<00:01:19.710> complexion<00:01:20.009> I

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you have that dewy complexion I

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
you have that dewy complexion I
personally<00:01:21.600> don't<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
personally don't really like that in a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.340 
personally don't really like that in a
foundation<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.780> thought<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.320> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
foundation and I thought that when I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.080 
foundation and I thought that when I
would<00:01:25.439> set<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.799> with<00:01:25.890> powder<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.729> would<00:01:26.939> be

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
would set it with powder that would be

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.300 
would set it with powder that would be
gone<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.659> unfortunately<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.560> does<00:01:28.740> keep<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
gone but unfortunately it does keep that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.240 
gone but unfortunately it does keep that
kind<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.579> fresh<00:01:29.939> dewy<00:01:30.390> look<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> skin<00:01:31.250> so

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
kind of fresh dewy look on the skin so

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.679 
kind of fresh dewy look on the skin so
for<00:01:32.520> oily<00:01:32.820> skin<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.119> found<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.630> very

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
for oily skin I found it was very

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.179 
for oily skin I found it was very
problematic<00:01:34.170> because<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.770> would<00:01:34.890> break<00:01:35.159> down

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
problematic because it would break down

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.280 
problematic because it would break down
during<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> day<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.689> sides<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.140> nose

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
during the day on the sides of the nose

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.749 
during the day on the sides of the nose
and<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> nose<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.430> looked<00:01:38.670> kind

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
just looked really really straight and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.359 
just looked really really straight and
normal<00:01:42.899> skin<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.409> dead<00:01:43.590> hold<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.070> little<00:01:44.220> bit

talk<00:01:47.430> about<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.770> wouldn't<00:01:50.549> really

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
talk about so I wouldn't really

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
talk about so I wouldn't really
recommend<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.630> foundation<00:01:52.170> unless<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.530> are

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
recommend the foundation unless you are

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.719 
recommend the foundation unless you are
looking<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:52.950> something<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.280> ultra

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
looking for something that is ultra

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.429 
looking for something that is ultra
hydrating<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.659> one<00:01:55.079> thing<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.350> this

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
hydrating that is one thing that this

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.080 
hydrating that is one thing that this
foundation<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.520> my<00:01:56.700> skin's<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> little

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
foundation is like my skin's a little

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.490 
foundation is like my skin's a little
bit<00:01:57.299> dry<00:01:57.540> here<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> moment<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.200> apply<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
bit dry here the moment you apply the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.950 
bit dry here the moment you apply the
foundation<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.700> really<00:02:00.090> hydrates<00:02:00.719> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
foundation this just really hydrates and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.440 
foundation this just really hydrates and
it<00:02:01.079> kind<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.380> sucks<00:02:01.710> into<00:02:02.130> my<00:02:02.280> skin<00:02:02.610> even<00:02:03.270> just

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
it kind of sucks into my skin even just

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.880 
it kind of sucks into my skin even just
on<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.600> back<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> my<00:02:04.049> hand<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.560> really

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
on the back of my hand it just really

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.150 
on the back of my hand it just really
draws<00:02:05.460> into<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.270> skin<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.649> found<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
draws into the skin and that I found to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.859 
draws into the skin and that I found to
also<00:02:08.190> kind<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.149> prickling<00:02:09.599> sensation

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
also kind of be of a prickling sensation

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.199 
also kind of be of a prickling sensation
on<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.349> skin<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.459> odd<00:02:11.640> 5<00:02:11.940> 10

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
on the skin just for the odd 5 10

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.300 
on the skin just for the odd 5 10
minutes<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.510> don't<00:02:12.690> know<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.959> was<00:02:13.170> my<00:02:13.379> skin

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
minutes I don't know if that was my skin

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.770 
minutes I don't know if that was my skin
because<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.060> type<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.390> skin<00:02:15.569> that<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.750> have

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
because of the type of skin that I have

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.860 
because of the type of skin that I have
but<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.860> was<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.550> sort<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.030> irritated<00:02:18.780> my

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
but it was just it sort of irritated my

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.240 
but it was just it sort of irritated my
skin<00:02:18.900> which<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.380> be<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> little<00:02:19.800> bit<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.100> the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
skin which can be a little bit on the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.220 
skin which can be a little bit on the
sensitive<00:02:20.760> side<00:02:20.940> as<00:02:21.180> well<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.900> didn't

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
sensitive side as well this didn't

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.600 
sensitive side as well this didn't
oxidize<00:02:22.709> throughout<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> day<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.400> didn't

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
oxidize throughout the day it didn't

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.280 
oxidize throughout the day it didn't
cause<00:02:23.760> any<00:02:23.790> acne<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> good<00:02:25.050> thing

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
cause any acne so that is a good thing

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.630 
cause any acne so that is a good thing
so<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.740> would<00:02:26.010> recommend<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.580> for

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
so I would recommend this for

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.030 
so I would recommend this for
combination<00:02:27.480> dry<00:02:27.870> skin<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.290> wouldn't<00:02:28.560> say<00:02:28.740> if

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
combination dry skin I wouldn't say if

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.590 
combination dry skin I wouldn't say if
you<00:02:29.190> are<00:02:29.220> oily<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:30.120> go<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.390> try<00:02:30.540> this

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
you are oily to go and try this

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.660 
you are oily to go and try this
foundation<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.320> because<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:32.160> does<00:02:32.430> have

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
foundation just because it does have

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.130 
foundation just because it does have
that<00:02:32.760> tendency<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.270> break<00:02:33.480> down<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.900> kind<00:02:34.080> of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
that tendency to break down and kind of

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.750 
that tendency to break down and kind of
look<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.350> bit<00:02:34.500> gunky<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> skin<00:02:35.340> at<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.640> end

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
look a bit gunky on the skin at the end

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.600 
look a bit gunky on the skin at the end
of<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:35.970> day<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.530> not<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.709> really<00:02:38.040> long<00:02:38.310> wearing

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.250 
of the day so not a really long wearing
finish<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.330> was<00:02:39.450> definitely<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.870> juhi

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
finish and it was definitely a juhi

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.590 
finish and it was definitely a juhi

found<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.209> really<00:03:18.450> hydrated<00:03:19.079> underneath

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
found that it really hydrated underneath

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.080 
found that it really hydrated underneath
my<00:03:19.530> eyes<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:19.950> like<00:03:20.190> full<00:03:20.670> hydration

kind of a crinkly effect there and

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.910

got the little DNA thing in it I've been
using<00:04:19.380> mainly<00:04:19.829> this<00:04:20.010> side<00:04:20.220> as<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.489> can<00:04:20.609> see

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
kind of the wear and tear and the powder

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.380 
kind of the wear and tear and the powder
there<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.070> it's<00:04:23.220> kind<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.610> changed<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.270> little

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
there and it's kind of changed a little

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.700 
there and it's kind of changed a little
bit<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.720> color<00:04:24.960> there<00:04:25.229> it's<00:04:25.349> kind<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.560> gone<00:04:25.680> a

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
bit of color there it's kind of gone a

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.360 
bit of color there it's kind of gone a
bit<00:04:25.800> pinky<00:04:26.460> beige

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
bit pinky beige

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.430 
bit pinky beige
but<00:04:27.850> overall<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.540> thought<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.930> powder<00:04:29.169> would

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
but overall I thought the powder would

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.430 
but overall I thought the powder would
be<00:04:29.650> really<00:04:30.220> kind<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:30.760> setting<00:04:31.690> but<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:31.870> found<00:04:32.229> it

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
be really kind of setting but I found it

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.080 
be really kind of setting but I found it
to<00:04:32.560> be<00:04:32.590> really<00:04:32.680> white<00:04:33.280> like<00:04:33.550> I'm<00:04:33.790> barely

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
to be really white like I'm barely

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.570 
to be really white like I'm barely
touching<00:04:34.660> that<00:04:34.780> powder<00:04:35.050> just<00:04:35.770> look<00:04:36.040> how<00:04:36.220> white

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
touching that powder just look how white

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.670 
touching that powder just look how white
that<00:04:36.820> is<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:37.360> apply<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:37.960> you<00:04:38.050> just<00:04:38.290> don't

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
that is you apply it and you just don't

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.840 
that is you apply it and you just don't
know<00:04:38.889> if<00:04:39.070> you're<00:04:39.160> gonna<00:04:39.280> see<00:04:39.430> if<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.520> can<00:04:39.699> see

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
know if you're gonna see if you can see

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.870 
know if you're gonna see if you can see
it<00:04:39.910> right<00:04:40.120> there<00:04:40.150> that<00:04:40.389> kind<00:04:40.720> of<00:04:40.780> white<00:04:41.880> kind

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
it right there that kind of white kind

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.879 
it right there that kind of white kind
of<00:04:43.000> powder<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.540> you<00:04:43.600> have<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.930> be<00:04:44.020> super

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
of powder so you have to be super

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.290 
of powder so you have to be super
careful<00:04:44.919> how<00:04:45.430> you<00:04:45.460> apply<00:04:45.880> this<00:04:45.940> powder

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
careful how you apply this powder

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.540 
careful how you apply this powder
because<00:04:46.960> after<00:04:47.290> a<00:04:47.320> few<00:04:47.680> uses<00:04:47.889> it<00:04:48.220> like<00:04:48.250> it

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
because after a few uses it like it

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.430 
because after a few uses it like it
becomes<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.180> little<00:04:49.330> bit<00:04:49.419> more<00:04:49.540> loose<00:04:50.110> in<00:04:50.320> the

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
becomes a little bit more loose in the

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.230 
becomes a little bit more loose in the
packaging<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:51.040> then<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.580> moment<00:04:51.850> you<00:04:51.880> sweep

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
packaging and then the moment you sweep

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.150 
packaging and then the moment you sweep
your<00:04:52.389> brush<00:04:52.600> over<00:04:52.930> you<00:04:53.020> just<00:04:53.050> get<00:04:53.380> an<00:04:53.560> amazing

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
your brush over you just get an amazing

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.070 
your brush over you just get an amazing
amount<00:04:54.340> of<00:04:54.490> powder<00:04:54.699> like<00:04:54.910> my<00:04:55.479> powder<00:04:55.990> brush

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
amount of powder like my powder brush

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.680 
amount of powder like my powder brush

extremely<00:05:09.010> greasy<00:05:09.430> skin<00:05:09.820> you<00:05:09.970> would<00:05:10.120> use<00:05:10.360> that

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
extremely greasy skin you would use that

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.200 
extremely greasy skin you would use that

but even me feel like having a very oily

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.090 
but even me feel like having a very oily
t-zone<00:05:13.600> I<00:05:13.990> don't<00:05:14.229> like<00:05:14.380> to<00:05:14.530> use<00:05:14.560> that<00:05:14.919> much

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
t-zone I don't like to use that much

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.550 
t-zone I don't like to use that much
powder<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:15.699> do<00:05:15.940> like<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.600> kind<00:05:17.020> of<00:05:17.110> set<00:05:17.380> my

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
powder I do like to kind of set my

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.830 
powder I do like to kind of set my
foundation<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:18.400> then<00:05:18.580> touch<00:05:19.180> up<00:05:19.389> maybe<00:05:19.570> once

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
foundation and then touch up maybe once

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.300 
foundation and then touch up maybe once
throughout<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.199> day<00:05:20.350> then<00:05:20.560> have<00:05:20.710> a<00:05:20.740> big<00:05:21.010> cake

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
throughout the day then have a big cake

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.060 
throughout the day then have a big cake
face<00:05:21.729> of<00:05:21.970> powder<00:05:22.330> so<00:05:23.229> I<00:05:23.260> thought<00:05:23.620> that<00:05:23.800> even

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
face of powder so I thought that even

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.469 
face of powder so I thought that even
that<00:05:24.250> amount<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.699> powder<00:05:24.940> would<00:05:25.120> make<00:05:25.330> the

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
that amount of powder would make the

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.659 
that amount of powder would make the
foundation<00:05:26.020> that<00:05:26.199> little<00:05:26.620> bit<00:05:26.770> more<00:05:26.979> less<00:05:27.310> wet

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
foundation that little bit more less wet

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.730 
foundation that little bit more less wet
kind<00:05:28.030> of<00:05:28.240> look<00:05:28.449> but<00:05:28.870> even<00:05:29.169> doesn't<00:05:29.500> matter<00:05:29.650> how

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
kind of look but even doesn't matter how

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.760 
kind of look but even doesn't matter how
much<00:05:29.949> powder<00:05:30.280> you<00:05:30.520> apply<00:05:31.169> whether<00:05:32.169> it<00:05:32.380> be<00:05:32.560> the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
much powder you apply whether it be the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.550 
much powder you apply whether it be the
the<00:05:33.130> not<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.940> rim<00:05:34.090> or<00:05:34.240> sorry<00:05:34.539> the<00:05:35.020> Revlon<00:05:35.380> age

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
the not the rim or sorry the Revlon age

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.020 
the not the rim or sorry the Revlon age
to<00:05:35.800> fine<00:05:35.950> powder<00:05:36.220> or<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.460> Rimmel<00:05:36.789> stay<00:05:36.910> matte

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
oxidize and do all the horrible things

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.100 
oxidize and do all the horrible things
so<00:06:06.849> if<00:06:06.910> you<00:06:07.000> have<00:06:07.120> the<00:06:07.240> skin<00:06:07.449> type<00:06:07.660> for<00:06:07.900> it<00:06:07.990> this

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
so if you have the skin type for it this

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.810 
so if you have the skin type for it this
would<00:06:08.349> be<00:06:08.380> really<00:06:08.650> good<00:06:08.889> the<00:06:09.280> concealer<00:06:09.729> I

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
would be really good the concealer I

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.189 
would be really good the concealer I
would<00:06:10.030> recommend<00:06:10.419> for<00:06:10.570> everyone<00:06:10.870> to<00:06:11.080> go<00:06:11.169> and

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
would recommend for everyone to go and

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.930 
would recommend for everyone to go and
try<00:06:11.560> if<00:06:11.710> you<00:06:11.830> do<00:06:11.979> have<00:06:12.160> bags<00:06:12.400> on<00:06:12.639> your<00:06:12.789> eyes<00:06:12.910> or

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
try if you do have bags on your eyes or

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.700 
try if you do have bags on your eyes or
dark<00:06:13.419> circles<00:06:13.930> or<00:06:14.110> anything<00:06:14.320> you<00:06:14.470> want<00:06:14.560> to

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
dark circles or anything you want to

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.620 
dark circles or anything you want to
cover<00:06:15.190> up<00:06:15.340> or<00:06:15.520> even<00:06:15.550> like<00:06:15.910> little<00:06:16.030> fine<00:06:16.360> lines

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
cover up or even like little fine lines

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.000 
cover up or even like little fine lines
this<00:06:16.870> really<00:06:17.199> doesn't<00:06:17.530> minimize<00:06:17.650> the

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
this really doesn't minimize the

appearance of it it does cover dark

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.659 
appearance of it it does cover dark
circles<00:06:20.010> fantastically<00:06:21.010> well<00:06:21.190> and<00:06:21.430> it

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.370 
circles fantastically well and it
hydrates<00:06:21.940> that<00:06:22.330> area<00:06:22.690> and<00:06:22.870> if<00:06:22.990> you<00:06:23.080> set<00:06:23.349> it

Halloween gothic tutorials just because

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.309

it<00:06:47.710> is<00:06:47.860> so<00:06:48.310> wide<00:06:48.610> which<00:06:49.300> is<00:06:49.330> kind<00:06:49.779> of<00:06:49.900> a<00:06:50.110> good

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 
it is so wide which is kind of a good

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:51.809 
it is so wide which is kind of a good
thing<00:06:50.469> for<00:06:50.800> if<00:06:51.069> you're<00:06:51.249> doing<00:06:51.370> Halloween

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
thing for if you're doing Halloween

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.550 
thing for if you're doing Halloween
stuff<00:06:52.120> but<00:06:52.330> not<00:06:52.449> for<00:06:52.629> everyday<00:06:52.870> use<00:06:53.139> so<00:06:53.349> I

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
stuff but not for everyday use so I

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.709 
stuff but not for everyday use so I
would<00:06:53.979> say<00:06:54.219> get<00:06:54.610> a<00:06:54.639> colored<00:06:55.120> powder<00:06:55.360> just

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:55.719 
would say get a colored powder just

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:57.300 
would say get a colored powder just
because<00:06:55.930> it<00:06:56.020> is<00:06:56.139> so<00:06:56.319> powdery<00:06:56.740> that<00:06:56.919> a<00:06:56.949> colored

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
because it is so powdery that a colored

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.580 
because it is so powdery that a colored
powder<00:06:57.520> might<00:06:57.759> serve<00:06:58.060> better<00:06:58.330> but<00:06:59.259> for<00:06:59.499> the

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
powder might serve better but for the

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.469 
powder might serve better but for the
transparent<00:07:00.310> one<00:07:00.460> I<00:07:00.729> would<00:07:00.999> say<00:07:01.180> stay<00:07:01.449> away

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 
transparent one I would say stay away

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:03.300 
transparent one I would say stay away
from<00:07:01.689> that<00:07:01.900> one<00:07:01.990> cuz<00:07:02.169> it's<00:07:02.319> just<00:07:02.499> really<00:07:02.919> too
