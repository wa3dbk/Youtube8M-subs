I<00:01:46.320> didn't<00:01:46.590> see<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.740> guy<00:01:47.070> laying<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.670> in

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
I didn't see that guy laying there in

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.730 
I didn't see that guy laying there in
the<00:01:47.850> mine<00:01:48.030> shaft<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.840> actually<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.290> big

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the mine shaft that's actually a big

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.639 
the mine shaft that's actually a big
spot<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.340> campers<00:01:50.729> from<00:01:50.850> what<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> could<00:01:51.180> see

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
spot for campers from what I could see

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.440 
spot for campers from what I could see
and<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.159> know<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.490> game<00:01:53.670> play<00:01:53.939> was<00:01:54.149> produced

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and I know this game play was produced

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.389 
and I know this game play was produced
within<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> first<00:01:55.290> hour<00:01:55.530> hour<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.130> half<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
within the first hour hour and a half of

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
within the first hour hour and a half of
me<00:01:56.520> playing<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.390> still<00:01:57.899> felt<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.320> was<00:01:58.439> nice

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
me playing but I still felt it was nice

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.130 
me playing but I still felt it was nice
a<00:01:58.950> nice<00:01:59.790> gameplay<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:00.329> at<00:02:00.509> least<00:02:00.630> nice<00:02:00.840> enough

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
a nice gameplay or at least nice enough

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.280 
a nice gameplay or at least nice enough
to<00:02:01.200> share<00:02:01.469> with<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.860> all<00:02:03.049> could<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.079> been<00:02:04.259> a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
to share with you all could have been a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.469 
to share with you all could have been a
lot<00:02:04.500> better<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:05.040> expect<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.880> expect<00:02:06.329> better

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
lot better I expect I expect better

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.210 
lot better I expect I expect better
gameplay<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> future<00:02:07.500> once<00:02:07.710> i<00:02:07.860> get<00:02:08.039> used

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
gameplay in the future once i get used

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.930 
gameplay in the future once i get used
to<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.520> shit<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:09.770> still<00:02:10.770> fun<00:02:11.009> times

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to this shit but still fun times

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.760 
to this shit but still fun times
as<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.090> can<00:02:13.150> see<00:02:13.330> here<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.600> mean<00:02:13.930> with<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.530> with

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
as you can see here I mean with the with

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.220 
as you can see here I mean with the with
the<00:02:14.860> recoil<00:02:15.220> spread<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.760> everything<00:02:16.030> else<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
the recoil spread and everything else a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.200 
the recoil spread and everything else a
nice<00:02:17.680> nice<00:02:18.100> little<00:02:18.400> controlled<00:02:18.730> bursts<00:02:19.030> and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
nice nice little controlled bursts and

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.280 
nice nice little controlled bursts and
shots<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.660> could<00:02:19.810> sit<00:02:19.990> there<00:02:20.170> and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
shots you could sit there and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.260 
shots you could sit there and
practically<00:02:20.830> use<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.190> m4<00:02:21.580> as<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> sniper<00:02:22.030> rifle

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
practically use the m4 as a sniper rifle

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.050 
practically use the m4 as a sniper rifle
so<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.380> pretty<00:02:23.860> effective<00:02:24.040> just<00:02:24.700> don't<00:02:24.880> hold

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
so it's pretty effective just don't hold

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.030 
so it's pretty effective just don't hold
down<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.480> trigger<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:26.440> can<00:02:26.560> usually<00:02:26.710> get

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
down the trigger you can usually get

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.680 
down the trigger you can usually get
them<00:02:27.190> get<00:02:27.550> them<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:27.940> two<00:02:27.970> or<00:02:28.240> three<00:02:28.270> burst

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
them get them in like two or three burst

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.270 
them get them in like two or three burst
it's<00:02:29.440> pretty<00:02:29.530> effective<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:32.040> think<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
it's pretty effective I think in the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.040 
it's pretty effective I think in the
future<00:02:33.310> I'm<00:02:33.820> gonna<00:02:33.940> probably<00:02:34.480> be<00:02:34.690> putting

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
future I'm gonna probably be putting

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.690 
future I'm gonna probably be putting
more<00:02:35.230> sniper<00:02:35.590> gameplay<00:02:35.920> than<00:02:36.250> anything

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
more sniper gameplay than anything

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.220 
more sniper gameplay than anything
because<00:02:36.850> I'm<00:02:37.120> really<00:02:37.300> starting<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.780> love<00:02:37.930> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
because I'm really starting to love the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.100 
because I'm really starting to love the
m24<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.790> m21<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.660> know<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:40.780> really<00:02:40.990> don't

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
m24 and the m21 you know I really don't

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.810 
m24 and the m21 you know I really don't
count<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.500> as<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.710> sniper<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.190> consider<00:02:42.610> that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
count that as a sniper I consider that

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.200 
count that as a sniper I consider that
more<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.900> like<00:02:44.080> an<00:02:44.290> overpowered<00:02:45.210> semi-auto

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
more of like an overpowered semi-auto

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.930 
more of like an overpowered semi-auto
rifle<00:02:46.810> which<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.500> still<00:02:47.890> amazing<00:02:48.160> in<00:02:48.460> itself<00:02:48.730> I

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
rifle which is still amazing in itself I

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.270 
rifle which is still amazing in itself I
mean<00:02:49.120> it's<00:02:49.240> basically<00:02:49.330> two<00:02:49.870> shots<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.470> each

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
mean it's basically two shots for each

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.950 
mean it's basically two shots for each
kill<00:02:51.610> you<00:02:52.180> can<00:02:52.270> shoot<00:02:52.420> them<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.660> feet

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
kill you can shoot them in the feet

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.610 
kill you can shoot them in the feet
doesn't<00:02:53.410> really<00:02:53.560> matter<00:02:53.880> but<00:02:54.880> yeah<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.810> m24

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
doesn't really matter but yeah the m24

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.130 
doesn't really matter but yeah the m24
amazing<00:02:57.460> gets<00:02:58.090> tough<00:02:58.330> one<00:02:58.630> shot<00:02:58.870> one<00:02:59.110> kill

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
amazing gets tough one shot one kill

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.050 
amazing gets tough one shot one kill
you're<00:03:00.010> not<00:03:00.130> going<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.340> get<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.550> quick<00:03:00.730> scopes

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
you're not going to get the quick scopes

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.050 
you're not going to get the quick scopes
that<00:03:01.210> you<00:03:01.330> did<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:02.130> modern<00:03:03.130> warfare<00:03:03.310> 2<00:03:03.700> and

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
that you did in modern warfare 2 and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.410 
that you did in modern warfare 2 and
rest<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.080> call<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.410> duty<00:03:05.440> series<00:03:05.890> but<00:03:06.430> it's

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
rest of the call of duty series but it's

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.570 
rest of the call of duty series but it's
still<00:03:07.690> effective<00:03:08.410> in<00:03:08.530> itself<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:09.160> mean<00:03:09.340> it

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
still effective in itself I mean it

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.300 
still effective in itself I mean it
makes<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.940> sniper<00:03:10.380> be<00:03:11.380> more<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.130> support

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
makes the sniper be more of a support

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.920 
makes the sniper be more of a support
player<00:03:12.760> like<00:03:13.000> they're<00:03:13.180> supposed<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.660> be<00:03:13.810> in

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
player like they're supposed to be in

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.630 
player like they're supposed to be in
real<00:03:14.080> life<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.560> mean<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:14.710> guess<00:03:15.130> I<00:03:15.340> guess<00:03:15.490> that

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
real life I mean I guess I guess that

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.460 
real life I mean I guess I guess that
makes<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.940> game<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.120> little<00:03:16.209> more<00:03:16.570> realistic<00:03:17.110> I

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
makes the game a little more realistic I

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.470 
makes the game a little more realistic I
can't<00:03:17.680> really<00:03:17.770> say<00:03:18.040> as<00:03:18.160> much<00:03:18.370> but<00:03:19.150> yeah<00:03:19.270> right

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
can't really say as much but yeah right

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.970 
can't really say as much but yeah right
here<00:03:19.660> some<00:03:19.900> guy<00:03:20.020> tried<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.290> hide<00:03:20.560> in<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.800> mine

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
here some guy tried to hide in the mine

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.980 
here some guy tried to hide in the mine
shaft<00:03:21.250> again<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.850> same<00:03:22.030> camping<00:03:22.510> spot<00:03:22.750> I

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
shaft again that same camping spot I

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.800 
shaft again that same camping spot I
tried<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.800> drive<00:03:24.040> him<00:03:24.220> out<00:03:24.510> didn't<00:03:25.510> work<00:03:25.660> out

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
tried to drive him out didn't work out

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.680 
tried to drive him out didn't work out
so<00:03:26.110> well<00:03:26.140> pulled<00:03:26.560> out<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.830> 84<00:03:27.459> and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
so well pulled out the 84 and

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.030 
so well pulled out the 84 and
fortunately<00:03:28.690> his<00:03:28.840> teammate<00:03:29.290> intercepted<00:03:29.920> me

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
fortunately his teammate intercepted me

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.340 
fortunately his teammate intercepted me
but<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.250> did<00:03:30.610> get<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.910> 84<00:03:31.540> kill<00:03:31.780> off<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:31.990> guy<00:03:32.200> at

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
but I did get the 84 kill off the guy at

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.140 
but I did get the 84 kill off the guy at
the<00:03:32.410> mine<00:03:32.650> shaft<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.250> wasn't<00:03:34.120> too<00:03:34.240> bad<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:36.150> I

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
the mine shaft so wasn't too bad and I

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.270 
the mine shaft so wasn't too bad and I
think<00:03:37.480> when<00:03:37.900> this<00:03:38.080> game<00:03:38.320> is<00:03:38.380> all<00:03:38.950> said<00:03:39.250> and

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
think when this game is all said and

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.690 
think when this game is all said and
done<00:03:39.490> I<00:03:39.970> finished<00:03:40.630> with<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:40.930> score<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.500> 26<00:03:42.430> and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
done I finished with a score of 26 and

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.740 
done I finished with a score of 26 and
for<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.560> don't<00:03:44.560> think<00:03:44.709> you're<00:03:44.770> going<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:44.950> see

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
for I don't think you're going to see

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.750 
for I don't think you're going to see
see<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.810> too<00:03:46.959> much<00:03:47.170> from<00:03:47.350> this<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.920> think<00:03:48.670> the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
see you too much from this I think the

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.130

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
game's pretty much over from this point

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.360 
game's pretty much over from this point
because<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.500> looks<00:03:50.770> like<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:50.950> already<00:03:51.070> got<00:03:51.250> the
