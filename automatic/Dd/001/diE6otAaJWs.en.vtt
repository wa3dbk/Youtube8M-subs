00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.060 
patients will work against a lot of
players<00:01:49.690> but<00:01:49.869> what<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.440> higher<00:01:50.619> higher<00:01:50.920> you

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
players but what the higher higher you

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.919 
players but what the higher higher you
go<00:01:51.190> with<00:01:51.340> skill<00:01:51.520> level<00:01:51.789> that's<00:01:52.240> exactly<00:01:52.450> where

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
go with skill level that's exactly where

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.719 
go with skill level that's exactly where
you'll<00:01:53.050> lose<00:01:53.229> yeah<00:01:53.649> especially<00:01:54.250> when<00:01:54.640> you

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
you'll lose yeah especially when you

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.130 
you'll lose yeah especially when you
face<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.000> player<00:01:55.270> that's<00:01:55.420> very<00:01:55.660> aware<00:01:55.929> that's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
face a player that's very aware that's

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.840 
face a player that's very aware that's
happening<00:01:56.560> father<00:01:57.070> picked<00:01:57.340> up<00:01:57.429> this<00:01:57.520> combo

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
happening father picked up this combo

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.300 
happening father picked up this combo
though<00:01:57.970> Oh<00:01:58.060> My<00:01:58.330> gods<00:01:58.690> I<00:01:59.110> was<00:01:59.770> on<00:01:59.860> my<00:01:59.890> get<00:02:00.130> back

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
though Oh My gods I was on my get back

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.240 
though Oh My gods I was on my get back
yeah<00:02:01.060> I<00:02:01.740> think<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:02.860> could<00:02:03.009> have<00:02:03.100> actually

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
yeah I think you could have actually

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.100 
yeah I think you could have actually
converted<00:02:03.700> that<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.819> a<00:02:03.940> zero<00:02:04.210> depth<00:02:04.420> here<00:02:04.630> yeah

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
converted that to a zero depth here yeah

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.690 
converted that to a zero depth here yeah
give<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.530> few<00:02:05.800> more<00:02:05.920> months<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.340> we'll<00:02:06.520> start

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
give a few more months and we'll start

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.249 
give a few more months and we'll start
seeing<00:02:06.880> those<00:02:07.090> convert<00:02:07.390> away<00:02:07.569> yeah<00:02:07.780> seriously

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
seeing those convert away yeah seriously

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.650 
seeing those convert away yeah seriously
like<00:02:08.500> there's<00:02:09.009> those<00:02:10.000> are<00:02:10.119> problems<00:02:10.300> there's

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
like there's those are problems there's

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.479 
like there's those are problems there's
so<00:02:10.780> many<00:02:10.840> setups<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.350> this<00:02:11.470> game<00:02:11.620> yeah<00:02:11.800> it's

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
so many setups in this game yeah it's

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.850 
so many setups in this game yeah it's
all<00:02:12.640> setup<00:02:12.880> dependent<00:02:13.330> really<00:02:13.540> oh<00:02:14.170> nice

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
all setup dependent really oh nice

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.250 
all setup dependent really oh nice
forward<00:02:15.370> smash<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.970> it's<00:02:16.090> not<00:02:16.239> like<00:02:16.420> filling

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
forward smash and it's not like filling

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.140 
forward smash and it's not like filling
a<00:02:17.319> brawl<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> lot<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:17.920> was<00:02:18.400> very<00:02:18.700> self<00:02:18.970> dependent

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
a brawl a lot it was very self dependent

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.270 
a brawl a lot it was very self dependent
but<00:02:19.420> we're<00:02:19.600> very<00:02:19.750> tenuous<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.380> was<00:02:20.470> like<00:02:20.650> you

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
but we're very tenuous it was like you

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.800 
but we're very tenuous it was like you
could<00:02:21.310> set<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.640> up<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.060> predict<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.720> do

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
could set it up and predict it and do

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.850 
could set it up and predict it and do
that<00:02:22.959> but<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.170> probably<00:02:23.350> have<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.590> predict

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
that but you probably have to predict

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.440 
that but you probably have to predict
like<00:02:23.920> three<00:02:24.160> or<00:02:24.280> four<00:02:24.310> things<00:02:24.610> yeah<00:02:25.090> yeah<00:02:25.299> yeah

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
like three or four things yeah yeah yeah

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.240 
like three or four things yeah yeah yeah
and<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.690> works<00:02:25.959> like<00:02:26.140> no<00:02:26.320> seriously<00:02:26.829> you

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
and this works like no seriously you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.740 
and this works like no seriously you
know<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.700> will<00:02:27.850> happen<00:02:27.880> if<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.420> set<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.690> up

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
know it will happen if you set it up

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.210 
know it will happen if you set it up
right<00:02:28.989> yeah<00:02:31.380> yeah<00:02:32.380> something<00:02:32.769> actually<00:02:33.010> I

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
right yeah yeah something actually I

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.699 
right yeah yeah something actually I
can't<00:02:33.790> wait<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.910> see<00:02:34.150> his<00:02:34.239> people<00:02:34.590> finding<00:02:35.590> it

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
can't wait to see his people finding it

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.490 
can't wait to see his people finding it
more<00:02:35.739> set<00:02:36.130> up<00:02:36.250> since<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.519> jab<00:02:36.730> block<00:02:36.970> yeah<00:02:37.660> yeah

think<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.080> absorb<00:03:31.560> yeah<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:33.290> it's<00:03:34.290> hard<00:03:34.470> yeah

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
think the absorb yeah but it's hard yeah

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.830 
think the absorb yeah but it's hard yeah
a<00:03:34.920> lot<00:03:35.129> of<00:03:35.190> matchups<00:03:35.519> in<00:03:35.610> this<00:03:35.760> game<00:03:35.940> yeah<00:03:36.690> it

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
a lot of matchups in this game yeah it

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.050 
a lot of matchups in this game yeah it
is<00:03:36.989> yeah<00:03:37.920> but<00:03:38.220> actually<00:03:38.519> i<00:03:38.579> don't<00:03:38.700> think<00:03:38.940> it'll

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
is yeah but actually i don't think it'll

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.930 
is yeah but actually i don't think it'll
work<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.450> doubt<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:39.989> right<00:03:40.260> yeah<00:03:40.500> oh<00:03:40.849> that<00:03:41.849> would

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
work I doubt it right yeah oh that would

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.399 
work I doubt it right yeah oh that would
actually<00:03:42.030> invalidate<00:03:42.629> the<00:03:42.720> pool<00:03:42.870> like<00:03:43.260> that

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
actually invalidate the pool like that

don't think I like about the stage
especially<00:04:21.120> is<00:04:21.600> when<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.900> water<00:04:22.109> is<00:04:22.229> used<00:04:22.560> for

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
especially is when the water is used for

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.920 
especially is when the water is used for
like<00:04:22.950> spikes<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.430> stuff<00:04:23.610> yeah<00:04:23.940> because<00:04:24.660> then
