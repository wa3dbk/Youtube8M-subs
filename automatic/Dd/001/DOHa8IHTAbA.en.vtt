needs one of them could ride without it
but<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.360> know<00:03:04.650> that's<00:03:05.650> asking<00:03:05.890> for<00:03:06.190> trouble

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
but you know that's asking for trouble

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.280 
but you know that's asking for trouble
that's<00:03:08.200> like<00:03:09.209> yeah<00:03:10.209> it's<00:03:10.720> just<00:03:10.870> asking<00:03:11.260> for

that's like yeah it's just asking for

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.039 
that's like yeah it's just asking for
trouble<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:12.280> leak<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.489> really<00:03:12.880> pretty<00:03:13.060> there

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
trouble the leak is really pretty there

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.530 
trouble the leak is really pretty there
was<00:03:14.200> something<00:03:14.440> at<00:03:14.530> jump<00:03:14.709> in<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:14.920> water<00:03:15.870> so

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
was something at jump in the water so

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.760 
was something at jump in the water so
the<00:03:19.540> ER<00:03:19.690> 6n<00:03:21.030> went<00:03:22.030> pick<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.270> up<00:03:22.360> in<00:03:22.480> Chicago

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
the ER 6n went pick it up in Chicago

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.950 
the ER 6n went pick it up in Chicago
made<00:03:23.770> it<00:03:23.920> home<00:03:24.330> parked<00:03:25.330> in<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.480> driveway<00:03:25.780> and

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
made it home parked in the driveway and

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.980 
made it home parked in the driveway and
all<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.290> coolant<00:03:26.620> boiled<00:03:26.950> out<00:03:27.900> here's<00:03:28.900> the

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
all the coolant boiled out here's the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:36.770 
all the coolant boiled out here's the
brook<00:03:30.570> pretty<00:03:31.570> anymore

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.230 

hi<00:03:37.380> guys

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.350 

is<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.990> moment<00:03:43.440> pit<00:03:44.660> trap

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.750 

downside<00:03:50.350> then<00:03:50.800> on<00:03:50.890> this<00:03:51.010> side<00:03:51.070> you<00:03:51.340> got<00:03:51.490> this

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
downside then on this side you got this

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.620 
downside then on this side you got this
so<00:03:52.300> it's<00:03:52.690> kind<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:52.900> pretty<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:55.450> nice<00:03:55.600> thing

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
so it's kind of pretty the nice thing

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.540 
so it's kind of pretty the nice thing
about<00:03:55.750> living<00:03:56.020> in<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.290> city<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.770> still<00:03:57.370> has<00:03:57.520> a

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
about living in a city that still has a

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.740 
about living in a city that still has a
lot<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.820> open<00:03:58.150> land<00:03:58.270> that<00:03:58.480> isn't

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
lot of open land that isn't

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.110 
lot of open land that isn't
overpopulated<00:03:59.500> like<00:03:59.620> Chicago<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.220> you'll

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
overpopulated like Chicago is you'll

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.140 
overpopulated like Chicago is you'll
have<00:04:01.360> a<00:04:01.390> lot<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.720> places<00:04:01.960> like<00:04:02.410> this<00:04:03.150> tucked

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
have a lot of places like this tucked

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.020 
have a lot of places like this tucked
right<00:04:04.270> in<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.540> middle<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.840> city<00:04:05.050> and

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
right in the middle of the city and

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.930 
right in the middle of the city and
that's<00:04:07.030> kind<00:04:07.270> of<00:04:07.300> cool<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:09.010> if<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.490> live<00:04:09.700> here

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
that's kind of cool and if you live here

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.430 
that's kind of cool and if you live here
you<00:04:10.090> know<00:04:10.180> where<00:04:10.420> they<00:04:10.510> are<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:11.200> can<00:04:11.320> use

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
you know where they are and you can use

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.000 
you know where they are and you can use
the<00:04:11.590> mr.<00:04:11.860> cuts<00:04:12.570> when<00:04:13.570> you<00:04:13.840> don't<00:04:14.140> have<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.530> car

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
the mr. cuts when you don't have a car

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.900 
the mr. cuts when you don't have a car
or<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:16.269> motorcycle<00:04:16.450> oh<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:18.700> then<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:18.880> little

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
or a motorcycle oh and then a little

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.280 
or a motorcycle oh and then a little
fifty<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.829> engines<00:04:21.190> all<00:04:21.340> messed<00:04:21.579> up<00:04:22.290> bad

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
fifty that engines all messed up bad

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.659 
fifty that engines all messed up bad
compression<00:04:23.860> in<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.010> Rings<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:26.669> some

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
compression in the Rings and some

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.070 
compression in the Rings and some
knocking<00:04:27.910> at<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.240> bottom<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:28.780> think<00:04:28.990> the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
knocking at the bottom and I think the

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.790 
knocking at the bottom and I think the
bearings<00:04:29.550> spun<00:04:30.550> in<00:04:30.669> there<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:31.240> I<00:04:31.540> could<00:04:32.500> just

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
bearings spun in there so I could just

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.490 
bearings spun in there so I could just
keep<00:04:32.919> riding<00:04:33.220> until<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:33.700> just<00:04:33.880> stops<00:04:34.380> you<00:04:35.380> know

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
keep riding until it just stops you know

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.740 
keep riding until it just stops you know
this<00:04:35.740> is<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:36.160> compression<00:04:36.850> or<00:04:37.030> either<00:04:37.330> gives

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
this is the compression or either gives

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.080 
this is the compression or either gives
of<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:37.990> bearing<00:04:38.290> where<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.250> crank<00:04:39.640> gives<00:04:39.880> and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
of the bearing where the crank gives and

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.210 
of the bearing where the crank gives and
then<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:40.240> know<00:04:40.540> it<00:04:40.600> won't<00:04:40.860> won't<00:04:41.860> turn<00:04:42.100> over

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
then you know it won't won't turn over

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.150 
then you know it won't won't turn over
anymore<00:04:42.520> but<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:44.710> would<00:04:44.860> suck<00:04:45.070> because

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
anymore but that would suck because

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.740 
anymore but that would suck because
there's<00:04:45.460> not<00:04:45.550> really<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.820> clutch<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.510> then<00:04:46.660> I'd

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
there's not really a clutch and then I'd

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.200 
there's not really a clutch and then I'd
be<00:04:46.900> stuck<00:04:47.110> trying<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.500> ride<00:04:47.710> at<00:04:47.860> home<00:04:48.060> push<00:04:49.060> it

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
be stuck trying to ride at home push it

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.290 
be stuck trying to ride at home push it
home<00:04:49.360> with<00:04:49.600> a<00:04:49.630> locked<00:04:49.930> rear<00:04:50.200> wheel<00:04:50.880> unless<00:04:51.880> the

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
home with a locked rear wheel unless the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.730 
home with a locked rear wheel unless the
if<00:04:52.480> the<00:04:52.630> piston<00:04:52.930> that<00:04:53.080> just<00:04:53.230> goes<00:04:53.410> there's<00:04:53.680> no

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
if the piston that just goes there's no

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.600 
if the piston that just goes there's no
compression<00:04:54.390> well<00:04:55.390> then<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.600> just<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:57.550> just

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
compression well then it just it just

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.830 
compression well then it just it just
won't<00:04:57.940> won't<00:04:58.870> fire<00:05:01.229> that<00:05:02.229> would<00:05:02.350> stink<00:05:02.620> but<00:05:03.310> I

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
won't won't fire that would stink but I

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.000 
won't won't fire that would stink but I
don't<00:05:04.840> want<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.020> push<00:05:05.200> that<00:05:05.380> bike<00:05:05.560> so<00:05:05.860> it's

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
don't want to push that bike so it's

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.820 
don't want to push that bike so it's
parked<00:05:06.660> waiting<00:05:07.660> on<00:05:07.870> a<00:05:07.900> new<00:05:08.020> motor<00:05:08.290> oh<00:05:08.530> that's

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
parked waiting on a new motor oh that's

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.190 
parked waiting on a new motor oh that's
at<00:05:08.919> the<00:05:08.979> bottom<00:05:09.040> of<00:05:09.310> my<00:05:09.370> list<00:05:09.930> because<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:11.050> keep

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
at the bottom of my list because I keep

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.240 
at the bottom of my list because I keep
having<00:05:11.290> other<00:05:11.560> things<00:05:11.800> wrong<00:05:11.950> with<00:05:11.979> my<00:05:12.160> other

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
having other things wrong with my other

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.490 
having other things wrong with my other
bikes<00:05:12.750> so<00:05:13.750> there's<00:05:13.870> a<00:05:13.900> cooling<00:05:14.200> system

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
bikes so there's a cooling system

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.380 
bikes so there's a cooling system
failure<00:05:14.800> on<00:05:14.919> the<00:05:14.950> ER<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:16.530> it<00:05:17.970> will<00:05:18.970> remain<00:05:19.240> to

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
failure on the ER and it will remain to

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
doesn't leak once I do this because it's

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.450 
doesn't leak once I do this because it's
linking<00:05:56.020> right<00:05:56.169> now<00:05:56.320> in<00:05:56.919> fact<00:05:57.100> it's<00:05:57.280> still

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
the overflow just parked there and it's

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.170 
the overflow just parked there and it's
not<00:06:02.289> even<00:06:02.470> on
