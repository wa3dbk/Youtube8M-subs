installing<00:00:45.750> ensuring<00:00:46.230> printers<00:00:46.559> let's<00:00:47.309> begin

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
installing ensuring printers let's begin

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.889 
installing ensuring printers let's begin
by<00:00:47.700> creating<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.329> new<00:00:48.510> port<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:51.210> our<00:00:51.570> printer

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
by creating a new port and our printer

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.799 
by creating a new port and our printer
is<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:54.379> 10.20<00:00:55.379> 1.5<00:00:56.100> 11<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:57.449> always<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> good

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
is at 10.20 1.5 11 it's always a good

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.930 
is at 10.20 1.5 11 it's always a good
idea<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> printer<00:00:58.620> online<00:00:59.129> when

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
idea to have the printer online when

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.069 
idea to have the printer online when
you're<00:01:00.059> trying<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> auto<00:01:00.449> detect<00:01:00.539> will<00:01:00.989> go

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
you're trying to auto detect will go

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.759 
you're trying to auto detect will go
much<00:01:01.260> quicker<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.530> let's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
much quicker and there it is and let's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.130 
much quicker and there it is and let's
just<00:01:04.979> add<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> new<00:01:05.460> printer<00:01:05.930> we're<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
just add a new printer we're going to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.240 
just add a new printer we're going to
use<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> port<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.070> created<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:10.130> we<00:01:11.130> use

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
use the port we just created and we use

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
use the port we just created and we use
the<00:01:11.400> HP<00:01:11.729> Universal<00:01:11.850> printing<00:01:13.700> us<00:01:14.960> makes<00:01:15.960> life

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the HP Universal printing us makes life

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.660 
the HP Universal printing us makes life
a<00:01:16.229> lot<00:01:16.320> easier<00:01:16.500> dealing<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.460> one

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
a lot easier dealing with just one

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.270 
a lot easier dealing with just one
driver<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.380> we'll<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.770> leave<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> be

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
driver and we'll just leave that to be

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.700 
driver and we'll just leave that to be
our<00:01:20.369> printer<00:01:20.640> name<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.380> take<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> few

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
our printer name this will take a few

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.890 
our printer name this will take a few
seconds<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> run<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:24.509> once<00:01:24.750> it's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
seconds to run and then once it's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.499 
seconds to run and then once it's
complete<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.380> will<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.799> shared<00:01:26.100> printer

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.840 

ok<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> printer<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.020> successfully<00:01:31.140> installed

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
ok the printer is successfully installed

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.640 
ok the printer is successfully installed
we'll<00:01:32.850> click<00:01:33.060> finish<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> you'll<00:01:34.350> see<00:01:34.530> it's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
we'll click finish and you'll see it's

we'll click finish and you'll see it's
right<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:36.290> ok<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.470> next<00:01:37.590> step<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.100> go<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
right there ok the next step is to go to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.010 
right there ok the next step is to go to
our<00:01:38.400> domain<00:01:38.549> controller<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.180> create<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> new

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
our domain controller and create a new

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.499 
our domain controller and create a new
group<00:01:40.229> policy<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.970> you'll<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
group policy so you'll see I have a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.450 
group policy so you'll see I have a
domain<00:01:42.869> set<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> couple<00:01:43.829> test<00:01:44.130> users

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
domain set up I have a couple test users

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.450 
domain set up I have a couple test users
you'll<00:01:45.390> notice<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> test<00:01:46.110> user<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.649> not

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you'll notice that the test user is not

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.710 
you'll notice that the test user is not
an<00:01:47.640> admin<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:50.119> let's<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.360> create<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.689> new

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
an admin and let's just create a new

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.450 
an admin and let's just create a new
group<00:01:52.049> policy<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.560> want<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> keep<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.009> number

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
group policy you want to keep the number

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.980 
group policy you want to keep the number
of<00:01:53.549> policies<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.119> being<00:01:54.509> deployed<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
of policies you have being deployed to a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.590 
of policies you have being deployed to a
minimum<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.590> they<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.270> 34<00:01:57.270> Meg's<00:01:57.450> in

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
minimum because they do have 34 Meg's in

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.719 
minimum because they do have 34 Meg's in
size<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.229> start<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.159> take<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> little

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
size and that can start to take a little

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.429 
size and that can start to take a little
bit<00:01:59.880> longer<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> download<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.780> login<00:02:01.140> if

bit longer to download and login if

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.249 
bit longer to download and login if
you're<00:02:01.829> having<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.790> bunch<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.090> them<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.960> let's

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
you're having a bunch of them so let's

and<00:02:09.329> you'll<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.649> shows<00:02:10.890> up<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.129> our

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:11.219 
and you'll see that it shows up on our

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:13.879 
and you'll see that it shows up on our
COBOL<00:02:11.760> developers<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:13.139> next<00:02:13.409> step<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.799> go

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:13.889 
COBOL developers the next step is to go

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.149 
COBOL developers the next step is to go
back<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.249> the<00:02:14.340> print<00:02:14.549> server<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:16.069> select<00:02:17.069> the

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
back to the print server and select the

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.399 
back to the print server and select the
printer<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.489> just<00:02:17.700> created<00:02:17.969> right<00:02:18.900> click<00:02:19.170> and

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
printer we just created right click and

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.270 
printer we just created right click and
say<00:02:20.310> deploy<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.269> group<00:02:21.450> policy<00:02:21.889> and<00:02:22.889> we're

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
say deploy with group policy and we're

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.399 
say deploy with group policy and we're
going<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.519> browse<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.719> group<00:02:24.900> policy<00:02:25.319> we

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
going to browse to the group policy we

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.369 
going to browse to the group policy we
just<00:02:25.650> created<00:02:25.950> now<00:02:26.040> keep<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.459> mind<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.629> you

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
just created now keep in mind that you

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.319 
just created now keep in mind that you
can<00:02:28.530> deploy<00:02:28.799> printers<00:02:29.280> either<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.760> computers

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
can deploy printers either to computers

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.750 
can deploy printers either to computers
or<00:02:30.629> tweezers<00:02:31.019> in<00:02:31.439> this<00:02:32.069> instance<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.700> will

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
or tweezers in this instance I will

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.449 
or tweezers in this instance I will
select<00:02:33.120> per<00:02:33.389> user<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.950> then<00:02:34.950> don't<00:02:35.159> forget<00:02:35.310> to

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
select per user and then don't forget to

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.580 
select per user and then don't forget to
add<00:02:35.790> over<00:02:36.000> here<00:02:37.099> let's<00:02:38.099> apply<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:39.590> that's

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
add over here let's apply this that's

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.300 
add over here let's apply this that's
good<00:02:40.889> and<00:02:41.819> okay<00:02:42.500> all<00:02:43.500> right<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:43.889> if<00:02:43.980> we<00:02:44.040> look<00:02:44.219> in

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
good and okay all right so if we look in

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.619 
good and okay all right so if we look in
our<00:02:44.370> deploy<00:02:44.669> printers<00:02:45.060> tab<00:02:45.859> it<00:02:46.859> shows<00:02:46.919> up

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
our deploy printers tab it shows up

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.699 
our deploy printers tab it shows up
another<00:02:48.629> thing<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:48.900> can<00:02:49.019> do<00:02:49.139> is<00:02:49.260> if<00:02:49.379> we<00:02:49.469> look<00:02:49.560> at

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
another thing we can do is if we look at

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.220 
another thing we can do is if we look at
our<00:02:49.739> domain<00:02:50.040> controller<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.750> we<00:02:51.750> inspect

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
our domain controller and we inspect

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.610 
our domain controller and we inspect
that<00:02:52.560> group<00:02:53.219> policy<00:02:53.609> we<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:53.909> created<00:02:54.620> under

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
that group policy we just created under

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.740 
that group policy we just created under
the<00:02:55.859> settings<00:02:56.250> you'll<00:02:56.430> notice<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.939> now

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the settings you'll notice that now

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.209 
the settings you'll notice that now
you'll<00:02:57.959> see<00:02:58.139> printer<00:02:58.590> connections<00:02:59.010> whereas

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
you'll see printer connections whereas

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.809 
you'll see printer connections whereas
before<00:02:59.519> there<00:02:59.639> was<00:02:59.760> nothing<00:03:00.030> set<00:03:00.209> up<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:02.010> now

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
before there was nothing set up and now

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.830 
before there was nothing set up and now
we're<00:03:03.030> all<00:03:03.150> set<00:03:03.389> so<00:03:04.379> let's<00:03:04.530> check<00:03:04.769> our<00:03:04.949> client

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
we're all set so let's check our client

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.189 
we're all set so let's check our client
we'll<00:03:06.840> run<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.049> quick<00:03:07.819> GP<00:03:08.819> update<00:03:11.989> you'll<00:03:12.989> see

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:13.199 
we'll run a quick GP update you'll see

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.749 
we'll run a quick GP update you'll see
we<00:03:13.319> have<00:03:13.349> no<00:03:13.620> printers<00:03:13.979> currently<00:03:14.400> except<00:03:14.639> for

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:14.759 
we have no printers currently except for

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.149 
we have no printers currently except for
the<00:03:14.819> default<00:03:14.909> fax<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.889> will<00:03:16.979> take<00:03:17.129> a

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
the default fax and it will take a

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.069 
the default fax and it will take a
couple<00:03:17.370> seconds<00:03:17.759> to<00:03:17.819> show<00:03:18.060> up<00:03:18.209> there<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.989> is

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
couple seconds to show up there it is

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.409 
couple seconds to show up there it is
now<00:03:19.949> there<00:03:20.099> is<00:03:20.159> one<00:03:20.370> minor<00:03:20.609> caveat<00:03:20.879> with<00:03:21.269> this

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
now there is one minor caveat with this

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:25.189 
now there is one minor caveat with this
Windows<00:03:22.290> XP<00:03:22.769> requires<00:03:23.519> one<00:03:23.849> extra<00:03:24.180> step<00:03:24.389> so

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
Windows XP requires one extra step so

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.559 
Windows XP requires one extra step so
let's<00:03:25.409> show<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.889> to<00:03:26.849> deploy<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> printer

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
let's show you that to deploy a printer

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.270 
let's show you that to deploy a printer
to<00:03:27.750> Windows<00:03:28.019> XP<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:28.680> have<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.859> go<00:03:28.949> back<00:03:29.129> to

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
to Windows XP you have to go back to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.039 
to Windows XP you have to go back to
your<00:03:29.370> domain<00:03:29.639> controller<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.359> there's

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
startup script so you'll browse and just

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.830 
startup script so you'll browse and just
stick<00:03:54.329> it<00:03:54.479> right<00:03:54.509> in<00:03:54.719> there<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:56.719> that<00:03:57.719> will

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
stick it right in there and that will

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.289 
stick it right in there and that will

deploy it by machine if you're doing it

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.860 
deploy it by machine if you're doing it
by<00:04:00.419> user<00:04:02.000> you'll<00:04:03.000> need<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.299> add<00:04:03.509> it<00:04:03.659> to<00:04:03.689> their

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
file to the folder

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.770 
file to the folder
and<00:04:12.689> you're<00:04:12.900> good<00:04:13.019> to<00:04:13.140> go

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.600 

let's<00:04:18.470> hand<00:04:18.769> over<00:04:18.920> and<00:04:19.040> take<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.190> look<00:04:19.280> at<00:04:19.489> our

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
let's hand over and take a look at our

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.320 
let's hand over and take a look at our
windows<00:04:19.880> xp<00:04:20.180> client<00:04:21.700> so<00:04:22.700> we<00:04:22.730> have<00:04:22.880> no<00:04:22.970> printers

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
windows xp client so we have no printers

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.940 
windows xp client so we have no printers
so<00:04:24.640> we'll<00:04:25.640> do<00:04:25.760> a<00:04:25.790> quick<00:04:25.970> restart<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:27.560> can<00:04:27.770> run

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950
