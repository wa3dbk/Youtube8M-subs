00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.150
 but more what was there the way 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.940
 to save 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.210
 because he 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.830
 flamenco and the most important work of 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.890
 our Spanish literature that is the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.540
 Quixote Quixote the beat of a dream 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.670
 it's called now that it premieres here in the 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.520
 theater artery coliseum next 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.350
 Thursday the 9th and I am accompanied by the concha jareño 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.720
 which is one of the choreographers along with 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.070
 javier latorre things as you are because 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.020
 I understand that although you have 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.500
 Many years of experience is your first 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.629
 choral work your work gives vertigo for prima 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.000
 and somehow say so is the 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.920
 first time I have the opportunity to 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.710
 choreograph in a company of so many 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.610
 dancers and well then here we are with 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.610
 the experience and the challenge not 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.760
 good not so nervous but expectant 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.680
 not to do with people and then 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.500
 also see the reaction of the public and 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.020
 that in the end they are the ones who decide and 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.550
 are the ones who tell us that always more 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.500
 seeing 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.510
 you have crossed borders in those of 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.400
 September you go to China as you receive 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.610
 the Chinese public because this combination 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.850
 flamenco dance literature and good yo 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.830
 I think that first of all we have to export 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.740
 our what we have in Spain that 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.710
 course is flamenco and how not 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.760
 masterpiece as from literature as 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.710
 is 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.800
 of don quijote de la mancha 'then 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.550
 well then we go there for china 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:52.550
 with a show concept that is 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.980
 and focused on all kinds of 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.320
 of the public not only the one who knows 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.120
 don quijote de la la 'and the public 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.910
 that late who is but a little giving 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.910
 to know and making a little bridge 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.550
 from Spain towards the rest of the world 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.650
 we started by china in september as 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.710
 you say and well let's hope we hope not 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.080
 for content that this is one 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.820
 to two things not on the one hand each work 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.020
 more international than we have the quixote 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.190
 from the spot 'don quijote de la mancha' 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.110

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.340
 World heritage site of course 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.690
 as I said it is part 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.910
 always the one that we have to feel 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.580
 very proud and we have to give them a 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.300
 site that is sometimes good at level 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.450
 cultural like we forget to give us 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.640

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.610
 professionals there is practically no 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.940

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.390
 they feel comfortable that then 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.260

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.959

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.090

 that arrives arrives at the sale no and good is 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.260
 the moment in which 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.440
 the whole town somehow makes fun of a 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.630
 little of him by the fact by the fact of 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.780
 think that he thinks it 's a great 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.220
 gentleman no and there is a bit of mockery for 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.010
 part of the whole town and here it is 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.290
 Sancho Panza 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.950
 always try to comfort him of some 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.220
 mode 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.620
