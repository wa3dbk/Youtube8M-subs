00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.529
 I'm going to make you a song that you 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.870
 they like so much in those that I get sad 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.030
 and I tell you she can not stand I learned to 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.010
 value more time since you're not 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.620
 Also there are things to be and not 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.870
 they never come back, I hope you 're having more 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.360
 bad as I do not return that 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.820
 I'll ask what you forgot to do and I 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.010
 in my head ideas as a locomotive if not 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.269
 you were in the bad you do not deserve to be 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.760
 now why are you crying 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.470
 perhaps I said something that was not true I close 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.140
 Eyes me and I'll walk to the 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.180
 desert of my solitude for the poets 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.040
 they prefer not to feel anything for you 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.590
 the reason why you do not want to not me 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.660
 wait if tonight he will arrive very late 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.479
 that you like cowards and we no longer 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.789
 we try is better so I have more things 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.030
 important to worry about the 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.030
 compass when you're not when you're not 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.729
 I can choose when I'm left with nothing 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.850
 to say for no insomnia war and no 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.340
 there is peace and all that happens when you 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.400
 you are not when you are not when you no longer 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.690
 I can choose when I'm left with nothing 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.480
 what to say 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.090
 insomnia war and there is no peace and 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.280
 all that happens when you are not me 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.590
 they like moonless nights that never 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.260
 sleep otherwise awake and to the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.090
 another design of a broken heart of you 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.880
 I do not have a photo I have a past 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.090
 with you as a plane without a pilot climbs 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.890
 and descends traveling aimlessly 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.290
 always making a difference what I choose 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.090
 I wanted to get everything I chest 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.400
 squeeze and more than beads of sweat I 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.710
 splash a notebook I'm not sad 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.870
 I do not know if you have understood and it is not 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.480
 because you leave if not because you have not yet 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.610
 gone dawned cloudy while everything went 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.110
 concentrates talking alone with me I saw 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.870
 that the problem is in my 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.030
 head the only terrain that you govern 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.030
 two days we made nights seem like 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.550
 eternal locked I saw you escaping through the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.040
 roof will let it go say of my 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.190
 right shoulder but you're already when 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.890
 I can not choose when I'm left with nothing 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.010
 to say for no insomnia war and no 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.500
 there is peace and all that happens when you 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.410
 you are not when you are not when you no longer 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.050
 I can choose when I run out 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.690
 nothing to say paranoia insomnia war 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.590
 and there is no peace and all that happens 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.590
 When you are not here 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.810
 i
