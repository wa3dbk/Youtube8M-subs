 Good, I'll show you guys in this video. 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.530
 the localities are three localities that 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.960
 Are Teddy bear okay? 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.610
 it's pretty hard to find so I'm okay 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.280
 bringing the video here for you who do not 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.600
 it's so easy to find one of the seven berg 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.980

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.760
 ring once at the time you activate and 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.210
 will appear this annual song of 25 or 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.060
 26 I do not know the time of the round is 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.070
 because where it is very long it is 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.219
 depending on the radio item that arrives 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.289
 lasting half an hour in a part of the round 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.859
 music will play and it will be a song 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:20.810
 different, fine, what else can you say? 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:26.539

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.319

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.009

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.679
 Are you never sure which one is going to fall by 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.729
 example can drop what who will 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:44.149
 first jang can drop the speedy glue 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.850
 There is no exact time to fall so much that 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.969
 had round since I played that day that 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.779
 arrived at 15 for me and complicates a lot 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:56.090
 because the difficulty is very high and 

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:58.550
 you can drop at any time when 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.250
