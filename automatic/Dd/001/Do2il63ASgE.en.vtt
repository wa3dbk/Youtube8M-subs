00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.910
 new video on call of duty black 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.010
 ops 2 we are in death match by 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.129
 team on the map express I play with 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.539
 the msn is long barrel and handles 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.359
 ergonomic in secondary weapon I had 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.859
 the b 23 m and in my touch is more of 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.830
 everything you will see every time 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.880
 I die on the right so here is 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.710
 anyway people I hope you 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.840
 Well, for me it's going great 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.800
 today 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.960
 during this video so I'm going to you 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.760
 talk about my launch in said 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.219
 certeau on black ops so it turns out 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.120
 that I had done a little arthaud on 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.539
 black too much with the seven but nothing of 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.440
 standards 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:48.440
 I had maybe done ten 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.619
 mix but finally this crime rather may 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.339
 but nothing bad so that's so 

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:57.589
 today we meet for you 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.549
 talk like I wanted jeans from mountains re 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.609
 launch of a certain goal 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:04.549
 so I told you about my material 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:08.329
 in my helmet and my joysticks if I have 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:12.079
 shifters or what in what team 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:15.590
 I am in what size and so 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:18.320
 then sees my helmet so yes I have a 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.810
 headphones this is the turtle beach bitch I 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.149
 believe as you say no real pix 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.579
 So a helmet good enough for 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.369
 start in the back but finally in the 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.229
 brain but I will change I want 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.820
 take care in too sensitive a wedding 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.810
 I would see later but for 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.689
 the moment it is true that it is not appropriate 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.399
 rather not bad it's not enough we'll say 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.859
 even if bpt and I can not talk 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.329
 with the people on xbox live 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.880
 Besides, it makes me very proud 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.560
 because bah when you're in this 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.549
 crime and you want to talk about 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.810
 displacement and all that's right it's 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.340
 not really speaking practice 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.100
 headphones and so that's so I think 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.350
 change quickly makes headphones this for 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.070
 this reason there so here 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.659
 had my controllers so I play with them I 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.640
 play without competitive controller at wholesale 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.460
 I have to controller that you spend with the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.410
 console in the box here I am the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.220
 wholesale classic joystick I have no 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.260
 skf mick byrne 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.819
 I also think to buy myself a small 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.290
 butter a little what I do not know 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.069
 I still have not done well 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.900
 informed even though I looked a little 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:26.360
 but now for the moment it's not 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.480
 still not sure yet so that's after 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:35.000
 I have no teams since I left 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.830
 my team so there nzh to leave from there 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.900
 if I find one of course to leave 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:45.170
 sarto in a team if possible 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.130
 minimum to lift themselves or even if 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.180
 it's not a team a little roadster 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.870
 san pacheco 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.930
 so here's quietly for for 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.319
 to be discreet but all to start 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.569
 me it would be pretty good so here we go 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.890
 money must be in the ser touba and what 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.840
 while I started there is not very 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.690
 a long time i started iata she is 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.940
 maybe three weeks to me no 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.799
 researchers knew that I did rather 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.000
 a lot of scream mix gold what is a 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.250
 unix script for those who do not know 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.500
 it's basically you play without having 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.019
 of equipped wholesally there is a person who 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.810
 lives several there several players 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.220
 etc. random teams so that's the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.220
 four against four 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.350
 so we see yes on my channel will have 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.269
 jeddi certeau so some gameplay but not 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.650
 for now because necessarily a 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.540
 life that I just started I'm 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.239
 not very very strong yet I make myself a 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.820
 little ripped but it will happen you 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.170
 do not worry I also do league 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.599
 so the league 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:48.050
 the competitive game mode if we can 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:49.580
 say online bo 2 so here I am you 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.110
 to do league with pals when 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.239
 I get the headphones as you 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.280
 throw on time because ben there it's not 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.780
 practice to talk with my friends 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.640
 and all so good here is all that 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.670
 I had to say in the description of the 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.709
 Video will be the site of Decerto 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.750
 France because I'm on the sarto 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.450
 site sarto france and not on game 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.150
 battle or be like that for now 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.660
 I know that on that huge loophole 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.019
 passage 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.720
 so here it is rather a little 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.479
 nas is good even finished on a score 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.940
 of 33 6 or something like that I know more 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.729
 where is 33.6 because I have it in front of me 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.260
 so that's okay it's not it's not 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.450
 disgusting 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.979
 and so here you can also found 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.290
 that even without butter or what I'm getting 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.240
 all the same to manage the jump shot 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.280
 finally I think I'm fine 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.700
 pretty much does not work for 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.340
 do the jump shot me who was born 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.169
 had no shoot on black ops 2 you 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.700
 see that I have recovered and 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.840
 honestly it's a lot of fun 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.130
 and besides I will make you a 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.010
 little video to show you my 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.039
 tactically I me how I recovered 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.200
 my black shoot with them and that 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.669
 takes time but I managed 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.130
 so everyone can succeed in 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.530
 France since I know that there are many 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.720
 of people who can not manage well 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.030
 adapt to this black hawks from high 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.270
 level of the shoot and where I understand because 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.720
 that I too have taken a long time to see 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:21.229
 a minimum of a minimum of details 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.090
 but hey it's better and here and at all 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.890
