00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
remember Garuda had the gimmickry he'd

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.260 
remember Garuda had the gimmickry he'd
fold<00:01:48.009> his<00:01:48.189> wings<00:01:48.400> down<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:48.909> then<00:01:49.000> push<00:01:49.180> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
little button on the back and they'd

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.260 
little button on the back and they'd
flip<00:01:50.439> up<00:01:50.619> Griffon<00:01:51.520> actually<00:01:51.759> has<00:01:51.880> if<00:01:52.000> you<00:01:52.030> push
