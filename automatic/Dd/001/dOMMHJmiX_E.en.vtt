 today's edition in tek world 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.309
 you will see that android kitkat can 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.800
 have resources and also very 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.509
 interesting and other highlights 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:21.539
 then it stays connected that will ratify 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:24.359
 updated there in your 2065 agenda is 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.439
 the year in which the dead can master the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.010
 Facebook 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.230
 what happens is that 2065 is the year in which 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.570
 the social network may have more 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.399
 dead people in what you live 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.829
 this forecast is the result of a 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.440
 of the mortality rate of the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.420
 Facebook users compared to the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.090
 creation of new profiles 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.039
 who joined the social network between 2000 and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.879
 2001 and 2010 may be at an age of 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.910
 The criticism in 2065 gave rise to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.690
 but one remaining doubt is that the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.530
 facebook will exist in 2065 against 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.079
 what do you think 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.750
 still talking on facebook the social network 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.869
 can begin to trace the cursor of the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.880
 user mouse what in diesel motif 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.369
 of facebook told wall street 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.740
 journal that the social network is testing 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.170
 new ways of measuring the interest of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.450
 users in relation to the ads that are 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.420
 shown in timelines and one of these 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.340
 shapes is cursor tracking 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.380
 knowing which areas of the screen the cursor 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.270
 the more the facebook mouse can 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.579
 target ads exactly to 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.670
 for example those points android 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.470
 kitkat may not just be a partnership 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.659
 between google and nestlÃ© 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.150
 this is the conclusion of the samira reporter 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.340
 because it states that the system will 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.189
 bring various changes to the devices 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.530
 compatible with Android 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.020
 kitkat is aimed at smartphones of 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.659
 low cost and performance and also serves 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.210
 TVs and devices 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.040
 wearable as smart watches and 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.530
 Frete states that he had access to 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.479
 confidential documents with a list of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.360
 functions not yet leaked 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.070
 the system would be unifying would have mode 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.170
 full screen and provide economy 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.610
 during the transfer of data from a 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.489
 device to another 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.710
 android kitkat would also be optimized 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.050
 for step counter 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.420
 the actor of steps and also vector 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.520
 rotational magnetic gel or for 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.720
 people who engage in physical activity with 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.030
 the device 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.190
 detran makes an alert about 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.770

 some links for more information 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.970

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.460
 countless viruses 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.740

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.960
 are only sent to 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.550

 many of these messages used as 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.840
 baits just to spread viruses 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.360
