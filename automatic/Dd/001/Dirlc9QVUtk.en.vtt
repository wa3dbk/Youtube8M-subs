 good hair ironing at home 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.619
 Pay attention to the following 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.420
 once finished washing the hair 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.820
 with the absolute iris line that left 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.400
 the line for ironing protector 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.150
 enjoy caught we will use lis 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.150
 absolute 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:43.860
 This product will help us protect 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.860
 the hair of the iron or dryer 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.950
 allowing it to have a lot of finish 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.020
 smoother in Japanese style 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 to proceed to do a good ironing 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.980
 we need as a first point to remove 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.170
 the excess moisture that keeps the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.740
 hair and so let's proceed to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.740
 dry it 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.550
 Once the hair is dried, let's try the 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.400
 This hair is 100% dry that does not remain 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.050
 a minimum excess of humidity we light the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.540
 iron and we have to have a minimum 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.310
 of 300 whole degrees for what reason 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.770
 because if we go over 300 degrees 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.240
 we are going to tend to burn and mistreat the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.720
 hair 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.190
 we take layer layer and iron as 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.190
 minimum three times per strand 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.369
 then we continue doing the same 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.049
 procedure on all the hair up 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.049
 get a final result 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.150
 and we continue with the procedure of 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.010
 ironing we get catching the strand 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.320
 and we continue to raise the same 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.030
 way that I just indicated now if 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.590
 they want to vary a romantic look something 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.690
 differently make a difference too 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.280
 we can make some small waves like 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.480
 we are going to do it with we have a small 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.550
 we twist 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.580
 and let the iron slide through 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.710
 the hair and we get a new band and 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.710
 a new look something different 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.920
 and in that same procedure we can 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.920
 buy all the hair 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.470
 here the finished work a smooth 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.470
