00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.910 
but there's also the flipside of this
whole<00:03:26.070> stereotype<00:03:26.520> of<00:03:27.030> temper<00:03:27.810> then<00:03:28.620> there's

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
whole stereotype of temper then there's

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.000 
whole stereotype of temper then there's
also<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.910> think<00:03:29.970> more<00:03:30.360> than<00:03:30.960> average<00:03:31.530> warmth

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010
