00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.560
 That's why I have none, for example

 I also think the idea is pretty good 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:35.079
 because I have to say it's pretty 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.090
 hard to make a great smokie 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.379

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.280

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.650
 to give make-up as the very first 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.479
