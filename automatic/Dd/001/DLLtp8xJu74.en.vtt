 Sixth, it's not all that thin 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.430
 not just a very thin construction 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.079
 but also looks chic on the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.510
 Backside looks brushed 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.789

 eight gigabytes but you can expand 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.390
 thanks to a memory extension to 32 gb 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.880
 with a micro sd hc card the display 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.990
 4 7-inch diagonal is large resolves 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.840
 with high definition 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.630
 that's two 1280 pixels in height x 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.650
 720 pixels in the broad as I said that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.369
 it's 4.7 inches tall and it's an ips 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.659
 display based on a lcd course 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.759

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.670
 megapixel on the front page 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.409
 that means you can do high-resolution 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.570
 take pictures of yourself on the 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.560
 on the other hand, we have an 8 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.869
 megapixel camera 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.150
 I grab another device 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.259
 which is not that old what it is 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.119
 was also presented 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.460
 a few months ago the mobile 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.729
 world congress the sp2 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.390
 that has a 3 10 megapixel camera and 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.000
 But lte has so far what is net 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.520
 something faster, something better 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.460
 go but it is of course the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.329
 new top-of-the-line smartphone the p 6 es 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.970
 runs with android ios 4.2 point two the 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.390
 train is emotion in the ruhr in the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.200
 version 1 point 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.380
 the phone what you see in front of us 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.390
 easiest in the simplest methods 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.640
 variant 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.950
 huawei has no or no menu but 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.410
 everything is packed on the homescreen 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.630
 One then has one has the folder and 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.490
 of course his applications and 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.810
 Everything is stored here, so to speak 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.720
 can my menu from top to bottom 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.600
 short attitudes I have there 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.610
 and so basically it looks like two 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.980
 I have the effects here 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.120
 individualizing can therefore be specific 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.340
 can adjust me 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.650
 I hold on for a little longer 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.050
 Transitions and then I want ahead what I 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.910
 would like to have and what it looks 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.350
 Whole I have a good selection 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.630
 I just set it to box 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.140
 we are here once cylinder and you see 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.670
 something roundish thunder creek even more 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.930
 the camera application does not stop 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.850
 I look like her 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.160
 i have some effects in different 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.130
 modes i want out between front 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.780
 Of course, secondary camera also wants 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.519
 I take a photo or video of the trigger 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.829
 sleds shot picture and should the 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.720
 lightning fire yes and no or 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.570
 automatically that can decide here 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.400
 Otherwise what resolution what a 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.250
 Method would like to have the singles 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.079
 in the smart beauty high contrast panorama 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.410
 or even with real-time effects 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.019
 Choosing poets well, what can you do 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.549
 here everything shows the phone is 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.290
 of course a lot in the hand of the 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.090
 works fast also the graphic is 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.010
 Accordingly, we have their own 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.950
 taipeh on it because the factory 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.519
 supplied the sentry six values 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.220
 The ufop e costs 449 euros 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.040
 it in black and white in 23 colors 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.329
 they see here white and later pink 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.660
 for those who like it 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.920
 want 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.140
 I hope now a good overview 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.690
 get over huawei's smp 6 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.720
