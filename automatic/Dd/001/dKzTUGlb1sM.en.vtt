00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello I am looked noble and good here they 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.780
 I bring a basic tutorial on how to do 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.120
 its good alpha let's start with this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.850
 tutorial 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.040
 well here we are already on my computer 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.050
 and well the first thing we should do is 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.090
 go to the page where your alphaz is created 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.160
 which I will leave in the description of this 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.240
 video and as you will notice this is the page 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.240
 with your tools 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.320
 and if they mistakenly eliminate upwards, they do not 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.320
 worry they can make another one appear 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.960
 well what follows is to go to the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.440
 tool parts and hence change 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.440
 your 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.380
 well here you are ready now press 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.770
 the screen capture key that is 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.540
 good synthesis now we go to our 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.720
 photoshop I 'll leave a download link 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.460
 in the description of two versions are going to 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.890
 file to new and ok 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.690
 now type a control of it 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.000
 time then they go to the tool 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.000
 trimmed and selected only in guÃ¡rico 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.940
 now we use the magic eraser to 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.830
 remove the white if they only have the 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.830
 draft right click and selection 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.080
 in the good magical eraser here is your 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.060
 alpha can now save it where 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.590
 want but save it in png format 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.320
 since it allows transparencies 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.869
 and to put a face go to your folder 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.149
 of faces if they do not have one I'll leave a link 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.170
 in the description and good they put the 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.170
 face adjusting the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.360
 ready now save it in the png format 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.100
 and so they do successively until they have the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.789
 number of renders that you think 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.789
 enough 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.610
 well now let's how to make a wolf to 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.590
 personalized 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.750
 The first thing we must do to 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.150
 Our custom raft is cut out 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.820
 the hair that in our case is a walk 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.320
 fade link to trim it use the pen 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.320
 and go selecting the hair 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.480
 when they close the route they made 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.700
 with the mist click right create 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.620
 select and use the move tool 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.420
 to move the hair to the image of 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.010
 base golf I'll leave a link to 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.480
 download the golf based on the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.819
 description 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.069
 if it happens to them like me there is 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.349
 some strand of hair to spare like here 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.569
 that should go back only use the 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.000
 pen form a path with that hair of 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.860
 left click right create selection and with 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.750
 The rectangular frame tool make 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.660
 Right click and select layer via 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.700
 cut once done this select the 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.680
 layer of that strand of hair and put that 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.440
 layer back coat based wolf 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.390
 making it look better now 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.390
 small adjustments so that I stay better 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.980
 Now let's make the clothes first 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.780
 select the wolf layer based and 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.000
 use the magic eraser to erase 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.450
 some parts of the body and so paint 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.450
 clothes 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.140
 the next thing is to make the lines draw 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.790
 what is t-shirt belt and so on 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.560
 that select the pen and when 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.810
 finish some line click 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.940
 right and select contour plot 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.409
 this has been in the same layer as that of 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.409
 the same phase if they want 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.530
 ready once we finish with the clothes 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.210
 now we turn to the colors where they give 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.210
 life on the fly 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.380
 first we create a layer behind the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.380
 layer of the base of the spear 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.700
 then in our new layer we're going 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.410
 making a path with the pen and a 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.670
 once we finish let's click right 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.670
 and fill in a path 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.270
 ready and we keep doing this until 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.270
 let's finish with the whole body 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.940
 and here I finished painting everything 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.730
 good friends what happens if they do not like the 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.560
 hair as it is that does not fit 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.920
 you just have to do this thing that is 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.410
 simple 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.270
 and here you will see that I do not like how it is 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.730
 good hair what they have to do 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.530
 just create a new layer and in 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.930
 that layer use the pen to make a 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.000
 drawn with the lines that is we do 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.300
 the hair so to speak so that it is 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.300
 best 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.190
 and 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.770
 for me 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.660
 do not 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.180
 low 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.670
 and here is our raft ready 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.800
 my case is one of the inc if something came up 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.170
 ugly do not worry that with practice 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.100
 it will go very well as they say 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.100
