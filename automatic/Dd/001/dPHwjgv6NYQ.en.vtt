00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.790 
little tape close that up open this flap
I<00:02:30.550> guess<00:02:31.550> this<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.880> made<00:02:32.450> by<00:02:32.690> Mad<00:02:33.080> Catz<00:02:33.380> a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
I guess this is a made by Mad Catz a

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.890 
I guess this is a made by Mad Catz a
little<00:02:34.730> bit<00:02:34.880> there<00:02:38.590> alright<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.790> first<00:02:41.360> up<00:02:41.690> in

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
little bit there alright so first up in

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:50.980 
little bit there alright so first up in
the<00:02:42.050> top<00:02:42.470> we<00:02:42.800> have<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:47.210> user<00:02:47.990> manual<00:02:49.990> contents

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
the top we have the user manual contents

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.590 
the top we have the user manual contents
and<00:02:51.320> how<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.070> set<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.370> up<00:02:52.520> stuff<00:02:53.210> like<00:02:53.330> that

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
and how to set it up stuff like that

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.730 
and how to set it up stuff like that
against<00:02:58.750> here<00:02:59.750> we<00:02:59.870> had<00:02:59.960> an<00:03:00.080> asset<00:03:00.200> well<00:03:00.620> look

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
against here we had an asset well look

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.100 
against here we had an asset well look
at<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:00.980> second<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.900> then<00:03:03.350> we<00:03:03.470> have<00:03:04.870> USB<00:03:05.870> to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
micro-usb I guess that goes into the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.810 
micro-usb I guess that goes into the
adapter<00:03:09.470> into<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:09.980> speakers

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820
