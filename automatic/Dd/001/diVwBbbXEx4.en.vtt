00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.950
 yes even today I am indeed again 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.410
 warmly welcome to a further 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.690
 There are video from Kanal and today 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.790
 again a round black ops 2 this time 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.420
 a round team deathmatch on the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.740
 carrier with the a94 and you pull her 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.170
 just my very first tdm league mode 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 yes I once played with two people 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.050
 by charlie lady is my main 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.119
 clear though I am here now and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.179
 excellent cup actually makes the courage 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.460
 only in mp3s forget to change 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.230
 but half determined and then have two 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.460
 played by colleagues 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.890
 let a little league play 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.120
 I have to say that league owns only on 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.879
 first played where black ops for 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.710
 has come out but somehow it has 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.930
 I did not like it because of the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.489
 connection was really shit and 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.320
 the lobbies are always squeezed together and 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.059
 the game was scored as a defeat 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.829
 that was all still in the test phase 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.719
 in the beginning, as far as I can tell 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.780
 I already have it running 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.410
 better and there are several more 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.420
 songs that somehow do not know 23 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.040
 I do not know who among you 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.390
 someone should be active and know that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.210
 Can you write me a comment? 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.010
 I'm a bit ignorant now but I have to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.650
 also to say I have hardly so far 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.890
 black ops 2 played in league mode yes 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.450
 all first round tdm and it ran on 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.450
 beginning quite well in the beginning because I have 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.130
 a bit happened and so bad 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.509
 because then you also see gameplay where 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.880
 not necessarily her opponents 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.140
 wash it is I can already ahead 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.090
 say 127 to eight so a little more 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.100
 leave as three cars 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.799
 To the parks like bulletproof vest 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.540
 toughness and tactics mask have played 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.049
 I with blackbird without controller as 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.119
 my yes standard killstreaks to the league 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.170
 Mode can say too big I have now 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.600
 quite often a video of it 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.340
 seen at a cookies which he plays 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.880
 sort of clear his tea or something 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.130
 quite active because somehow there are synonymous 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.740
 master league and silver bronze and what 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.540
 is not everything 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.270
 yes it is not so for me because no 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.380
 Lex 2 is talking to me now about the area 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.020
 not so much 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.420
 So I prefer to play m3 with port 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.649
 If you had something like that long ago I introduced 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.590
 think it was not so bad 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.360
 been 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.580
 for the people do not know what pro mod 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.340
 is something is still a pc and give 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.830
 just on youtube cod promote 1 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.680
 then videos should come to cod 4 or 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.420
 top4 at that time was my time 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.769
 opinion was at that time the first promo 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.489
 cd 4 presented 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:33.250
 then there is also a mw2 in black ops 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.310
 1 and yes a mp3 black ops 2 was there 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.709
 no it a bit a pity now 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.970
 think then sport area still 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.099
 was slightly larger 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.840
 but let's just hope that 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.819
 it is changed in size in call of duty 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.829
 also something to the league mode which was not too 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.239
 say yes, I'm holding somehow normal 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.220
 tempo played West 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.980
 There were no big ones for me now 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.890
 Differences of the opponent I do not know 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.110
 what you are looking for against me by now 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.760
 and destroy plays or becomes position 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.739
 also like to play like me 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.890
 got and then somehow clear 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.629
 the game is of course something 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.670
 more demanding and there you go 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.290
 For example, even out negatively to 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.540
 win or over and over again with 1 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.950
 cad where the kde and all yes some 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.620
 Shit is he is actually 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.519
 mainly for winning 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.079
 and now you could leave the comment 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.060
 if you already write a bit 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.730
 have gained experience in league mode 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.190
 and how it liked so well 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.139
 the league has to actively play the game 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.480
 is not for me now because I am yes 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.160
 I can not do it alone or mine 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.500
 Clear teenagers prefer to play something 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.880
 other things can be different 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.590
 give opportunities why I am now 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.000
 squats or why not so as I said 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.290
 if I'm just like that I'm playing 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.450
 generally little black ops 2 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.840
 and if the player formation cotton 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.849
 I do not play public alone either 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.720
 I did a little bit but 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.690
 I also have this one 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.680
 grafikkarten bench overlooking two 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.950
 could not fix it yet but 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.209
 actually relatively no matter 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.319
 and yes, what is there to say 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.049
 actually nothing more 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.549
 I'll think that tomorrow 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.709
 second game upload the worlds 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.530
 move what is to tell gameplay 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.540
 also very interesting and yes of mine 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.010
 side ago what first a few 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.730
 Suggestions should have for a few 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.620
 comments topic so now 78 go 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.039
 that's how you like me the band 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.390
 Write or somehow the comments 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.960
 and yes I let that end slowly 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.120
 the gameplay as I said 27 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.590
 Eight the best but also very good 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.360
 for you to see that is with me 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.400
 also does not always run perfectly because he 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.430
 many somehow think of an asiate or 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.300
 a solution or so they only do 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.750
 Highscore game lets it's not that 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.270
 case 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.490
 I also say the good subscribers 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.930
 have their bad rounds and that 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.380
 say goodbye and say hello to you 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.380
 next time
