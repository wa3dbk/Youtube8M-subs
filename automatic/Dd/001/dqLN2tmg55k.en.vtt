00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:20.900
 last time we learned how to spiral 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:23.750
 knitting with beads but beaded harnesses from 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.439
 small beads knit a little differently 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.450
 and 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:32.060
 this is a more complicated method first 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:37.880
 we knit the first loop of the air 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:41.450
 chains and tighten and and then post 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.289
 on the right one bead and 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:49.430
 knit air loop so repeat yet 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.870
 four to five times if we want our 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.710
 the year was thicker 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.910
 then a larger amount is used 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.780
 beads 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.829
 and if we want the harness to be thinner then 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.050
 then enough 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:08.980
 5 beads I'll show on 5 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.980
 koch beads 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.130
 and here is the first row ready and now 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.640
 you need to connect it for this 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:30.210
 place the beads as a ringlet and 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.240
 connect the first and last loop 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.140
 this is done this way the hook 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.950
 is introduced 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:44.430
 for beads thread should be on top 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:50.600
 the beads are then grabbed by the worker 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:55.710
 thread and knit loop then 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:00.899
 we place on the right a bead and we knit 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:06.140
 two loops together next knitting 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:10.320
 repeats just the same for the beads on the left 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:14.780
 a hook is inserted the working thread lies 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:19.400
 over the beads and grab the working thread 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:25.680
 pull out the loop and two loops on the hook 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:29.750
 now move one bead to the right and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.780
 Behind the bead we grab a working thread and 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.340
 provyazyvaem loop thereby bead 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.400
 turns out to be inside a single crochet and 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.780
 just as all other provyazyvayutsya 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.420
 the rows of hook is first found on the left 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.709
 hand bead 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.590
 thread should lie on top of the bead 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:03:00.350
 previous row then grab 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:04.019
 working thread stretch the loop 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.630
 push the bead and behind the bead 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:11.609
 grab the thread and drag 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:14.910
 two loops and so knit until 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:18.370
 harness will not be necessary Elena 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.580
 here I already knitted a few rows and 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.570
 You may notice that this option 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.790
 harness 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:30.520
 beads fit more closely to 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.340
 surface knitting and it looks more 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:38.590
 accurately and more densely 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:41.070
 and this version of the harness is made of fine 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.070
 beads 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.860
 connections 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.780
