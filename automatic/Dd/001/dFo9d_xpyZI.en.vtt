00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
tracks to where I take that same

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.770 
tracks to where I take that same
instrument<00:02:42.350> with<00:02:42.710> a<00:02:42.740> voice<00:02:43.220> count<00:02:43.580> over<00:02:43.850> it<00:02:43.970> so

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
and when you can kind of play around

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.060 
and when you can kind of play around
with<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.840> music<00:03:39.140> with<00:03:39.260> your<00:03:39.410> feet<00:03:39.620> with<00:03:39.920> your

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
by doing different if you choose to do

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.840 
by doing different if you choose to do
body<00:03:42.590> isolations<00:03:42.830> or<00:03:43.370> different<00:03:43.670> type<00:03:43.820> of

body isolations or different type of
movements<00:03:44.300> as<00:03:45.260> opposed<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.680> just<00:03:45.830> doing<00:03:45.890> your

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
movements as opposed to just doing your

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.820 
movements as opposed to just doing your
basic<00:03:46.370> step<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.450> whole<00:03:47.600> song<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.110> how<00:03:48.770> you

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
basic step the whole song and how you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.380 
basic step the whole song and how you
can<00:03:49.010> be<00:03:49.100> more<00:03:49.250> creative<00:03:49.459> as<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.850> dancer<00:03:50.209> on<00:03:50.300> the

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
can be more creative as a dancer on the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.330 
can be more creative as a dancer on the
dance<00:03:50.570> floor<00:03:50.660> because<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.770> understand<00:03:52.190> it

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
dance floor because you understand it

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.740 
dance floor because you understand it
you<00:03:52.820> understand<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.270> music
