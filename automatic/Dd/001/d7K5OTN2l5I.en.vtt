00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.340
 Hello, how are you today? 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.070
 for the hair today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.710
 do this natural wave without needing 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.780
 plates or custard or anything that 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.840
 give warmth to hair, we're just going to 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:26.010
 use some socks some socks 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.470
 well executive type laguitos 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.900
 and well, this would be done in the hair 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.080
 with the hair a little bit a little 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.850
 wet when it is about to dry 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.920
 because coriander we already talk with the hair 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.750
 wet would not finish drying and the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.910
 true that we would damage our hair 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.140
 so, nothing, I'm going to show you how 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.140
 I do 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:00.720
 first let's comb it well so that 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.490
 there is no merit out of place 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.390
 and so that the curl is much more 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.680
 beautiful 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.590
 let's open it in half 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.610
 we will separate 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.780
 in 2 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.780
 and pain we will do 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.850
 once everything is fine peinadito 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.170
 let's separate it into two 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.120
 we will take more or less above the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.420
 ear 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:35.500
 and we will leave as you see 22 meters 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.500
 well with 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.680
 the top part we're going to start 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.680
 roll up 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.430
 we will take one of the socks 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.499
 if you see it well a 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.930
 I'm going to roll first the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.360
 together 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.640
 because as I have the hair layered not 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.940
 I want to make no point 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.420
 out because 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.050
 it would be very ugly 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.190
 let's go putting them right 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.190
 winding up 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.860
 we make a knot and this would be such that 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.980
 so in the other I would do the same 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.140
 we would do well 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.760
 how is the little hair still a little 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.980
 humid because the truth is that it is going to 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.049
 look great we would take another sock 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.140
 and we would do the same in rhode we would do what 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:43.190
 which is first the boards and once 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.810
 they are rolled up then all up 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.290
 we would do it 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.769
 and once we have it right up 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.769
 we would do 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.720
 but 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.380
 let's do the same with the other side 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.740
 dance well 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.250
 we have the little finger 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.250
 ear 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.500
 we also separate the best 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.470
 the tips as we have done before 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.599
 and we are going to go rolling up and 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.599
 when we have it well up 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.110
 same with the one below 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.900
 of you 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.349
 we have a couple of turns first the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.349
 tips 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.200
 what are you painting 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.600
 Well, one time, we would go to 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.500
 sleep and the next day it would be 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.739
 a very nice curl if we hurry with 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.730
 a dryer with diffuser and also 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.730
 it would be pretty good 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.820
 well then after having slept all 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:38.000
 the night with the socks on and 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.290
 check that they are well dry well 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.290
 we will apply them 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:52.890
 I do not know if you appreciate 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.890
 that the wave has already been very marked 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.210
 the truth that this trick I like 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.650
 do a lot especially in the afternoon 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.569
 when you get in the shower or 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.490
 quietly 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.349
 and when you have your hair still a 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.659
 a little bit wet that is 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.659
 point to dry then it's time for 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.810
 and so on the next day, I do not have to 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.210
 be worrying about my hair because 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.370
 the truth is that it stays in super curl 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.900
 nice and super natural 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.600
 and I learned it 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.210
 Well, what remains is a wave that seems 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.260
 it seems mine the only thing we would have to 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.570
 to do would be 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.050
 pass your fingers a little to open it a 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.050
 bit 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:42.089
 and if you want, you can apply 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:46.110
 a little lacquer even so that the 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:48.839
 wave is a little more fixed before 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.759
 roll the socks you could apply 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.889
 a little bit of foam I really know 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.679
 I do not like throw me and my foam or 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:59.309
 lacquer so that the wave appears 

00:05:55.679 --> 00:06:02.100
 little bit more natural I do not know if from behind 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:05.480
 the truth is that 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.480
 I do not know if later but you can appreciate 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.849
 to a very very pretty 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.910
 I encourage you to 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:20.280
 who make it and if the truth is that it is 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.980
 very easy you have seen 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.590
 easy to do nothing and up to date 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.400
 next, you do not have to be 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:32.190
 worrying about the dog nor do I do 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.720
 plates exceeded the tongs as well 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.480
 that you have a natural wave 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.330
 Come up fast 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.090
 so nothing if you liked it already 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.820
 you know thumbs up subscribe to me
