skin<00:02:17.870> back<00:02:18.080> too<00:02:18.320> far<00:02:18.560> because<00:02:18.800> then<00:02:19.190> it'll

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
skin back too far because then it'll

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.370 
skin back too far because then it'll
warp<00:02:19.880> what<00:02:20.330> your<00:02:20.480> wing<00:02:20.630> actually<00:02:21.020> looks<00:02:21.230> like

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
making a general outline a line that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.720 
making a general outline a line that
leads<00:02:23.870> directly<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.709> where<00:02:25.010> your<00:02:25.310> eyeliner

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
leads directly to where your eyeliner

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.229 
leads directly to where your eyeliner
already<00:02:26.269> is<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:27.050> straight<00:02:27.440> line<00:02:28.030> then<00:02:29.030> once

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
already is in a straight line then once

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.030 
already is in a straight line then once
you<00:02:29.360> have<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.780> straight<00:02:30.110> top<00:02:30.350> line<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.860> can

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
you have that straight top line you can

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.740 
you have that straight top line you can
form<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.640> wing<00:02:31.790> itself

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.759 

after<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.810> get<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.049> general<00:02:40.200> shape<00:02:40.409> down

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
after I get the general shape down

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.319 
after I get the general shape down
that's<00:02:41.069> when<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.310> go<00:02:41.609> back<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.030> make
