00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.200
 Haiku history is 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.630
 I understand that the effect is on that drink 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.730
 Please 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.609
 To drink today's 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:14.219
 It is a US classic shell but not Coca-Cola 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.269
 It is Pepsi Nex 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.269
 Yes, about zero calories 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.380
 It is called a correction sentence 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.499
 rain 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.499
 It is the raw material name 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.180
 Cameroon should be several weeks ahead 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.930
 What can I do and I have not read it so often 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.040
 Though 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.250
 Big 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.250
 In terms of suntory sun 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.800
 diet 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.370
 I want you to follow the traffic rules, I used to 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.580
 I have made deposits but I think so 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.310
 It should have been cheaper than such a little Coca-Cola 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.470
 you know 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.120
 Well that horse but in detail 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.770
 I'm 184 people who are stuck with the escape 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.159
 Ne 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.159
 I think that's what it is 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.530
 The feeling that the taste read a long time ago is a very good thing 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.620
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.620
 I would like to receive 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.950
 here we go 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.950
 What do you mean 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.650
 After all it is said that there is not enough 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.700
 It is three o'clock 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.080
 The balance between Kansai University and Tokyo Lease spreads out 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.330
 but 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
 Man 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.650
 I say that you do not want to eat something that is not sweet printed 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.140
 Though expression of is strange 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.630
 Still feels a little sweet 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.400
 But do 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.029
 That there are only zero calories 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.999
 I think after the end 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.679
 Make energy 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.419
 Because it means that 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.159
 Those who are dieting for a while 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.119
 U.S. City has a code name easy drink 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.119
 I think other 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.090
 Good coffee 6 days took place but it is normal 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.090
 You may like Pepsi Cola 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.999
 I think that is the way but I would like you to scrutinize
