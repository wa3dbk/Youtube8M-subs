00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
of it every day okay so that's about it

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.049 
of it every day okay so that's about it
that's<00:00:36.929> all<00:00:37.109> I<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.710> don't<00:00:38.429> mean<00:00:38.699> that's<00:00:38.879> all

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
that's all I do I don't mean that's all

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.939 
that's all I do I don't mean that's all
I<00:00:39.089> do<00:00:39.269> I<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.629> more<00:00:39.870> independent<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.620> out<00:00:40.769> like

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
I do I have more independent go out like

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.790 
I do I have more independent go out like
this<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:42.389> I<00:00:42.420> think<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.809> brown<00:00:43.050> powder<00:00:43.319> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
this so then I think a brown powder and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.879 
this so then I think a brown powder and
I'm<00:00:44.579> still<00:00:45.089> using<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:46.019> is<00:00:46.199> from<00:00:46.499> all<00:00:46.679> May

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:52.969 
it's their intense eye color powder
shadow<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.479> I<00:00:51.870> still<00:00:52.199> use<00:00:52.229> this<00:00:52.589> brown<00:00:52.949> color

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
shadow and I still use this brown color

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.250 
shadow and I still use this brown color
I'm<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.549> sure<00:00:53.879> why<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.389> works<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.109> well

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
I'm not sure why it just works so well

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.410 
I'm not sure why it just works so well
for<00:00:55.589> me<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.889> then<00:00:56.249> I<00:00:56.339> just<00:00:56.519> take<00:00:56.760> an<00:00:57.030> angled

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
for me and then I just take an angled

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.340 
for me and then I just take an angled
brush<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.019> go<00:00:58.170> into<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.559> powder<00:00:58.829> and<00:01:00.350> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
brush and I go into the powder and the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.000 
brush and I go into the powder and the
first<00:01:01.589> thing<00:01:01.769> I<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:03.359> start<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:04.409> there

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
first thing I do is I start right there

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.000 
first thing I do is I start right there
and<00:01:06.000> fill<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.630> okay<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.590> like

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and fill in it's okay if you have like

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.620 
and fill in it's okay if you have like
shaking<00:01:08.640> hands<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.940> you<00:01:09.030> can't<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> where

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
shaking hands and you can't get it where

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
shaking hands and you can't get it where
you<00:01:09.690> want<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> trick

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you want it to because I have a trick

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.810 
you want it to because I have a trick
that<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.940> can<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:13.260> help<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.490> make<00:01:14.640> them

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
that you can do to help to make them

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.810 
that you can do to help to make them
more<00:01:15.030> exactly<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> way<00:01:16.260> you<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.620> them<00:01:16.800> so<00:01:17.040> if

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
more exactly the way you want them so if

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.250 
more exactly the way you want them so if
you<00:01:17.910> make<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> too<00:01:18.360> high<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:19.140> ciggies

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
you make it too high to ciggies

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.040 
you make it too high to ciggies
and<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:21.130> fill<00:01:21.310> in<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.520> middle<00:01:21.670> first<00:01:21.940> and<00:01:22.360> then

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
and I fill in the middle first and then

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.170 
and I fill in the middle first and then
whatever<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.500> left<00:01:23.560> I<00:01:24.100> kind<00:01:24.550> of<00:01:24.640> flung<00:01:24.910> this

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
whatever is left I kind of flung this

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.790 
whatever is left I kind of flung this
guy<00:01:25.420> right<00:01:25.720> here<00:01:25.750> just<00:01:26.080> a<00:01:26.230> little<00:01:26.380> bit<00:01:26.530> but<00:01:26.770> I

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
guy right here just a little bit but I

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.380 
guy right here just a little bit but I
never<00:01:27.040> actually<00:01:27.310> fill<00:01:27.790> in<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.000> little<00:01:28.150> thing

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
never actually fill in the little thing

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.410 
never actually fill in the little thing
because<00:01:28.480> then<00:01:28.690> it<00:01:28.780> just<00:01:28.930> looks<00:01:29.110> too<00:01:29.410> filled<00:01:30.160> in

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
because then it just looks too filled in

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.030 
because then it just looks too filled in
so<00:01:31.420> then<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:31.750> started<00:01:32.080> working<00:01:32.260> on<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.860> arch

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
so then I started working on the arch

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.720 
so then I started working on the arch
area<00:01:33.870> and<00:01:34.870> then<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:37.150> that<00:01:37.570> part<00:01:37.780> going<00:01:37.990> down

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
area and then on that part going down

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.120 
area and then on that part going down
and<00:01:39.730> I<00:01:40.390> do<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.720> same<00:01:40.750> thing<00:01:41.350> for<00:01:41.740> my<00:01:42.010> other

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
and I do the same thing for my other

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.110 
and I do the same thing for my other
eyebrow<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:44.500> this<00:01:45.250> doesn't<00:01:45.790> take<00:01:45.940> me

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
eyebrow and really this doesn't take me

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.440 
eyebrow and really this doesn't take me
long<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.860> that's<00:01:48.580> nice<00:01:50.940> but<00:01:51.940> probably<00:01:52.330> only

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
long so that's nice but probably only

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.850 
long so that's nice but probably only
takes<00:01:52.720> in<00:01:52.900> like<00:01:53.080> three<00:01:53.380> minutes<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:53.770> the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
takes in like three minutes in the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.130 
takes in like three minutes in the
morning<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.340> I've<00:01:54.400> done<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.780> since<00:01:55.990> I'm

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
morning and I've done but since I'm

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.719 
morning and I've done but since I'm
explaining<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.800> it<00:01:56.920> might<00:01:57.040> take<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.310> little<00:01:57.490> bit

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
explaining it it might take a little bit

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.969 
explaining it it might take a little bit
longer<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.960> as<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.470> can<00:01:59.620> tell<00:01:59.800> they're

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
longer and as you can tell they're

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.920 
longer and as you can tell they're

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
I want them and you could do it

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.490 
I want them and you could do it
underneath<00:02:33.150> as<00:02:33.330> well<00:02:33.629> if<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.110> haven't<00:02:34.410> done

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
underneath as well if you haven't done

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.289 
underneath as well if you haven't done
your<00:02:34.650> eye<00:02:34.709> shadow<00:02:34.890> or<00:02:35.069> any<00:02:35.190> buyer<00:02:35.400> yeah<00:02:35.670> and
