00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
not think it's really overpowered

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.479 
not think it's really overpowered
compared<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.500> other<00:02:19.620> assault<00:02:20.160> workers<00:02:20.370> in

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
compared to the other assault workers in

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.930 
compared to the other assault workers in
this<00:02:20.580> game<00:02:21.830> it's<00:02:22.830> not<00:02:23.130> always<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.489> one<00:02:23.730> bus

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
this game it's not always the one bus

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.180 
this game it's not always the one bus
kill<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.380> like<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.770> guns<00:02:25.950> at<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
kill and the like the guns at the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.030 
kill and the like the guns at the
scarlet<00:02:26.670> are<00:02:26.850> normally<00:02:27.319> two<00:02:28.319> short<00:02:28.650> two<00:02:28.860> or

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
scarlet are normally two short two or

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.100 
scarlet are normally two short two or
three<00:02:29.190> shot<00:02:29.400> kills<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:30.209> automatically<00:02:30.810> with

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
three shot kills but automatically with

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.470 
three shot kills but automatically with
something<00:02:31.350> power<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.610> think<00:02:32.760> those<00:02:33.090> guns<00:02:33.360> a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480
