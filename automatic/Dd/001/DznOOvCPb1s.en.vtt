it right here the rain will come out at
a<00:02:34.470> 45<00:02:34.709> degree<00:02:35.129> angle<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.670> then<00:02:36.030> that's<00:02:36.269> how

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
a 45 degree angle and then that's how

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.020 
a 45 degree angle and then that's how
you<00:02:36.450> remove<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.079> now<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:38.010> put<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.310> RAM<00:02:38.549> back<00:02:38.849> in

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
you remove it now to put the RAM back in

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.180 
you remove it now to put the RAM back in
there<00:02:39.239> you're<00:02:39.780> gonna<00:02:39.930> put<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.470> back<00:02:40.500> on<00:02:40.890> the

there you're gonna put it back on the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.490 
there you're gonna put it back on the
same<00:02:41.400> before<00:02:42.030> t<00:02:42.150> 5<00:02:42.299> degree<00:02:42.659> angle<00:02:43.079> and<00:02:43.260> make

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
same before t 5 degree angle and make

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.770 
same before t 5 degree angle and make
sure<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.859> sockets<00:02:44.310> are<00:02:44.459> matched<00:02:45.239> up<00:02:45.480> as<00:02:45.629> you

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
stick in there and then I'm gonna do the

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.670 
stick in there and then I'm gonna do the
same<00:03:32.160> way<00:03:32.370> by<00:03:32.790> installing<00:03:33.569> it<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.930> once

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
same way by installing it and once

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.800 
same way by installing it and once
you're<00:03:34.859> done<00:03:35.040> with<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:35.609> then<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.449> just<00:03:36.660> want

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.009 
actually a new battery if you guys saw
it<00:04:14.879> there<00:04:15.030> from<00:04:15.120> model<00:04:15.449> at<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.599> beginning

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
it there from model at the beginning

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.839 
it there from model at the beginning
that<00:04:16.199> was<00:04:16.349> the<00:04:16.500> old<00:04:16.650> battery<00:04:17.099> this<00:04:17.609> one's

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
that was the old battery this one's

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.520 
that was the old battery this one's
newer<00:04:18.120> because<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.599> other<00:04:18.720> one<00:04:18.900> was<00:04:18.930> depleted

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
before I put into Windows I'm gonna go

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.270 
before I put into Windows I'm gonna go
into<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.900> BIOS<00:04:28.290> on<00:04:28.440> my<00:04:28.530> computer<00:04:28.920> just<00:04:29.070> to

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
into the BIOS on my computer just to

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.000 
into the BIOS on my computer just to
make<00:04:29.490> sure<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.600> RAM<00:04:30.810> is<00:04:31.080> recognized<00:04:31.740> and

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
make sure that the RAM is recognized and

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.790 
make sure that the RAM is recognized and
normally<00:04:32.550> it'd<00:04:32.700> be<00:04:32.850> like<00:04:32.970> f2<00:04:33.480> f10<00:04:33.990> 11<00:04:34.620> the

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
normally it'd be like f2 f10 11 the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.070 
normally it'd be like f2 f10 11 the
delete<00:04:35.160> button<00:04:35.190> whatever<00:04:35.700> you<00:04:36.660> know<00:04:36.810> it'll

everything and as you can see I got four

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.680 
everything and as you can see I got four
gigabytes<00:04:59.040> of<00:04:59.190> RAM<00:04:59.490> installed<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.300> for<00:05:00.660> a

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
gigabytes of RAM installed and for a

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.810 
gigabytes of RAM installed and for a
closer<00:05:00.930> look<00:05:01.260> four<00:05:01.650> gigabytes<00:05:02.100> of<00:05:02.250> RAM<00:05:02.490> and

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
closer look four gigabytes of RAM and

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.060 
closer look four gigabytes of RAM and
there<00:05:03.600> you<00:05:03.810> go<00:05:03.990> that's<00:05:04.320> how<00:05:04.500> you<00:05:04.560> install<00:05:04.860> the

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
there you go that's how you install the

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.520 
there you go that's how you install the
RAM<00:05:05.220> so<00:05:05.640> as<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.150> can<00:05:06.240> see<00:05:06.300> installing<00:05:07.290> ram

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
RAM so as you can see installing ram

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.880 
RAM so as you can see installing ram
into<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:08.010> Acer<00:05:08.430> Aspire<00:05:08.750> 47:32<00:05:09.750> z<00:05:09.930> was<00:05:10.260> not<00:05:10.590> bad

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
into the Acer Aspire 47:32 z was not bad

and the same for a desktop subset that
the<00:05:19.410> room<00:05:19.590> for<00:05:19.770> desktops<00:05:20.280> are<00:05:20.550> no<00:05:21.000> longer<00:05:21.390> and

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
the room for desktops are no longer and

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.440 
the room for desktops are no longer and
you<00:05:22.320> have<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.740> older<00:05:23.220> Mac<00:05:23.490> Pro's<00:05:23.910> instead<00:05:24.360> of

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
you have the older Mac Pro's instead of

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.410 
you have the older Mac Pro's instead of
the<00:05:24.540> cylinder<00:05:25.080> design<00:05:25.800> then<00:05:26.580> obviously<00:05:26.940> those

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
the cylinder design then obviously those

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.630 
the cylinder design then obviously those
RAM<00:05:27.780> sticks<00:05:28.080> are<00:05:28.230> much<00:05:28.440> bigger<00:05:28.740> than<00:05:29.070> a<00:05:29.280> normal

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
RAM sticks are much bigger than a normal

RAM sticks are much bigger than a normal
PC<00:05:30.120> now<00:05:30.810> as<00:05:31.440> you<00:05:31.770> saw<00:05:31.980> in<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:32.190> video<00:05:32.310> it<00:05:32.640> said

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
PC now as you saw in the video it said

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.000 
PC now as you saw in the video it said
four<00:05:33.150> gigabytes<00:05:33.600> of<00:05:33.720> RAM<00:05:33.960> and<00:05:34.200> I<00:05:34.530> did<00:05:34.740> see<00:05:34.980> that

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
four gigabytes of RAM and I did see that

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.070 
four gigabytes of RAM and I did see that
this<00:05:35.310> computer<00:05:35.640> can't<00:05:36.060> go<00:05:36.240> Ottomans<00:05:36.720> four

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
this computer can't go Ottomans four

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.340 
this computer can't go Ottomans four
gigabytes<00:05:37.530> of<00:05:37.650> RAM<00:05:37.890> but<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:39.210> was<00:05:39.720> wondering<00:05:40.170> how

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
gigabytes of RAM but I was wondering how

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.380 
gigabytes of RAM but I was wondering how
come<00:05:40.590> it<00:05:40.800> said<00:05:41.190> only<00:05:41.400> two<00:05:41.820> point<00:05:42.180> nine<00:05:42.360> three

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
come it said only two point nine three

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.870 
come it said only two point nine three
gigabytes<00:05:43.020> was<00:05:43.410> usable<00:05:43.890> and<00:05:44.250> you<00:05:44.490> guys<00:05:44.670> saw

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
gigabytes was usable and you guys saw

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.820 
gigabytes was usable and you guys saw
that<00:05:44.910> in<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:45.240> club<00:05:45.480> and<00:05:45.750> as<00:05:46.230> I<00:05:46.500> kept<00:05:46.710> doing

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
that in the club and as I kept doing

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.460 
that in the club and as I kept doing
research<00:05:46.980> but<00:05:47.880> it<00:05:48.090> was<00:05:48.360> saying<00:05:48.690> oh<00:05:48.930> that's<00:05:49.320> a

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
research but it was saying oh that's a

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.440 
research but it was saying oh that's a
32-bit<00:05:50.100> operating<00:05:50.370> system<00:05:51.000> for<00:05:51.300> Windows

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
32-bit operating system for Windows

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.930 
32-bit operating system for Windows
seven<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:52.200> so<00:05:52.950> you're<00:05:53.280> gonna<00:05:53.460> get<00:05:53.670> that<00:05:53.730> no

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
seven and so you're gonna get that no

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.970 
seven and so you're gonna get that no
matter<00:05:54.120> what<00:05:54.450> but<00:05:54.720> I<00:05:54.900> find<00:05:55.320> that<00:05:55.500> kind<00:05:55.800> of<00:05:55.920> hard

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
matter what but I find that kind of hard

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.070 
matter what but I find that kind of hard
to<00:05:56.310> believe<00:05:56.610> because<00:05:56.970> I<00:05:57.120> also<00:05:57.360> have<00:05:57.750> other

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
to believe because I also have other

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.860 
to believe because I also have other
32-bit<00:05:58.800> machines<00:05:59.190> in<00:05:59.400> the<00:05:59.490> house<00:05:59.670> and<00:06:00.000> they

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
32-bit machines in the house and they

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.470 
32-bit machines in the house and they
have<00:06:01.440> Windows<00:06:01.860> 7<00:06:02.220> on<00:06:02.310> it<00:06:02.520> and<00:06:02.700> it<00:06:03.060> recognized

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
have Windows 7 on it and it recognized

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.270 
have Windows 7 on it and it recognized
the<00:06:03.600> full<00:06:03.840> give<00:06:04.020> you<00:06:04.140> the<00:06:04.680> full<00:06:04.920> four

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
the full give you the full four

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.690 
the full give you the full four
gigabytes<00:06:05.700> of<00:06:05.820> RAM<00:06:06.050> so<00:06:07.050> I'm<00:06:07.530> not<00:06:07.800> sure<00:06:08.040> why<00:06:08.640> is

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
gigabytes of RAM so I'm not sure why is

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.040 
gigabytes of RAM so I'm not sure why is
this<00:06:09.090> 2.93

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
this 2.93

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.140 
this 2.93
thing<00:06:10.380> gigabytes<00:06:10.800> usable<00:06:11.190> but<00:06:11.370> it<00:06:11.550> did<00:06:11.730> say<00:06:11.880> 4

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
thing gigabytes usable but it did say 4

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.330 
thing gigabytes usable but it did say 4
gigabytes<00:06:12.600> of<00:06:12.690> RAM<00:06:12.930> however<00:06:13.590> I'm<00:06:13.800> still<00:06:13.830> doing

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
gigabytes of RAM however I'm still doing

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.730 
gigabytes of RAM however I'm still doing
more<00:06:14.520> research<00:06:14.670> on<00:06:15.030> this<00:06:15.180> so<00:06:15.540> the<00:06:16.320> for<00:06:16.620> the

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
more research on this so the for the

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.580 
more research on this so the for the
reasoning<00:06:17.130> behind<00:06:17.250> that<00:06:17.640> I'm<00:06:17.790> still<00:06:18.300> unsure

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
reasoning behind that I'm still unsure

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.290 
reasoning behind that I'm still unsure
at<00:06:19.590> the<00:06:19.770> time<00:06:20.040> and<00:06:20.400> this<00:06:20.700> is<00:06:20.760> being<00:06:21.120> recorded

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
at the time and this is being recorded

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.970 
at the time and this is being recorded
and<00:06:21.810> I'm<00:06:21.930> still<00:06:22.200> gonna<00:06:22.290> do<00:06:22.470> more<00:06:22.620> research

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
and I'm still gonna do more research

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.630 
and I'm still gonna do more research
about<00:06:23.100> it<00:06:23.490> I'm<00:06:23.700> thinking<00:06:24.570> maybe<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.500> rest<00:06:26.490> of

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
about it I'm thinking maybe the rest of

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.240 
about it I'm thinking maybe the rest of
the<00:06:26.730> memory<00:06:27.120> was<00:06:27.300> used<00:06:27.660> for<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.680> video<00:06:28.980> card

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
the memory was used for the video card

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.790 
the memory was used for the video card
or<00:06:29.370> something<00:06:29.790> which<00:06:30.000> I<00:06:30.240> don't<00:06:30.990> believe<00:06:31.770> so

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
or something which I don't believe so

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.700 
or something which I don't believe so
maybe<00:06:32.490> it<00:06:32.880> would<00:06:33.210> it<00:06:33.780> would<00:06:33.990> have<00:06:34.140> specified

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
maybe it would it would have specified

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.980 
maybe it would it would have specified
that<00:06:35.070> because<00:06:35.730> before<00:06:36.210> when<00:06:36.419> I<00:06:36.480> had<00:06:36.750> 2

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
that because before when I had 2

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.080 
that because before when I had 2
gigabytes<00:06:37.470> of<00:06:37.590> RAM<00:06:37.800> it<00:06:38.010> automatically<00:06:38.760> read

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
gigabytes of RAM it automatically read

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.390 
gigabytes of RAM it automatically read
as<00:06:39.270> two<00:06:39.449> full<00:06:39.720> two<00:06:39.990> gigs<00:06:40.380> and<00:06:40.620> then<00:06:40.680> with<00:06:41.010> the<00:06:41.130> 4

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
as two full two gigs and then with the 4

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.640 
as two full two gigs and then with the 4
gigabyte<00:06:41.550> I<00:06:42.120> don't<00:06:42.480> know<00:06:42.570> what's<00:06:42.810> going<00:06:43.139> on<00:06:43.260> so

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
gigabyte I don't know what's going on so

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.250 
gigabyte I don't know what's going on so
I'm<00:06:44.280> gonna<00:06:44.490> have<00:06:44.910> to<00:06:45.090> check<00:06:45.389> into<00:06:45.600> that<00:06:45.900> more

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260
