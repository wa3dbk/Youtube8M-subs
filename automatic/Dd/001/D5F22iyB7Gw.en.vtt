00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
leaving YouTube this is not a correct

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.719 
leaving YouTube this is not a correct
interpretation<00:02:05.679> of<00:02:06.679> that<00:02:06.920> video<00:02:07.099> I<00:02:07.280> can<00:02:07.580> see

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
interpretation of that video I can see

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.130 
interpretation of that video I can see
how<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:08.330> can<00:02:08.539> make<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.810> mistake<00:02:09.310> but<00:02:11.140> but

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
how you can make the mistake but but

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.040 
how you can make the mistake but but
that's<00:02:12.260> not<00:02:12.470> what<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.650> was<00:02:13.360> going<00:02:14.360> for<00:02:14.510> there

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
that's not what I was going for there

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.170 
that's not what I was going for there
and<00:02:15.349> maybe<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.830> can<00:02:16.010> go<00:02:16.190> back<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.700> look<00:02:16.910> at<00:02:17.060> it

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
and maybe you can go back and look at it

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.839 
and maybe you can go back and look at it
again<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.720> bear<00:02:17.989> in<00:02:18.080> mind<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.250> solution

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
again and bear in mind that the solution

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.720 
again and bear in mind that the solution
isn't<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.870> most<00:02:21.140> obvious<00:02:21.739> surface<00:02:22.250> thing<00:02:22.520> you

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
isn't the most obvious surface thing you

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.030 
isn't the most obvious surface thing you
can<00:02:22.879> imagine<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.959> might<00:02:24.170> actually<00:02:24.410> go<00:02:24.830> down

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
can imagine you might actually go down

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.869 
can imagine you might actually go down
like<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> little<00:02:26.060> deeper<00:02:26.420> than<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.730> yeah

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
like a little deeper than that so yeah

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.680 
like a little deeper than that so yeah
that's<00:02:29.780> all<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.959> have<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.140> say<00:02:30.170> Missy<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.950> just
