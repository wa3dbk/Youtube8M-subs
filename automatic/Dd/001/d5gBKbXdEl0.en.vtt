00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
the issues that we found in terms of

cyber charter school funding is that

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.520 
cyber charter school funding is that
there's<00:01:04.370> been<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.879> legislative<00:01:05.630> legislation

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
there's been the legislative legislation

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.859 
there's been the legislative legislation
that<00:01:07.009> our<00:01:07.130> funding<00:01:07.460> should<00:01:07.640> be<00:01:07.790> cut<00:01:08.030> but<00:01:08.750> if

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
that our funding should be cut but if

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.569 
that our funding should be cut but if
you<00:01:08.990> really<00:01:09.229> look<00:01:09.619> at<00:01:09.799> what's<00:01:10.040> going<00:01:10.159> on<00:01:10.520> in

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579

you really look at what's going on in
the<00:01:10.820> state<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.090> Pennsylvania<00:01:11.750> I<00:01:11.780> think<00:01:12.110> the

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
the state of Pennsylvania I think the

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.710 
the state of Pennsylvania I think the
governor<00:01:12.619> is<00:01:12.649> really<00:01:13.280> on<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.670> something

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
governor is really on to something

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.990 
governor is really on to something
looking<00:01:14.720> at<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.020> total<00:01:15.320> funding<00:01:15.890> model<00:01:16.310> when

looking at the total funding model when

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.630

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
we look at funding in our state it is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.179 
we look at funding in our state it is
the<00:01:20.149> varying<00:01:20.600> weights<00:01:20.840> go<00:01:21.500> from<00:01:21.860> somewhere

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
the varying weights go from somewhere

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.010 
the varying weights go from somewhere
around<00:01:22.250> six<00:01:22.670> thousand<00:01:23.180> dollars<00:01:23.210> for<00:01:23.719> in<00:01:23.810> one

and<00:01:27.829> you<00:01:28.189> really<00:01:28.430> have<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.700> ask<00:01:28.729> yourself<00:01:29.210> how

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
and you really have to ask yourself how

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.350 
and you really have to ask yourself how
can<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:30.140> provide<00:01:30.469> equity<00:01:31.009> in<00:01:31.159> education<00:01:31.360> with

can you provide equity in education with

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.139 
can you provide equity in education with
that<00:01:32.570> much<00:01:32.810> variation<00:01:33.229> in<00:01:33.799> funding<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.490> cyber

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
that much variation in funding and cyber

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.999 
that much variation in funding and cyber
charter<00:01:35.689> schools<00:01:36.049> regardless<00:01:36.289> of<00:01:36.829> where

charter schools regardless of where
student<00:01:37.520> lives<00:01:37.789> we're<00:01:38.420> able<00:01:38.719> to<00:01:39.079> provide<00:01:39.409> that

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
student lives we're able to provide that

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.830 
student lives we're able to provide that

student with the same quality of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.039 
student with the same quality of

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
education so we really do need to look

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.270 
education so we really do need to look
at<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.289> funding<00:01:45.619> model<00:01:45.890> but<00:01:46.100> do<00:01:46.189> you<00:01:46.250> agree

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
at the funding model but do you agree

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.569 
at the funding model but do you agree
that<00:01:46.579> if<00:01:46.789> they<00:01:47.270> were<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.509> go<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:48.170> uniform<00:01:49.100> fee

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
that if they were to go to a uniform fee

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.849 
that if they were to go to a uniform fee
that<00:01:50.270> would<00:01:50.420> go<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.840> tuition<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.380> should<00:01:51.619> say

education to their students at that
price<00:03:34.069> well<00:03:34.670> there's<00:03:34.819> two<00:03:35.000> things<00:03:35.209> there

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
price well there's two things there

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.900 
price well there's two things there
there's<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.750> uniform<00:03:36.579> amount<00:03:37.579> and<00:03:37.760> then

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
there's a uniform amount and then

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.309 
there's a uniform amount and then
there's<00:03:38.060> fifty<00:03:38.420> eight<00:03:38.569> hundred<00:03:38.900> dollars<00:03:38.930> I

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
there's fifty eight hundred dollars I

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.569 
there's fifty eight hundred dollars I
think<00:03:39.530> if<00:03:39.620> it's<00:03:39.769> fifty<00:03:40.099> eight<00:03:40.250> hundred

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
think if it's fifty eight hundred

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.819 
think if it's fifty eight hundred
dollars<00:03:40.609> I<00:03:41.120> adopter<00:03:42.049> Barnett's<00:03:42.440> right<00:03:42.680> they

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
dollars I adopter Barnett's right they

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.949 
dollars I adopter Barnett's right they
probably<00:03:43.069> would<00:03:43.430> go<00:03:43.579> out<00:03:43.730> of<00:03:43.880> business<00:03:44.060> but<00:03:44.720> i

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
probably would go out of business but i

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.659 
probably would go out of business but i
think<00:03:45.109> a<00:03:45.380> uniform<00:03:45.829> rate<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.190> something<00:03:46.549> that's

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
think a uniform rate is something that's

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.729 
think a uniform rate is something that's
needed<00:03:46.819> after<00:03:47.299> all<00:03:47.630> these<00:03:48.139> kids<00:03:48.500> are<00:03:48.650> all

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.500 
needed after all these kids are all
going<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.190> same<00:03:49.489> school<00:03:49.760> so<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.209> doesn't

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
going to the same school so it doesn't

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.030 
going to the same school so it doesn't
make<00:03:50.599> sense<00:03:50.870> for<00:03:51.049> one<00:03:51.290> school<00:03:51.590> district<00:03:51.980> to

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
make sense for one school district to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.979 
make sense for one school district to
pay<00:03:52.250> eighty<00:03:52.819> five<00:03:53.120> hundred<00:03:53.540> dollars<00:03:53.870> in

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
pay eighty five hundred dollars in

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.390 
pay eighty five hundred dollars in
another<00:03:54.200> school<00:03:54.410> district<00:03:54.799> to<00:03:54.829> pay<00:03:55.010> fifty

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
another school district to pay fifty

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.940 
another school district to pay fifty
five<00:03:55.579> hundred<00:03:55.940> dollars<00:03:56.500> for<00:03:57.500> this<00:03:57.620> for<00:03:57.859> the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
five hundred dollars for this for the

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.220 
five hundred dollars for this for the
same<00:03:58.160> school<00:03:58.519> what<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:59.000> what<00:03:59.569> that<00:03:59.599> results

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
same school what that what that results

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.140 
same school what that what that results
and<00:04:00.380> is<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.680> people<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.639> the<00:04:01.760> wealthier

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
and is that people in the wealthier

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.520 
and is that people in the wealthier
school<00:04:02.480> districts<00:04:02.900> are<00:04:03.049> essentially

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
school districts are essentially

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.009 
school districts are essentially
financing<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.790> education<00:04:05.480> of<00:04:05.599> kids<00:04:05.900> from

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
financing the education of kids from

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.690 
financing the education of kids from
districts<00:04:06.709> that<00:04:06.799> aren't<00:04:07.069> so<00:04:07.220> wealthy<00:04:07.430> at

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
districts that aren't so wealthy at

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.940 
districts that aren't so wealthy at
cyber<00:04:08.000> schools<00:04:08.419> and<00:04:08.750> I<00:04:08.930> don't<00:04:09.650> think<00:04:09.769> that's

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
cyber schools and I don't think that's

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.530 
cyber schools and I don't think that's
the<00:04:10.190> way<00:04:10.220> that<00:04:10.519> anybody<00:04:10.790> would<00:04:11.090> want<00:04:11.329> it<00:04:11.419> to

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
the way that anybody would want it to

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.440 
the way that anybody would want it to
work<00:04:11.660> well<00:04:12.470> but<00:04:13.430> what<00:04:13.609> what<00:04:14.000> is<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.239> point

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
work well but what what is the point

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.970 
work well but what what is the point
though<00:04:14.690> really<00:04:14.930> because<00:04:15.380> we<00:04:15.709> don't<00:04:15.889> have

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
though really because we don't have

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.430 
though really because we don't have
uniform<00:04:16.549> funding<00:04:17.000> there<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.660> that<00:04:17.870> disparity

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
uniform funding there is that disparity

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.020 
uniform funding there is that disparity
reading<00:04:18.979> school<00:04:19.220> district<00:04:19.579> I<00:04:19.669> think<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:19.970> was

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
reading school district I think it was

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.460 
reading school district I think it was
something<00:04:20.209> like<00:04:20.450> six<00:04:20.780> thousand<00:04:21.169> dollars<00:04:21.200> a

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
something like six thousand dollars a

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.930 
something like six thousand dollars a
kid<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.859> down<00:04:22.039> a<00:04:22.070> new<00:04:22.310> hope<00:04:22.490> in<00:04:22.610> Bucks<00:04:22.820> County

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
kid it down a new hope in Bucks County

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.839 
kid it down a new hope in Bucks County
the<00:04:23.630> difference<00:04:23.900> is<00:04:24.050> 13,000<00:04:24.890> a<00:04:24.950> child<00:04:25.219> you're

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
the difference is 13,000 a child you're

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.540 
the difference is 13,000 a child you're
not<00:04:26.000> asking<00:04:26.180> for<00:04:26.659> there<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:26.840> be

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
not asking for there to be

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.309 
not asking for there to be
in<00:04:27.639> a<00:04:27.699> sense<00:04:28.150> uniform<00:04:28.659> funding<00:04:29.110> throughout

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
in a sense uniform funding throughout

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.749 
in a sense uniform funding throughout
the<00:04:29.470> state<00:04:29.680> every<00:04:29.919> district<00:04:30.250> is<00:04:30.340> nobody<00:04:30.669> the

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
the state every district is nobody the

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.070 
the state every district is nobody the
same<00:04:30.940> why<00:04:31.090> are<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.270> holding<00:04:31.449> charter<00:04:31.840> schools

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
same why are you holding charter schools

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.659 
same why are you holding charter schools
to<00:04:32.229> that<00:04:32.379> same<00:04:32.650> let's<00:04:33.310> do<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.430> different

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
to that same let's do a different

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.809 
to that same let's do a different
standard<00:04:34.180> well<00:04:34.900> again<00:04:35.889> we're<00:04:36.310> talking<00:04:36.340> about

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
standard well again we're talking about

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.180 
standard well again we're talking about
not<00:04:37.240> so<00:04:37.479> much<00:04:37.659> funding<00:04:38.319> for<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.620> district<00:04:39.069> and

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
not so much funding for the district and

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.129 
not so much funding for the district and
you're<00:04:39.340> right<00:04:39.490> there<00:04:39.699> isn't<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.139> uniform

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
you're right there isn't a uniform

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.409 
you're right there isn't a uniform
funding<00:04:41.470> trail<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.800> district<00:04:42.190> but<00:04:42.699> again<00:04:43.180> if

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
funding trail to district but again if

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.619 
funding trail to district but again if
your<00:04:44.490> take<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.639> example<00:04:45.940> that<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.270> gave<00:04:46.300> us

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
your take the example that you gave us

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.379 
your take the example that you gave us
why<00:04:46.810> why<00:04:47.199> does<00:04:47.409> it<00:04:47.530> make<00:04:47.680> sense<00:04:47.710> for<00:04:48.389> one

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
why why does it make sense for one

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.999 
why why does it make sense for one
district<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:49.930> pay<00:04:50.110> so<00:04:50.169> much<00:04:50.409> and<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.919> other

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
district to pay so much and the other

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.760 
district to pay so much and the other
district<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.490> pay<00:04:52.110> less<00:04:53.110> than<00:04:53.289> half<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.650> that

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
district to pay less than half of that

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.740 
district to pay less than half of that
amount<00:04:53.830> to<00:04:54.550> send<00:04:54.789> at<00:04:54.940> school<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.300> kid<00:04:55.509> to<00:04:55.629> the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
amount to send at school a kid to the

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.330 
amount to send at school a kid to the
same<00:04:55.960> school<00:04:56.199> it<00:04:56.530> doesn't<00:04:56.560> make<00:04:56.949> any<00:04:57.099> sense

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
same school it doesn't make any sense

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.640 
same school it doesn't make any sense
and<00:04:57.610> these<00:04:57.729> the<00:04:58.360> thing<00:04:58.870> here<00:04:59.080> now<00:04:59.229> these<00:04:59.470> are

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
and these the thing here now these are

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.409 
and these the thing here now these are
taxpayer<00:05:00.250> dollars<00:05:00.819> these<00:05:01.060> are<00:05:01.240> public

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
taxpayer dollars these are public

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.029 
taxpayer dollars these are public
dollars<00:05:01.930> that<00:05:02.080> are<00:05:02.110> coming<00:05:02.469> from<00:05:02.590> taxpayers

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
dollars that are coming from taxpayers

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.339 
dollars that are coming from taxpayers
so<00:05:03.789> it<00:05:04.060> seems<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.539> us<00:05:04.569> that<00:05:04.690> it<00:05:04.930> makes<00:05:05.080> more

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
so it seems to us that it makes more

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.469 
so it seems to us that it makes more
sense<00:05:05.409> that<00:05:05.979> if<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.580> child's<00:05:06.940> gone<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.270> PA

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
sense that if a child's gone to PA

Tim's point I'd like to speak to the

funding and cyber charter schools cyber

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.159 
funding and cyber charter schools cyber
charter<00:06:02.949> schools<00:06:03.250> are<00:06:03.430> funded<00:06:03.819> based<00:06:04.659> on<00:06:05.020> the

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
charter schools are funded based on the

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.140 
charter schools are funded based on the

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
funding model that exists in the state

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.140 
funding model that exists in the state
we<00:06:07.569> didn't<00:06:07.870> create<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.889> disparity<00:06:09.699> within

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
we didn't create the disparity within

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.899 
we didn't create the disparity within
the<00:06:10.539> per<00:06:10.930> pupil<00:06:10.960> rates<00:06:11.500> we<00:06:12.039> inherited<00:06:12.610> it<00:06:12.789> and

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
the per pupil rates we inherited it and

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.360 
the per pupil rates we inherited it and
so<00:06:13.419> if<00:06:13.599> you<00:06:13.629> fix<00:06:14.139> that<00:06:14.319> then<00:06:14.979> you<00:06:15.190> will

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
so if you fix that then you will

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.510 
so if you fix that then you will
automatically<00:06:16.270> fix<00:06:16.719> what<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:17.919> funding<00:06:18.340> for
