00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:04.219
 With 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.609
 Rename files and rename to copy rename and the like 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:14.929
 is always a bit problematic in every operating system here and there 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.010
 Program with which you do it under mac-os 10 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.610
 while enemies see the companies for they see the symbol of the investigator 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.330
 when they drive over it with the mouse 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.960
 if you know the name when I click on it now it will be a fine one 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 Window open this is such a window 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.819
 and now they can do it accordingly 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:35.540
 manage the files 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.750
 fine windows Always divide into several areas 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.909
 For one thing, they kept something like that upstairs 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:42.999
 like the head 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:44.370
 the window off 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.970
 then you have here on the left side 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.720
 also an area 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.350
 and then they have the main area if they want 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.929
 the right side the left side 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.219
 forms in the big areas 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.530
 favorites 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.080
 shares 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.360
 and below devices off 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.650
 depending on it 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.850
 as it is set with him if she is a bit 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.370
 or see a little less 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.460
 on the right side, on the other hand 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.909
 always see the actual documents or folders 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.530
 and so on 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.600
 romp around here 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.159
 there they have the opportunity 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.700
 the way the year is displayed 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.560
 to change accordingly at the moment I am here 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.060
 in this they are probably also in sight if I am here for example one 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390
 Continue to the right 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.020
 then I get here so Aigner tabular things view if I still 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.230
 go one position to the right 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.329
 then I get a view of the sounds organized 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.579
 That's a view 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.950
 which one tends to recognize on the Unix world 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.570
 I think that the example shows how that, for example, on the account for 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.270
 Example I have my hard drive here 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.180
 and then I have a folder here that users 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.160
 and there I have a folder again 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.700
 and you see that goes on and on to the right 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.420
 and the further they go to the right, the deeper they go into the structure 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.130
 in 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.629
 always back 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.259
 namely Pierobon by clicking on all my files kicker 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:16.309
 I get the view again I have the previous one then there is one more 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.709
 another view that is the so-called Tauber fled 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.049
 That's a view 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.820
 you might look that way 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.710
 iTunes then recognizes the images or documents 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:31.149
 in a barely go from left to right 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.380
 and now i can just use the arrow keys here on the keyboard 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.479
 go right 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:36.800
 and I always come 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.950
 to the next picture 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.130
 or to the next document 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.379
 The team has to be my pictures 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.159
 Often it will certainly be pictures 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.219
 but this is for example a pdf-document 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.789
 or this is also a pdf document as well as this and 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.019
 Here is also a small movie 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.269
 Kids click on it to start the movie accordingly 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:04.619
 This view here is perhaps still a bit small and not quite 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:08.289
 that's why I want to enlarge this window once 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:12.049
 Of course, the whole thing down here could just touch it to enlarge it 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.609
 but you can also click here on the green icon 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.039
 to enter this traffic light 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:21.169
 and then the window will be maximized as well 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:23.650
 I want to switch back 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.060
 in this view becomes 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.069
 and that the 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.249
 Elements here raise as small icons I have up here the area 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:32.339
 favorites 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.599
 and there they see there is the point all my files 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.920
 Here it is now so the investigator 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.820
 all pictures in certain categories 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.910
 and then here also with Fontane indicating they all see all the pictures 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.359
 PDF documents 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.549
 All Movies 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.349
 if I go down Things i give it presentation then it's here 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.360
 document 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.709
 Documents are for example Pelagius documents 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.839
 or there documents 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:06.410
 but here you see there are also so Dixon l documents respectively here 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.579
 my pearl 11 virtual machine 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:10.339
 in this connection 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:12.619
 they are happy now 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:17.859
 my files are the majorities of a folder structure to find somewhere 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.519
 Oh, well, the computer has a lot to do 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.920
 if he will show all my pictures Bayern 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.510
 they see that up here 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.699
 that of course not all of us here, but only the first five 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.370
 and here it continues accordingly I am now times these failures and now 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.210
 with the Friday to go to the right 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.270
 then you see 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.180
 as there is also a kind of Kawa Flow here 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.639
 and I continue to look right, maybe I'm interested 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.360
 primary and pictures 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.520
 and everything else I do not own so much right now 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.910
 then you can see all 13 pictures here at the moment I can 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.099
 click on it here 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.650
 and then I see here now 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.310
 the pictures no longer in such a carousel gondola from left to right 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.680
 but giving it all goes from top to bottom depending on how 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.260
 many documents I have 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.160
 you can now imagine live here 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.680
 the diesel is their goal 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.270
 be very very big approx 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.099
 be strong but always that 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.129
 so often show less 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.349
 and then I see many of them have this view 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.849
 and I can also use the mouse with the Tatsch area in relation to the 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:23.689
 trackpad 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.580
 which also immediately left 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.200
 drive over to the right 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.430
 and how to look at each document 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.310
 in this video I was going to give him a first little overview about it 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.139
 what they can do with the enemy like that 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.620
 and how they look like 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.700
 to adapt to your own wishes
