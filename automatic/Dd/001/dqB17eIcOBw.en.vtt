00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.409
 according to rob horne terroir and today at home 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:19.279
 Hello, I'm in the coffin 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.970
 it's cute wrote 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.159
 for now I am delighted kumar to welcome you 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.179
 so percent i'm coming here it's oit today 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.079
 because if avignon dynamic objects 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.130
 it's a biological practice 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.960
 the discussions between 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.800
 yes it became tense dynamic for ten years then 4 finally we have 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.190
 started with effects because there 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.180
 we wanted to break the dynamic what is written is a subject enough 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.180
 delicate when one has the rational and Cartesian mind 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.580
 so we also said we should not sometimes we also have to do things we do not 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.600
 not understand and just see what happens 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.760
 so we did a test on a hectare and a half he came it's so 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.880
 concluding that 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.630
 the following year we 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.680
 in his domain 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.340
 when of more than two since 98 cents for his team mike ouster 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.070
 in 2011 and 11 years 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.960
 that's it yes it's something you 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.280
 for who still works on me or different 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.280
 % and especially interiors which is quite particular to alsace 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.240
 to enter the ministry 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.829
 yes it's true anderson has there in Alsatian afp 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.099
 properties very fragmented since we only have 15 hectares that are distributed 

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:31.080
 sure 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.340
 over 100 parcels of vines followed either a little harder speech than the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.789
 pavilions of Scottish gardeners gardening couple 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.909
 with his picture but pretty much the vineyards is divided into two places 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.109
 principal on the face of the tatane pillars then to and then we have 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.070
 terroir near the center of athens 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.880
 for a few lines 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 by then the best terroirs of the place is called cheese 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.440
 duceppe marked by quartz 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.750
 the clay link to the girl quartz that has a quartz sand can be 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.429
 but the main thing is to stop the quartile tide place 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.680
 with him a microclimate that 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.590
 very particular since one is detached from the left that detach them 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.419
 Nivose 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.349
 and we have a little much light emitted a lot of wind so it's a 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.009
 very airy place 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.369
 who ever screams the grapes so we're never sure about expression 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.479
 too sure office narboux finesse at city cost 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.219
 the omaha gotha ​​the grand cru emitting towards him which is a terroir 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.519
 very particular since this is what would make okami alsace 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.849
 our customers both a stone that is very emblematic of Alsace which 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:34.569
 would 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.639
 khadra of strasbourg it's a small voice the eurozone services that has a 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:39.509
 who attracted him 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:40.679
 who make it up 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.679
 so staying it is a stone that brings back a lot of 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.540
 tenderness and a stone that brings back much trinity-of-mountains 20% of 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.009
 charm in a month 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.339
 I do not say anything yes yes it's very voluptuous 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.479
 it seems average of the volcano that once of the earth and which brings back 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.139
 the intensity of American power so c 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.029
 it is a place that is quite complete 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:06.129
 for me it's a little billion idea what the town of villiers the volcano is 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.169
 wake up finally 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.149
 because the individuals 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.159
 but on the tata nano g2o terroir because it's not going out between the ciotat 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.919
 trouble 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.189
 we also have the berlin hotel 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.969
 which is a very particular knife since this was director I 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.729
 will tell you mountain and me a Cistercian essay that he denied 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:23.759
 created in the 12th century and 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.930
 the albères is the ump 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.800
 koto contiguity to applaud the hermitage in Alsatian this story seleçao him 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.589
 let 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.649
 aliou probably at home had a hermitage in the middle ages finally 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.019
 after the monks settled in the area 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.629
 where is the monks who wanted to isolate themselves isolate themselves 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.829
 it's enough local archives cut the onions 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.139
 it is the calcareous soil that we have because the uci has not extinguished before a shot 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.209
 in the corner 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.339
 much more than expected yes to the nose and especially when is it solved 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.209
 the big Blue 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.079
 but limestones are quite rare 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.369
 and then to the iceberg which has a knife that is very stiff which is composed of 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.679
 granit greg and that it costs interesting since 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.379
 he does it with the good days of leaving did you play a game that are 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.679
 our juniors and evolve ethical do you know I'm left crystalline 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:10.309
 it's really the meeting of the two bogeys is the first 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.189
 the first to paris his granite gaggle forbidden the first rut 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:17.700
 cause of granite currently 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.930
 so a few years ago are meeting at that time 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.520
 percent and justin 100 meters from this terroir 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.770
 you guessed cyber who is the first ter in alsace first team 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.000
 Grand Prix Festival is infinitely more dramatic 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.279
 firstly 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:33.409
 an alleged accomplice of the case and 46 'tour water in a complexity 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.099
 who binds who's theirs the ale the loophole of the bar corner the arhab region a 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:39.849
 regions as complex as the region at the team level which is 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.120
 who is well known for his accomplices I live here it's 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.550
 about the same thing 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.150
 so we're not yet on the nyse this back in the water 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.479
 for barbarian tractors have to go to parliament and all that for 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.689
 that it is a magnificent mosaic of terroirs only 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.800
 this is what allows to work different terroirs imbalance 

00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:57.170
 completely different absolutely 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.879
 which is magical and that's why funding 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.400
 supervision out of 10 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.630
 yes normal last and that's not seeing the size of the plots but it's true 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.930
 also that 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.719
 decision 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:11.889
 3 nausea and geological it's true that we can also say that side 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.139
 no, but there it is a region 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.680
 which is marked by various steffi laier want to simplify our regions as 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.580
 Alsace a nonsense 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.150
 because it was natural of the asa c 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.719
 both in this geological landscape territory 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:27.969
 m even climatic because the intentions when we compare to the 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.430
 Burgundy is a region that is reputed to be complex 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.520
 yes to a coast who have joined invested and then to some fighting 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.520
 in Alsace to all possible impressions on a very very 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.240
 close that already all microclimates are possible 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.749
 all young girls are possible because the game the collapse of the 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:46.549
 you're crazy these meetings did show up on the piedmont m the 

00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:48.689
 geology creativity possible 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.819
 and then afterwards there are also the seven pages that are objects 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.929
 different because when we take the pinault that come from burgundy or the 

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:58.230
 bio what comes from italy and russia via the rhine valley the cnr that comes 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.229
 we realize that we are in a denim crossroads also European 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.729
 the bigger the situation since we are the example of the matte paint 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.599
 eyi akoz to know we also have to get along in our wine traditions 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.110
 betrayal make debate mouallem 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.919
 what is human kinect deserved from germany's list of his supporters 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.050
 the picards of the big steps that comes from France the french alstom 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.360
 and we are talking about terroir which is an idea 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.409
 typically french latin 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.699
 and we speak of grape variety is a purely Germanic idea it is necessary that its 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.699
 tell its diversity marc fremond the nature of alsace what 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:33.759
 I have to be a little concerned about people who would like us 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.159
 simplifies all that because 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:38.729
 I play I think we're going to a form industrialization and nap can 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:39.659
 not be industrialized 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.979
 so what I find it strong in its complexity 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:43.740
 absolutely not answer absolutely 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.090
 and on the same place we can make the souls of the harvest by dvd 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.930
 language year because the conditions lend themselves 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.520
 but after we will make a misfortune happen dry very great advice absolutely I 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.460
 do and it's really unique to have such a capacity in the 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.750
 world today
