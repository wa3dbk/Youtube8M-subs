00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
mine just wanted to point out that

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.920 
mine just wanted to point out that
phyllo<00:03:06.640> can<00:03:06.880> get<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> little<00:03:07.360> tricky<00:03:07.600> and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
phyllo can get a little tricky and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.740 
phyllo can get a little tricky and
notice<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.260> kind<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.650> broken<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.280> one<00:03:09.459> up<00:03:09.750> but

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
notice I kind of broken that one up but

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.539 
notice I kind of broken that one up but
it's<00:03:10.900> okay<00:03:11.200> it's<00:03:11.440> very<00:03:11.650> forgiving<00:03:12.190> by<00:03:12.489> the

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
it's okay it's very forgiving by the

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:13.979 
it's okay it's very forgiving by the
time<00:03:12.760> it's<00:03:12.910> all<00:03:12.970> said<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.209> done<00:03:13.330> with<00:03:13.600> it

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
time it's all said and done with it

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.479 
time it's all said and done with it
really<00:03:14.440> doesn't<00:03:14.769> matter<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:15.100> nobody<00:03:15.400> will

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
really doesn't matter and nobody will

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.800 
really doesn't matter and nobody will
know<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.610> difference<00:03:15.730> it's<00:03:16.209> not<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.600> hard

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
know the difference it's not that hard

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.110 
know the difference it's not that hard
to<00:03:16.930> make<00:03:17.170> this<00:03:17.320> is<00:03:17.530> just<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.920> few<00:03:18.459> more<00:03:18.580> steps<00:03:18.850> in

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
to make this is just a few more steps in

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.150 
to make this is just a few more steps in
your<00:03:19.150> usual<00:03:19.420> dessert<00:03:19.930> but<00:03:20.200> once<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.680> taste<00:03:20.920> it

you'll<00:03:21.400> just<00:03:21.640> want<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.000> make<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.269> all<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.510> time

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
you'll just want to make it all the time
