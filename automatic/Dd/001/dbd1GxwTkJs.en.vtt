the<00:00:15.299> engine<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:16.130> experiencing<00:00:17.130> problems<00:00:17.310> low

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
the engine is experiencing problems low

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.820 
the engine is experiencing problems low
compression<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.600> multiple<00:00:19.020> cylinders<00:00:19.380> and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
compression and multiple cylinders and

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.859 
compression and multiple cylinders and
it's<00:00:20.460> leaking<00:00:20.609> engine<00:00:20.910> engine<00:00:21.240> coolant

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
it's leaking engine engine coolant

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.750 
it's leaking engine engine coolant
directly<00:00:22.289> into<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> engine<00:00:22.619> oil<00:00:23.070> which

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
directly into the engine oil which

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.939 
directly into the engine oil which
unfortunately<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.570> cause<00:00:25.050> major<00:00:25.500> engine

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
unfortunately can cause major engine

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.189 
unfortunately can cause major engine
problems<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.519> runs<00:00:26.670> too<00:00:26.910> long<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.930> engine

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
problems if it runs too long the engine

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.929 
problems if it runs too long the engine
is<00:00:28.289> also<00:00:28.470> experiencing<00:00:29.250> large<00:00:29.519> amount<00:00:29.820> of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
is also experiencing large amount of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.749 
is also experiencing large amount of
engine<00:00:30.240> sludge<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.470> most<00:00:32.130> likely<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.700> is

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
engine sludge so most likely this is

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.700 
engine sludge so most likely this is
going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> nice<00:00:33.600> full<00:00:33.930> project<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.620> it

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
going to be a nice full project and it

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.990 
going to be a nice full project and it
might<00:00:34.860> end<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:35.190> having<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.550> rebuild<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
might end up having to be rebuild the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.490 
might end up having to be rebuild the
bottom<00:00:36.180> end<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.510> engine<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:37.170> we'll<00:00:37.320> see

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
bottom end of the engine but we'll see

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.479 
bottom end of the engine but we'll see
how<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.710> goes

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
how that goes

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.150 
how that goes
ok<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.239> far<00:00:39.870> we've<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.620> both<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.010> AC

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
ok so far we've on both of the AC

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.910 
ok so far we've on both of the AC
compressor<00:00:41.719> 4<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.840> part<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.770> not

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
compressor 4 and part of this one do not

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.590 
compressor 4 and part of this one do not
disconnect<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.520> line<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.390> do

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
disconnect this line because if you do

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.170 
disconnect this line because if you do
have<00:00:45.870> refrigerant<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.500> there<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.920> r134a<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
have refrigerant in there the r134a and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.540 
have refrigerant in there the r134a and
it<00:00:48.420> does<00:00:48.600> leak<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> federal<00:00:49.739> offense

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
it does leak out it is a federal offense

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
it does leak out it is a federal offense
just<00:00:51.000> unbolt<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.809> set<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.050> off<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
just unbolt it and just set it off the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.069 
just unbolt it and just set it off the

rebuild it from the ground up and to be
honest<00:03:35.299> with<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.599> it<00:03:35.930> probably<00:03:36.410> isn't<00:03:36.530> worth

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
honest with you it probably isn't worth

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.129

Durango's these are steel heads and they
are<00:03:58.519> very<00:03:59.000> prone<00:03:59.359> to<00:03:59.389> crack<00:03:59.900> about<00:04:00.440> 85<00:04:01.190> percent

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
are very prone to crack about 85 percent

are very prone to crack about 85 percent
85<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.180> 90<00:04:02.359> percent<00:04:02.389> of<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.810> time<00:04:03.049> when<00:04:03.560> you

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
85 to 90 percent of the time when you

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.530 
85 to 90 percent of the time when you
have<00:04:03.769> a<00:04:03.799> head<00:04:03.980> gasket<00:04:04.130> leak<00:04:04.519> feed<00:04:05.030> tube<00:04:05.239> crack

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
have a head gasket leak feed tube crack

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.180 
have a head gasket leak feed tube crack
and<00:04:05.989> it<00:04:06.109> makes<00:04:06.260> them<00:04:06.440> completely<00:04:06.950> useless

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
and it makes them completely useless

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.270

just<00:04:08.000> a<00:04:08.090> little<00:04:08.269> tip<00:04:08.450> for<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.870> but<00:04:09.440> I'm<00:04:10.099> going

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
just a little tip for you but I'm going

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.830 
just a little tip for you but I'm going
to<00:04:10.370> continue<00:04:10.730> tearing<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.209> head<00:04:11.359> down<00:04:11.569> and

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
to continue tearing the head down and

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.349 
to continue tearing the head down and
see<00:04:12.290> what<00:04:12.500> we<00:04:12.530> can<00:04:12.739> do<00:04:12.889> for<00:04:13.099> this<00:04:13.160> engine<00:04:13.400> if<00:04:13.880> if

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
see what we can do for this engine if if

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.839 
see what we can do for this engine if if
it's<00:04:14.540> unsavable<00:04:14.989> then<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:16.099> will<00:04:16.370> continue<00:04:16.549> this

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
it's unsavable then I will continue this

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.919 
it's unsavable then I will continue this
project<00:04:17.120> as<00:04:17.659> a<00:04:17.690> engine<00:04:18.620> replacement
