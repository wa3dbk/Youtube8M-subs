00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.850
 now commented we have another hour the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.160
 rhythm for may we add a 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.189
 very cool effect more than an effect are 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.710
 aquatic plants and nothing else and some 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.540
 some not shine some also you 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.340
 can swallow in the environment if you're in 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.700
 normal mode will be very difficult to get out of 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.320
 but if you are creative, you can not 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.530
 Attentively beige I got 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.850
 you see 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.039
 and serving is very difficult up to 16 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.809
 now I get it right I started some shine 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.379
 mushrooms do not also think that they add two 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.610
 cubes but more this beige and another that was 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.890
 this 6 1 and 2 groups 2 and if there are more 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.420
 I am seen by now these and you take 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.100
 some plants shine and some do not 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.600
 you see well from the outside it looks much better and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.269
 nothing else 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.460
 it's an optical effect with a cool 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.080
 observe and nothing else I think in a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.810
 future you can do something else with these 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.520
 plants but for now not well I hope 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.840
