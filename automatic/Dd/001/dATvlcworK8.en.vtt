 at a very interesting moment in my life

 I'm starting a business and I have many 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.049
 ideas in the head that I think are very 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.049
 good however I do not know where 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.150
 start on a day to day basis I would like 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.520

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.320
 way to start the day to be productive 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.250
 and do what you have to do 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.740
 I await your answer gonzalo greeting 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:26.680
 well, good gonzalo, that is to create a plan 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.750
 and it is not not to live the day as the 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.490
 mistake that you do not have to start letting 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.350
 the day to day come and go 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.060
 hitting one and one like that means 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.970
 go adapting to him one has to 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.700
 start generating and creating a plan 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.500
 action on a day-to-day basis what is it 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.330
 you have to do to build your 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.770
 plan to build your plan the first thing 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.509
 you have to do is generate a routine 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.180
 since you get up when you 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.950
 wake up what are you going to do there are many 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.860
 comments that say it generates routines 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.830
 very bad and that the routine bores the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.770
 routine is not that bored to the routine should 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.830
 exist so that the some things of the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.750
 day by day they become automatic and that 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.880
 can move forward as you want 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.080
 then the most basic routine that you should 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.060
 do 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.550
 it's a routine as soon as you get up 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.990
 you pick up and what do you do I want you to smile 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.150
 I'll tell you what serves me I 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.310
 I get up and smile is the first thing 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.110
 I do the second thing I do is drink water 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.210
 I drink at least half a liter of water 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.790
 to start hydrating the body that is 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.920
 usually dehydrated when we sleep and what 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.710
 third thing I do is that I go and wash 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.810
 the teeth I do those three things and so 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.420
 I am already telling my body that 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.130
 I'm starting the day when I finish 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.650
 do that I feel in front of me 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.600
 desk I take out a sheet of paper and 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.550
 post-its and I start to answer the 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.730
 following questions the first is that 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.709
 I'm going to achieve today I set myself the goals of 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.350
 that I'm going to achieve the second thing that I'm going to 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.380
 to do is what I'm going to do to achieve it 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.230
 today and I start to put the action plan 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.560
 of the day the third thing is that I start to see 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.660
 If I need someone to achieve it 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.860
 then I begin to notice to whom I owe 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.950
 to call 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.990
 and then start making a list of 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.320
 what do I have to do in the day 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.370
 for me before for others what 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.930
 means with this 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.090
 the number one error you can do if 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.550
 you are if you are starting a company is 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.170
 open the email and 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.120
 respond to other people 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.530
 it means that you are not controlling your 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.540
 time but you 're letting the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.180
 other people start to control you 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.010
 from the first moment of the day that's why 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.350
 I want you to first make a list of what 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.850
 is what you have to do before 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.860
 open the email if you have 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.560
 send emails to the brand and send the 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.140
 but it's because you need to send them 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.959
 start sorting your life with these steps 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.209
 with these questions answers fabrics and 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.120
 start teaching your body how to 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.090
 you are raising and how are you acting 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.000
 end of the day I want the list that 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.739

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.560

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.650
 November and November 30 the 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.330
