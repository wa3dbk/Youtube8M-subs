00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.590 
owning a machine you'll still be able to
see<00:01:32.100> through<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> window<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:33.299> your<00:01:33.450> work

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
see through the window see your work

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
see through the window see your work
piece<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.590> look<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.040> your<00:01:35.220> machining

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
piece so I look at what your machining

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.120 
piece so I look at what your machining
the<00:01:36.570> other<00:01:36.689> thing<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.500> move<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.860> door

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the other thing just as I move this door

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.600 
the other thing just as I move this door
back<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.939> forth<00:01:39.439> it<00:01:40.439> used<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> open<00:01:41.250> outside

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
back and forth it used to open outside

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270 
back and forth it used to open outside
the<00:01:42.060> enclosure<00:01:42.180> yeah<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.920> could<00:01:44.070> drip<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the enclosure yeah if it could drip a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.240 
the enclosure yeah if it could drip a
little<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:46.229> made<00:01:46.470> machine<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.070> hair

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
little so we made machine just a hair

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.789 
little so we made machine just a hair
wider<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.780> move<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> door<00:01:49.320> opening<00:01:49.649> we're

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
wider and we move the door opening we're

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.530 
wider and we move the door opening we're
able<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> full<00:01:50.579> sink<00:01:50.880> sized<00:01:51.060> door<00:01:51.299> in

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
able to get a full sink sized door in

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.240 
able to get a full sink sized door in
there<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.259> doesn't<00:01:52.590> penetrate<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.979> machine

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
there it doesn't penetrate the machine

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.380 
there it doesn't penetrate the machine
it's<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> lot<00:01:53.579> easier<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.850> clean<00:01:54.119> out<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
it's a lot easier to clean out the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.090 
it's a lot easier to clean out the
inside<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> lot<00:01:55.229> simpler<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.979> other

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
inside it's a lot simpler the other

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.800 
inside it's a lot simpler the other
thing<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.369> really<00:01:56.520> stands<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.329> me<00:01:57.509> when

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
thing that really stands out to me when

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.389 
thing that really stands out to me when
I<00:01:57.840> walk<00:01:58.079> up<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> while<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.189> thing's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
I walk up is like a while this thing's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.190 
I walk up is like a while this thing's
got<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> roof<00:01:59.820> down<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.450> used<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> mini

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
got a roof down and used to be the mini

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.289 
got a roof down and used to be the mini
mill<00:02:01.409> was<00:02:01.560> totally<00:02:01.950> open<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.430> now<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.909> put<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
mill was totally open and now you put a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.760 
mill was totally open and now you put a
bully

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
bully

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.889 
bully
metal<00:02:05.100> roof<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.119> before<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.659> know<00:02:06.689> we

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
metal roof on it so before you know we

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.389 
metal roof on it so before you know we
first<00:02:07.200> start<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.409> with<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.590> mini<00:02:07.799> mill<00:02:08.009> we

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
first start out with a mini mill we

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.219 
first start out with a mini mill we
didn't<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.819> needed<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.149> roof<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:09.810> as

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
didn't think we needed a roof but as

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.190 
didn't think we needed a roof but as
we've<00:02:10.470> added<00:02:10.649> TSC<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.489> lots<00:02:11.670> more<00:02:11.760> coolant<00:02:12.420> we

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
we've added TSC and lots more coolant we

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.809 
we've added TSC and lots more coolant we
had<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> clear<00:02:13.650> plastic<00:02:13.860> top<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.640> still

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
had the clear plastic top but it still

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.089 
had the clear plastic top but it still
had<00:02:14.970> opening<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.629> we<00:02:15.959> fully<00:02:16.170> enclosed<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.769> just

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
had opening so we fully enclosed it just

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.979 
had opening so we fully enclosed it just
to<00:02:17.190> keep<00:02:17.280> everything<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.790> there<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.690> if

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
to keep everything in there and if

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.270 
to keep everything in there and if
you're<00:02:19.110> going<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.290> fully<00:02:19.470> enclose<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.040> now<00:02:20.220> you

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
you're going to fully enclose it now you

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.770 
you're going to fully enclose it now you
need<00:02:20.550> light<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.970> don't<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.330> light<00:02:21.540> from

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
need light you don't have to light from

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.350 
need light you don't have to light from
your<00:02:22.290> shop<00:02:22.560> anymore<00:02:22.830> right<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:23.910> added<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
your shop anymore right so we added the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.059 
your shop anymore right so we added the
brightest<00:02:24.780> LED<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.260> could<00:02:25.410> find<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.950> it

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
brightest LED we could find and it

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.410 
brightest LED we could find and it
actually<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.459> think<00:02:26.580> lights<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.120> up<00:02:27.180> better

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
actually I think lights it up better

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.809 
actually I think lights it up better
than<00:02:27.660> with<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.290> roof<00:02:28.470> open<00:02:28.799> it<00:02:29.099> does<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.700> got

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
than with the roof open it does you got

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.640 
than with the roof open it does you got
a<00:02:29.849> lot<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.120> light<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.420> your<00:02:30.750> table<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.410> your

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
a lot of light on your table and your

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.380 
a lot of light on your table and your
workpiece<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:32.459> moving<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:32.970> inside<00:02:33.360> the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
workpiece so moving to inside the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.570 
workpiece so moving to inside the
machine<00:02:33.930> another<00:02:34.590> thing<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:34.890> our<00:02:35.099> customers

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
machine another thing that our customers

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.160 
machine another thing that our customers
really<00:02:35.849> like<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.420> we've<00:02:36.599> had<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.989> last

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
really like that we've had in the last

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.410 
really like that we've had in the last
couple<00:02:37.319> of<00:02:37.560> years<00:02:37.769> on<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.400> bmc's<00:02:38.970> you've

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
couple of years on the bmc's you've

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.210 
couple of years on the bmc's you've
brought<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> many<00:02:40.110> mill<00:02:40.349> you've<00:02:41.069> got<00:02:41.190> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
brought to the many mill you've got a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.400 
brought to the many mill you've got a
coolant<00:02:41.610> ring<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:41.940> here<00:02:42.120> now<00:02:42.269> right<00:02:43.170> it's<00:02:43.290> been

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
coolant ring in here now right it's been

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.020 
coolant ring in here now right it's been
very<00:02:43.590> popular<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.160> BMC<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:44.880> made<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
very popular on the BMC so we made a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.970 
very popular on the BMC so we made a
smaller<00:02:45.630> version<00:02:45.900> but<00:02:46.319> it's<00:02:46.440> great<00:02:46.650> I've<00:02:46.799> put

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
smaller version but it's great I've put

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.860 
smaller version but it's great I've put
tons<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.430> cooling<00:02:47.730> right<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.329> part<00:02:48.510> right

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
tons of cooling right on the part right

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.059 
tons of cooling right on the part right
on<00:02:48.989> your<00:02:49.140> tool<00:02:49.290> tip<00:02:49.470> right<00:02:49.650> where<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:49.860> want<00:02:50.010> to

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
on your tool tip right where you want to

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.500 
on your tool tip right where you want to
bring<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.489> can<00:02:50.610> adjust<00:02:50.970> each<00:02:51.239> nozzle

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
bring you can adjust each nozzle

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.809 
bring you can adjust each nozzle
independently<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.280> said<00:02:53.519> there's<00:02:53.730> a

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
independently like you said there's a

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.860 
independently like you said there's a
ton<00:02:53.849> of<00:02:54.090> coolant<00:02:54.540> good<00:02:54.810> flow<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.950> course

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
ton of coolant good flow and of course

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.970 
ton of coolant good flow and of course
option<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.959> we've<00:02:58.140> always<00:02:58.319> had<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.799> people

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
option that we've always had is people

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.309 
option that we've always had is people
you<00:02:59.730> can<00:02:59.880> still<00:03:00.000> add<00:03:00.329> that<00:03:00.569> on<00:03:00.810> any<00:03:01.049> of<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
you can still add that on any of the

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.140 
you can still add that on any of the
many<00:03:01.500> mill<00:03:01.709> servers<00:03:02.069> right<00:03:02.280> all<00:03:02.700> right<00:03:02.790> people

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
many mill servers right all right people

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.360 
many mill servers right all right people
is<00:03:03.239> great<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.660> puts<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.709> coolant<00:03:05.040> right<00:03:05.220> at

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
is great it puts the coolant right at

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.280 
is great it puts the coolant right at
the<00:03:05.519> tip<00:03:05.730> or<00:03:05.940> right<00:03:06.120> where<00:03:06.569> wherever<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.019> want

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
the tip or right where wherever you want

the tip or right where wherever you want
and<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.560> puts<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.860> right<00:03:07.920> there<00:03:08.250> that's<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.819> big

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
and it puts it right there that's a big

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.879 
and it puts it right there that's a big
deal<00:03:09.180> especially<00:03:09.359> on<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:09.989> machine<00:03:10.410> like<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.590> mini

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
deal especially on a machine like a mini

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.160 
deal especially on a machine like a mini
mill<00:03:11.130> where<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.400> job<00:03:11.700> shop<00:03:11.970> may<00:03:12.239> have<00:03:12.420> many

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
mill where a job shop may have many

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.379 
mill where a job shop may have many
different<00:03:13.590> job<00:03:13.769> sets<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.400> set<00:03:14.579> up<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.819> once<00:03:15.060> you

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
different job sets and set up a once you

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.270 
different job sets and set up a once you
can<00:03:16.049> have<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.230> different<00:03:16.650> setting<00:03:16.950> for<00:03:16.980> each

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
can have a different setting for each

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.580 
can have a different setting for each
tool<00:03:17.579> so<00:03:18.120> talking<00:03:18.630> about<00:03:18.690> coolant<00:03:19.230> let's<00:03:19.410> go

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
tool so talking about coolant let's go

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.809 
tool so talking about coolant let's go
around<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.859> side<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.190> machine<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.609> take<00:03:20.760> a

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
around the side of the machine to take a

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.000 
around the side of the machine to take a
look<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.630> guys<00:03:21.810> have<00:03:21.989> actually<00:03:22.170> redesigned

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
look you guys have actually redesigned

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.400 
look you guys have actually redesigned
this<00:03:23.160> whole<00:03:23.370> section<00:03:23.790> as<00:03:23.940> well<00:03:24.150> right<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:24.959> what

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
this whole section as well right so what

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.840 
this whole section as well right so what
we<00:03:25.530> did<00:03:25.650> was<00:03:25.889> we<00:03:25.920> brought<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.459> back<00:03:26.609> of<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
we did was we brought the back of the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.819 
we did was we brought the back of the
tank<00:03:27.060> out<00:03:27.299> we<00:03:27.780> dropped<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.260> bottom<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.680> little

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
tank out we dropped the bottom a little

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.860 
tank out we dropped the bottom a little
we<00:03:29.280> brought<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.609> colon<00:03:29.910> level<00:03:30.180> up<00:03:30.329> that's<00:03:30.750> how

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
we brought the colon level up that's how

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.360 
we brought the colon level up that's how
we<00:03:30.930> doubled<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.350> full<00:03:31.530> volume<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.280> that

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
we doubled the full volume and that

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.849 
we doubled the full volume and that
allowed<00:03:32.700> us<00:03:32.730> room<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.269> put<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:34.290> standard<00:03:34.650> tank

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
allowed us room to put the standard tank

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.699 
allowed us room to put the standard tank
here<00:03:35.099> with<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.280> TSC<00:03:35.790> side<00:03:36.150> by<00:03:36.329> side<00:03:36.540> or<00:03:36.840> pump<00:03:37.530> in

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
here with a TSC side by side or pump in

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.740 
here with a TSC side by side or pump in
our<00:03:37.889> standard<00:03:38.489> high<00:03:38.940> flow<00:03:39.180> tank<00:03:39.450> right<00:03:39.630> off

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
our standard high flow tank right off

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.509 
our standard high flow tank right off
our<00:03:39.900> VMC's<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.950> looks<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.310> lot<00:03:41.489> different

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
our VMC's and this looks a lot different

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.550 
our VMC's and this looks a lot different
and<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> lot<00:03:42.180> more<00:03:42.239> user-friendly<00:03:42.780> because

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
and a lot more user-friendly because

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.629 
and a lot more user-friendly because
where<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:43.980> used<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.250> have<00:03:44.400> some

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
where you used to have some

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.360 
where you used to have some
interferences<00:03:45.359> now<00:03:46.019> when<00:03:46.319> you<00:03:46.440> do<00:03:46.620> add<00:03:46.799> TSE

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
interferences now when you do add TSE

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.559 
interferences now when you do add TSE
you<00:03:47.910> drop<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.299> straight<00:03:48.419> down<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:49.019> don't

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
you drop it straight down you don't

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.780 
you drop it straight down you don't
anyway<00:03:50.319> nothing<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.769> worry<00:03:50.950> about<00:03:51.219> right<00:03:51.609> we

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
anyway nothing to worry about right we

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.459 
anyway nothing to worry about right we
also<00:03:51.909> changed<00:03:52.390> how<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.540> coolant<00:03:52.930> flow<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.349> how

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:53.469 
also changed how the coolant flow is how

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.440 
also changed how the coolant flow is how
we<00:03:53.530> port<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.040> coolant<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.579> that<00:03:55.030> allow<00:03:55.239> us<00:03:55.329> to

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
we port the coolant and that allow us to

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.089 
we port the coolant and that allow us to
get<00:03:55.540> rid<00:03:55.659> of<00:03:55.689> the<00:03:55.780> filter<00:03:56.079> and<00:03:56.290> that's<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:56.920> big

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
get rid of the filter and that's a big

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.369 
get rid of the filter and that's a big
deal<00:03:57.249> because<00:03:57.310> now<00:03:57.790> you've<00:03:58.030> got<00:03:58.239> one<00:03:58.269> less<00:03:58.719> guy

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
deal because now you've got one less guy

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.899 
deal because now you've got one less guy
in<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.709> shop<00:03:59.920> having<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.400> come<00:04:00.549> back<00:04:00.579> and

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
in the shop having to come back and

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.970 
in the shop having to come back and
check<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.120> bilge<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.659> daily<00:04:02.349> or<00:04:02.379> weekly<00:04:02.499> ride

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
check that bilge a daily or weekly ride

morning<00:04:25.449> before<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:25.840> came<00:04:26.289> down<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.860> was

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
morning before you came down I was

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.189 
morning before you came down I was
walking<00:04:27.520> around<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.849> machine<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.479> what's

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
walking around the machine and what's

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.650 
walking around the machine and what's
really<00:04:29.500> obvious<00:04:29.949> is<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.520> larger<00:04:31.060> opening<00:04:31.509> in

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
really obvious is the larger opening in

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.770 
really obvious is the larger opening in
the<00:04:31.840> coolant<00:04:32.800> tank<00:04:33.009> right<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.150> old<00:04:34.389> mini<00:04:34.599> mill

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
the coolant tank right the old mini mill

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.999 
the coolant tank right the old mini mill
was<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:34.930> little<00:04:35.139> hard<00:04:35.259> to<00:04:35.349> clean<00:04:35.560> out<00:04:35.710> we<00:04:35.889> had

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
was a little hard to clean out we had

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.390 
was a little hard to clean out we had
big<00:04:36.280> opening<00:04:36.729> song<00:04:36.970> on<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.990> sides<00:04:38.370> because<00:04:39.370> of

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
big opening song on the sides because of

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.770 
big opening song on the sides because of
the<00:04:39.580> longer<00:04:39.789> tank<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.389> we<00:04:40.449> could<00:04:40.599> move

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
the longer tank and we could move

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.900 
the longer tank and we could move
everything<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.470> we<00:04:41.530> got<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.919> lubrication

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
everything and we got the lubrication

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.820 
everything and we got the lubrication
system<00:04:43.389> off<00:04:43.509> the<00:04:43.690> back<00:04:43.900> we<00:04:44.139> added<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.470> giant

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
system off the back we added a giant

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.990 
system off the back we added a giant
hole<00:04:44.949> in<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.099> back<00:04:45.310> too<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:45.639> you<00:04:45.729> can<00:04:45.759> take<00:04:45.970> a

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
hole in the back too so you can take a

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.600 
hole in the back too so you can take a
shot<00:04:46.270> back<00:04:46.449> took<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.020> long<00:04:47.259> nozzle<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:48.070> easily

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
shot back took a long nozzle and easily

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.860 
shot back took a long nozzle and easily
get<00:04:48.789> every<00:04:49.000> corner<00:04:49.270> of<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.389> machine<00:04:49.690> without

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
get every corner of the machine without

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.020 
get every corner of the machine without
much<00:04:50.110> effort<00:04:50.259> that's<00:04:50.949> a<00:04:51.160> big<00:04:51.310> improvement<00:04:51.550> I

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
much effort that's a big improvement I

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.760 
much effort that's a big improvement I
know<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.449> guys<00:04:52.599> made<00:04:52.840> some<00:04:52.870> changes<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.530> the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
know you guys made some changes to the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.460 
know you guys made some changes to the
honor<00:04:53.979> so<00:04:54.759> a<00:04:55.030> little<00:04:55.630> bit<00:04:55.750> about<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.080> history

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
honor so a little bit about the history

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.659 
honor so a little bit about the history
on<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.680> order<00:04:56.919> of<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.039> many<00:04:57.220> military

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
on the order of the many military

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.879 
on the order of the many military
remember<00:04:58.030> correctly<00:04:58.419> at<00:04:58.750> first<00:04:59.380> we<00:04:59.590> didn't

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
remember correctly at first we didn't

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.890 
remember correctly at first we didn't
have<00:05:00.009> it<00:05:00.190> then<00:05:00.400> we<00:05:00.669> added<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.060> auger<00:05:01.300> so

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
have it then we added the auger so

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.330 
have it then we added the auger so
what's<00:05:02.229> different<00:05:02.590> about<00:05:02.650> this<00:05:02.949> on<00:05:03.190> the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
what's different about this on the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.610 
what's different about this on the
newly-redesigned<00:05:04.169> well<00:05:05.169> you're<00:05:05.289> right<00:05:05.440> we

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
newly-redesigned well you're right we

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.439 
newly-redesigned well you're right we
added<00:05:05.949> the<00:05:06.070> auger<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.400> few<00:05:06.580> years<00:05:06.789> after<00:05:07.030> the

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
added the auger a few years after the

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:08.939 
added the auger a few years after the
introduction<00:05:07.840> of<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:07.960> mini<00:05:08.139> mill<00:05:08.349> it<00:05:08.830> was

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
introduction of the mini mill it was

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.159 
introduction of the mini mill it was
kind<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.190> a<00:05:09.280> compromise<00:05:09.849> it<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.570> savage<00:05:10.930> that

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
kind of a compromise it is savage that

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.350 
kind of a compromise it is savage that
on<00:05:11.320> top<00:05:11.590> of<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.009> tank<00:05:12.280> so<00:05:12.789> with<00:05:12.940> a<00:05:13.000> new<00:05:13.120> tank

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
on top of the tank so with a new tank

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.450 
on top of the tank so with a new tank
we've<00:05:13.570> actually<00:05:13.810> got<00:05:14.229> the<00:05:14.259> auger<00:05:14.530> lower<00:05:14.919> down

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
we've actually got the auger lower down

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.670 
we've actually got the auger lower down
in<00:05:15.550> the<00:05:15.580> coolant<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.060> little<00:05:16.330> we<00:05:17.169> shape<00:05:17.500> the

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
in the coolant a little we shape the

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.490 
in the coolant a little we shape the
tank<00:05:17.949> for<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.490> auger<00:05:18.669> so<00:05:19.599> it's<00:05:19.810> as<00:05:20.199> long<00:05:20.349> as

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
tank for the auger so it's as long as

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.730 
tank for the auger so it's as long as
designed<00:05:20.919> around<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.490> auger<00:05:21.820> ride<00:05:22.000> exactly

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
designed around the auger ride exactly

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.740 
designed around the auger ride exactly
and<00:05:23.740> it<00:05:23.860> does<00:05:24.009> a<00:05:24.039> much<00:05:24.280> better<00:05:24.310> job<00:05:24.639> of<00:05:25.270> eating

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
and it does a much better job of eating

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.450 
and it does a much better job of eating
the<00:05:25.840> chips<00:05:26.050> not<00:05:26.259> oh<00:05:26.500> it<00:05:26.620> does<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:27.009> does<00:05:27.220> it's

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
the chips not oh it does it does it's

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.300 
the chips not oh it does it does it's
more<00:05:27.669> like<00:05:27.849> a<00:05:27.880> regular

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
more like a regular

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.339 
more like a regular
something<00:05:30.240> that<00:05:30.360> I'm<00:05:30.479> used<00:05:30.509> to<00:05:30.810> seeing<00:05:30.870> on<00:05:31.229> the

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
something that I'm used to seeing on the

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:32.960 
something that I'm used to seeing on the
verticals<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.009> now<00:05:32.129> I<00:05:32.159> see<00:05:32.400> on<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:32.580> mini<00:05:32.759> mill

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
verticals and now I see on the mini mill

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.899 
verticals and now I see on the mini mill
is<00:05:33.629> this<00:05:33.930> lubrication<00:05:34.620> chemical<00:05:35.099> right<00:05:35.639> so

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
is this lubrication chemical right so

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.339 
is this lubrication chemical right so
the<00:05:36.000> mid<00:05:36.150> loop<00:05:36.330> system<00:05:36.720> is<00:05:36.840> really<00:05:37.020> kind<00:05:37.319> of

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
the mid loop system is really kind of

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.020 
the mid loop system is really kind of
the<00:05:37.470> heart<00:05:37.500> of<00:05:37.830> our<00:05:37.979> reliability<00:05:38.490> efforts

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030
