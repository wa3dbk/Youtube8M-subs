missing from this movie I enjoyed the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.820 
missing from this movie I enjoyed the
movie<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.809> definitely<00:01:04.080> laughed<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.530> lot<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.710> I

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
movie I definitely laughed a lot and I

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.800 
movie I definitely laughed a lot and I
thought<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.040> was<00:01:05.100> funny<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> story<00:01:06.600> was<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
thought it was funny but the story was a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960 
thought it was funny but the story was a
little<00:01:07.020> boring<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.650> overall<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.729> thought<00:01:08.880> they

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
little boring and overall I thought they

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.399 
little boring and overall I thought they
could<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.180> done<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:09.659> better<00:01:09.720> job<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
could have done a lot better job with it

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.830 
could have done a lot better job with it
if<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.369> minions<00:01:11.760> were<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.510> film

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
if the minions were not in this film

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.660 
if the minions were not in this film
this<00:01:13.290> movie<00:01:13.350> would<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:13.770> utter<00:01:14.040> crap<00:01:14.369> because

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this movie would be utter crap because

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.039 
this movie would be utter crap because
the<00:01:14.880> minions<00:01:15.210> made<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.570> movie<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.900> that's

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the minions made this movie and that's

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.600 
the minions made this movie and that's
why<00:01:16.200> they're<00:01:16.350> doing<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.680> spin-off<00:01:16.890> movie<00:01:17.430> with

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
why they're doing a spin-off movie with

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.780 
why they're doing a spin-off movie with
