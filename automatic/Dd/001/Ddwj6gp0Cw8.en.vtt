quality<00:00:39.960> /<00:00:40.950> chemistry<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.850> because<00:00:42.690> I'd

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
quality / chemistry and because I'd

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.049 
quality / chemistry and because I'd
rather<00:00:43.260> play<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:43.739> gold<00:00:44.100> players<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> very

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
rather play with gold players for a very

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.709 
rather play with gold players for a very
solid<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.160> rather<00:00:47.160> than<00:00:47.370> play<00:00:47.579> with<00:00:47.760> bronzes

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
solid and rather than play with bronzes

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.779 
solid and rather than play with bronzes
you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.079> make<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.379> hundred<00:00:49.800> chemistry<00:00:50.250> but

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
you can make a hundred chemistry but

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.250 
you can make a hundred chemistry but
chances<00:00:51.329> are<00:00:51.449> you'd<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> use<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> lot<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
chances are you'd have to use a lot of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.470 
chances are you'd have to use a lot of
bronzes<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.829> Silver's<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.489> wanted<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.300> as

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
bronzes and Silver's I wanted to get as

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.180 
bronzes and Silver's I wanted to get as
many<00:00:54.629> gold<00:00:54.989> players<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.680> I'm<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> have

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
many gold players but I'm going to have

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.279 
many gold players but I'm going to have
fun<00:00:56.399> using<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.030> over<00:00:57.510> left<00:00:57.660> back<00:00:57.780> position<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
fun using so over left back position I

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.830 
fun using so over left back position I
have<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.680> Samoa<00:00:59.070> he<00:00:59.579> has<00:01:00.030> played<00:01:00.300> left<00:01:00.660> back

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
have a Samoa he has played left back

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
have a Samoa he has played left back
before<00:01:01.230> four<00:01:01.469> year<00:01:01.649> enters<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.309> think<00:01:02.460> he

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
before four year enters and I think he

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.219 
before four year enters and I think he
had<00:01:02.670> an<00:01:02.789> in-form<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> last<00:01:03.899> year's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
had an in-form on one of the last year's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
had an in-form on one of the last year's
FIFA's<00:01:04.650> maybe<00:01:04.949> at<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.880> left<00:01:06.060> back<00:01:06.210> position

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
FIFA's maybe at the left back position

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.230 
FIFA's maybe at the left back position
so<00:01:06.780> he's<00:01:06.960> gonna<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.260> filling<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:07.979> I

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
still might get forward because that's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.330 
still might get forward because that's
what<00:01:55.140> players<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.649> tend<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.219> this

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
there before but it's one of those

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.230 
there before but it's one of those
positions<00:02:28.680> where<00:02:29.280> he's<00:02:29.460> got<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.820> stats<00:02:30.060> to

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
positions where he's got the stats to

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.210 
positions where he's got the stats to
actually<00:02:30.690> play<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.020> position<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.650> why<00:02:32.010> not

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220

really difficult to make a team it I've
spent<00:02:54.240> quite<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.690> long<00:02:54.930> time<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.320> try<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.590> get

as quite as many quality players into
this<00:02:57.930> team<00:02:58.110> as<00:02:58.230> possible<00:02:58.650> but<00:02:59.130> also<00:02:59.340> keep<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
this team as possible but also keep the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.970 
this team as possible but also keep the
chemistry<00:03:00.420> rather<00:03:00.690> high<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.500> decided<00:03:01.860> to

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
chemistry rather high and I decided to

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.120 
chemistry rather high and I decided to
go<00:03:02.070> with<00:03:02.280> wilfried<00:03:02.940> bony<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.620> striker<00:03:04.620> or<00:03:04.920> the

little<00:04:59.580> less<00:04:59.760> sweat<00:05:00.030> even<00:05:00.390> divisions<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.080> you

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
little less sweat even divisions and you

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.050 
little less sweat even divisions and you
just<00:05:01.590> see<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:01.860> couple<00:05:02.130> more<00:05:02.580> teams<00:05:02.760> that<00:05:02.970> you

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
just see a couple more teams that you

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.120 
just see a couple more teams that you
wouldn't<00:05:03.390> usually<00:05:03.600> see<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.290> finally<00:05:04.860> my

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
wouldn't usually see and finally my

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.830 
wouldn't usually see and finally my
goalkeeper<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:05.760> copper<00:05:06.150> I<00:05:06.270> think<00:05:06.300> it<00:05:06.570> goes<00:05:06.660> for

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
goalkeeper is copper I think it goes for

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.900 
goalkeeper is copper I think it goes for
about<00:05:06.900> twenty-five<00:05:07.680> thousand<00:05:08.400> coins<00:05:08.550> at<00:05:08.820> the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
about twenty-five thousand coins at the

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.210 
about twenty-five thousand coins at the
moment<00:05:09.300> but<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:10.050> pulled<00:05:10.290> mine<00:05:10.470> out<00:05:10.500> of<00:05:10.950> a<00:05:11.010> pack

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
moment but I pulled mine out of a pack

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.770 
moment but I pulled mine out of a pack
when<00:05:11.400> I<00:05:11.430> went<00:05:11.640> on<00:05:11.760> my<00:05:11.790> little<00:05:12.150> silver<00:05:12.570> binge

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
when I went on my little silver binge

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.000 
when I went on my little silver binge
and<00:05:13.110> so<00:05:13.980> I<00:05:14.010> got<00:05:14.730> him<00:05:14.940> on<00:05:15.180> very<00:05:15.750> luckily<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.350> I'd

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
and so I got him on very luckily and I'd

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.380 
and so I got him on very luckily and I'd
be<00:05:17.220> able<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.430> make<00:05:17.550> quite<00:05:17.730> a<00:05:17.790> lot<00:05:17.970> of<00:05:18.000> profit<00:05:18.180> on

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
be able to make quite a lot of profit on

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.880 
be able to make quite a lot of profit on
him<00:05:18.510> but<00:05:19.020> guys<00:05:19.200> that's<00:05:19.440> going<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:19.680> be<00:05:19.740> the

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
him but guys that's going to be the

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.100 
him but guys that's going to be the
squad<00:05:20.160> 87<00:05:20.940> chemistry<00:05:21.390> if<00:05:21.540> you<00:05:21.720> move<00:05:21.900> some

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
squad 87 chemistry if you move some

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.300 
squad 87 chemistry if you move some
players<00:05:22.260> rounds<00:05:22.590> you<00:05:22.650> can<00:05:22.710> actually<00:05:23.100> get<00:05:23.250> the

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
players rounds you can actually get the

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.820 
players rounds you can actually get the
chemistry<00:05:23.700> a<00:05:23.730> little<00:05:24.180> bit<00:05:24.300> higher<00:05:24.480> but<00:05:24.900> I'd

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
chemistry a little bit higher but I'd

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.950 
chemistry a little bit higher but I'd
rather<00:05:26.010> mantari<00:05:26.640> in<00:05:26.640> the<00:05:26.880> middle<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.300> have<00:05:27.930> a

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
rather mantari in the middle and have a

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.100 
rather mantari in the middle and have a
KP<00:05:28.590> be<00:05:28.740> on<00:05:28.920> full<00:05:29.760> chemistry<00:05:30.480> and<00:05:30.690> of<00:05:30.840> course

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
KP be on full chemistry and of course

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.020 
KP be on full chemistry and of course
montara<00:05:31.740> with<00:05:32.040> everyone<00:05:32.550> would<00:05:32.670> get<00:05:32.790> higher

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
montara with everyone would get higher

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.870 
montara with everyone would get higher
chemistry<00:05:33.630> once<00:05:34.350> they<00:05:35.160> played<00:05:35.430> for<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.670> ten

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
chemistry once they played for the ten

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.210 
chemistry once they played for the ten
games<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:36.330> got<00:05:36.630> loyalty<00:05:36.840> so<00:05:37.320> if<00:05:37.920> the

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
games and got loyalty so if the

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.480 
games and got loyalty so if the
chemistry<00:05:38.640> would<00:05:38.790> rise<00:05:39.030> into<00:05:39.360> V<00:05:39.990> about<00:05:40.590> 95<00:05:41.460> I

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
chemistry would rise into V about 95 I

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.850 
chemistry would rise into V about 95 I
think<00:05:41.940> it<00:05:42.090> would<00:05:42.240> because<00:05:42.630> Bonilla<00:05:43.110> soiree<00:05:43.530> on

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
think it would because Bonilla soiree on

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.710 
think it would because Bonilla soiree on
for<00:05:44.100> chemistry<00:05:44.430> so<00:05:44.580> yeah<00:05:44.760> you'd<00:05:44.970> get<00:05:45.150> 95

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
for chemistry so yeah you'd get 95

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.680 
for chemistry so yeah you'd get 95
chemistry<00:05:46.620> from<00:05:47.130> this<00:05:47.370> team<00:05:47.640> at<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:48.150> end<00:05:48.330> so

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
chemistry from this team at the end so

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.080 
chemistry from this team at the end so
it's<00:05:49.290> not<00:05:49.470> too<00:05:49.680> bad<00:05:49.950> and<00:05:50.220> I<00:05:50.790> definitely

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
it's not too bad and I definitely

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.450 
it's not too bad and I definitely
recommend<00:05:51.330> you<00:05:51.750> guys<00:05:51.930> Wow<00:05:52.830> see<00:05:53.100> what<00:05:53.280> the

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
recommend you guys Wow see what the

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.310 
recommend you guys Wow see what the
squad<00:05:53.670> builders<00:05:54.030> like<00:05:54.240> and<00:05:54.450> see<00:05:55.080> what<00:05:55.230> the

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
squad builders like and see what the

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.820 
squad builders like and see what the
gameplay<00:05:55.620> is<00:05:55.680> like<00:05:55.920> and<00:05:57.290> judge<00:05:58.290> for<00:05:58.740> yourself

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
gameplay is like and judge for yourself

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.350 
gameplay is like and judge for yourself
and<00:05:59.310> then<00:05:59.460> maybe<00:05:59.670> going<00:05:59.880> to<00:05:59.970> try<00:06:00.090> it<00:06:00.150> out<00:06:00.330> if

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
and then maybe going to try it out if

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.850 
and then maybe going to try it out if
that's<00:06:00.840> the<00:06:01.050> sort<00:06:01.320> of<00:06:01.410> team<00:06:01.680> you're<00:06:01.830> looking

you have enjoyed this little squad

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.860 
you have enjoyed this little squad
builder<00:06:20.550> because<00:06:20.700> this<00:06:21.240> took<00:06:21.420> me<00:06:21.480> a<00:06:21.570> long<00:06:21.810> time

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
builder because this took me a long time

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.290 
builder because this took me a long time
to<00:06:22.110> make<00:06:22.440> a<00:06:22.650> six<00:06:23.220> chemistry<00:06:23.670> it<00:06:23.820> doesn't<00:06:24.120> seem

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
to make a six chemistry it doesn't seem

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.240 
to make a six chemistry it doesn't seem
like<00:06:24.330> it's<00:06:24.660> that<00:06:24.750> difficult<00:06:24.990> but<00:06:25.830> I<00:06:25.860> did<00:06:26.100> have

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
like it's that difficult but I did have

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.710 
like it's that difficult but I did have
to<00:06:26.310> make<00:06:26.520> a<00:06:26.550> lot<00:06:26.730> of<00:06:26.790> choices<00:06:27.030> on<00:06:27.450> where<00:06:27.690> I
