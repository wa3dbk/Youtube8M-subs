00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.100 
everyone loves John Cena apparently I
don't<00:02:12.740> mind<00:02:13.070> him<00:02:13.250> but<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.390> mean<00:02:14.870> we<00:02:15.020> already

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
don't mind him but I mean we already

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.210 
don't mind him but I mean we already
good<00:02:15.350> storyline<00:02:17.350> like<00:02:18.350> because<00:02:18.680> he<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
good storyline like because he is the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.400 
good storyline like because he is the
face<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.490> role<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.270> he<00:02:20.510> will<00:02:20.660> win<00:02:20.900> only<00:02:21.200> a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
face of role and he will win only a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.730 
face of role and he will win only a
thousand<00:02:21.980> FF<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:22.520> that'd<00:02:22.850> be<00:02:23.090> pretty<00:02:23.390> cool

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
thousand FF so that'd be pretty cool

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.200 
thousand FF so that'd be pretty cool
some<00:02:24.740> people<00:02:24.980> might<00:02:25.070> disagree<00:02:25.220> saying<00:02:25.820> punk

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
some people might disagree saying punk

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.810 
some people might disagree saying punk

face of all I yeah uses the face you
when<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.020> think<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.350> right<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.560> think<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.010> John

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
when I think of right I think of John

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.020 
when I think of right I think of John
Cena<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:38.060> punk<00:02:38.990> but<00:02:39.440> more<00:02:39.830> John<00:02:40.010> Cena<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.940> that

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
Cena a punk but more John Cena and that

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.470 
Cena a punk but more John Cena and that
would<00:02:41.210> be<00:02:41.300> really<00:02:41.480> cool<00:02:41.780> oh<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:43.310> wish<00:02:44.270> it's

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
would be really cool oh I wish it's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.850 
would be really cool oh I wish it's
going<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.660> be<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.780> really<00:02:45.020> long<00:02:45.140> match<00:02:45.500> but<00:02:45.830> I

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
going to be a really long match but I

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.340 
going to be a really long match but I
don't<00:02:46.160> think<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.490> gonna<00:02:46.610> be<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:46.760> long

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
don't think it's gonna be that long

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.010 
don't think it's gonna be that long
because<00:02:48.350> if<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.650> look<00:02:48.830> at<00:02:49.010> their<00:02:50.020> that's

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
because if you look at their that's

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.500 
because if you look at their that's
SummerSlam<00:02:51.740> of<00:02:51.890> money<00:02:52.100> in<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.370> bank<00:02:52.580> they

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
SummerSlam of money in the bank they

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.570 
SummerSlam of money in the bank they
were<00:02:53.570> pretty<00:02:54.170> long<00:02:54.560> matches<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:55.040> they<00:02:55.340> did

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
were pretty long matches that they did

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.600 
were pretty long matches that they did
their<00:02:55.790> finishes<00:02:56.420> loads<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:57.080> times<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:57.770> I

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
their finishes loads of times and I

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.330 
their finishes loads of times and I
really<00:02:59.150> wish<00:02:59.630> it<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.020> be<00:03:00.050> like<00:03:00.290> that<00:03:00.320> but<00:03:00.770> it's

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
really wish it to be like that but it's

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.110 
really wish it to be like that but it's
raw<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.600> think<00:03:02.810> it's<00:03:02.990> just<00:03:03.110> going<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.470> be

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
raw and I think it's just going to be

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.050 
raw and I think it's just going to be
worried<00:03:05.120> about<00:03:05.560> 20<00:03:06.560> minutes<00:03:06.770> in<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.160> end<00:03:07.310> but

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
worried about 20 minutes in the end but

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.090 
worried about 20 minutes in the end but
I<00:03:08.090> hope<00:03:08.209> it's<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.540> bit<00:03:08.750> more<00:03:09.020> because<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.950> would

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
I hope it's a bit more because it would

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.449 
I hope it's a bit more because it would
be<00:03:10.280> pretty<00:03:10.640> cool<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:12.070> don't<00:03:13.070> know<00:03:13.160> what<00:03:13.280> other

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
be pretty cool I don't know what other

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.100 
be pretty cool I don't know what other
matches<00:03:13.940> are<00:03:14.090> going<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.330> happen<00:03:14.600> i<00:03:14.720> think<00:03:14.989> the

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110
