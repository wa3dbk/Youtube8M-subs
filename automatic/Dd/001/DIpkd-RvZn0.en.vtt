00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
maybe pepper will come up now hopefully

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.720 
maybe pepper will come up now hopefully
you'll<00:02:22.910> have<00:02:23.060> had<00:02:23.240> even<00:02:23.390> longer<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:24.230> rub<00:02:24.730> your

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
you'll have had even longer to rub your

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.900 
you'll have had even longer to rub your
pep<00:02:26.630> your<00:02:26.870> spoon<00:02:27.260> with<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.100> wall<00:02:28.250> and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
pep your spoon with the wall and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.910 
pep your spoon with the wall and
optimally<00:02:29.750> all<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:30.170> your<00:02:30.290> pepper<00:02:30.500> will<00:02:30.740> come

optimally all of your pepper will come

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.980 
optimally all of your pepper will come
up<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.310> might<00:02:31.580> have<00:02:31.610> even<00:02:31.820> put<00:02:32.180> too<00:02:32.540> much<00:02:32.750> on

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
up so I might have even put too much on

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.110 
up so I might have even put too much on
so<00:02:33.350> see<00:02:33.680> how<00:02:33.980> it's<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.340> important<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.910> not<00:02:35.060> put

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
so see how it's so important to not put

00:02:35.120 --> 00:03:17.760 
so see how it's so important to not put
too<00:02:35.600> much<00:02:35.920> okay

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.980 

and<00:03:17.890> then<00:03:18.550> you<00:03:18.820> can<00:03:18.970> put<00:03:19.150> your<00:03:19.180> empty<00:03:19.690> salt

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
and then you can put your empty salt

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.630 
and then you can put your empty salt
container<00:03:20.470> back<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.190> there

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
container back in there

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.070 
container back in there
and<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.940> kid<00:03:22.120> with<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.300> next<00:03:22.690> service<00:03:22.930> will

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
and the kid with the next service will

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.230 
and the kid with the next service will
be<00:03:23.140> responsible<00:03:23.680> for<00:03:23.830> getting<00:03:24.010> more<00:03:24.280> salt<00:03:24.550> so

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
be responsible for getting more salt so

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.140 
be responsible for getting more salt so
that's<00:03:25.450> how<00:03:25.600> you<00:03:25.660> do<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.930> left
