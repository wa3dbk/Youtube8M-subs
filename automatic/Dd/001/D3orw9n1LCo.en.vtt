now<00:01:19.990> we<00:01:20.049> have<00:01:20.289> a<00:01:20.320> different<00:01:21.039> layout<00:01:21.430> compared

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
now we have a different layout compared

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.819 
now we have a different layout compared
to<00:01:22.149> last<00:01:22.390> year<00:01:22.689> with<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.899> shortcut<00:01:23.380> that<00:01:23.530> brings

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
to last year with a shortcut that brings

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.999 
to last year with a shortcut that brings
us<00:01:24.039> to<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.520> next<00:01:24.670> chicane<00:01:25.530> we<00:01:26.530> have<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.770> lot<00:01:26.979> of

Salt<00:01:36.000> Lake<00:01:36.060> City<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> circuit<00:01:37.200> which<00:01:37.380> is

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
Salt Lake City is a circuit which is

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.530 
Salt Lake City is a circuit which is
anti-clockwise<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.880> means<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.329> more

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
anti-clockwise that means you have more

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.200 
anti-clockwise that means you have more
left<00:01:39.750> corners<00:01:40.290> which<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.829> unusual<00:01:41.399> and<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
left corners which is unusual and it's a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
left corners which is unusual and it's a
lot<00:01:42.420> harder<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> neck<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
lot harder for the neck and you have to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
lot harder for the neck and you have to
practice<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.340> neck<00:01:44.810> specifically<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:45.990> this
