00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.810

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.990

 dryer as serve to remove the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.190
 static of the clothes also leave you a 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.250
 nice smell 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.280
 but the best the best the best of these 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.199
 wipes dryer is 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.199
 which are absolutely free 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.520
 you will see how easy it is to prepare 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:56.090
 our wipes for the dryer only 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.700
 we are going to need the fabric softener 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.100
 remember that at the end of the video they 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.030
 is the link to see how you can 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.410
 prepare and now what we are going to do is 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.810
 use pieces of t-shirt fabric 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.720
 preference that they are cotton and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.550
 let's put in a plastic container 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.550
 and we are going to add the softener 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.270
 we throw so that they impregnate that 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.270
 wet 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.090
 We put several I prefer to have 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.369
 different 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.000
 cloths in case one of the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.980
 clothes and then one stays looking 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.150
 we throw another little we put another 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.150
 and a little bit 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.479
 and the last one then 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.979
 we submerge them well so that everyone 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.180
 moisten and we have them near the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:06.729
 dryer and when we are going to use them 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.729
 we're just going to drain what's good 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.260
 and we're going to put one of these inside 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.260
 the dryer
