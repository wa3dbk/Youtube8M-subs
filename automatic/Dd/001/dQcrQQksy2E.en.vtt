00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
opportunity is past the post a little

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.660 
opportunity is past the post a little
bit<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.680> pressure<00:02:43.890> there<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.370> ball<00:02:44.550> has

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
bit of pressure there and the ball has

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.910 
bit of pressure there and the ball has
been<00:02:44.730> given<00:02:45.510> away<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:45.989> quickly<00:02:46.319> won<00:02:46.680> back

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.330 
the brake is on
it<00:02:51.510> could<00:02:51.720> be<00:02:51.870> something<00:02:52.320> here<00:02:52.350> he's<00:02:52.860> gone<00:02:53.100> for

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
it could be something here he's gone for

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.550 
it could be something here he's gone for
the<00:02:53.430> shot<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.880> scored

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560

it's<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.130> very<00:03:00.340> nicely<00:03:00.610> weighted<00:03:01.060> pass

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
it's a very nicely weighted pass

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.010 
it's a very nicely weighted pass
possibilities<00:03:03.940> are<00:03:04.090> simple<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.720> overlap

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
possibilities are simple and the overlap

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:26.630 
possibilities are simple and the overlap
here<00:03:05.380> always<00:03:06.190> close

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640
