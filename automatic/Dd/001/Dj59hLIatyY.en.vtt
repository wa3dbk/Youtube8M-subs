00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.040

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.939
 smartphone that you will have seen that I have 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.939
 hung him 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.300
 the unboxing and well here I asked for a 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.180
 sheath 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.880
 ebay group seller 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.910
 a group your mobile in the royal city me 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.950
 it has taken 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:56.950
 It is 23 days per letter and good 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.739
 it's a transparent cover and I think if not 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.420
 I remember badly that comes with protective 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.930
 and everything for without protector you get for 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.930
 with short 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.300
 some documentation 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:18.060
 without protector tell you that it goes out by 229 and 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.060
 with protector goes out for 259 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.020
 here we have my mother sent me two 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.859
 covers 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.859
 and it was only one 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.820
 my mother, two covers that have given me 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.200
 it gives me that they have sent me 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.040
 the covers of another person 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.590
 the truth is thanked for two points and 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.900
 two protectors of that to the valid one or 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.980
 they have put in my package what was going 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.500
 for someone else 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.159
 well something that I say 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.689
 here we have we are going to open a subtle 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.030
 I would appreciate it by uploading this video 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.479
 Clear 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.510
 here we have the transparent cover and 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.190
 others in bone I did not want to spend for the 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.740
 nine euros and the peak costs 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.220
 originals and other covers that these 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.959
 buttons let's say they were staying this was 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.760
 like a little window a draft like that of 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.490
 the camera and you had to press the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.640
 inside I did not have push buttons like this 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.250
 have here for the speakers and the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.890
 microphone for the micro usb here for the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.780
 microphone here for her and here for the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.160
 camera and here the buttons we are going to 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.970
 to approve it has a very good look 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.970
 to put it 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.290
 so we have left is pretty good now 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.450
 the transparent I suppose with the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.920
 time and use and according to what you work 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.920
 it will get dirty 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.900
 okay the buttons 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.290
 it looks very good, the truth is founded 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.150
 of all that I saw and the typical one of 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.489
 silicone like the one I have in my 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.220
 smartphone that I do not know right now where 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.220
 it's the one around here you're typical 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.250
 they had as I did the impression of 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.200
 the photos that came to light that is the 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.300
 opaque covers and the light came in because 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.690
 the picture was wrong like this upside down 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.300
 the light came in 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.160
 well it's not a little up forgiveness came in 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.460
 light over here by these little holes and you 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.960
 I looked like that like this is staying 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.550
 value the buttons remained on the air 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.890
 so I wanted one that marked 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.990
 then I saw that I had here reliefs 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.260
 and I say this one has the buttons here 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.640
 in relief I will ask for it and apparently 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.730
 well, well 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.340
 I only asked for one but good 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.190
 well, if the piece of paper was coming 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.110
 as for another recipient here I have 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.110
 another I'll thank you uploading the video 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.700
 and the protectors that we're going to get one 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.739
 we remove this 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.550
 the protectors that I suppose you 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.550
 will be worth 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:20.360
 this would be such that 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:23.840
 here leaves us there has been removed here we 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.130
 let the hole put the speaker for the 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.130
 flash and for the camera 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.330
 I'm not focusing 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.839
 It also covers everything 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:42.540
 so, well, guys, I hope that I have 

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:46.380
 liked this case you can see how it looks 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.670
 you will arrive so I have two for 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.030
 to show 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.710
 when you get this way the case and good in theory 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.110
 a sheath and a protector hamid have been 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.870
 due to wrong and they sent me two 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.390
 covers and two protectors but as I say 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.080
 I would say the seller and I will tell him that I have 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.379
 made a video they say 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.879
 although it will be fine I guess I've passed 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.650
 so, well, guys, I hope that I have 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:15.980
 liked you know that you can acquire this 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:20.639

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.410
 259 with cases and transparent protector 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.570
 just do they have a color at the moment 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.430
 I know if in the future I would attack with others 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.040
 colors but it has a very good track to 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.230
 other wheels as you put in a time 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.689
 if we put villÃ©n it is ok but it has 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.550
 no pint 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:36.470
 and it is not 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.660
 is enough to protect the 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.110
 smartphone that does not hit the screen 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:46.710
 to protect the camera 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.710
 all the holes so well done 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.810
