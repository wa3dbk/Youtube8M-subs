fret so you hear this then I'm going to

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.700 
fret so you hear this then I'm going to
bend<00:01:39.670> up<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:39.880> semitone<00:01:40.299> to<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.869> minor<00:01:41.170> third

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
bend up a semitone to the minor third

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.760 
bend up a semitone to the minor third
so<00:01:43.710> yes<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> way<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.000> get<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.420> flow

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
so yes so the way to get this to flow

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.370 
so yes so the way to get this to flow
cleanly<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.150> forget<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:51.930> picking

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
cleanly is to just forget your picking

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.240 
cleanly is to just forget your picking
because<00:01:52.530> you're<00:01:52.740> not<00:01:52.830> picking<00:01:53.040> you're

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
because you're not picking you're

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.490 
because you're not picking you're
sweeping<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:54.210> imagine<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:54.960> your<00:01:55.200> pick

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
sweeping and just imagine that your pick

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.010 
sweeping and just imagine that your pick
is<00:01:55.740> now<00:01:55.950> paintbrush<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.880> run<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.720> over<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
is now paintbrush and run it over the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.200 
is now paintbrush and run it over the
strings<00:01:58.350> now<00:01:59.010> you'll<00:01:59.130> notice<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.760> I<00:01:59.940> give<00:02:00.119> you

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
strings now you'll notice if I give you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.390 
strings now you'll notice if I give you
a<00:02:00.240> close-up<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.810> second<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.380> my<00:02:02.070> pick

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
a close-up in a second that my pick

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.570 
a close-up in a second that my pick
moves<00:02:03.300> freely<00:02:03.810> between<00:02:04.170> my<00:02:04.259> fingers<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.830> I'm

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
moves freely between my fingers and I'm

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.730 
moves freely between my fingers and I'm
simply<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.270> moving<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:06.630> arm<00:02:06.990> down<00:02:07.560> across

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
simply just moving my arm down across

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.430 
simply just moving my arm down across
the<00:02:07.920> strings<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.640> all<00:02:08.789> about<00:02:09.440> synchronizing

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
the strings it's all about synchronizing

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:19.310 
the strings it's all about synchronizing
left<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.220> right<00:02:11.340> hands<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:17.840> here<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.020> with

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
left and right hands so here it is with

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.430 
left and right hands so here it is with
a<00:02:19.350> close-up<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.459> medium<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.270> fast<00:02:21.390> give<00:02:22.350> you
