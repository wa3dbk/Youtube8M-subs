00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.370
 there is more to cover camp supporters 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.290
 bourgeois looks to me it's on these 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.300
 this is not the expression 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.750
 freedom of expression what are you this 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.039
 that we will say that I want limited is 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.490
 actually francs that you know I have 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.029
 said same I think we can we will 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.430
 too far into in security in 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.109
 this way we really want 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.510
 get out a lot of stadium supporters 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.160
 no it's not that it's the opposite 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.880
 apologize I just want to understand the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.399
 background of the thing 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.739
 today I feel that everything 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.300
 it's all the expression of supportism 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.610
 that I do not understand for lack of 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.520
 consistency but I believe that in fact finally 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.719
 I wonder if I come back 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.210
 little did you do everything to their waters 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.480
 at the very beginning what but if it's not the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.969
 crisis climate today in the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.890
 society that makes football become a 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.440
 kind of defuelling the hardness of life 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.820
 for many did you go to the stadium 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.350
 and that you quickly attack a 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.710
 player who earns a lot of money 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.090
 this story has always been a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.470
 excellent were then the years 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.330
 thatcher given leads them exactly in 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.340
 a week in a time of crisis 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.670
 strong economic where we are in a 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.530
 identity search for many the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.590
 football club sometimes does not represent you 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.700
 not where you see players and it's a 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.110
 reproaches that make a lot of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.909
 supporters they are not coming 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.950
 to greet either the coach obliged to say 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.930
 go fast and greet all this 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.060
 addition of things there does that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.740
 finally in front of that you have a form of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.170
 protest of ras-le-bol who comes 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.369
 very quickly of indulgence that comes down from 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.659
 more and more because it has to be well 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.369
 to say we spend our time here 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.590
 a lot to say that the level of football 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.630
 French is not good that he gives you more 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.920
 dissatisfaction than satisfactions 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.540
 from a point of view of the attitude of 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 players the results and what makes 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.530
 that on arrival beats to this form of 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.810
 protest rising and expressing itself 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.850
 so I find it inconsistent 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.740
 but that may be explained by this 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.210
 way there finally so I can the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.920
 understand but they would have to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.360
 are a little more structured what and after 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.159
 it is true that there is also in this climate 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.550
 from crisis to nantes an anti system a 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.649
 anti money an anti an anti situ 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.269
 precisely because you're talking about that 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.799
 many people who say 'no' 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.879
 be careful not to confuse antisystem 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.349
 with con ie it's true 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.049
 that in fact that 's the big trend 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.189
 from the moment we do not talk about the quenelle 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.329
 finally, it exists also in the 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.420
 tribunes in other forms 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.970
 this is the message anti franck system 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.099
 is blurry and of course but I cross 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.170
 salam which I think again 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.950
 and daniel imperiously and fluffy 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.409
 the this anti system side for me in all 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.079
 case in the football stadiums and the one 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:43.470
 groups of supporters is not 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:45.000
 according to me link a current climate and that's 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.470
 something intrinsic to these groups 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.359
 of supporters of course but what he 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.549
 does not increase and that there 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.079
 joined no other people whose stadium 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.120
 apart from the hard cores you are talking about 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.650
 who are not comfortable in 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.670
 their everyday lives who are suffering 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.829
 economically who sees 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.780
 billionaires play and who go fast 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:05.129
 blame them for being oneself 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.280
 hero either overpaid zeros you ddd 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.720
 see yes it's true by little teams 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.430
 with guys coming from right of 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.879
 left who simply do not have any 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.260
 good results 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.280
 the guy in marseille today they 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.010
 be they completely 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.109
 disillusioned by the policy 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.530
 sports club by the level of 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.209
 team 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.579
 very frankly even though it's not 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.750
 consistent in his expression 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.549
 roughly I understand pretty much what 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.780
 why he's angry you see I 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.180
 can understand why he angry 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.560
 frankly flourish even I think 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.519
 that if we want to answer 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.230
 the fans have become 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.530
 keep continuing in provocation 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.930
 I would tell you to climb his house if so 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.949
 if so sportingly contests what you 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.479
 just said because they think that 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.699
 sports policy the direction of 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:46.560
 their club is not the good I find 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.150
 that they are not stupid because there is 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.299
 it's their role and I agree 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.500
 if they come if they come for 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.639
 attention second hypothesis they 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.650
 come to challenge the policy 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.299
 social or economic government 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.799
 Thursday are not cons either 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.329
 pastor or that's not the place but 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.069
 it's not stupid because in all 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.440
 stages in much longer periods 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.949
 troubled in the stadiums under certain 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.109
 dictatorships 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:09.000
 allowed in the stadiums to pass 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.650
 messages through via streamers or 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.150
 via hardcore banks I'm some 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.349
 apart the stage was also the pressures 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.530
 of her so I say that it's not a 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.930
 bullshit if now you come to the stadium 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.459
 for insults and even players but 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.650
 because you think you have a kind 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.570
 of message for others as you say 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.130
 because they are thousands 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.230
 roads that's bullshit because 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.450
 that the city if you are quoted educated 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.920
 by parents cited cultivate it's not 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.570
 because you say oh hooves fucked it's 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.220
 not because you say too much paid thoissey 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.640
 tricky did not hear me even small in 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.530
 the stages 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.660
 I can not wait to get paid too much for it 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.220
 this is the 4th pay these two there are 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.290
 not past you understand it's just that 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.300
 money a message money the power 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.340
 so he's writing all that 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.020
 in this climate yes but all that is 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.930
 it's a kind of pressure cooker what 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.260
 me anyway what I see is that 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.330
 this bullshit there if we want the denominated 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.490
 like that she has more or less always 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.690
 existed and it's daddy 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.220
 unfortunately in quotation marks I 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.780
 would say that in times of crisis like one 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.390
 is at the moment I would prefer 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.490
 see stronger claims more 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.080
 precise that is to say that for example those 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.430
 who complain to maurice ducros 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.350
 today lake and the box that is a 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.810
 little on the front line and ferry we see 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.700
 this box where these workers through 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.170
 fan clubs in the region of 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.640
 clubs that represent them 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.710
 I would say that at the limit that I 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.510
 would find that very strong now if 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.680
 it is to make believe that we are 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.330
 a bit against the system because we 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.380
 insult everyone as and there I 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.300
 do not talk about fan groups 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.440
 again necessarily identified 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.630
 because it exists 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.810
 - there for once there yes it's the 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.810
 bullshit
