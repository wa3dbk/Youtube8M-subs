 general sponsor of our channel 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:19.590
 airsoft shop ball honey. 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:21.990
 rub all hello with you the next issue 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.779
 well , the sofa expert has begun 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.880
 just another fear of ball season than me you 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.019
 all of course congratulations on the nature of the game 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.850
 fresh air and really want to eat here 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.040
 surely many of you are familiar with 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.989
 portable preheater about consisting 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.079
 from a small folding taganka 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.430
 and dry fuel in a pill such a thing 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.950
 convenient to take with you 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.260
 it can be found in rp kits were 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.360
 purchase separately this one 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.250
 the small hob will allow you to warm 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.469
 hands boil a cup of water or 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.180
 warm up a little canned well and to 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.460
 they didn't say hot meals on 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.559
 great games or hiking is useful 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.660
 health is important to observe the technique 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.850
 security and do not miss the bus ti 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.790
 when your canned food is torn off the lid and 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.900
 joke but there is a nuance without these 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.299
 magic pills 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.729
 the burner does not work again need 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.500
 matches to use such comfort with 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.689
 open fire in a tent for example 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.259
 categorically impossible and what to do 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.259
 you ask 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.829
 so what do you do when you're hungry 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.229
 can you have a match and fuel 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.539
 to and warm up not from the word at all 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.579
 and here comes to the rescue such 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.009
 here is a flameless food heater 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.679
 which consists of a dense transparent 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.579
 cellophane bag and dry chemical 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.579
 heating pads inside 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.130
 I'm certainly not a big connoisseur of chemistry, but about 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.869
 bluestone I remember from high school and here 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.500
 here apparently the warmer just on his 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.929
 basis 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.240
 Well, the truth does not matter the main thing is that 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.759
 activation is the hot water bottle you need 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.670
 just nothing but a glass of water can 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.250
 even serve well the faces are cool now 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.679
 about 10 degrees so hot lunch 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.020
 it hurts me to use this bnp 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.060
 can even a schoolboy if carefully 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.250
 read the instructions on the package 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.890
 package attaches here is such a sticky 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.799
 sealing up, do not lose it is useful to you 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.739
 also recommend that the heater was below 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.360
 as the excess heat goes up on 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.459
 we put it we warm up our food 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.860
 necessarily in an airtight container and 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.049
 we fill this business with a small amount 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.620
 water for about 100 milliliters per one 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.139
 portion 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.329
 what if water is used instead 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:34.660
 beer or let's say my own piss I don't 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.489
 I know, you want to check it yourself 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.709
 don't hold your head it's in my 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.930
 a bubble of plain water and not something you 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.120
 thought what you thought flooded 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.260
 it cannot be here for any other purpose. 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.470
 and have long been drunk offscreen and so here I am 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.440
 poured the package using velcro taped on 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.359
 instructions to wait 10-12 minutes well 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.959
 this is enough to go to score 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.849
 mehans 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.090
 cut bread or even a little bit 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.250
 take a nap and so far nothing seems 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.169
 There is generally such a thing convenient 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.540
 use almost anywhere at least 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:09.730
 in the campaign even in the trench, in principle, I think 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.489
 even in a tent you can use it well 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.859
 The main thing is that the package does not tip over 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.230
 That seems to have gone reaction so I 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.319
 briefly go to safe 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.319
 distance 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.040
 thank you very much store specials 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.890
 armies for assisting in filming 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.530
 ohara how do you want to eat so i do 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.310
 did the hands washed the fork he found let's 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.110
 open the bag and get my lunch 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.000
 caution water inside hot drink 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.370
 by the way you can not unless of course you 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 There is no shortage of running and aluminum 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.010
 By the way, you can open the package in different ways. 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.870
 can just gently open and you can 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.970
 use instructions where it is written 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.370
 that there is one more break line and 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.560
 by which you can quickly disrupt the top 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.660
 part and well, something like this 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.299
 there is no thermometer at hand but trust me 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.370
 the word canned is really hot and hot 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.890
 raw does not happen so i'm from your 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.800
 permission'm going to eat for a 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.660
 bag then recycle color met so 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.290
 for the second time in a row he has nothing 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.290
 will succeed
