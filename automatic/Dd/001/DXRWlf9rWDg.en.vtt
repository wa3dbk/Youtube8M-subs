Stingray<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:07.379> shouldn't<00:00:07.770> need<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.919> program

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
Stingray you shouldn't need to program

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.129 
Stingray you shouldn't need to program
anything<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.970> way<00:00:09.120> it<00:00:09.240> comes<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.780> shouldn't

have<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.440> touch<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.679> should<00:00:11.099> just<00:00:11.219> work<00:00:11.370> so

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
have to touch it should just work so

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.270 
have to touch it should just work so
long<00:00:12.330> yourself<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.840> TG<00:00:13.139> multi<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.099> plug

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
long yourself to TG multi and you plug

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.730 
long yourself to TG multi and you plug
this<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.759> should<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:15.120> work<00:00:15.470> but<00:00:16.470> if<00:00:16.560> for

ten percent now it's doing the dual be
four<00:04:32.250> times<00:04:32.430> is<00:04:32.669> fifteen<00:04:33.030> percent<00:04:34.250> default<00:04:35.250> is

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
four times is fifteen percent default is

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.850 
four times is fifteen percent default is
thirty<00:04:35.700> percent<00:04:36.090> so<00:04:36.840> i'm<00:04:37.020> going<00:04:37.200> to<00:04:37.260> go<00:04:37.500> let's

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
thirty percent so i'm going to go let's

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.760 
thirty percent so i'm going to go let's
say<00:04:38.010> forty<00:04:38.400> five<00:04:38.610> percent<00:04:39.410> for<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.470> start-up

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
say forty five percent for a start-up

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.440 
say forty five percent for a start-up
speed<00:04:41.070> you<00:04:41.580> know<00:04:41.669> assuming<00:04:41.910> this<00:04:42.120> was<00:04:42.180> too

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
speed you know assuming this was too

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.870 
speed you know assuming this was too
slow<00:04:42.720> right<00:04:43.590> now<00:04:43.620> we're<00:04:44.010> at<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.130> three<00:04:44.610> beeps

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
slow right now we're at the three beeps

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.700 
slow right now we're at the three beeps
which<00:04:45.270> is<00:04:45.450> twenty<00:04:45.720> percent<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.260> work<00:04:46.410> for

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
which is twenty percent that work for

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.760 
which is twenty percent that work for
beep<00:04:46.919> which<00:04:47.160> is<00:04:47.250> twenty-five<00:04:47.669> percent<00:04:48.770> when

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
beep which is twenty-five percent when

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.350 
beep which is twenty-five percent when
it<00:04:49.890> gets<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.130> long<00:04:50.370> beep<00:04:50.640> we're<00:04:50.850> at<00:04:50.970> default

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
it gets to a long beep we're at default

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.159 
it gets to a long beep we're at default
which<00:04:51.630> is<00:04:51.810> thirty<00:04:52.200> percent<00:04:53.360> that's<00:04:54.360> default

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
which is thirty percent that's default

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.960 
which is thirty percent that's default
thirty<00:04:55.380> percent<00:04:58.370> now<00:04:59.370> we're<00:04:59.520> going<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.669> thirty

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
thirty percent now we're going to thirty

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.850 
thirty percent now we're going to thirty
five<00:05:00.240> percent<00:05:00.270> which<00:05:00.990> is<00:05:01.140> one<00:05:01.350> along<00:05:01.590> in<00:05:01.740> one

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
five percent which is one along in one

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.420 
five percent which is one along in one
short<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:03.030> that's<00:05:03.210> thirty-five<00:05:03.600> percent

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
short to that's thirty-five percent

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.990 
short to that's thirty-five percent
forty<00:05:05.430> percent<00:05:05.669> is<00:05:05.820> one<00:05:05.970> long<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.419> too<00:05:06.630> short

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
forty percent is one long and too short

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.130 
forty percent is one long and too short
that's<00:05:09.000> forty<00:05:09.270> percent<00:05:09.479> i<00:05:09.570> should<00:05:09.720> say<00:05:09.840> is<00:05:09.960> too

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
that's forty percent i should say is too

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.070 
that's forty percent i should say is too
short<00:05:11.210> we're<00:05:12.210> going<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.390> sit<00:05:12.479> at<00:05:12.600> forty<00:05:12.900> five

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
short we're going to sit at forty five

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.659 
short we're going to sit at forty five
percent<00:05:13.110> which<00:05:13.650> is<00:05:13.800> one<00:05:13.979> long<00:05:14.190> and<00:05:14.430> three

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
percent which is one long and three

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.350 
percent which is one long and three
short<00:05:14.970> let's<00:05:15.540> see<00:05:16.220> that's<00:05:17.220> too<00:05:17.430> short<00:05:17.460> one

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
short let's see that's too short one

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.600 
short let's see that's too short one
long<00:05:18.680> that's<00:05:19.680> three<00:05:19.919> short<00:05:20.160> so<00:05:20.250> that's<00:05:20.400> forty

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
long that's three short so that's forty
