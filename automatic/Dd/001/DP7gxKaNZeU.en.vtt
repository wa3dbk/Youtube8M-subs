00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
about WD black this isn't exactly a new

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.750 
about WD black this isn't exactly a new
concept<00:00:43.980> by<00:00:44.219> any<00:00:44.399> stretch<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
concept by any stretch of the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.900 
concept by any stretch of the
imagination<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> three

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
imagination but what it is is as a three

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.880 
imagination but what it is is as a three
and<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> half<00:00:48.090> inch<00:00:48.480> drive<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.530> only<00:00:49.559> one

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and a half inch drive it's the only one

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.500 
and a half inch drive it's the only one
that's<00:00:50.070> ever<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.399> been<00:00:50.640> positioned<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
that's ever really been positioned as a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
that's ever really been positioned as a
performance<00:00:52.170> leading<00:00:52.620> drive<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.160> makes

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
performance leading drive so what makes

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.520 
performance leading drive so what makes
it<00:00:53.550> different<00:00:53.760> from<00:00:54.570> something<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.170> blue

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
it different from something like a blue

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.439 
it different from something like a blue
or<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:55.829> differentiated<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.670> back<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
or what differentiated it back then it

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.930 
or what differentiated it back then it
was<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.170> about<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.129> tuning<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.789> tweaking

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
was all about the tuning and tweaking

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.549 
was all about the tuning and tweaking
and<00:01:00.449> things<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:00.989> putting<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.379> dual

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and things like putting in dual

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.889 
and things like putting in dual
processors<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.609> order<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> make<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> perform

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
processors in order to make it perform

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.320 
processors in order to make it perform
even<00:01:04.409> better<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.339> time<00:01:05.549> than<00:01:05.820> an

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
even better at the time than an

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.350 
even better at the time than an
equivalent<00:01:06.680> 7200<00:01:07.680> RPM<00:01:08.010> drive<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.210> in

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
equivalent 7200 RPM drive and this is in

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.300 
equivalent 7200 RPM drive and this is in
lined<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.170> concept<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.159> not

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
lined with that concept that it's not

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.550 
lined with that concept that it's not
all<00:01:11.610> about<00:01:11.640> rpm<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:13.080> how<00:01:13.260> does<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
all about rpm because how does it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.109 
all about rpm because how does it
perform<00:01:13.680> better<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> spins<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> same

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
perform better if it spins at the same

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.179 
perform better if it spins at the same
speed<00:01:15.420> waltz<00:01:15.750> more<00:01:16.409> complicated<00:01:16.950> than<00:01:17.130> that

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
speed waltz more complicated than that

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.670 
speed waltz more complicated than that
so<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.299> black<00:01:18.689> dry<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.350> well<00:01:19.590> it's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
so what is it black dry for well it's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.080 
so what is it black dry for well it's
for<00:01:19.830> people<00:01:19.950> who<00:01:20.130> don't<00:01:20.400> want<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> worry<00:01:20.939> about
