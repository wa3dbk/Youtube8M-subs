what<00:00:00.539> is<00:00:00.659> up<00:00:00.870> guys<00:00:01.140> random<00:00:01.740> ginger<00:00:02.129> here<00:00:02.310> today

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
what is up guys random ginger here today

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.190 
what is up guys random ginger here today
what<00:00:03.179> I've<00:00:03.240> got<00:00:03.419> for<00:00:03.629> you<00:00:03.689> is<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.959> little

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
what I've got for you is a little

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.599 
what I've got for you is a little
something<00:00:04.529> that<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.770> discovered<00:00:04.920> while

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
something that I discovered while

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.400 
something that I discovered while
messing<00:00:06.029> around<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.450> creative<00:00:06.930> both<00:00:07.080> trying

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
messing around and creative both trying

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.730 
messing around and creative both trying
to<00:00:07.440> find<00:00:08.120> ways<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.420> people<00:00:09.599> can<00:00:09.870> get<00:00:10.019> early

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
to find ways that people can get early

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.160 
to find ways that people can get early
in<00:00:11.130> game<00:00:11.550> earth<00:00:12.509> early<00:00:13.469> game<00:00:13.679> energy<00:00:14.009> low<00:00:14.670> cost

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
in game earth early game energy low cost

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.340 
in game earth early game energy low cost
but<00:00:16.170> that's<00:00:16.529> self-sustaining<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.730> can<00:00:17.850> be

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
but that's self-sustaining so it can be

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.990 
but that's self-sustaining so it can be
used<00:00:19.350> easily<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.430> don't<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.850> go

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
used easily and you don't have to go

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.759 
used easily and you don't have to go
keep<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.420> gathering<00:00:21.779> resources<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.560> will<00:00:22.619> just

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
keep on gathering resources it will just

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.920 
keep on gathering resources it will just
keep<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.189> sustaining<00:00:23.760> itself<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.359> producing

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
keep on sustaining itself and producing

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.810 
keep on sustaining itself and producing
excess<00:00:25.199> power<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.519> something<00:00:26.760> I

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
excess power and this is something I

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.910 
excess power and this is something I
came<00:00:26.880> up<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.869> also<00:00:27.990> works<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.560> smaller

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
came up with it also works in a smaller

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.560 
came up with it also works in a smaller
version<00:00:29.130> over<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:30.000> don't<00:00:30.179> hear<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
version over here you don't hear the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.240 
version over here you don't hear the
cobblestone<00:00:31.019> because<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.500> sound<00:00:31.980> turned

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
cobblestone because I have sound turned

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.280 
cobblestone because I have sound turned
off<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.420> slimes<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
off but because of the slimes and

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.069 
off but because of the slimes and
because<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.710> cobblestone<00:00:35.219> generators<00:00:36.079> um

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
because of the cobblestone generators um

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.250 
because of the cobblestone generators um
but<00:00:38.010> what<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> don't<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> running

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
but what this is I don't have a running

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.959 
but what this is I don't have a running
right<00:00:40.379> now<00:00:40.530> because<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.399> timer<00:00:41.700> that

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
right now because this is the timer that

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.660 
right now because this is the timer that
it<00:00:42.059> runs<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.140> not<00:00:43.170> connected<00:00:43.710> these

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it runs on and it's not connected these

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.729 
it runs on and it's not connected these
are<00:00:44.789> block<00:00:45.030> breakers<00:00:45.390> right<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.899> they

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
are block breakers right here and they

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.040 
are block breakers right here and they
are<00:00:46.770> read<00:00:47.129> above<00:00:47.430> cobblestone<00:00:48.360> generator<00:00:48.390> 8

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
are read above cobblestone generator 8

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.770 
are read above cobblestone generator 8
cobblestone<00:00:49.739> generators<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.550> exact

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
cobblestone generators to be exact

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.920 
cobblestone generators to be exact
they're<00:00:52.079> very<00:00:52.260> simple<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.890> lava<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.899> then<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
they're very simple just lava and then a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.380 
they're very simple just lava and then a
space<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.739> hole<00:00:56.699> dug<00:00:56.910> into<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> ground

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
space then a hole dug into the ground

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.430 
space then a hole dug into the ground
and<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:57.780> water<00:00:58.969> and<00:00:59.969> these<00:01:00.840> black<00:01:01.109> breakers

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and then water and these black breakers

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.390 
and then water and these black breakers
will<00:01:01.620> break<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> cobble<00:01:02.510> every<00:01:03.769> 2.25<00:01:04.769> seconds

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
will break the cobble every 2.25 seconds

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.710 
will break the cobble every 2.25 seconds
that's<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> interval<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.330> found<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> be

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that's the interval that I found to be

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.410 
that's the interval that I found to be
the<00:01:06.810> best<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.030> they'll<00:01:09.180> send

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the best for this and then they'll send

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.390 
the best for this and then they'll send
it<00:01:09.510> through<00:01:09.659> these<00:01:09.869> pneumatic<00:01:10.229> tubes<00:01:10.710> into

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it through these pneumatic tubes into

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.090 
it through these pneumatic tubes into
these<00:01:11.520> recyclers<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:13.200> recyclers<00:01:13.710> will<00:01:13.950> then

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
these recyclers the recyclers will then

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.880 
these recyclers the recyclers will then
turn<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.580> into<00:01:14.700> scrap<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:16.259> there's<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
turn it into scrap and there's I think a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.670 
turn it into scrap and there's I think a
one<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.220> ten<00:01:17.369> chance<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.820> turning<00:01:18.680> anything

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
one in ten chance of turning anything

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.230 
one in ten chance of turning anything
into<00:01:20.100> scrap<00:01:20.340> once<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.790> put<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.090> through<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
into scrap once you put it through a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.649 
into scrap once you put it through a
recycler<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.759> chance<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.390> then

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
recycler so that is chance and then

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.890 
recycler so that is chance and then
it'll<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> pumped<00:01:25.409> out<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.619> those<00:01:26.810> not<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it'll be a pumped out of those not a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.480 
it'll be a pumped out of those not a
bubble<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.259> meth<00:01:28.409> right<00:01:28.590> there<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.159> will<00:01:29.369> get

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
bubble of meth right there it will get

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.100 
bubble of meth right there it will get
pumped<00:01:29.729> out<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.850> those<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.299> into<00:01:30.900> these

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
pumped out of those and into these

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.890 
pumped out of those and into these
generators<00:01:31.860> which<00:01:32.159> will<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:32.630> get<00:01:33.630> power

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
generators which will then get power

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.560 
generators which will then get power
from<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.409> burn<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.430> get<00:01:35.549> power<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.939> then

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
from it burn it to get power and then

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.660 
from it burn it to get power and then
some<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.200> power<00:01:37.470> half<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.220> will<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
some of that power half of it will go to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.569 
some of that power half of it will go to
the<00:01:38.869> recyclers<00:01:39.869> again<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.740> help<00:01:41.040> them<00:01:41.220> keep<00:01:41.460> on

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the recyclers again to help them keep on

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.179 
the recyclers again to help them keep on
making<00:01:41.939> more<00:01:42.119> scrap<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.799> part<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.950> will<00:01:44.070> go

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
making more scrap and part of it will go

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.330 
making more scrap and part of it will go
to<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.430> storage<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> mfsu

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
to this storage and I just have a mfsu

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.530 
to this storage and I just have a mfsu
just<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.970> could<00:01:48.149> run<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.509> a

just because so that I could run for a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
while in-game you're obviously not gonna

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.270 
while in-game you're obviously not gonna
have<00:01:51.270> her<00:01:51.450> early<00:01:51.780> game<00:01:51.960> you're<00:01:52.890> obviously<00:01:53.009> not

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
have her early game you're obviously not

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.830 
have her early game you're obviously not
gonna<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.729> mfsu<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.360> start<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:54.689> with

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
gonna have and mfsu to start out with

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.289 
gonna have and mfsu to start out with
probably<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.439> bad<00:01:55.619> box<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.880> it'll<00:01:57.060> work<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
probably a bad box but it'll work the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.109 
probably a bad box but it'll work the
same<00:01:57.509> either<00:01:57.659> way<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.229> show<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:59.119> and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
same either way I can show you that and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.840 
same either way I can show you that and
like<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.899> say<00:02:01.110> over<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.740> it'll<00:02:02.009> work<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.189> as

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
like I say over here it'll work just as

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550 
like I say over here it'll work just as
well<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.960> wanted<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> show<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
well I just wanted to show you the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.649 
well I just wanted to show you the
bigger<00:02:04.799> version<00:02:05.070> because<00:02:06.049> it's<00:02:07.049> better

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
bigger version because it's better

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.699 
bigger version because it's better
I<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.009> better<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.539> what<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.379> need<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.530> do

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
I like it better so what you need to do

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.530 
I like it better so what you need to do
first<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.220> start<00:02:12.519> it<00:02:12.610> off<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:12.849> need<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.000> private

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
first to start it off you need a private

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.699 
first to start it off you need a private
with<00:02:13.720> which<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.349> with<00:02:15.129> coal<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:17.230> I'll<00:02:17.319> just<00:02:17.500> pop

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
with which is with coal so I'll just pop

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.890 
with which is with coal so I'll just pop
a<00:02:17.739> couple<00:02:18.069> coal<00:02:18.400> into<00:02:18.640> each<00:02:18.819> these<00:02:19.060> one<00:02:19.690> would

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
a couple coal into each these one would

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.479 
a couple coal into each these one would
probably<00:02:20.319> do<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.590> trick<00:02:20.620> but<00:02:20.950> I'll<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.040> put

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
probably do the trick but I'll just put

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.330 
probably do the trick but I'll just put
two<00:02:21.700> inches<00:02:22.239> because<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:23.019> then<00:02:23.769> you<00:02:24.040> go<00:02:24.190> over

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
two inches because and then you go over

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.320 
two inches because and then you go over
here<00:02:25.260> place<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.549> redstone<00:02:27.549> there

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
here place that redstone there

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.199 
here place that redstone there
you're<00:02:29.140> not<00:02:29.260> red<00:02:29.500> sound<00:02:29.799> right<00:02:30.790> down<00:02:30.910> where

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
you're not red sound right down where

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.729 
you're not red sound right down where
and<00:02:32.040> as<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.220> can<00:02:33.340> see<00:02:33.400> uh<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.540> will<00:02:34.900> start<00:02:35.440> to

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
and as you can see uh it will start to

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.970 
and as you can see uh it will start to
produce<00:02:36.310> some<00:02:36.640> some<00:02:37.480> cobble<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:37.989> that<00:02:38.830> is

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
produce some some cobble and that is

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.220 
produce some some cobble and that is
actually<00:02:39.160> another<00:02:40.120> cycle<00:02:40.510> anyway<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.840> fast<00:02:41.049> is

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
actually another cycle anyway to fast is

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.069 
actually another cycle anyway to fast is
it<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:42.459> then<00:02:43.269> important<00:02:43.780> thing<00:02:43.870> with<00:02:43.989> these

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
it and then important thing with these

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.949 
it and then important thing with these
recyclers<00:02:44.620> when<00:02:44.829> you<00:02:44.950> have<00:02:45.160> eight<00:02:46.060> black

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
recyclers when you have eight black

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.720 
recyclers when you have eight black
breakers<00:02:47.379> or<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.739> couple<00:02:48.040> some<00:02:48.160> generators<00:02:48.489> and

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
breakers or a couple some generators and

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.789 
breakers or a couple some generators and
two<00:02:49.180> recyclers<00:02:49.720> if<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.079> put<00:02:50.319> four

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
two recyclers if you put four

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.160 
two recyclers if you put four
overclocker<00:02:51.400> up<00:02:51.579> Red's<00:02:51.819> in<00:02:51.940> here<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.390> set

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
overclocker up Red's in here and set

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.100 
overclocker up Red's in here and set
this<00:02:53.379> timer<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.860> 2.25<00:02:54.640> seconds<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.420> will<00:02:55.870> be

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
this timer to 2.25 seconds it will be

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.170 
this timer to 2.25 seconds it will be
basically<00:02:56.799> perfectly<00:02:57.549> timed<00:02:57.790> out<00:02:57.970> it's<00:02:58.150> a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
basically perfectly timed out it's a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.869 
basically perfectly timed out it's a
little<00:02:58.450> bit<00:02:58.569> off<00:02:58.890> but<00:02:59.890> it'll<00:03:00.129> be<00:03:00.310> basically

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
little bit off but it'll be basically

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.130 
little bit off but it'll be basically
perfect<00:03:01.769> so<00:03:02.769> as<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.489> can<00:03:03.609> see<00:03:03.879> these<00:03:04.299> are<00:03:04.569> kind

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
perfect so as you can see these are kind

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.960 
perfect so as you can see these are kind
of<00:03:05.290> running<00:03:05.560> out<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.709> power<00:03:05.920> here<00:03:06.250> but<00:03:06.819> then

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
of running out of power here but then

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.550 
of running out of power here but then
we'll<00:03:07.120> get<00:03:07.239> some<00:03:07.420> scrap<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.989> be<00:03:08.109> burned<00:03:08.349> in

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
we'll get some scrap to be burned in

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.920 
we'll get some scrap to be burned in
there<00:03:08.769> that<00:03:09.160> would<00:03:09.250> give<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.489> some<00:03:09.640> more<00:03:09.730> power

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
there that would give it some more power

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.559 
there that would give it some more power
it'll<00:03:10.930> keep<00:03:11.079> on<00:03:11.290> going<00:03:12.090> it's<00:03:13.090> built<00:03:13.329> up<00:03:13.480> a

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
it'll keep on going it's built up a

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.680 
it'll keep on going it's built up a
little<00:03:13.660> bit<00:03:13.900> there<00:03:14.079> it's<00:03:14.829> not<00:03:14.980> perfect<00:03:15.690> it'll

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
little bit there it's not perfect it'll

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.420 
little bit there it's not perfect it'll
work<00:03:16.959> it'll<00:03:17.290> always<00:03:17.500> work<00:03:17.650> better<00:03:17.920> if<00:03:18.099> you<00:03:18.220> put

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
work it'll always work better if you put

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.569 
work it'll always work better if you put
more<00:03:19.440> more<00:03:20.440> coal<00:03:20.769> in<00:03:20.950> there<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.220> start<00:03:21.400> out

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
more more coal in there to start out

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.729 
more more coal in there to start out
with<00:03:21.730> but<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.599> will<00:03:22.750> be<00:03:22.959> self-sustaining<00:03:23.620> I

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
with but it will be self-sustaining I

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.940 
with but it will be self-sustaining I
have<00:03:23.980> tested<00:03:24.340> this<00:03:24.639> and<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:26.349> results<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:26.769> got

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
have tested this and the results I got

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.620 
have tested this and the results I got
from<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.370> let<00:03:27.669> it<00:03:27.790> run<00:03:27.940> for<00:03:28.120> about<00:03:28.180> two<00:03:28.599> hours

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
from it I let it run for about two hours

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.809 
from it I let it run for about two hours
and<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.290> ended<00:03:29.650> up<00:03:29.769> creating<00:03:30.069> about<00:03:31.049> 200<00:03:32.049> to

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
and it ended up creating about 200 to

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.150 
and it ended up creating about 200 to
250<00:03:33.819> thousand<00:03:34.569> EU<00:03:34.989> because<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.349> had<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.650> mfsu

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
250 thousand EU because I had that mfsu

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.220 
250 thousand EU because I had that mfsu
hooked<00:03:36.459> up<00:03:36.609> to<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.849> so<00:03:37.569> that<00:03:37.690> is<00:03:37.780> pretty<00:03:38.019> good

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
hooked up to it so that is pretty good

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.930 
hooked up to it so that is pretty good
for<00:03:38.440> two<00:03:38.560> hours<00:03:38.919> I<00:03:39.010> didn't<00:03:39.280> compare<00:03:39.669> it<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.849> any

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
for two hours I didn't compare it to any

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.080 
for two hours I didn't compare it to any
solar<00:03:40.329> panels<00:03:40.810> or<00:03:40.959> geothermic<00:03:42.090> geothermal

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
solar panels or geothermic geothermal

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
generators or anything like that but for

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.050 
generators or anything like that but for
early-game<00:03:46.389> power<00:03:47.049> I'd<00:03:47.440> say<00:03:48.190> that's<00:03:48.400> pretty

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
early-game power I'd say that's pretty

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.759 
early-game power I'd say that's pretty
dang<00:03:49.419> good<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.959> as<00:03:50.079> you<00:03:50.200> can<00:03:50.290> see<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.500> stopped

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
dang good and as you can see it stopped

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.610 
dang good and as you can see it stopped
here<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:51.549> not<00:03:51.700> perfect<00:03:52.269> you<00:03:52.359> guys<00:03:52.530> but<00:03:53.530> it

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
here so it's not perfect you guys but it

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.559 
here so it's not perfect you guys but it
doesn't<00:03:53.919> work<00:03:54.010> very<00:03:54.430> well<00:03:54.579> for<00:03:54.970> what<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.329> needs

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
doesn't work very well for what it needs

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.809 
doesn't work very well for what it needs
to<00:03:55.720> do<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:56.829> can<00:03:56.919> always<00:03:57.130> pop<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.370> coal<00:03:57.669> or

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
to do and you can always pop a coal or

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.309 
to do and you can always pop a coal or
two<00:03:57.970> in<00:03:58.120> there<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:58.660> it'll<00:03:58.810> get<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.109> going

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
two in there and it'll get it going

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.680 
two in there and it'll get it going
again<00:03:59.410> but<00:04:00.400> once<00:04:00.579> it<00:04:00.730> does<00:04:00.880> get<00:04:01.090> going<00:04:01.389> once<00:04:01.599> it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
again but once it does get going once it

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.550 
again but once it does get going once it
gets<00:04:01.810> into<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.079> rhythm

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
gets into a rhythm

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.220 
gets into a rhythm
it<00:04:02.910> doesn't<00:04:03.910> really<00:04:04.269> ever<00:04:04.510> stop<00:04:04.840> it'll<00:04:05.049> keep

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
it doesn't really ever stop it'll keep

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.670 
it doesn't really ever stop it'll keep
on<00:04:05.410> going<00:04:05.739> basically<00:04:06.280> forever<00:04:07.470> again<00:04:08.470> there's

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
on going basically forever again there's

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.949 
on going basically forever again there's
all<00:04:08.829> cents<00:04:09.459> this<00:04:09.700> isn't<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.090> 100%<00:04:10.599> chance<00:04:10.840> of

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
all cents this isn't the 100% chance of

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.379 
all cents this isn't the 100% chance of
baking<00:04:11.319> scrap<00:04:11.650> is<00:04:11.859> only<00:04:11.980> 10%<00:04:12.310> there's<00:04:13.209> always

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
baking scrap is only 10% there's always

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.240 
baking scrap is only 10% there's always
going<00:04:13.569> to<00:04:13.629> be<00:04:13.720> some<00:04:14.109> error<00:04:14.379> involved<00:04:14.919> there

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
going to be some error involved there

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.009 
going to be some error involved there
there's<00:04:16.060> always<00:04:16.150> going<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.359> be<00:04:16.449> a<00:04:16.509> little<00:04:16.780> bit

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
there's always going to be a little bit

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:17.670 
there's always going to be a little bit
of

of

of
I'm<00:04:17.949> charity<00:04:18.759> but<00:04:19.509> it's<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.750> very<00:04:20.079> good<00:04:20.910> early

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
I'm charity but it's a very good early

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.480 
I'm charity but it's a very good early
game<00:04:22.150> power<00:04:22.539> source<00:04:22.900> if<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:23.979> don't<00:04:24.220> want<00:04:24.400> to

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
game power source if you don't want to

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.610 
game power source if you don't want to
do<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.940> normal<00:04:25.240> route<00:04:25.419> of<00:04:25.570> baby<00:04:25.870> solar<00:04:26.229> panels

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
do the normal route of baby solar panels

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.830 
do the normal route of baby solar panels
which<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.190> think<00:04:27.430> solar<00:04:27.639> panels<00:04:28.030> I<00:04:28.240> know<00:04:28.660> the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
which I think solar panels I know the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.219 
which I think solar panels I know the
drag<00:04:29.050> tech<00:04:29.259> that<00:04:29.500> may<00:04:29.590> not<00:04:29.710> be<00:04:29.770> early<00:04:30.460> game<00:04:31.229> but

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
drag tech that may not be early game but

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.080 
drag tech that may not be early game but
you<00:04:32.680> know<00:04:32.800> sometimes<00:04:33.130> it's<00:04:33.430> fun<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.729> do<00:04:33.850> some

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
you know sometimes it's fun to do some

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.210 
you know sometimes it's fun to do some
energy<00:04:34.630> sources<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:35.050> aren't<00:04:35.320> quite<00:04:35.680> typical

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
energy sources that aren't quite typical

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.640 
energy sources that aren't quite typical
so<00:04:36.789> this<00:04:36.970> is<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.120> good<00:04:37.240> way<00:04:37.389> to<00:04:37.419> do<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.660> I'm

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
so this is a good way to do that I'm

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.439 
so this is a good way to do that I'm
going<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.860> be<00:04:38.919> trying<00:04:39.130> to<00:04:39.400> come<00:04:39.520> up<00:04:39.639> in<00:04:40.240> my

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
going to be trying to come up in my

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.290 
going to be trying to come up in my
future<00:04:41.320> videos<00:04:41.440> with<00:04:42.009> some<00:04:42.220> other<00:04:42.370> alternate

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
future videos with some other alternate

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.840 
future videos with some other alternate
power<00:04:43.509> sources<00:04:44.020> like<00:04:44.259> this<00:04:44.500> I<00:04:44.680> think<00:04:45.400> it's<00:04:45.669> I

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
power sources like this I think it's I

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.159 
power sources like this I think it's I
think<00:04:46.000> it's<00:04:46.210> fun<00:04:46.389> to<00:04:46.509> do<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.720> try<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.020> figure

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
think it's fun to do to try and figure

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.860 
think it's fun to do to try and figure
out<00:04:47.350> what<00:04:47.620> ways<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:48.070> can<00:04:48.220> do<00:04:48.340> things<00:04:48.870> that

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
out what ways you can do things that

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.499 
out what ways you can do things that
aren't<00:04:50.080> exactly<00:04:50.229> normal<00:04:50.889> but<00:04:51.250> work<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:51.789> work

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
aren't exactly normal but work and work

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.350 
aren't exactly normal but work and work
well<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:54.250> hope<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.430> guys<00:04:54.520> know<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.910> video<00:04:55.120> I
