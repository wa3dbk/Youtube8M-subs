00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 everyone knows that I hope mini 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.040
 you're fine in this video I'm going 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.109
 show you how to make a cut 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.469
 that softens a gradient for 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.030
 eliminate it gradually to achieve 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.889
 this couse would need scissors 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.839
 a comb and a few flat pliers 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.150
 you're going to have to do 3 separation a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.800
 on the top of the head one that does the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.320
 turn of the head through the back 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.640
 and one at the neck 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.619
 I detail everything in diagrams on 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.789
 the block we start right away 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.099
 cut by the top area 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.590
 paint first carefully then 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.949
 plot a central re on one of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.960
 sides 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.239
 take a strand of 2 or 3 cm 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.399
 thick stay there vertically 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.070
 is cut off serve this snow 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.410
 as a landmark to cut the second then 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.289
 the second to cut the third etc 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.059
 until the end it will suffice then to 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.720
 repeat this operation for the other 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.430
 side 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.380
 do not forget to re- wrap your 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.450
 wick each time not to make 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.220
 cuts on dry hair and it's gone 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.990
 we repeat cooperation held the hair 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.630
 well perpendicular to the skull at the 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.610
 vertical and do you know benchmarks with 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.080
 the first bit to cut the second 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.910
 then so on 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.770
 serve you with the second 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.410
 wick to cut the third and so on 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.060
 until you have finished take 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.340
 care to check that the hair is 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.530
 soggy and not just slightly wet 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.060
 because otherwise you will recreate 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.250
 new forks at the very moment when 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.660
 you will understand if you think that 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.170
 you do not cut a way while at 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.119
 made equal 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.590
 do not hesitate to iron one last 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.140
 times to check that everything is fine 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.330
 right once you finish the area 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.800
 attached duo has it carefully with a 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.290
 flat pliers and you will be able 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.710
 detach the second area 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.330
 for this area we will cut between 1 cm 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.979
 and a centimeter and a half 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.390
 the principle is exactly the same as 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.550
 for the first rhône except that we will 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.170
 put horizontally so you hold 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.619
 your lashes well horizontally by 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.060
 report to your skull and cut you 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.890
 as before you will be able 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.590
 take the first wick for you in 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.630
 serve as benchmark to the coupe the second and 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.490
 so on you serve as benchmarks 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.409
 with the second to cut the third 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.770
 and so on all around the 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.170
 skull 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.090
 everything is explained in detail with 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.830
 diagrams and explanatory drawings on 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.860
 the blog the link of the article is in 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.570
 info bar 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.520
 do not forget to wet your 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.950
 hair every time and then continue 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.140
 your shot there is really no need 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.700
 to be a hairdresser to make a successful cut 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.920
 the proof the person who makes me the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.540
 cut is not at all what to do by 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.040
 against it must be rigorous and 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.590
 methodical and well follow the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.590
 explanations here we just got 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.080
 finish the second part we do the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.400
 last wick and it will be over and 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.140
 now we are just going to 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.570
 put in the other direction ie 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.100
 make horizontal separations and 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.320
 check that everything is right in 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.030
 intersecting if it takes a few millimeters 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.890
 once you have finished 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.840
 check that it is right tasks 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.290
 and the top area and paint your 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.330
 hair we're going to make fittings here 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.220
 you will see that between the hair of 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.739
 the area of ​​the top and that of the sides there 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.040
 has a small end that exceeds it must 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.920
 cut 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.150
 it will allow to melt the cup is 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.680
 a very fast step 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.470
 you will have done it in a few minutes 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.260
 after that we'll go to the 4th and 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.450
 last step of this cup is negated 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.540
 first carefully your hair and then 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.780
 Obtain an place created clip 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.310
 clip at the neck 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.530
 keep your eyes open and paint your 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.720
 hair or that they are straight in 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.130
 the clip 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.140
 then it's very simple and it's 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.740
 the funniest step you have to do 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.140
 go down the clip 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.400
 to the desired length try to 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.200
 make sure it's right thanks 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.240
 at the little bubble level that's on 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.070
 the top of the clip and once you 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.140
 get to the length at which you 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.950
 want to cut your hair ideally 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.280
 3 cm or more and well it's the moment he 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.280
 must be cut 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.500
 once you have cut it is enough 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.860
 just remove youtube and got 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.269
 completed you have finished your account if 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.800
 Like me, you want a cup at sight 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.290
 you have one more thing to do 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.060
 that's what I'm doing 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.739
 draw a dar behind your head and 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.440
 fold the hair on the front then 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.240
 cut what goes beyond that will allow 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.470
 make a pretty 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.150
 again I'm used so I 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.410
 do it without elastic but if you 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.180
 do not get used to 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.550
 of elastics is cut which exceeds 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.229
 elastic and that's the result 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.930
 there is no mistake the cut is 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.490
 super fluid and so far we come from 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.200
 degrade a little bit but the spikes 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.060
 appear much thicker and the 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.250
 degrade and much less pronounced 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.290
 it's an ideal cut if you want 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.440
 eliminate your gradient because it's okay 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.030
 remove it gradually for you 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.740
 help I made you lots of drawings 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.210
 and explanatory diagrams for you 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.570
 can make this cut to the 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.220
 House 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.080

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.760
