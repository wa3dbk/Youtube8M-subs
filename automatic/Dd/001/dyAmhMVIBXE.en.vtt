Hello everyone, Cd here and welcome back to
Work Revolt Gun reviews. Once again, before

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.921
we get started, I have a correction to make.
Last week, an anonymous poster (whose comment

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:18.440
has mysteriously disappeared) used some vulgar
language to explain I am pronouncing Gjallarhorn

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.530
wrong. It bothered the commenter so badly
that they decided not to give a like. Because

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.699
I�m very vain and need validation constantly,
this episode is dedicated to this unknown

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.629
commenter as I will pronounce the word correctly
this episode in hopes of receiving your like.

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:43.739
Now let�s get into the Necrochasm review!
For the Necrochasm, we must first understand

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.420
the type of gun it is. Many in the community
have put it under the archetype �Bullet

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.500
Hoes�, a derogatory term given to guns that
easily give up their bullets. With this idea

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.320
in mind, we decided to test its Bullet Spread.
As you can see immediately, the Necrochasm

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.019
freely gives up its bullets to anywhere and
everything. In just a single magazine, bullets

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.869
were on the ground, walls, and even multiple
enemies.

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:15.010
Compared to a more proper weapon, the GUH-JALER-HORN,
which plays a little �hard to get.�

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.720
We also tested Bullet thrust to see which
gun, when aimed at the ground, can give more

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.780
height to your jump due to bullet force. We
conducted the test on the moon where gravity

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.020
has a lesser effect on guardians.
As you can see, the Necrochasm does give a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.361
slight burst, but the JallerGhorn not only
gives a boost to height, but also allows the

00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:37.250
user to complete a flip.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.251
Like the Fatebringer, the Necrochasm has a
unique perk. It actually has the ability to

00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:46.500
create cursed thrall that are allies, but
it seems that a glitch in the game forces

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.060
these friendlies to explode on creation, hopefully
this is corrected in the next patch.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.181
We also tested the weapon�s writing skills.
Each gun is given 30 minutes to complete an

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:03.620
essay based on any subject matter it prefers.
While the Necrochasm wasn�t able to complete

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.610
its thesis statement, the purpose shined through
despite spelling errors, resulting in a passing

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.720
grade.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.180
GallyJorn also completed the test, but failed
to complete a single word.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.689
Finally, many viewers have been asking for
some PvP tests, so I decided to jump into

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.299
a match to test the Necrochasm�s worth.
As you can see, though, it seems as if the

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.650
gun does zero damage to other guardians. This
could be due to my current ban, or just extreme

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.709
lag.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.080
So, what�s the Necrochasm�s actual worth?
It�s a poor speller, but in the hands of

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.689
a skilled warlock or titan, it could be a
decent asset�but Xur just sold YallyGorn,

00:02:44.689 --> 00:03:02.979
so all guardians should be using that.
