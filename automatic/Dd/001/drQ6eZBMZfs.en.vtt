00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
first steps and I'm excited about what

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.740

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.210 
the future holds there's always going to
be<00:05:05.810> an<00:05:05.960> element<00:05:06.290> of<00:05:06.350> fear<00:05:06.530> with<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:06.800> I<00:05:06.890> think<00:05:07.100> I

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
be an element of fear with it I think I

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.440 
be an element of fear with it I think I
think<00:05:07.400> if<00:05:07.520> you<00:05:07.580> don't<00:05:07.790> have<00:05:07.910> an<00:05:08.030> element<00:05:08.300> of

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
think if you don't have an element of

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.110 
think if you don't have an element of
fear<00:05:08.630> then<00:05:09.520> something's<00:05:10.520> not<00:05:10.640> right<00:05:10.700> and

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
fear then something's not right and

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.880 
fear then something's not right and
because<00:05:11.600> it<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:11.840> dangerous<00:05:12.050> out<00:05:12.530> there<00:05:12.710> we're

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
because it is dangerous out there we're

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.350 
because it is dangerous out there we're
all<00:05:13.010> aware<00:05:13.310> of<00:05:13.370> that<00:05:13.490> we<00:05:13.700> see<00:05:13.910> it<00:05:14.000> on<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.180> news

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
all aware of that we see it on the news

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.270 
all aware of that we see it on the news
all<00:05:14.540> the<00:05:14.630> time<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:15.800> is<00:05:15.890> definitely

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
all the time so it is definitely

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.620 
all the time so it is definitely
something<00:05:16.310> that<00:05:16.520> you<00:05:16.700> have<00:05:16.850> to<00:05:17.000> be<00:05:17.120> scared<00:05:17.390> of

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
something that you have to be scared of

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.170 
something that you have to be scared of
but<00:05:18.470> it's<00:05:18.680> not<00:05:18.800> something<00:05:19.220> that's<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.640> barrier

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
but it's not something that's a barrier

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.440 
but it's not something that's a barrier
for<00:05:20.450> me<00:05:20.600> it<00:05:20.870> probably<00:05:21.700> shows<00:05:22.700> me<00:05:22.850> more<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.300> want
