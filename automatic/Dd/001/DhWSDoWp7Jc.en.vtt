 in detail on the one hand follows a line of 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.159
 instability associated with a system 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.140
 front that is generating numerous 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.699
 precipitation areas in the state of 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.589
 texas and that can also be 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.509
 generating some showers and storms
