00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.599
 Hello friends here I cheat jesus 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.639
 good towers I will explain something that 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.440
 frequently consulted with the 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.920
 forums and I see that it is very asked what is 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.140
 where to get the cane seeds 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.300
 Sugar almost acquired this for the pussy 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.520
 I want the cane seed the rock if 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.190
 I have food and the cane is good 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.570
 sugar has some properties that is that 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.760
 you can make sugar worth and you can do 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.510
 paper that then will serve us to make 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.480
 a map in the following video 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.370
 where to get where to get the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.039
 seeds the seeds and in this case the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.469
 I've gotten there you see those 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.690
 that's sugar cane, it's worth that I've already 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.300
 planted here is worth in sugarcane 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.760
 the first height block does not have to 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.409
 remove it so it keeps growing because 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.430
 has a second level 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:01:01.600
 we give it to him and we take it worth for 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:05.619
 planting to plant does not need to 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.560
 tilling the land is worth just as 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.590
 you are seeing being next to the water and 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.250
 I'm worth for example here in this part 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.700
 we are not going to put 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.189
 here I am 28 I am going to put it here 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.439
 is the button 9 the right button has already 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.380
 planted does not respect the work only 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.960
 has to be next to the water is already 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.700
 it is worth collecting the catch 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.460
 only the row above by in this 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.350
 three levels is worth if you leave the first 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.920
 level this first level will continue 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.450
 growing and will be getting such 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.299
 For example, wheat is 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.759
 flies and yellowish is part of the 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:46.039
 food community does not love you 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.079
 enough is worth on this first Monday 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.049
 that at first what I did was 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.899
 go there is worth there there her away 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.849
 he took a few samples is in a few 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.270
 samples that serve or to cook 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:02.090
 or you used to make sugar or 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.340
 paper is worth always have to be at 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.170
 side of the water there can not be a box 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.819
 away as for example can 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.929
 happen with the wheat that can be 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.540
 up to three boxes 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.650
 he is water and put wheat here here and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.870
 here but with the sugarcane not what 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.400
 ideal is to make a central area and a 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.099
 circle around 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.170
 and you sow all of priego see as the 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.750
 wheat keeps growing these trees and 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.849
 plants continue to grow 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.610
 good wheat you will find 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.650
 always near the water already at the beginning 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.480
 we do not give it wheat or wheat but nothing 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.090
 sugar cane 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.280
 there is no sugar cane at the beginning what 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.390
 you have with you here you take the wheat 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.950
 when you break them, it's worth sometimes 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.319
 this is private then in this one that is that 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.080
 I was there, you come here, you take 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.120
 break up and if that cache 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.120
 plants you come here I will plant the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.120
 plant 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.310
 we already have there 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.180
 and good and we already have sugar cane that 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.000
 it's worth to us to make the paper and to 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.760
 make sugar is worth how sugar is made 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.410
 because you put one in the middle of the table 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.760
 of creation and sugar you and if you put 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.690
 three in horizontal line will be a papyrus 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.330
 of paper that we leave for the next 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.210
 episode I hope you liked it and 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.340
 well soon there will be more right now I'll

 to do another one that wants to make the videos 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.470
 very short very concise not to bore
