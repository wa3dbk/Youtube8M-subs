Walkie-talkie:
Got him. He's on the bag.

Keep everyone back until we
clear away the breakaway glass.

00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:39.215
Mr. Van orton,
don't open your eyes.

00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:41.751
This is breakaway glass,
but it can still cut you.

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:45.922
We're just gonna
take a look at you.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.323
I'm gonna check
your pulse.

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:53.797
Just take it easy.

00:00:53.864 --> 00:00:55.231
That was
quite a fall.

00:01:26.613 --> 00:01:29.232
Happy birthday, nickie.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.812
W-w-what is this?

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.948
It's your
birthday present.

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:06.335
I had to do something.

00:02:06.403 --> 00:02:09.773
You were becoming
such an asshole.

00:02:20.284 --> 00:02:23.386
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother nicholas van orton.

00:02:58.588 --> 00:02:59.522
Amazing.

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.291
