00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
I don't why but I can see that the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.100 
I don't why but I can see that the
articulation<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.099> this<00:02:19.310> thing<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:20.080> should<00:02:21.080> be

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
articulation of this thing is should be

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.270 
articulation of this thing is should be
quite<00:02:21.470> good<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.810> think

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
quite good I think

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.550 
quite good I think
big<00:02:26.739> will<00:02:27.739> be<00:02:27.980> quite<00:02:28.400> good<00:02:28.670> too

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
big will be quite good too

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.780 
big will be quite good too
because<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:33.050> Duloc<00:02:33.530> smile<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:34.069> like<00:02:34.280> out<00:02:34.519> of

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
because the Duloc smile is like out of

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.170 
because the Duloc smile is like out of
scale<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.720> mean<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.440> out<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:37.010> scale<00:02:37.400> it's

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
scale and I mean it's out of scale it's

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.080 
scale and I mean it's out of scale it's
too<00:02:38.420> big<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:39.080> mean<00:02:39.920> if<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.130> compare<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.790> this

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
too big I mean if I compare it to this

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.720 
too big I mean if I compare it to this
figure<00:02:41.540> here<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:42.680> should<00:02:42.860> be<00:02:42.920> bigger<00:02:43.310> it

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
figure here it should be bigger it

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.640 
figure here it should be bigger it
should<00:02:43.910> be<00:02:44.030> around<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.660> same<00:02:44.870> size<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.470> too

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
should be around the same size you too

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.750 
should be around the same size you too
stale<00:02:47.170> but<00:02:48.170> I'm<00:02:48.440> glad<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:49.069> didn't<00:02:49.459> get<00:02:49.580> that

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
stale but I'm glad I didn't get that

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.990 
stale but I'm glad I didn't get that
it's<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:50.060> bit<00:02:50.709> because<00:02:51.709> here<00:02:52.310> they<00:02:52.549> have<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.730> Lisa

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
it's a bit because here they have a Lisa

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.050 
it's a bit because here they have a Lisa
peak<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:54.430> think<00:02:55.430> can<00:02:55.640> transform<00:02:56.360> into<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.750> gun

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
peak I think can transform into a gun

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.380 
peak I think can transform into a gun
yep

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390
