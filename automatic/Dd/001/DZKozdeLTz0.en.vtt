00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hi how surely you will know the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.069
 ministry of education ie the miur a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.570
 me provides all those who 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.250
 they want to do tests with a limited number 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.610
 like that of medical dentistry 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.199
 veterinary and health professions with 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.880
 a program with guidelines 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.400
 general information on what the topics are from 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.109
 know to do these tests though 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.789
 we have seen in the video and general on 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.070
 biology topics to know there 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.840
 are five main topics according to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.920
 of these to the cell as the basis of the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.900
 life 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.340
 if you want to see the program or the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.649
 general video I put you linking 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 description or even above the video 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.940
 let's start right away as you want to see here 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.520
 are all the topics it covers 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.230
 the cell as a basis in life we ​​start a 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.050
 see the first one that the theory 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.180
 cellphone what you need to know about 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.340
 cell theory therefore essentially 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.370
 you must know how it was discovered 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.160
 what the cell theory says is so 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.930
 away because it is important because a lot 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.690
 often heights find the question who has 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.430
 discovered the cell what the says 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.339
 mobile jury and so on 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.310
 the lines are incendiary instead what 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.720
 you need to know who will want this topic 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.060
 essentially will defend to understand the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.640
 various cells that decreases each year 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.830
 understand why they decide different 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.229
 dimensions for example the cells because 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.240
 we are small and they are not huge because 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.030
 we are formed by so many cells does not give 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.159
 a few huge cells this happens 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 because the cell since it feeds for 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.670
 spread 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.560
 if the cell perhaps the very large 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.900
 diffusion could not take place e 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.700
 therefore the cell would die because not 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.300
 could feed this for example in the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.270
 symbols what you need to know 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.820
 then the third argument was cell 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.260
 prokaryotic of the quario what you must know 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.450
 you need to know about this topic 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.280
 essentially the differences between the one 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.720
 and the other then you have to study the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.510
 difference between leaving carioti 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.120
 prokaryotic, a practical example of this 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.150
 and I for example the core of the sky 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.770
 cariota there is not precisely there is a true e 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.900
 own core not because coated 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.970
 there is no membrane in prokaryotes 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.860
 the core is a sketch of number that 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.720
 it is called wheeler nuclei in fact 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.360
 prokaryotes means the nucleus 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.360
 primordial while a cariota means 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.540
 nucleus or eukaryote means nucleus 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.010
 true therefore there is a real this 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.220
 is an example of what you need to know e 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.710
 then just study the differences that 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.260
 there are so many other topics to be 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.910
 study the cell membrane what 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.890
 you need to know for the membrane test 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.840
 cell phone you need to know how you do that 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.640
 functions to then go and see that 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.800
 what are membrane phospholipids? 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.470
 membrane proteins market 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.060
 here is that it works in the membrane 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.650
 cellular structures instead of selling it to 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.570
 study what the components are 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.030
 of the c then the lattice 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.850
 endoplasmic smooth lattice 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.370
 wrinkled endoplasmic mitochondria e 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.120
 chloroplasts in plant cells e 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.880
 etc 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.940
 then study the names of the various organs 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.320
 ii and how these work then 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.150
 we go to study reproduction 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.370
 cellular cellular reproduction 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.190
 analyzes what the reproduction 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.920
 sexed ie meiosis is that 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.930
 sexed ie mitosis so much 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.170
 important to understand the differences between 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.310
 these two types of reproduction and how 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.650
 just 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.770
 they are carried out where which ones are held 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.510
 they are their phases etc. then they study 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.459
 then the chromosome kit goes to 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.530
 study the number of chromosomes of the 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.420
 organisms of chromosome organization 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.150
 and so on 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.580
 the last topic the animal tissues 20 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.230
 on animals precisely in this 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.300
 topic you have to study the four 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.239
 paintings sutor and peter iannone the 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.069
 connective nerve muscle e 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.790
 you have to understand the differences that are there 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.080
 you must also among these fabrics 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.819
 remember that hand fabrics do 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.400
 they join together to form the organs 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.260
 this is the important feature is 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.920
 essentially on the cell as a base 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.959
 of life 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.940
 all these topics are very much 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.819
 important also to then understand the tumi 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.590
 so we have also seen physiology in 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.140
 general what is in fact 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.750
 what are the things to know about this 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.150
 now as always if I liked 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.430
 put a like I visit my channel 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.069
 because you find all the playlists with 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.290
 precisely the topics organized therefore 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.570
 you will find all the b lists on chemistry 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.400
 of the winds all the playlist on the cycle 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.840
 as the basis of life where there are all 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.190
 grouped videos that talk about 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.990
 that topic 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.400
 furthermore, if you are not registered, register 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.520
 because as I do videos you are always 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.770
 updated 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.210
 and I also promised me and all of you 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.210
 look to bruce convinced hello soon
