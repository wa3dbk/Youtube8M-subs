 Hello everyone, today we will prepare cookies 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.160
 American classic ones with drops of 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.990
 chocolate that always goes well 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.060
 breakfast for a snack 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.140
 let's see together how they prepare themselves 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.200
 ingredients are 200 g of flour 00 90 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.239
 grams of butter at room temperature 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.719
 60 g of brown sugar 100 g of 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.690
 white sugar 150 g of drops of 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.860
 chocolate 10 grams of yeast per 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.890
 desserts start putting the butter and it 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.890
 sugar 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.730
 work them with a whisk up to 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.730
 amalgamate 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.300
 now you can add the long one 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.729
 add the baking powder that the flour 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.729
 sifted 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.129
 help yourself to say this with a spatula 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.549
 the mixture from the whisk and add the 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.549
 chocolate chips 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.760
 now you can take the daughter and of 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.010
 these la of baking paper and form the 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.630
 your cookies must be cookies 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.400
 balls a little less than a walnut 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.440
 usually the dough contains it 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.080
 a lot of butter should be left to rest for a while 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.900
 the fridge to prevent it during the 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.630
 cooking the butter melts and not 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.850
 keep the form in the case of bookies 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.000
 the fact that the butter melts during 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.970
 cooking is essential because it gives the 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 typical form of American biscuits ie 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.739
 crushed and villages 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.920
 riguardatevi to space to catch 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.690
 the balls of dough to prevent the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.260
 cookies stick together in 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.569
 oven 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.470
 better to cook a few revolts, but do them 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.470
 come as he writes 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.049
 so you to your to kiss in the oven 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.250
 preheated ventilated at 180 degrees for 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.350
 about 10 minutes 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.940
 I remind you that cookies should be removed 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.580
 from the oven when they're still a little and 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.960
 soft because during cold chin 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.960
 tends judgments 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.180
 and here are my American conquests 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.580
 if you want to prepare a version for it 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.770
 cocoa you can replace 30 grams of 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.900
 flour with 30 grams of bitter cocoa in 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.789
 dust and maybe use the drops of 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.979
 white chocolate instead of that of 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:52.110
 with teeth I hope this recipe there 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.110
 both enjoyed thanks to the next
