00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
I came into the education system as a

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.160 
I came into the education system as a
second<00:00:05.009> career<00:00:05.130> actually<00:00:05.520> but<00:00:06.180> always<00:00:06.870> had<00:00:07.140> a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the time I was a little girl so I wanted

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.099 
the time I was a little girl so I wanted
very<00:00:15.599> much<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:16.740> part<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.630> not<00:00:18.630> only<00:00:18.990> an

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
very much to be part of not only an

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.830 
very much to be part of not only an
education<00:00:19.260> system<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.550> was<00:00:20.910> new<00:00:21.510> and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
education system that was new and

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.840 
education system that was new and
innovative<00:00:22.230> which<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.160> believe<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> charter

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
innovative which I believe the charter

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.210 
innovative which I believe the charter
school<00:00:24.090> initiative<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:25.560> also<00:00:25.740> wanted<00:00:26.189> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
school initiative is but also wanted to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.279 
school initiative is but also wanted to
bring<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.609> model<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.300> Philadelphia<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.170> an

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
bring a model to Philadelphia to an

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.009 
bring a model to Philadelphia to an
urban<00:00:28.439> setting<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:30.179> unique<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
urban setting that was unique and

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.040 
urban setting that was unique and
innovative<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.610> brought<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> EIC<00:00:33.390> model

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
innovative and I brought the EIC model

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.139 
innovative and I brought the EIC model
here<00:00:34.500> which<00:00:35.160> stands<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.640> using<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
here which stands for using the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.270 
here which stands for using the
environment<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:36.870> an<00:00:37.140> integrating<00:00:37.680> context

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
environment as an integrating context

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.970 
environment as an integrating context
for<00:00:38.460> learning<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.780> ki<00:00:40.020> model<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> EIC

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
for learning the ki model and the EIC

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.770 
for learning the ki model and the EIC
model<00:00:41.460> go<00:00:41.610> hand-in-hand<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.480> we're<00:00:42.629> both

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
model go hand-in-hand because we're both

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.630 
model go hand-in-hand because we're both
innovative<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.399> we're<00:00:44.520> both

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
innovative and I think we're both

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.060 
innovative and I think we're both
forward-thinking<00:00:45.360> about<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.559> school

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
forward-thinking about what school

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.250 
forward-thinking about what school
should<00:00:47.340> look<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.690> means<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
should look like what that means is that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.110 
should look like what that means is that
our<00:00:49.739> students<00:00:50.280> are<00:00:50.430> immersed<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
our students are immersed in the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.180 
our students are immersed in the
environment<00:00:51.210> both<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> classroom<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
environment both in the classroom and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.160 
environment both in the classroom and
outside<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.789> classroom<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
outside the classroom and the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.319 
outside the classroom and the
environment<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> concepts<00:00:56.699> related<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
environment and the concepts related to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.540 
environment and the concepts related to
the<00:00:57.570> environment<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.559> not<00:00:58.859> only<00:00:59.070> taught<00:00:59.430> in

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the environment are not only taught in

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.160 
the environment are not only taught in
science<00:00:59.940> class<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.510> they're<00:01:00.660> taught<00:01:00.899> in

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
science class but they're taught in

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.680 
science class but they're taught in
reading<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.250> writing<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.910> also<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.510> that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
reading and writing and also in that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.380 
reading and writing and also in that
when<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.559> came<00:01:04.830> time<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.339> assign<00:01:05.640> classrooms

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
when it came time to assign classrooms

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.660 
when it came time to assign classrooms
for<00:01:06.689> instance<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.710> put<00:01:07.979> our<00:01:08.100> fourth<00:01:08.400> grade

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
for instance we put our fourth grade

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.210 
for instance we put our fourth grade
classrooms<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.140> side<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.040> building

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
classrooms on the side of the building

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.460 
classrooms on the side of the building
where<00:01:11.850> they<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.210> actually<00:01:12.390> overlook<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
where they can actually overlook the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.200 
where they can actually overlook the
pond<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> streams<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> wetlands

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
pond and the streams and the wetlands

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.060 
pond and the streams and the wetlands
and<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.080> reason<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.950> our

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and the reason for that is our

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.950 
and the reason for that is our
fourth-grade<00:01:17.460> studies<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.420> watershed

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
fourth-grade studies the watershed

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200 
fourth-grade studies the watershed
throughout<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> year<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.520> they<00:01:20.729> study<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
throughout the year so they study the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.960 
throughout the year so they study the
history<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.810> geography<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.530> ecology<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
history the geography the ecology the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.270 
history the geography the ecology the
science<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.750> watershed<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.189> able

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
science of the watershed and to be able

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.490 
science of the watershed and to be able
to<00:01:26.520> watch<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.150> watershed<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.840> action<00:01:28.290> through

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to watch the watershed in action through

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.670 
to watch the watershed in action through
the<00:01:28.560> seasons<00:01:29.130> was<00:01:29.729> very<00:01:29.970> purposely<00:01:30.420> done<00:01:30.689> also

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the seasons was very purposely done also

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.640 
the seasons was very purposely done also
at<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.280> lower<00:01:32.460> levels<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> k2<00:01:33.420> level<00:01:34.020> we

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
at the lower levels at the k2 level we

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.710 
at the lower levels at the k2 level we
have<00:01:34.799> doorways<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.640> directly<00:01:35.790> from

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
have doorways that go directly from

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.050 
have doorways that go directly from
their<00:01:37.049> classroom<00:01:37.560> right<00:01:37.950> out<00:01:38.250> into<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
their classroom right out into the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
their classroom right out into the
outdoor<00:01:39.450> learning<00:01:39.840> lab<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:41.070> so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
outdoor learning lab and that was so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.850 
outdoor learning lab and that was so
teachers<00:01:41.610> whenever<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.450> wanted<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.320> could

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
teachers whenever they wanted to could

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.560 
teachers whenever they wanted to could
literally<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.549> open<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.970> door<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.210> walk

literally just open the door and walk

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.260 
literally just open the door and walk
outside<00:01:46.070> our<00:01:47.070> students<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> quarter<00:01:48.090> mile
