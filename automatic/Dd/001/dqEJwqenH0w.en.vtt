00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:06.760 
first things first we're going to die

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.570 
first things first we're going to die
electrically<00:00:07.390> grease<00:00:07.690> the<00:00:08.340> connections<00:00:09.340> on

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.580 
electrically grease the connections on

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
the plow itself put the caps on it too

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.630 
the plow itself put the caps on it too
just<00:00:14.230> like<00:00:14.590> we<00:00:14.709> did<00:00:14.830> on<00:00:14.949> the<00:00:14.980> truck<00:00:17.640> light

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
just like we did on the truck light

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.800 
just like we did on the truck light
harnesses<00:00:19.240> we're<00:00:19.390> going<00:00:19.570> to<00:00:19.660> die

electrically<00:00:20.470> grease<00:00:20.679> them<00:00:20.949> as<00:00:21.099> well

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.680 

and<00:00:26.070> plug<00:00:26.430> them<00:00:26.580> into<00:00:26.880> each<00:00:27.030> other<00:00:27.270> so<00:00:27.540> they're

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
and plug them into each other so they're

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.060 
and plug them into each other so they're
not<00:00:27.870> exposed<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> elements<00:00:28.770> the<00:00:31.070> next

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
not exposed to the elements the next

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.110 
this plow for example one of these hinge
connections<00:00:43.080> we're<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:44.090> grease<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
connections we're going to grease that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.340 
connections we're going to grease that
we<00:00:45.720> use<00:00:45.930> white<00:00:46.290> lithium<00:00:46.620> grease<00:00:47.629> just<00:00:48.629> grease

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
we use white lithium grease just grease

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.010 
we use white lithium grease just grease
her<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:51.650> that<00:00:52.650> helps<00:00:52.950> prevent<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.780> horse<00:00:54.780> from

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
her up that helps prevent the horse from

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.799 
her up that helps prevent the horse from
getting<00:00:55.350> corroded<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:56.100> also<00:00:56.280> keeps<00:00:56.760> them<00:00:57.659> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
getting corroded it also keeps them in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.960 
getting corroded it also keeps them in
good<00:00:58.019> working<00:00:58.260> order<00:01:04.610> we're<00:01:05.610> also<00:01:05.730> going<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
good working order we're also going to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.670 
good working order we're also going to
throw<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.420> lithium<00:01:06.960> grease<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
throw a little lithium grease on the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.470 
throw a little lithium grease on the
cylinders<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.370> helps<00:01:08.580> protect<00:01:08.970> them<00:01:09.120> from

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
cylinders that helps protect them from

we're<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> work<00:01:27.600> ourselves<00:01:27.810> around<00:01:28.230> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
we're going to work ourselves around the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.250 
we're going to work ourselves around the
plow<00:01:28.830> for<00:01:29.730> example<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.480> revolution

version there are some joints that

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.630 
version there are some joints that
should<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.630> greased<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.380> helps<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
should be greased up that helps get it

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.580

revolution types these joints can be

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.590 
revolution types these joints can be
greased<00:01:47.010> too<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.430> helps<00:01:47.610> keep<00:01:47.910> the<00:01:47.970> sound<00:01:48.330> down

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
greased too it helps keep the sound down

00:01:48.600 --> 00:02:01.220
