00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.490 
New York then had to come back early
because<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.630> weather<00:00:21.810> wasn't<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.289> greatest

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
because the weather wasn't the greatest

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.240 
because the weather wasn't the greatest
as<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.949> can<00:00:23.100> see<00:00:23.539> it's<00:00:24.539> raining<00:00:27.890> so<00:00:28.890> today<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
as you can see it's raining so today I

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.950 
as you can see it's raining so today I
thought<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.609> give<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.939> little<00:00:30.119> quick<00:00:30.660> tour

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
thought you give you a little quick tour

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.580 
thought you give you a little quick tour
and<00:00:31.199> start<00:00:31.740> up<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.070> car

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
and start up of this car

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
and start up of this car
actually<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.649> really<00:00:34.950> like<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.340> Malibu<00:00:35.820> it's

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
this is the LT version so it's likely

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.770 
this is the LT version so it's likely
got<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.670> four-cylinder<00:00:54.660> Ecotec<00:00:56.720> kind<00:00:57.720> of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
got a four-cylinder Ecotec kind of

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.840 
got a four-cylinder Ecotec kind of
reminds<00:00:58.110> me<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:59.130> days<00:00:59.309> when<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.730> my

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
reminds me of the days when I have my

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.080 
reminds me of the days when I have my
lumina<00:01:02.420> there<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.510> go

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.130 

here's<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> interior<00:01:11.930> actually<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.140> LSS

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
here's the interior actually if my LSS

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.880 
here's the interior actually if my LSS
decides<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.350> go

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
decides to go

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.850 
decides to go
I<00:01:16.920> might<00:01:17.670> actually<00:01:18.170> buy<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.410> these<00:01:19.560> cars

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
I might actually buy one of these cars

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.300 
I might actually buy one of these cars
are<00:01:19.950> actually<00:01:20.220> really<00:01:20.580> nice-looking<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:23.280> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
are actually really nice-looking but I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:36.730 
are actually really nice-looking but I
would<00:01:23.550> probably<00:01:23.670> get<00:01:23.910> the<00:01:24.440> 3.6<00:01:25.440> liter<00:01:31.580> okay<00:01:32.580> so

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.249 

it's<00:01:37.740> got<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> nice<00:01:38.100> interior<00:01:41.509> nice<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.690> snug

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
it's got a nice interior nice and snug

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.460 
it's got a nice interior nice and snug
very<00:01:43.710> comfortable<00:01:44.100> seats<00:01:45.140> yeah<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.320> only

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
very comfortable seats yeah the only

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.870 
very comfortable seats yeah the only
thing<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.890> don't<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.100> about<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.580> car<00:01:47.789> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
thing I don't like about this car is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.510 
thing I don't like about this car is
that<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.450> blind<00:01:48.840> spot<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.560> back<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
that the blind spot in the back is a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.029 
that the blind spot in the back is a
little<00:01:50.550> bit<00:01:51.320> difficult<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> see<00:01:52.440> in<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.860> my

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
little bit difficult to see in like my

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:06.160 
little bit difficult to see in like my
LSS<00:01:54.500> alright<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.800> let's<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:56.340> how<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.729> starts

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:17.080 

okay<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.350> love<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.710> gauge<00:02:07.920> sweep<00:02:08.220> watch<00:02:08.400> this

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.640 

okay<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.260> has<00:02:18.819> thirty<00:02:19.819> six<00:02:20.319> thousand<00:02:21.319> seven

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
okay so it has thirty six thousand seven

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.080 
okay so it has thirty six thousand seven
hundred<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.280> eighty-three<00:02:23.020> K<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:25.370> this<00:02:25.580> rides

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
hundred and eighty-three K so this rides

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.350 
hundred and eighty-three K so this rides
on<00:02:26.420> GM's<00:02:26.959> epsilon<00:02:27.709> platform<00:02:28.250> very<00:02:28.580> similar<00:02:29.060> to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
on GM's epsilon platform very similar to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.550 
on GM's epsilon platform very similar to
the<00:02:29.569> Pontiac<00:02:30.140> g6<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.340> Saturn<00:02:31.910> Aura<00:02:33.370> now

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
the Pontiac g6 and the Saturn Aura now

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.680 
the Pontiac g6 and the Saturn Aura now
when<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.590> first<00:02:36.920> introduced<00:02:37.430> in<00:02:37.610> 2008<00:02:38.330> they

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
when I first introduced in 2008 they

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.520 
when I first introduced in 2008 they
came<00:02:38.900> with<00:02:39.110> three<00:02:39.500> motors<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.790> 2.4<00:02:41.720> Ecotec<00:02:42.319> as

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
came with three motors the 2.4 Ecotec as

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.400 
came with three motors the 2.4 Ecotec as
you<00:02:42.880> just<00:02:43.880> seen<00:02:44.060> well<00:02:44.360> I'll<00:02:45.050> show<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
you just seen well I'll show you the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.830 
you just seen well I'll show you the
engine<00:02:45.830> Wow<00:02:46.819> it's<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.090> really<00:02:47.269> nine<00:02:47.480> degrees

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
engine Wow it's the really nine degrees

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.320 
engine Wow it's the really nine degrees
that's<00:02:48.050> pretty<00:02:48.290> cold<00:02:48.790> they<00:02:49.790> came<00:02:49.970> with<00:02:50.150> the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
that's pretty cold they came with the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.500 
that's pretty cold they came with the
3.5<00:02:51.200> liter<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.830> then<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.190> 3.6<00:02:52.970> liter<00:02:53.209> which

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
3.5 liter and then the 3.6 liter which

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:02.320 
3.5 liter and then the 3.6 liter which
is<00:02:53.660> probably<00:02:54.019> a<00:02:54.080> very<00:02:54.110> good<00:02:54.319> engine<00:02:55.120> so<00:03:01.330> if

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
is probably a very good engine so if

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.190 
is probably a very good engine so if
they<00:03:02.690> dirtied<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:04.280> does<00:03:04.489> have<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:05.299> six-speed

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
they dirtied it so does have a six-speed

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.630 
they dirtied it so does have a six-speed
Automatic<00:03:06.860> transmission<00:03:10.599> just<00:03:11.599> pretty<00:03:11.810> good

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
Automatic transmission just pretty good

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.110 
Automatic transmission just pretty good
at<00:03:13.640> least<00:03:14.410> my<00:03:15.410> versa<00:03:16.069> well<00:03:16.670> my<00:03:16.819> mother's

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
at least my versa well my mother's

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.670 
at least my versa well my mother's
versatile<00:03:17.450> has<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.569> force<00:03:17.900> beyond<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> Mac<00:03:18.470> and

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
versatile has a force beyond a Mac and

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.630 
versatile has a force beyond a Mac and
it's<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.830> same<00:03:19.130> year<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:21.890> I'll<00:03:22.250> show<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.519> the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
it's the same year so I'll show you the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.420 
it's the same year so I'll show you the
motor

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.670 

definitely<00:03:29.150> like<00:03:29.239> these<00:03:29.680> deceleration
