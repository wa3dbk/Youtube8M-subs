00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.710
 as we said at the beginning of our 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.110
 program today we are going to talk about 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.840
 an extremely interesting subject such as 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.730
 which is the antioxidants but knows that 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.619
 you and I often do not 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.210
 we know exactly what the 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.980
 antioxidants today we're going 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.140
 to comment and for that obviously story 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.630
 with my partner and friend donato of the 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.210
 sheet so is it born that are the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.620
 antioxidants to start to start 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.770
 let's understand 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.940
 where oxidation comes from 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.950
 of this planet 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.280
 had nitrogen atmosphere 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.670
 and then comes the origin of life in 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.670
 the oceans 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.440
 the cells start to appear and the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.710
 first cells that appear are the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.710
 vegetables 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.970
 the vegetables 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.970
 produce oxygen 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.890
 through the photosynthesis of light 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.880
 of the sun there is a process where 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.880
 absorb 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.210
 and carbon oxide and exhale oxygen 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.820
 then the atmosphere of the planet changes 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 from nitrogen to oxygen 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.930
 completely change the kind of life that 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.930
 there is on the planet 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:43.149
 oxygen you know is a paradox because 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.149
 we have 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.799
 in the brain 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.579
 consumes oxygen and 10 minutes without oxygen 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:57.100
 general brain death and then 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.810
 you need oxygen on the one hand but for 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.810
 On the other side , oxygen oxidizes 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.280
 then we have to be very careful 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.039
 to maintain a balance 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.030
 and for this we need to be taking 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.950
 constantly antioxidant foods and 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.560
 these are 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.300
 those that protect us from oxidation ok 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.060
 how was adapted to this process in 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.250
 chemical terms 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.480
 week 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:33.700
 a took loses an electron when it loses 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.380
 an electron immediately turns to 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.690
 complement to recover that electron 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.640
 of his immediate environment that falls then 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.010
 begins to steal and this to the other and there is the 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.040
 another and a chain reaction is created and 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.040
 that is what promotes oxidation 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.620
 so I need food that I 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.410
 provide those reserve electrons for 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.260
 that the atoms catch them and not 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.430
 destroy my tissues what do you 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.640
 I was going to ask because many times 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.860
 we say good the antioxidant 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.930
 I need it in food but for 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.250
 that works is to say in terms 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.530
 more colloquial skin that works for us 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.290
 the skin or that it brings us for our 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.569
 skin I do not know that we remove wrinkles 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.370
 or do not leave less wrinkles or in the 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.860
 stretch marks or cellulite is someone who 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.440
 it benefits us look is very simple to 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.960
 to be alive 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.960
 to be seen what happens with the 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.570
 society society is involved 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.750
 is committed is giving toluca 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.030
 because he wants to be old society that 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.390
 is giving an aging process 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.070
 early because work is because 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.080
 they want to work crap because 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.360
 they want to rust because they want to 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.700
 taste 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.510
 and then what happens I told you 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.440
 many times we see the old oriental 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.660
 it is wisdom symbol 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.340
 is agile is slender is autonomous not 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.980
 need relatives to walk the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.940
 bringing carrying does not need to be 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:18.140
 change diapers do not raise the plane 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:20.299
 why and why is this because he eats 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.270
 a proper way and age your 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.820
 oxidation time causes you the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.880
 early aging where it is reflected 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.250
 obviously in the hair on the skin in 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.740
 We can find all those sides 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.780
 antioxidants in what foods in all 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.600
 blackberries blackberries raspberries 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.750
 blueberries everything that has that 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.180
 little blue blueberry dictated and now 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.310
 also for example the lemon peel 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.780
 the white the citrus peel you see 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.130
 that there is a white capita 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.890
 those are bioflavonoids are 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.390
 antioxidants because that's why the tonic 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.250
 the world that I recommend in the 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.100
 mornings that takes ginger and honey and 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.460
 Lemon carries the whole lemons with everything 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.020
 and the shell to be able to provide those 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.090
 antioxidant antioxidants there are many 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.340
 in the food 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.750
 but you need to eat raw we're going to be 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.680
 mentioning this during the course 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.280
 of our program and by the 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.280
 quantified 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.260
 and much more in terms of what it is that 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.430
 we should eat good the university 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.410
 humanist what is the career of 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.390
 nutrition there you will learn everything is 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.950
 much more about food than what 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.990
 contain what it is that serves us to 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.760
 what for parks and why not what and 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.650
 which ones not at the humanistic university in 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.330
 nutrition career phones 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.890
 appear on the screen we continue with more 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.660
 of a thousand weapons right now of course 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.090
 to continue with more of this topic and much 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.470
 more and this for now let's go with the 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.570
 lady moon from the side that is us 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.280
 waiting in the kitchen and of course not 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.940
 be dear money bernie that are already 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.940
 what side forward
