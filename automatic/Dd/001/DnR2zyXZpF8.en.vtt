micro racing car so it comes with the
track<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.529> the<00:00:16.529> launcher<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.250> one<00:00:17.970> vehicle

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.750 

you<00:00:21.630> see<00:00:21.930> here<00:00:22.320> comes<00:00:22.590> with<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.859> squid<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.580> looks

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
you see here comes with a squid it looks

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.519 
you see here comes with a squid it looks
kind<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.359> spider<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.930> me<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.289> then

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
kind of like a spider to me but then

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.230 
kind of like a spider to me but then
this<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.740> supposed<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.369> good<00:00:26.580> that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
this is supposed to be as good that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.540 
this is supposed to be as good that
you're<00:00:27.359> supposed<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> escape<00:00:28.349> from<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:29.220> order

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550

you're supposed to escape from in order
to<00:00:29.730> win<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.189> squid<00:00:32.489> actually<00:00:32.969> attacks<00:00:33.890> so

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
to win and the squid actually attacks so

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.920 
to win and the squid actually attacks so
this<00:00:35.579> could<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.820> very<00:00:36.059> interesting<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
this could be very interesting and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.430 
this could be very interesting and

okay our track is ready let's take out
the<00:02:37.409> launcher<00:02:38.409> and<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.849> car<00:02:44.010> check<00:02:45.010> the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
the launcher and the car check the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:03:17.300 
the launcher and the car check the
launcher<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:47.760> very<00:02:48.760> secure<00:03:09.239> super<00:03:10.239> tiny<00:03:10.450> car

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:53.680 

put<00:03:18.310> in<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.549> batteries

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:44.250 

hey<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:55.050> load<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.350> car<00:03:55.560> back<00:03:56.459> inning

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.840 

so<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.410> squid<00:04:45.710> thing<00:04:45.920> suppose<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.490> rabbit

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
so the squid thing suppose the rabbit

00:04:46.850 --> 00:05:00.620 
so the squid thing suppose the rabbit
supposed<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.180> drop<00:04:47.420> down

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:45.309 

taken

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.499 

okay<00:05:46.319> so<00:05:46.379> that<00:05:47.009> little<00:05:47.219> micro<00:05:47.550> car<00:05:47.789> is<00:05:48.060> still

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
okay so that little micro car is still

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.529 
okay so that little micro car is still
going<00:05:49.050> in<00:05:49.229> circles<00:05:49.680> I'm<00:05:49.919> not<00:05:50.280> sure<00:05:50.699> how<00:05:51.120> it's

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
going in circles I'm not sure how it's

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.360 
going in circles I'm not sure how it's
supposed<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.020> make<00:05:52.169> its<00:05:52.349> way<00:05:52.499> back<00:05:52.710> out<00:05:52.949> once

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
supposed to make its way back out once

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.309 
supposed to make its way back out once
it's<00:05:54.150> inside<00:05:54.749> the<00:05:55.499> squid<00:05:56.180> and<00:05:57.180> I<00:05:57.719> also<00:05:58.110> had

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
it's inside the squid and I also had

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.320 
it's inside the squid and I also had
trouble<00:05:58.680> getting<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:59.129> squid<00:05:59.430> to<00:05:59.460> work<00:05:59.879> it's

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
trouble getting the squid to work it's

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.580 
trouble getting the squid to work it's
supposed<00:06:00.810> to

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
supposed to

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:08.739 
supposed to
I<00:06:03.259> suppose<00:06:04.259> the<00:06:04.469> rhombus<00:06:04.860> must<00:06:05.069> come<00:06:05.340> down

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:08.749 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:12.550 

when<00:06:09.749> it<00:06:09.870> overage<00:06:10.319> goes<00:06:11.189> down<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.580> dip<00:06:11.789> in<00:06:12.029> the

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
when it overage goes down the dip in the

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.709 
when it overage goes down the dip in the
no<00:06:13.560> mechanism<00:06:14.129> here<00:06:14.430> but<00:06:14.759> it<00:06:15.120> doesn't<00:06:15.509> seem<00:06:15.659> to

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
no mechanism here but it doesn't seem to

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:20.899 
no mechanism here but it doesn't seem to
do<00:06:15.960> it<00:06:16.110> very<00:06:16.379> often<00:06:19.069> so<00:06:20.069> overall<00:06:20.430> I<00:06:20.490> think<00:06:20.639> this

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
do it very often so overall I think this

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:24.260 
do it very often so overall I think this
is<00:06:21.090> a<00:06:21.120> pretty<00:06:21.539> cool<00:06:21.840> set<00:06:22.550> the<00:06:23.550> only<00:06:24.000> problem

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
is a pretty cool set the only problem

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.550 
is a pretty cool set the only problem
was<00:06:24.389> like<00:06:24.569> the<00:06:24.719> square<00:06:24.960> didn't<00:06:25.229> work<00:06:25.379> that

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
was like the square didn't work that

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.529 
was like the square didn't work that
well<00:06:25.740> and<00:06:26.099> once<00:06:26.370> it's<00:06:26.550> it<00:06:26.879> was<00:06:27.000> inside<00:06:27.419> the

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
well and once it's it was inside the

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.050 
well and once it's it was inside the
squid<00:06:27.919> doesn't<00:06:28.919> seem<00:06:29.069> to<00:06:29.159> come<00:06:29.310> out<00:06:29.340> but

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
squid doesn't seem to come out but

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.029 
squid doesn't seem to come out but
otherwise<00:06:30.479> the<00:06:30.840> track<00:06:31.139> is<00:06:31.319> a<00:06:31.349> lot<00:06:31.529> of<00:06:31.650> fun<00:06:31.860> you

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
otherwise the track is a lot of fun you

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.529 
otherwise the track is a lot of fun you
just<00:06:32.250> have<00:06:32.340> to<00:06:32.370> charge<00:06:32.669> it<00:06:32.789> up<00:06:32.879> and<00:06:33.060> it<00:06:33.419> goes

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
just have to charge it up and it goes

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.990 
just have to charge it up and it goes
really<00:06:33.719> fast<00:06:33.870> and<00:06:34.590> I<00:06:35.069> can<00:06:35.219> see<00:06:35.490> how<00:06:35.699> if<00:06:35.909> you

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
really fast and I can see how if you

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.879 
really fast and I can see how if you
have<00:06:36.089> more<00:06:36.300> than<00:06:36.419> one<00:06:36.629> car<00:06:37.020> it<00:06:37.349> would<00:06:37.469> be<00:06:37.620> a<00:06:37.650> lot

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
have more than one car it would be a lot

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.339 
have more than one car it would be a lot
of<00:06:37.919> fun<00:06:38.330> so<00:06:39.330> let<00:06:39.509> me<00:06:39.599> know<00:06:39.779> what<00:06:39.960> you<00:06:40.050> think<00:06:40.199> of

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
of fun so let me know what you think of
