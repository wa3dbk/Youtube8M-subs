00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.090 

now<00:00:21.900> make<00:00:22.050> sure<00:00:22.080> you're<00:00:22.410> muting<00:00:22.830> with<00:00:22.949> your

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
now make sure you're muting with your

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.519 
now make sure you're muting with your
palm<00:00:23.310> hand<00:00:23.640> instead<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.920> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.070> go<00:00:30.529> alright

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
so that's that chord a minor home then

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:43.569 
so that's that chord a minor home then
it<00:00:34.020> goes<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:35.480> a<00:00:36.920> SE<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.219> d<00:00:38.430> minor<00:00:40.910> like<00:00:41.910> that

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
it goes to a SE it's a d minor like that

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.729 
it goes to a SE it's a d minor like that
this<00:00:44.579> finger<00:00:44.969> these<00:00:45.600> two<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.530> up

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this finger these two and then this up

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.310 
this finger these two and then this up
here<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.270> looks<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.989> same

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
here so it kind of looks like that same

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.299 
here so it kind of looks like that same
chord<00:00:49.710> well<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> major<00:00:52.079> right<00:00:52.829> but

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309

it's<00:01:59.119> an<00:01:59.240> E<00:01:59.390> chord<00:02:02.380> but<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.500> also<00:02:03.619> sounds<00:02:03.920> good

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
it's an E chord but it also sounds good

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.389 
it's an E chord but it also sounds good
if<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.369> just<00:02:04.580> play<00:02:04.759> in<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:05.030> few<00:02:05.300> middle<00:02:09.070> so<00:02:10.070> and

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
if you just play in a few middle so and

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.479 
if you just play in a few middle so and
then<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.670> goes<00:02:10.789> back<00:02:10.820> to<00:02:11.269> a<00:02:11.300> my<00:02:11.690> phone<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:13.160> and

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
then it goes back to a my phone so and

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:35.650 
then it goes back to a my phone so and
all<00:02:13.640> in<00:02:13.790> all<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.360> goes<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:35.239> then<00:02:35.420> there's<00:02:35.600> a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
all in all it goes and then there's a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:03:18.920 
all in all it goes and then there's a
walk<00:02:35.870> down

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.970 

so<00:03:19.930> that's<00:03:20.050> how<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.200> play<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.470> thing

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
so that's how to play that thing

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.730 
so that's how to play that thing
whatever<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:21.880> just<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.930> minor<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:24.610> D<00:03:24.820> minor

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
whatever it is just a a minor to D minor

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.960 
whatever it is just a a minor to D minor
to<00:03:26.740> G<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:28.570> C<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:30.010> F<00:03:30.040> sharp<00:03:30.370> major<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:32.110> D<00:03:32.350> minor<00:03:32.970> to

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
to G to C to F sharp major to D minor to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.690 
to G to C to F sharp major to D minor to
e7<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:35.490> then<00:03:36.490> back<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:37.170> minor<00:03:38.940> like<00:03:39.940> that

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
e7 and then back to a minor like that

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.630 
e7 and then back to a minor like that
there<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.760> go<00:03:42.850> good<00:03:43.570> luck
