00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.530 
I collec shot glasses want to go on
vacation<00:00:04.710> so<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.550> decided<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.060> make<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.270> shelf

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
vacation so I decided to make a shelf

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.020 
vacation so I decided to make a shelf
for<00:00:06.690> them<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:07.020> forty<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.309> made<00:00:08.520> five<00:00:08.760> shelves

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
for them I forty so I made five shelves

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.690 
for them I forty so I made five shelves
of<00:00:09.240> eight<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.840> measured<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:10.920> glass<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.580> was

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
of eight I measured one glass and it was

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.640 
of eight I measured one glass and it was
two<00:00:11.940> inches<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.420> diameter<00:00:12.570> by<00:00:13.080> 2<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.559> 1/4

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
two inches in diameter by 2 and 1/4

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.950 
two inches in diameter by 2 and 1/4
inches<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.309> height<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> made<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:15.480> shelf

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
inches in height so I made one shelf

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.510 
inches in height so I made one shelf
with<00:00:16.200> a<00:00:16.230> height<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.439> three<00:00:16.740> inches<00:00:17.040> for<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
with a height of three inches for the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.359 
with a height of three inches for the
short<00:00:17.730> ones<00:00:17.939> and<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.810> rest<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.290> made<00:00:19.649> three<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
short ones and the rest I made three and

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.639 
short ones and the rest I made three and
a<00:00:20.399> half<00:00:20.550> inches<00:00:20.849> I<00:00:21.060> wanted<00:00:21.960> each<00:00:22.140> glass<00:00:22.439> to

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:22.649 
a half inches I wanted each glass to

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.740 
a half inches I wanted each glass to
have<00:00:22.770> about<00:00:23.009> 2.5<00:00:23.550> inches<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.180> horizontal

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
have about 2.5 inches of horizontal

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.850 
have about 2.5 inches of horizontal
space<00:00:24.989> so<00:00:25.860> 2.5<00:00:26.579> times<00:00:27.000> 8<00:00:27.270> is<00:00:27.450> 20<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.649> also

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
space so 2.5 times 8 is 20 but I also

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.440 
space so 2.5 times 8 is 20 but I also
wanted<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.309> whole<00:00:29.399> thing<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:29.880> 20<00:00:30.210> inches

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
wanted the whole thing to be 20 inches

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.630 
wanted the whole thing to be 20 inches
wide<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:30.989> just<00:00:31.230> made<00:00:31.439> each<00:00:31.649> shelf<00:00:31.980> 19<00:00:32.340> inches

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
wide so I just made each shelf 19 inches

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.090 
wide so I just made each shelf 19 inches
the<00:00:33.329> outside<00:00:33.600> frame<00:00:33.809> should<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.350> sturdy<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.040> I

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the outside frame should be sturdy so I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.040 
the outside frame should be sturdy so I
made<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.430> half<00:00:35.640> an<00:00:35.820> inch<00:00:35.970> thick<00:00:36.240> and<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
made that half an inch thick and the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.750 
made that half an inch thick and the
shelves<00:00:37.320> don't<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.830> be<00:00:37.920> quite<00:00:38.310> as<00:00:38.490> thick

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
shelves don't have to be quite as thick

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.160 
shelves don't have to be quite as thick
because<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.210> classes<00:00:39.450> don't<00:00:39.810> weigh<00:00:39.930> too<00:00:39.990> much

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
because the classes don't weigh too much

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.530 
because the classes don't weigh too much
so<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.950> made<00:00:41.130> them<00:00:41.370> three-eighths<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.150> of<00:00:42.330> an

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
so I made them three-eighths in it of an

00:00:42.540 --> 00:01:00.350 
so I made them three-eighths in it of an
inch<00:00:42.690> thick<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:57.920> two<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.820> shelves<00:01:00.090> together

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
inch thick and two the shelves together

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.200 
inch thick and two the shelves together
okay<00:01:01.200> so<00:01:01.260> these<00:01:01.530> shelves<00:01:02.010> are<00:01:02.280> 24<00:01:02.910> inches

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
okay so these shelves are 24 inches

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.469 
okay so these shelves are 24 inches
that's<00:01:03.570> too<00:01:03.780> long<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:05.129> them<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.549> 19

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that's too long I want them to be 19

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:34.490 
that's too long I want them to be 19
inches<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:30.290> rain<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:33.270> two<00:01:33.420> top<00:01:33.690> ones<00:01:33.720> are

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
inches so rain so the two top ones are

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.060 
inches so rain so the two top ones are
going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.220> 20<00:01:35.820> inches<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.590> two<00:01:37.770> sides

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
going to be 20 inches and the two sides

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:56.390 
going to be 20 inches and the two sides
are<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.880> 19<00:01:39.750> inches<00:01:54.979> this<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.159> just

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
are going to be 19 inches this is just

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:08.090 
are going to be 19 inches this is just
so<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.729> lines<00:01:57.090> are<00:01:57.299> straight

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.469 

after<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.250> wood<00:02:09.369> was<00:02:09.550> cut<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:10.000> even<00:02:10.300> know<00:02:10.390> what

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
after the wood was cut I even know what

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.950 
after the wood was cut I even know what
the<00:02:10.570> edges<00:02:10.840> using<00:02:11.140> sandpaper<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.330> did<00:02:13.600> try

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
the edges using sandpaper so I did try

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.630 
the edges using sandpaper so I did try
to<00:02:13.990> glue<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.590> frame<00:02:14.800> together<00:02:14.980> but<00:02:15.460> that

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
to glue the frame together but that

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.940 
to glue the frame together but that
didn't<00:02:15.970> really<00:02:16.060> work<00:02:16.360> out<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:17.290> instead<00:02:17.440> I

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
didn't really work out so instead I

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.950 
didn't really work out so instead I
decided<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.460> nail<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.640> together<00:02:18.880> this<00:02:19.720> just

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
decided to nail it together this just

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.630 
decided to nail it together this just
makes<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.290> process<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.800> drilling<00:02:21.010> holes<00:02:21.370> a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
makes the process of drilling holes a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.670 
makes the process of drilling holes a
lot<00:02:21.970> easier<00:02:22.330> because<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.140> won't<00:02:23.290> have<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.530> worry

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
lot easier because I won't have to worry

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.200 
lot easier because I won't have to worry
about<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.040> frame<00:02:24.220> falling<00:02:24.550> apart<00:02:24.850> while<00:02:25.090> I'm

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
about the frame falling apart while I'm

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.780 
about the frame falling apart while I'm
drilling<00:02:25.470> here<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.530> already<00:02:27.250> nailed<00:02:27.460> three

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
drilling here I already nailed three

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.210 
drilling here I already nailed three
pieces<00:02:28.030> together<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.680> just<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
pieces together and this is just the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.360 
pieces together and this is just the
last<00:02:30.400> piece<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:32.380> this<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.770> screw<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:33.280> I'm

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
last piece so this is a screw that I'm

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.740 
last piece so this is a screw that I'm
going<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.610> be<00:02:33.760> using<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:34.300> put<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.600> frame

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
going to be using to put the frame

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.660 
going to be using to put the frame
together<00:02:34.980> now<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.010> need<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.370> pick<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.640> right

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
together now I need to pick the right

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.630 
together now I need to pick the right
size<00:02:36.820> drill<00:02:37.270> bit<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.750> can<00:02:37.900> drill<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.680> hole<00:02:38.920> in

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
size drill bit so I can drill a hole in

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.310 
size drill bit so I can drill a hole in
the<00:02:39.790> wood<00:02:39.970> if<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.840> use<00:02:41.020> 332<00:02:41.800> or<00:02:42.720> 1/16<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:44.200> gonna

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
the wood if I use 332 or 1/16 it's gonna

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.620 
the wood if I use 332 or 1/16 it's gonna
be<00:02:44.470> too<00:02:44.740> narrow<00:02:45.070> of<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.460> hole<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.940> I'm<00:02:46.480> gonna

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
be too narrow of a hole and I'm gonna

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.540 
be too narrow of a hole and I'm gonna
have<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.930> use<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.110> lot<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.500> effort<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:48.070> screw<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
have to use a lot of effort to screw the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.960 
have to use a lot of effort to screw the
same<00:02:48.730> on<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.360> other<00:02:49.420> hand<00:02:49.720> if<00:02:49.990> I<00:02:50.140> use<00:02:50.610> 532<00:02:51.610> or

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
same on the other hand if I use 532 or

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:07.440 
same on the other hand if I use 532 or
960<00:02:52.480> for<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:53.380> hole<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.650> gonna<00:02:53.710> be<00:02:53.920> too<00:02:54.130> wide<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
960 for the hole is gonna be too wide to

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.210 
960 for the hole is gonna be too wide to
secure<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.930> drill<00:03:08.140> bit<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.620> rotate<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
secure the drill bit you rotate the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.280 
secure the drill bit you rotate the
metal<00:03:09.459> piece<00:03:09.640> clockwise<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.480> then<00:03:11.110> to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
metal piece clockwise and then to

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.530 
metal piece clockwise and then to
tighten<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.739> even<00:03:11.920> further<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.940> use<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.330> key

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
tighten it even further you use the key

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.320 
tighten it even further you use the key
and<00:03:13.750> rotate<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.320> clockwise<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.330> then

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
and rotate that clockwise and then

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:26.400 
and rotate that clockwise and then
you're<00:03:16.480> all<00:03:16.600> set<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.840> use<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.260> drill<00:03:25.410> so

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
you're all set to use the drill so

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.260 
you're all set to use the drill so
because<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:26.920> nailed<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.459> frame<00:03:27.670> together<00:03:27.850> I

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
because I nailed the frame together I

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.060 
because I nailed the frame together I
didn't<00:03:28.720> have<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:28.959> worry<00:03:29.200> about<00:03:29.350> holding<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:29.980> in

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
didn't have to worry about holding it in

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.400 
didn't have to worry about holding it in
place<00:03:30.370> while<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.730> drilled<00:03:31.150> holes<00:03:31.390> it's<00:03:32.170> pretty

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
place while I drilled holes it's pretty

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.710 
place while I drilled holes it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:32.800> at<00:03:33.489> this<00:03:33.640> point<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.209> just

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
self-explanatory at this point I just

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.630 
self-explanatory at this point I just
drilled<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.170> hole<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.709> then<00:03:35.920> use<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.340> screw

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
drilled a hole and then use a screw

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.670 
drilled a hole and then use a screw
driver<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:36.970> put<00:03:37.209> in<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.450> screws<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.080> I<00:03:38.500> did

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
driver to put in the screws and I did

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.680 
driver to put in the screws and I did
this<00:03:38.770> a<00:03:38.830> total<00:03:39.250> of<00:03:39.310> four<00:03:39.459> times<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.540> when<00:03:40.660> I

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
this a total of four times so when I

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.090 
this a total of four times so when I
drilled<00:03:41.050> I<00:03:41.230> had<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.500> make<00:03:41.650> sure<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.950> the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
drilled I had to make sure that the

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.670 
drilled I had to make sure that the
drill<00:03:42.310> was<00:03:42.430> perpendicular<00:03:42.760> to<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.209> frame

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
drill was perpendicular to the frame

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.870 
drill was perpendicular to the frame
otherwise<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:45.160> would<00:03:45.370> have<00:03:45.400> splintered<00:03:45.850> the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
otherwise it would have splintered the

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.699 
otherwise it would have splintered the
wood<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.360> come<00:03:47.110> out<00:03:47.260> from<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.530> other<00:03:47.560> side

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
wood and come out from the other side

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.070 
wood and come out from the other side
that's<00:03:48.520> because<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.880> frame<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.180> only<00:03:49.300> a<00:03:49.810> half

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
that's because the frame is only a half

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.570 
that's because the frame is only a half
an<00:03:50.230> inch<00:03:50.380> thick<00:03:50.440> so<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.950> didn't<00:03:51.250> have<00:03:51.370> much<00:03:51.550> room

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
an inch thick so I didn't have much room

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.630 
an inch thick so I didn't have much room
for<00:03:51.790> error<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.360> have<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.260> say<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:53.830> am<00:03:54.190> pretty<00:03:54.430> good

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
for error I have to say I am pretty good

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.280 
for error I have to say I am pretty good
at<00:03:54.700> drilling<00:03:54.970> though<00:03:55.540> my<00:03:55.780> hands<00:03:55.959> did<00:03:56.110> get

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
at drilling though my hands did get

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.780 
at drilling though my hands did get
pretty<00:03:56.560> tired<00:03:56.769> by<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.220> end<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.550> because

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
pretty tired by the end of it because

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.390 
pretty tired by the end of it because
the<00:03:58.120> troll<00:03:58.330> is<00:03:58.450> really<00:03:58.660> heavy<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.010> put<00:04:00.310> in

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
the troll is really heavy so I put in

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.009 
the troll is really heavy so I put in
the<00:04:00.489> screws<00:04:00.760> manually<00:04:01.269> but<00:04:01.480> that<00:04:01.660> wasn't<00:04:01.959> the

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
the screws manually but that wasn't the

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.979 
the screws manually but that wasn't the
only<00:04:02.320> option<00:04:02.769> if<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:03.760> had<00:04:04.030> wanted<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.600> I<00:04:04.810> could

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
only option if I had wanted to I could

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.180 
only option if I had wanted to I could
have<00:04:05.019> replaced<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.560> drill<00:04:05.769> bit<00:04:05.950> with<00:04:06.100> the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
have replaced the drill bit with the

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.740 
have replaced the drill bit with the
head<00:04:06.310> of<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.459> screwdriver<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.360> then<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.540> could

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
head of a screwdriver and then I could

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.090 
head of a screwdriver and then I could
have<00:04:07.840> used<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.140> drill<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.740> screw<00:04:08.920> in<00:04:09.010> the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
have used the drill to screw in the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.120 
have used the drill to screw in the
screws<00:04:09.370> but<00:04:10.270> I<00:04:10.480> mean<00:04:10.750> there<00:04:11.530> were<00:04:11.590> only<00:04:11.710> four

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
screws but I mean there were only four

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.950 
screws but I mean there were only four
so<00:04:12.610> it's

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
so it's

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.750 
so it's
not<00:04:13.320> really<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.710> big<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.040> deal<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.400> just<00:04:14.550> do

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
not really that big the deal to just do

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.040 
not really that big the deal to just do
it<00:04:14.880> manually<00:04:15.240> so<00:04:17.240> here's<00:04:18.240> the<00:04:18.390> frame<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.960> I

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
it manually so here's the frame and I

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.260 
it manually so here's the frame and I
put<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.320> four<00:04:19.500> shelves<00:04:19.830> in<00:04:19.950> place<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:20.910> this

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
put the four shelves in place so this

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.880 
put the four shelves in place so this
one<00:04:21.420> is<00:04:21.510> three<00:04:21.720> inches<00:04:22.020> because<00:04:22.290> some<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:22.710> my

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
one is three inches because some of my

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.220 
one is three inches because some of my
shot<00:04:23.130> glasses<00:04:23.340> are<00:04:23.640> shorter<00:04:23.940> than<00:04:24.090> others<00:04:24.420> so

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
shot glasses are shorter than others so

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.840 
shot glasses are shorter than others so
I<00:04:25.290> was<00:04:25.410> three<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.680> half<00:04:25.860> three<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:26.640> a<00:04:26.670> half

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
I was three and a half three and a half

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.540 
I was three and a half three and a half
three<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:27.570> a<00:04:27.600> half<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.050> three<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.560> half<00:04:28.710> so

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
three and a half and three and a half so

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.220 
three and a half and three and a half so
now<00:04:29.580> I'm<00:04:30.030> just<00:04:30.180> gonna<00:04:30.300> take<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.540> pencil<00:04:30.810> and

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
now I'm just gonna take a pencil and

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.170 
now I'm just gonna take a pencil and
Mark<00:04:31.440> three<00:04:31.770> inches<00:04:32.040> and<00:04:32.400> three<00:04:32.580> inches<00:04:32.610> here

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
Mark three inches and three inches here

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.690 
Mark three inches and three inches here
and<00:04:33.680> three<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.800> half<00:04:34.950> three<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.310> half<00:04:35.460> on

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
and three and a half three and a half on

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.330 
and three and a half three and a half on
both<00:04:36.420> sides<00:04:36.690> for<00:04:36.930> all<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.320> shelves<00:04:37.620> just<00:04:37.770> so

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
both sides for all the shelves just so

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:50.000 
both sides for all the shelves just so
that<00:04:38.520> they<00:04:38.760> can<00:04:38.820> be<00:04:39.030> perfectly<00:04:39.420> aligned<00:04:48.980> so<00:04:49.980> I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
that they can be perfectly aligned so I

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.890 
that they can be perfectly aligned so I
measured<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.550> sides<00:04:50.790> of<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.090> frame<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.600> made

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
measured the sides of the frame and made

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.630 
measured the sides of the frame and made
marks<00:04:52.200> with<00:04:52.380> pencil<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.890> indicate<00:04:53.250> where<00:04:53.490> the

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
marks with pencil to indicate where the

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.880 
marks with pencil to indicate where the
Shelf<00:04:53.850> should<00:04:54.030> be<00:04:54.150> on<00:04:54.360> both<00:04:54.510> sides<00:04:54.840> then<00:04:55.650> I

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
Shelf should be on both sides then I

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.590 
Shelf should be on both sides then I
just<00:04:56.070> used<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.430> hammer<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.940> put<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.240> nails<00:04:57.420> in

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
just used a hammer and put the nails in

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.080 
just used a hammer and put the nails in
I<00:04:57.840> did<00:04:58.380> have<00:04:58.560> a<00:04:58.590> few<00:04:58.830> problems<00:04:59.250> with<00:04:59.670> the<00:04:59.910> nails

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
I did have a few problems with the nails

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.970 
I did have a few problems with the nails
bending<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:00.720> going<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.140> on<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.290> slant<00:05:01.680> as

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
bending and going in on a slant as

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.530 
bending and going in on a slant as
opposed<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.430> going<00:05:02.580> in<00:05:02.730> perpendicular<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.330> the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
opposed to going in perpendicular to the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.840 
opposed to going in perpendicular to the
frame<00:05:03.810> when<00:05:04.590> that<00:05:04.740> happened<00:05:05.100> I<00:05:05.280> just<00:05:05.310> took<00:05:05.700> the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
frame when that happened I just took the

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.610 
frame when that happened I just took the
nail<00:05:06.000> out<00:05:06.210> using<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:06.930> other<00:05:07.020> side<00:05:07.290> of<00:05:07.380> hammer

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
nail out using the other side of hammer

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.580 
nail out using the other side of hammer
and<00:05:08.190> got<00:05:08.580> another<00:05:08.820> nail<00:05:09.060> then<00:05:09.870> I<00:05:10.110> put<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.440> new

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
and got another nail then I put the new

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.710 
and got another nail then I put the new
nail<00:05:10.800> in<00:05:11.070> a<00:05:11.370> few<00:05:11.580> millimeters<00:05:12.060> away<00:05:12.390> from<00:05:12.600> the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
nail in a few millimeters away from the

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.140 
nail in a few millimeters away from the
original<00:05:13.050> hole<00:05:13.200> each<00:05:14.130> of<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.490> shelves<00:05:14.940> has

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
original hole each of the shelves has

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.120 
original hole each of the shelves has
two<00:05:15.450> nails<00:05:15.660> on<00:05:15.840> one<00:05:15.990> side<00:05:16.200> and<00:05:16.440> two<00:05:16.710> nails<00:05:16.950> on

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
two nails on one side and two nails on

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.460 
two nails on one side and two nails on
the<00:05:17.220> other<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:18.090> makes<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.420> total<00:05:18.570> of<00:05:18.840> 16<00:05:19.260> nails

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
the other that makes a total of 16 nails

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.190 
the other that makes a total of 16 nails
for<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.800> four<00:05:20.040> shelves<00:05:20.280> so<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.660> thickness<00:05:22.050> of

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
for the four shelves so the thickness of

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.140 
for the four shelves so the thickness of
the<00:05:22.320> nails<00:05:22.500> was<00:05:23.010> a<00:05:23.040> big<00:05:23.280> part<00:05:23.490> of<00:05:23.550> this<00:05:23.700> I<00:05:23.940> had

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
the nails was a big part of this I had

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.340 
the nails was a big part of this I had
to<00:05:24.240> make<00:05:24.390> sure<00:05:24.540> they<00:05:24.690> weren't<00:05:24.840> too<00:05:25.080> thick

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
to make sure they weren't too thick

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.320 
to make sure they weren't too thick
otherwise<00:05:25.980> they<00:05:26.550> would<00:05:26.670> splinter<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.180> wood

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
otherwise they would splinter the wood

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.360 
otherwise they would splinter the wood
and<00:05:27.690> that's<00:05:28.080> because<00:05:28.500> each<00:05:28.770> shelf<00:05:29.160> is

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
and that's because each shelf is

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.520 
and that's because each shelf is
three-eighths<00:05:29.790> of<00:05:29.940> an<00:05:30.060> inch<00:05:30.120> thick<00:05:30.480> I<00:05:30.750> also

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
three-eighths of an inch thick I also

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.500 
three-eighths of an inch thick I also
said<00:05:31.830> one<00:05:32.010> thing<00:05:32.040> else<00:05:32.340> be<00:05:32.520> too<00:05:32.730> long<00:05:33.030> because

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
said one thing else be too long because

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.320 
said one thing else be too long because
this<00:05:33.960> could<00:05:34.140> also<00:05:34.290> cause<00:05:34.620> splintering<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.330> if

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
this could also cause splintering and if

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.970 
this could also cause splintering and if
I<00:05:36.480> wasn't<00:05:36.810> able<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:37.050> skillfully<00:05:37.440> hammer<00:05:37.770> the

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
I wasn't able to skillfully hammer the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.780 
I wasn't able to skillfully hammer the
nail<00:05:38.130> in<00:05:38.370> an<00:05:39.120> angle<00:05:39.480> of<00:05:39.630> exactly<00:05:40.350> 90<00:05:40.620> degrees

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
nail in an angle of exactly 90 degrees

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.220 
nail in an angle of exactly 90 degrees
it<00:05:41.790> would<00:05:42.000> have<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:42.270> more<00:05:42.510> obvious<00:05:42.870> effect<00:05:43.110> on

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
it would have a more obvious effect on

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.720 
it would have a more obvious effect on
the<00:05:43.320> shelf<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:43.800> then<00:05:44.010> I<00:05:44.070> would<00:05:44.280> definitely

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
the shelf and then I would definitely

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.270 
the shelf and then I would definitely
stick<00:05:45.000> out<00:05:45.150> so<00:05:45.390> by<00:05:46.290> using<00:05:46.470> a<00:05:46.650> nail<00:05:46.830> that's<00:05:47.010> one

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
stick out so by using a nail that's one

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.730 
stick out so by using a nail that's one
inch<00:05:47.460> long<00:05:47.730> even<00:05:48.390> if<00:05:48.510> I<00:05:48.660> was<00:05:48.900> a<00:05:48.930> little<00:05:49.110> off<00:05:49.380> it

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
inch long even if I was a little off it

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.040 
inch long even if I was a little off it
didn't<00:05:50.190> matter<00:05:50.340> because<00:05:50.510> the<00:05:51.510> nail<00:05:51.720> wasn't

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
didn't matter because the nail wasn't

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.720 
didn't matter because the nail wasn't
long<00:05:52.170> enough<00:05:52.440> and<00:05:52.710> my<00:05:53.010> angle<00:05:53.370> wasn't<00:05:53.520> bad

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
long enough and my angle wasn't bad

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.490 
long enough and my angle wasn't bad
enough<00:05:53.760> to<00:05:54.510> make<00:05:54.630> me<00:05:54.750> I'll<00:05:54.930> go<00:05:55.110> through<00:05:55.380> the

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
enough to make me I'll go through the

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
enough to make me I'll go through the
shelf<00:05:57.230> it<00:05:58.230> also<00:05:58.410> looks<00:05:58.710> like<00:05:58.800> I'm<00:05:59.160> trying<00:05:59.340> to

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
shelf it also looks like I'm trying to

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.340 
shelf it also looks like I'm trying to
kiss<00:05:59.730> the<00:05:59.910> wood<00:06:00.440> I'm<00:06:01.440> not<00:06:02.210> okay<00:06:03.210> so<00:06:03.690> I'm

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
kiss the wood I'm not okay so I'm

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.200 
kiss the wood I'm not okay so I'm
finally<00:06:04.650> done<00:06:05.040> and<00:06:05.220> now<00:06:05.580> my<00:06:05.760> shot<00:06:05.970> glasses
