00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.040
 hi how about youtube friends i am 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.740
 Alan or as you know me from 129 or in this 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.200
 case my name in good bell 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.019
 because that's what they call me xbox live good 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.539
 now I will continue with the video this 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.820
 video is called how to share the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.380
 internet of your computer in this case 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.380
 it's a laptop 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:34.000
 an xbox 360 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:38.250
 which is very easy for example this to me 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.250
 it happens to me that the model is very far from 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.579
 of my room then the computer 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.620
 it has a much better signal than the xbox 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:52.890
 then through this I could 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.860
 through this I could say that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.339
 half of an ethernet cable pass it the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.379
 internet to xbox 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:05.360
 through my computer now what 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.360
 next thing we're going to do is going to be 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.520
 ok permanent a small interruption 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.130
 good now 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.620
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.460
 here on the internet icon we are going to 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.110
 right click 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.110
 open the networking center 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.880
 here they will lead us to change the 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.880
 adapter configuration 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.060
 as they see me here I already have the 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.110
 the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:43.210
 as it is told 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:46.330
 the bridge the bridge that is for 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.170
 to spend driving the internet to 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.930
 xbox 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.880
 ok but in this case it would not be this would be 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.600
 This will eliminate ok good for 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.600
 see how it is done 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.539
 as you can see it is expected while 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.810
 will remove them 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:11.420
 well here we are going to do is going to be 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:15.069
 here we hope little is reconnecting 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.069
 internet what is it supposed to be 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.680
 when you click right properties 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.859
 shared use you are going to leave 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.370
 just like I have it like that so like that 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:34.069
 well ok they will not move anything else we give 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.129
 in accept 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.010
 from here we are going to select these two 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.230
 whether or not there is more ethernet and wi-fi in my 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.739
 case this is going to be the only thing that we are going to 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.940
 select ok right click connections 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.760
 of bridges we are going to click 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.130
 windows is establishing bridges for 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.860
 the connections here we're going to wait is 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.580
 a process a little bit slow not much 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.530
 but if it takes very little 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.220
 we are waiting, waiting, waiting 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.220
 waiting 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.490
 it takes longer than I expect 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.490
 good 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.250
 journal bridge 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.980
 and a lot 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.980
 here appeared network drive 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.630
 ah 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.830
 okay 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.110
 now and we are connected and there is the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.630
 bridge 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.660
 this is the signal that pulls our 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.180
 computer the wifi and this signal the 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.030
 computer sends it directly to 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.960
 our xbox or can be cpu auto that does not 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.180
 have wifi 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.280
 Well the joke is that here we can 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.470
 connect an ethernet cable and connect 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.800
 any device that has a cable 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.760
 or rather an ethernet port to which 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.760
 can connect ok 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.939
 well this was all a videotutorial 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.480
 very fast but this will be very useful and 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.480
 good help 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.050
 I'm going to connect my xbox this is 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.620
 connected to my xbox 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.139
 then you no longer study is to extract it when 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.639
 what you understand here is going to look like 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.400
 if they were connected by means of 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.620
 internet but it will not be like that ok and good 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.800
 this was the video tutorial of the day of 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.080
 I hope you like it, like it and 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.199
 your clients later I am going to 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.300
 bring the tutorial on how to pass the 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.240
 equally by your average 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.270
 computer but to a pink cellphone by 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:58.580
 via wifi that the same weisz jon modem in 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:00.379
 the same card and wireless good I hope 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:06.129
