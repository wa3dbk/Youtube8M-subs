00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.810
 then it was definitely a 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.000
 where the team has held up well the field is 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.400
 gone ahead has created a couple of 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.619
 quotes to double 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.220
 we risked the right and then instead 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.640
 in the second half 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.660
 of course the general condition of 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.760
 the ones I naturally wanted to do 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 play for ninety minutes came a 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.050
 little to miss 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.960
 naturally the amburgo is already at the first one 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.910
 championship day so different 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.500
 condition phase showed up 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.380
 considerably they then changed 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.910
 five six important men 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.850
 so naturally we did some 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.470
 but the last one is more difficult for me today 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.630
 aspect was just me result 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.730
 interested in making others play 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.500
 put repeat playing time in the legs 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.680
 so I removed the ones I did 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.960
 eventually they fell to the ground for the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.700
 cramps therefore just because they are 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.130
 players who need to play and 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.130
 so today however I am satisfied 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.500
 because I had excellent directions 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.869
 so I put a playmaker stretcher 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.500
 also because I like to try sometimes 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.930
 different solutions because you never know e 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.400
 farÃ­as giannetti in front therefore I am 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.729
 solutions during the championship 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.590
 they could appear because maybe a 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.050
 injury of disqualified moments 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.090
 contingents of a race or a moment 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.440
 so these are things that I like to try 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.290
 we have players who have 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.660
 features could adapt roles 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.290
 different and today comes the first time me 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.470
 loved it 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.910
 I knew we would have struggled the long 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.690
 against a team I repeat not only of 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.660
 higher category but who has 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.320
 now it's ready for the championship rhythm 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.200
 we the ones who played the least 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.540
 up to almost all the 90 minutes not 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.880
 they never did and therefore it is normal that 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.680
 in the long run this you go to pay though 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.060
 I repeat, I am generally satisfied with the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.870
 result did not interest me today 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.870
 absolutely
