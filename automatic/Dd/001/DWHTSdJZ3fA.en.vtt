it will make a fool out of Babel want to

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.950 
it will make a fool out of Babel want to
start<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:24.180> would<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.330> about<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.750> fourth

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
start but this would be about the fourth

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.660 
start but this would be about the fourth
time<00:00:25.050> I've<00:00:25.410> ever<00:00:25.439> started<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.189> usually<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
time I've ever started it usually the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:38.690 
time I've ever started it usually the
strap<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.630> we'll<00:00:27.840> see

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.660 

when<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.330> strap<00:00:39.780> around<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.200> flywheel<00:00:40.740> whoops

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
when a strap around the flywheel whoops

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.450 
when a strap around the flywheel whoops
the<00:00:42.240> wrong<00:00:42.420> direction<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.130> get<00:00:44.280> into

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the wrong direction and got to get into

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.670 
the wrong direction and got to get into
the<00:00:44.520> right<00:00:44.730> direction<00:00:45.680> pulls<00:00:46.680> off<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.950> top

the right direction pulls off the top

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.250 
the right direction pulls off the top
spin<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> backwards<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> won't<00:00:50.610> run<00:00:50.850> very<00:00:51.150> well

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
spin it backwards it won't run very well

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.190 
spin it backwards it won't run very well
it's<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.440> bad<00:00:52.680> direction<00:00:55.700> okay<00:00:56.700> now<00:00:57.510> cram<00:00:58.170> it

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
it's not bad direction okay now cram it

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.680 
it's not bad direction okay now cram it
up<00:00:58.380> give<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.680> 10<00:00:58.920> shots<00:00:59.220> of<00:00:59.400> fuel<00:01:02.420> turn<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.540> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
up give it 10 shots of fuel turn on the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:31.630 
up give it 10 shots of fuel turn on the
ignition<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.460> whip<00:01:05.460> fly

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640

if you'll notice the light on the white
box<00:01:35.479> that's<00:01:35.870> my<00:01:36.050> ignition<00:01:36.290> module<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:38.390> spark

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
box that's my ignition module the spark

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.080 
box that's my ignition module the spark
saver<00:01:38.990> has<00:01:39.140> hooked<00:01:39.409> up<00:01:39.590> it's<00:01:40.580> just<00:01:40.820> about

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
saver has hooked up it's just about

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:49.980 
saver has hooked up it's just about
trying<00:01:41.979> every<00:01:42.979> time<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.670> gets<00:01:43.880> ignition

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.420 

you'll<00:01:50.990> have<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.200> slight<00:01:51.560> issue<00:01:51.800> with<00:01:51.979> the

you'll have a slight issue with the

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.280 
you'll have a slight issue with the
injector<00:01:54.040> Popoff<00:01:55.040> valve<00:01:55.930> I'm<00:01:56.930> hoping<00:01:57.229> that

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
injector Popoff valve I'm hoping that

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.369 
injector Popoff valve I'm hoping that
that<00:01:57.979> will<00:01:58.009> age<00:01:58.340> well
