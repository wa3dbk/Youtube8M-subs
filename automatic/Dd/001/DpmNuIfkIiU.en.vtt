00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.490
 after you have registered a new one 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.380
 free domain you can proceed to 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.770
 connecting between 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.320
 computers in principle it seems that 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.000
 just enter the name of the created host and 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.570
 everything will work like a clock 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.869
 but this is far from us 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.400
 configure windows firewall and firewall 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.470
 and diesel modem 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.730
 you can simply solve the problem 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.730
 disabling them 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.770
 do not strongly recommended to 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.400
 due to the emergence of a real threat 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.850
 security for your computer 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.620
 in this regard, in this lesson we consider 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.230
 how can you change the settings 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.770
 windows firewall without threatening 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.829
 computer security and so for a start 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:59.460
 we need to open the firewall itself 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.820
 in the start menu, select the control panel in 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.940
 her 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.390
 select system and security 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.390
 and then click on firewall 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.240
 windows 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.540
 on windows firewall there 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.990
 item advanced options select 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.079
 him 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.900
 now you need to open the rule item 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.360
 for incoming connections 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.270
 here we just need to find among 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.710
 other connections connected 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.119
 with radmin 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.590
 in this case we see two rules 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.580
 meeting our requirements and 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.590
 conditions 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.460
 click on one of them first 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.280
 then go to the advanced tab 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.360
 By default, only the checkbox is checked. 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.530
 last profile to us for permission 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.250
 connect to radmin from different 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.400
 of sources 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.810
 need to tick all profiles 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.450
 after that click ok now you can 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.360
 to conclude that the windows firewall we 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.110
 set up in the following lessons 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.819
 consider in detail the configuration of the firewall 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.020
 directly to the modem itself by example 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.650
 modem company 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.650
 zyxel
