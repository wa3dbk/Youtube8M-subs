just be basically the exact same on the
other<00:01:35.790> side<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:37.070> it's<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.430> ticket

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
other side is that it's a little ticket

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.510 
other side is that it's a little ticket
booth<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:40.590> look<00:01:40.740> exactly<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.220> this

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
booth and it look exactly like this

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.929 
booth and it look exactly like this
there's<00:01:41.759> mirrored<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.750> both<00:01:43.020> sides<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.939> it's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
there's mirrored on both sides and it's

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.880 
there's mirrored on both sides and it's
just<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.540> lego<00:01:45.840> field<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.560> there's<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890

figure out the actual building up of the
stadium<00:05:40.529> wasn't<00:05:41.460> that<00:05:41.580> hard<00:05:41.879> it<00:05:42.210> was<00:05:42.719> just<00:05:42.779> a

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
stadium wasn't that hard it was just a

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.230 
stadium wasn't that hard it was just a
lot<00:05:43.259> of<00:05:43.339> you<00:05:44.339> have<00:05:44.490> a<00:05:44.520> lot<00:05:44.789> of<00:05:44.819> empty<00:05:45.149> space

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.700 
lot of you have a lot of empty space
under<00:05:45.719> there<00:05:45.899> because<00:05:46.110> you<00:05:46.289> don't<00:05:46.409> want<00:05:46.619> to

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
under there because you don't want to

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.439 
under there because you don't want to
fill<00:05:46.889> me<00:05:47.039> it's<00:05:47.159> our<00:05:47.279> areas<00:05:47.729> brick<00:05:47.999> that<00:05:48.270> would

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
fill me it's our areas brick that would

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.889 
fill me it's our areas brick that would
just<00:05:48.599> use<00:05:48.749> too<00:05:48.990> many<00:05:49.139> pieces<00:05:50.449> but<00:05:51.449> the<00:05:51.599> field

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:51.899 
just use too many pieces but the field

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:53.420 
just use too many pieces but the field
is<00:05:52.110> really<00:05:52.349> the<00:05:52.439> hardest<00:05:52.710> part<00:05:52.830> because<00:05:53.339> you

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
is really the hardest part because you

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.249 
is really the hardest part because you
have<00:05:53.610> all<00:05:53.879> these<00:05:54.089> angles<00:05:54.599> here<00:05:54.779> that<00:05:54.990> you<00:05:55.080> have

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
have all these angles here that you have

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.290 
have all these angles here that you have
to<00:05:55.289> work<00:05:55.589> around<00:05:55.770> and<00:05:56.249> since<00:05:56.430> you<00:05:56.759> know<00:05:56.909> bricks

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
to work around and since you know bricks

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.469 
to work around and since you know bricks
do<00:05:57.539> not<00:05:57.719> go<00:05:57.960> well<00:05:58.199> at<00:05:58.379> angles<00:05:58.999> he<00:05:59.999> has<00:06:00.149> to<00:06:00.300> find

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
do not go well at angles he has to find

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.320 
do not go well at angles he has to find
ways<00:06:00.599> to<00:06:00.749> work<00:06:01.080> it<00:06:01.199> out<00:06:01.289> and<00:06:01.879> we<00:06:02.879> kind<00:06:03.120> of<00:06:03.210> just

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330
