00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
how the outside case so let's see what

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.060 
how the outside case so let's see what
it<00:03:08.200> looks<00:03:08.380> like<00:03:09.120> that's<00:03:10.120> what<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.420> looks<00:03:10.690> like

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
it looks like that's what it looks like

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.670 
it looks like that's what it looks like
she'll<00:03:12.070> just<00:03:12.540> turn<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.600> on<00:03:14.280> turn<00:03:15.280> off<00:03:15.400> my

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
she'll just turn that on turn off my

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.340 
she'll just turn that on turn off my
shame

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
shame

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.510 
shame
and<00:03:19.890> then<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.310> have<00:03:20.400> your<00:03:20.510> fuel<00:03:21.510> gauge<00:03:22.520> their

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
and then you have your fuel gauge their

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.940 
and then you have your fuel gauge their
you<00:03:23.640> get<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.030> can't<00:03:24.270> see<00:03:24.450> but<00:03:24.480> see<00:03:25.380> your

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
you get you can't see but see your

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.580 
you get you can't see but see your
speedometer<00:03:26.310> ill<00:03:26.700> will<00:03:27.030> only<00:03:27.300> go<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.690> 62<00:03:28.140> if

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
speedometer ill will only go up to 62 if

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.220 
speedometer ill will only go up to 62 if
it<00:03:29.490> goes<00:03:29.580> farther<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.270> can't<00:03:30.630> go<00:03:30.720> farther<00:03:31.020> than

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
it goes farther it can't go farther than

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.860 
it goes farther it can't go farther than
that<00:03:31.350> because<00:03:31.680> placed<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.730> little<00:03:32.850> sensor<00:03:33.780> in

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
that because placed a little sensor in

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.940 
that because placed a little sensor in
it<00:03:33.990> that<00:03:34.170> will<00:03:34.260> stop<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.710> see<00:03:35.700> just<00:03:36.440> as<00:03:37.440> far<00:03:37.860> as

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
it that will stop it see just as far as

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.500 
it that will stop it see just as far as
there<00:03:38.070> we<00:03:38.130> go<00:03:38.280> if<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.550> go<00:03:38.730> any<00:03:38.910> farther<00:03:39.120> than

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
there we go if I go any farther than

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.710 
there we go if I go any farther than
that<00:03:39.740> it<00:03:40.740> will<00:03:40.950> break<00:03:41.160> oh<00:03:41.910> i<00:03:42.270> just<00:03:42.360> broke

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
that it will break oh i just broke

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:53.390 
that it will break oh i just broke
it<00:03:42.900> up<00:03:46.100> well<00:03:47.100> that's<00:03:47.220> not<00:03:47.400> good<00:03:51.530> open<00:03:52.530> up<00:03:52.620> i<00:03:52.860> fix

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
it up well that's not good open up i fix

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.470 
it up well that's not good open up i fix
let's<00:03:53.910> bring<00:03:54.360> down<00:03:54.600> six<00:03:54.900> all<00:03:55.560> right<00:03:59.450> all<00:04:00.450> right

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
let's bring down six all right all right

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.190 
let's bring down six all right all right
there<00:04:00.750> we<00:04:00.840> go<00:04:00.930> it's<00:04:01.050> fixed<00:04:02.390> see<00:04:03.390> that's<00:04:03.990> why

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
there we go it's fixed see that's why

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.270 
there we go it's fixed see that's why
you<00:04:04.260> never<00:04:04.530> go<00:04:04.830> past<00:04:05.100> at<00:04:05.790> 60<00:04:06.390> mark<00:04:06.920> so<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:07.980> can

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
you never go past at 60 mark so you can

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.270 
you never go past at 60 mark so you can
be<00:04:08.400> hidden<00:04:08.600> 200<00:04:09.600> miles<00:04:09.780> per<00:04:09.900> hour<00:04:10.110> if<00:04:10.710> anybody

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
be hidden 200 miles per hour if anybody

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.670 
be hidden 200 miles per hour if anybody
cares<00:04:11.550> well<00:04:12.360> yeah<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:13.020> would<00:04:13.320> probably<00:04:13.500> be

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
don't want to break this that would suck

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.360 
don't want to break this that would suck
but<00:04:36.870> well<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.440> speedometer<00:04:37.950> doesn't<00:04:37.980> mean

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
but well the speedometer doesn't mean

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.110 
but well the speedometer doesn't mean
breathe<00:04:38.610> anyway<00:04:39.060> so<00:04:39.740> all<00:04:40.740> right<00:04:40.920> and<00:04:41.120> that's

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
breathe anyway so all right and that's

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.180 
breathe anyway so all right and that's
what<00:04:42.360> how<00:04:42.840> you<00:04:42.900> take<00:04:43.170> apart<00:04:43.470> will<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.890> front

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
what how you take apart will the front

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.030 
what how you take apart will the front
of<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.550> that<00:04:45.450> and<00:04:45.720> that's<00:04:46.230> why<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.500> never<00:04:46.800> go

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
of it that and that's why you never go

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.730 
of it that and that's why you never go
past<00:04:47.220> 60<00:04:47.870> that's<00:04:48.870> why<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.110> can<00:04:49.260> never<00:04:49.350> go<00:04:49.470> past

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
past 60 that's why you can never go past

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.460 
past 60 that's why you can never go past
60<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.310> 64<00:04:50.880> miles<00:04:51.090> per<00:04:51.300> hour<00:04:51.390> on<00:04:51.660> these<00:04:51.840> because

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
60 to 64 miles per hour on these because

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.350 
60 to 64 miles per hour on these because
of<00:04:52.680> gauge<00:04:52.830> bowling<00:04:53.190> read<00:04:53.370> up<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.640> 60<00:04:54.030> miles<00:04:54.240> per

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
of gauge bowling read up to 60 miles per

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.520 
of gauge bowling read up to 60 miles per
hour<00:04:54.540> and<00:04:55.550> this<00:04:56.550> is<00:04:56.700> part<00:04:56.940> one<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.570> this<00:04:58.230> and

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
hour and this is part one of this and

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.890 
hour and this is part one of this and
then<00:04:58.650> ow<00:04:59.120> well<00:05:00.120> if<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:00.810> take<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.410> apart

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
then ow well if I take that apart

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.430 
then ow well if I take that apart
probably<00:05:03.900> end<00:05:04.050> up<00:05:04.740> it<00:05:04.950> up<00:05:06.290> excuse<00:05:07.290> my

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
probably end up it up excuse my

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.160 
probably end up it up excuse my
language<00:05:07.770> but<00:05:08.960> i<00:05:09.960> guess<00:05:10.530> i<00:05:11.540> guess<00:05:12.540> i<00:05:12.840> could<00:05:12.900> do

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
language but i guess i guess i could do

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.310 
language but i guess i guess i could do
it<00:05:13.610> whereas<00:05:14.610> i<00:05:14.790> I've<00:05:15.060> nothing<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.570> live<00:05:15.900> like
