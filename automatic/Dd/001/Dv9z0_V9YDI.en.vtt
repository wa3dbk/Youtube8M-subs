young-ran<00:00:11.040> shuffle<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> great<00:00:11.820> move<00:00:12.000> just

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
young-ran shuffle is a great move just

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.980 
young-ran shuffle is a great move just
looks<00:00:12.870> like<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.280> pretty<00:00:14.280> basic<00:00:14.490> move<00:00:14.990> it's

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
looks like this pretty basic move it's

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.970 
looks like this pretty basic move it's
actually<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.320> first<00:00:16.440> shuffle<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.859> ever

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
actually the first shuffle I ever

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.470 
actually the first shuffle I ever
learned<00:00:17.220> when<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.490> was<00:00:17.640> like<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:18.240> young

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
learned when I was like a really young

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.609 
learned when I was like a really young
kid<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:20.750> there's<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.810> lot<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.109> controls<00:00:22.529> and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
kid and there's a lot of controls and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.050 
kid and there's a lot of controls and
stuff<00:00:22.800> card<00:00:23.160> control<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:23.880> it's

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
stuff card control you can do with it's

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.939 
stuff card control you can do with it's
very<00:00:24.119> deceptive<00:00:24.570> what<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.439> about<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
very deceptive what I like about it's a

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.330 
very deceptive what I like about it's a
shuffle<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.310> everybody's<00:00:26.760> familiar<00:00:26.910> with

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
shuffle that everybody's familiar with

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.500 
shuffle that everybody's familiar with
even<00:00:29.340> people<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.789> aren't<00:00:29.939> magicians<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
even people that aren't magicians and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.430 
even people that aren't magicians and
stuff<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.869> kind<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.109> shuffle<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:32.030> so

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
gonna essentially do is feed off packets

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.569 
gonna essentially do is feed off packets
into<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.690> right<00:01:00.809> hand<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.579> just

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
dropping packets on the top you can use

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.100 
dropping packets on the top you can use
your<00:01:04.530> thumb<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.420> pull<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
your thumb like this to just pull the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.620 
your thumb like this to just pull the
packets<00:01:07.470> off<00:01:09.140> make<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.439> easier

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
packets off make it a little easier

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.539 
packets off make it a little easier
you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.810> even<00:01:12.930> put<00:01:13.200> your<00:01:13.229> finger<00:01:13.619> underneath

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549

if you like I'm everybody's got a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.679 
if you like I'm everybody's got a
different<00:01:16.860> way<00:01:17.070> they<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.909> I

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
different way they like to do it like I

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.170 
different way they like to do it like I
said<00:01:18.799> you<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.009> kind<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.250> strip<00:01:20.700> cards<00:01:21.060> off

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180

said you just kind of strip cards off
the<00:01:21.330> top<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:23.280> allows<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> do

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the top like this that allows you to do

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.289 
the top like this that allows you to do
a<00:01:23.850> lot<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.090> different<00:01:24.270> things<00:01:24.600> okay<00:01:26.150> just<00:01:27.150> like

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
a lot of different things okay just like

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.550 
a lot of different things okay just like
so<00:01:29.450> as<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.750> explained<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.229> riffle<00:01:31.530> shuffle

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
so as I explained in the riffle shuffle

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.679 
so as I explained in the riffle shuffle
you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.340> control<00:01:32.700> cards<00:01:33.000> pretty<00:01:33.210> easily<00:01:33.420> with

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
you can control cards pretty easily with

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
you can control cards pretty easily with
this<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> my<00:01:34.950> favorites<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.460> I've<00:01:35.549> been

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
this one of my favorites that I've been

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.100 
this one of my favorites that I've been
doing<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> long<00:01:36.119> time<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.540> very<00:01:36.720> simple

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
doing for a long time it's very simple

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.609 
doing for a long time it's very simple
but<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.829> confuses<00:01:38.280> people<00:01:38.400> very<00:01:39.360> easily<00:01:39.619> let's

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
but it confuses people very easily let's

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.569 
but it confuses people very easily let's
say<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.799> want<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.009> control<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> five

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
say we want to control the five

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.700 
say we want to control the five
indictments<00:01:41.899> we<00:01:42.899> happen<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> top<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
indictments we happen on the top of the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.010 
indictments we happen on the top of the
deck<00:01:44.000> what<00:01:45.000> you're<00:01:45.149> going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.329> want<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.659> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
deck what you're going to want to do is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.710 
deck what you're going to want to do is
use<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:46.799> thumb<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:47.850> strip<00:01:48.360> off<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
use your thumb and just strip off the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.630 
use your thumb and just strip off the
five<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.079> diamonds<00:01:49.369> obviously<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.460> would<00:01:50.610> be

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
five of diamonds obviously this would be

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030 
five of diamonds obviously this would be
facedown<00:01:51.090> into<00:01:51.270> performance<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.920> rip

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
facedown into performance you just rip

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.950 
facedown into performance you just rip
it<00:01:53.130> off<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.390> continue<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it off and then you just continue to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.709 
it off and then you just continue to
shuffle<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.320> top<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.399> now<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.579> know<00:01:56.939> that

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
shuffle on top of it so now we know that

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.830 
shuffle on top of it so now we know that
the<00:01:57.810> five<00:01:58.020> indictments<00:01:58.460> is<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.670> bottom<00:01:59.939> if

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the five indictments is on the bottom if

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.270 
the five indictments is on the bottom if
you<00:02:01.020> want<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.259> bring<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.469> back<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> top

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
you want to bring it back to the top

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.280 
you want to bring it back to the top
you<00:02:02.820> start<00:02:03.090> stripping<00:02:03.420> cards<00:02:03.659> off<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.110> as

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
you start stripping cards off and as

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.530 
you start stripping cards off and as
you're<00:02:04.439> getting<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> end<00:02:05.540> start

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
you're getting you the end start

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.510 
you're getting you the end start
stripping<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:06.960> off<00:02:07.079> singly

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
stripping them off singly

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.860 
stripping them off singly
until<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.060> come<00:02:09.240> to<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.420> five<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.630> diamonds

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:09.870 
until you come to that five of diamonds

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.230 
until you come to that five of diamonds
and<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.200> comes<00:02:10.350> right<00:02:10.530> back<00:02:10.680> to<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.890> top<00:02:11.240> so

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
and it comes right back to the top so

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.870 
and it comes right back to the top so
once<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.600> get<00:02:12.780> good<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> means<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.610> just

once you get good and the means of just

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.530 
once you get good and the means of just

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
shuffling you can keep bringing the five

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.750 
shuffling you can keep bringing the five
to<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.900> top<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.950> bottom<00:02:19.980> without<00:02:20.400> anybody

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760

to the top to the bottom without anybody
knowing<00:02:20.940> any<00:02:21.420> better<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:23.670> pretty<00:02:23.940> cool
