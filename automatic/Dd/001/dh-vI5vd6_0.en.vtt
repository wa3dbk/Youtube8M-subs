after<00:03:26.130> you've<00:03:26.280> done<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:27.120> go<00:03:27.319> barring

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
after you've done that you go barring

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.949 
after you've done that you go barring
move<00:03:29.010> your<00:03:29.220> bar<00:03:29.520> and<00:03:29.849> your<00:03:30.270> ring<00:03:30.450> finger<00:03:30.660> and

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
move your bar and your ring finger and

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.300 
move your bar and your ring finger and
maybe<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.200> bar<00:03:31.349> all<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.590> way<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.010> second

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
maybe a bar all the way to the second

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.240 
maybe a bar all the way to the second
fifth<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.989> play<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.349> same<00:03:34.560> pattern<00:03:35.130> with

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
fifth and you play the same pattern with

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.089 
fifth and you play the same pattern with
the<00:03:35.280> right<00:03:35.459> hand<00:03:35.670> which<00:03:35.819> is<00:03:35.849> six<00:03:36.300> string<00:03:37.099> third

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
the right hand which is six string third

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:44.660 
the right hand which is six string third
string<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.640> second

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.960 

and<00:03:45.030> then<00:03:45.300> you<00:03:45.420> go<00:03:47.270> we<00:03:48.270> play<00:03:49.099> sixth<00:03:50.099> both

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
and then you go we play sixth both

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.479 
and then you go we play sixth both
together<00:03:51.239> with<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.810> index<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.440> middle<00:03:52.800> we

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
together with the index in the middle we

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.340 
together with the index in the middle we
play<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.910> third<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.540> second

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.320 

now<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.970> quickly<00:04:00.970> moved<00:04:01.510> my<00:04:02.500> bar<00:04:03.280> away<00:04:03.580> and<00:04:03.880> i

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
now I quickly moved my bar away and i

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.660 
now I quickly moved my bar away and i
put<00:04:04.540> my<00:04:04.720> index<00:04:05.230> on<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.710> second<00:04:06.130> fret<00:04:06.250> on<00:04:06.580> the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
put my index on the second fret on the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.050 
put my index on the second fret on the
third<00:04:07.060> string<00:04:07.480> my<00:04:08.140> middle<00:04:08.590> finger<00:04:09.010> on<00:04:09.250> the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
third string my middle finger on the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.320 
third string my middle finger on the
second<00:04:10.540> string<00:04:10.980> second<00:04:11.980> fret<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.520> i<00:04:13.120> played

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
second string second fret and i played

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.510 
second string second fret and i played
the<00:04:13.450> same<00:04:13.600> pattern<00:04:13.990> as<00:04:14.080> before<00:04:14.140> which<00:04:14.710> we<00:04:14.860> omit

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
the same pattern as before which we omit

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.920 
the same pattern as before which we omit
the<00:04:15.640> two<00:04:15.880> strings<00:04:16.360> together<00:04:16.920> but<00:04:17.920> now<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.280> see

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
the two strings together but now you see

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.560 
the two strings together but now you see
when<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:20.110> smokin<00:04:20.620> base<00:04:20.800> so<00:04:21.100> you<00:04:21.640> should<00:04:21.880> be

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.290 

after<00:04:27.260> I<00:04:27.320> do<00:04:27.440> that<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:28.010> remove<00:04:28.760> my<00:04:28.790> middle

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
after I do that I remove my middle

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.930 
after I do that I remove my middle
finger<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:30.200> put<00:04:30.470> my<00:04:30.680> ring<00:04:30.890> finger<00:04:31.160> on<00:04:31.550> the

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
finger and I put my ring finger on the

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.260 
finger and I put my ring finger on the
third<00:04:32.180> fret<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.870> second<00:04:33.440> string

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.760 

so<00:04:37.270> once<00:04:37.540> again<00:04:37.690> slowly<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.230> nice<00:04:38.440> a<00:04:38.470> little<00:04:38.680> bit

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
so once again slowly a nice a little bit

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.770 
so once again slowly a nice a little bit
confusing<00:04:39.190> i'll<00:04:39.460> try<00:04:39.670> to<00:04:39.730> do<00:04:39.940> as<00:04:40.060> slow<00:04:40.540> as<00:04:40.570> i

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
confusing i'll try to do as slow as i

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.030 
confusing i'll try to do as slow as i
can

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.250 

and<00:04:48.430> then<00:04:48.610> I<00:04:48.640> put<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.180> stretch<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:49.930> a<00:04:49.960> little<00:04:50.170> bit

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
and then I put a stretch is a little bit

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.170 
and then I put a stretch is a little bit
of<00:04:50.320> a<00:04:50.380> stretch<00:04:50.620> but<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:50.920> can<00:04:51.070> do<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.460> put<00:04:52.060> my

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
of a stretch but you can do it I put my

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.830 
of a stretch but you can do it I put my
thumb<00:04:52.510> on<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:53.530> E<00:04:53.920> string<00:04:54.760> again<00:04:54.940> on<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.480> sixth

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
thumb on the E string again on the sixth

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:07.020 
thumb on the E string again on the sixth
string<00:04:55.900> of<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.560> base<00:04:56.770> on<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.580> second<00:04:57.970> fret

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.690 

then<00:05:08.030> I<00:05:08.060> played<00:05:08.450> open<00:05:08.980> same<00:05:09.980> pad<00:05:10.220> time<00:05:10.430> so<00:05:10.640> you

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
then I played open same pad time so you

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.970 
then I played open same pad time so you
can<00:05:10.790> follow<00:05:11.150> then<00:05:11.810> I<00:05:11.990> stretch<00:05:12.410> my<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:14.980> index

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
can follow then I stretch my I index

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.770 
can follow then I stretch my I index
finger<00:05:16.310> to<00:05:16.460> go<00:05:16.580> all<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:17.090> way<00:05:17.120> up<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.480> the<00:05:17.510> first

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
finger to go all the way up to the first

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.830 
finger to go all the way up to the first
Fred<00:05:18.140> keeping<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.070> ring<00:05:19.220> finger<00:05:19.430> in<00:05:19.820> place<00:05:22.840> so

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
Fred keeping the ring finger in place so

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.480 
Fred keeping the ring finger in place so
there<00:05:24.050> I<00:05:24.080> played<00:05:24.530> bass<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.630> two<00:05:26.810> strings

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
there I played bass and the two strings

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.040 
there I played bass and the two strings
and<00:05:28.490> then<00:05:29.060> only<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.510> two<00:05:29.660> strings<00:05:29.930> without

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
and then only the two strings without

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.730 
and then only the two strings without
base<00:05:34.540> then<00:05:35.540> I<00:05:35.570> went<00:05:35.780> back<00:05:36.050> to<00:05:36.080> that<00:05:36.350> shape

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
base then I went back to that shape

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.410 
base then I went back to that shape
where<00:05:36.980> I<00:05:37.010> use<00:05:37.400> only<00:05:37.610> these<00:05:37.790> two<00:05:37.850> fingers<00:05:38.240> to

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
where I use only these two fingers to

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.020 
where I use only these two fingers to
hold<00:05:38.720> part<00:05:39.140> of<00:05:39.290> an<00:05:39.410> 8<00:05:39.530> quart<00:05:39.610> but<00:05:40.610> this<00:05:40.760> time<00:05:40.970> I

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
hold part of an 8 quart but this time I

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.940 
hold part of an 8 quart but this time I
was<00:05:41.240> playing<00:05:41.540> the<00:05:41.690> fifth<00:05:41.990> string<00:05:42.410> that's<00:05:42.740> the

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
was playing the fifth string that's the

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.810 
was playing the fifth string that's the
base<00:05:44.380> I'll<00:05:45.380> play<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.890> slow<00:05:46.130> as<00:05:46.250> I<00:05:46.340> came<00:05:46.520> first

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
base I'll play the slow as I came first

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:59.610 
base I'll play the slow as I came first
here's<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:47.120> left<00:05:47.330> hand

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.320 

then<00:06:00.620> I<00:06:00.650> play<00:06:00.950> three<00:06:01.550> times<00:06:01.850> if<00:06:02.090> i'm<00:06:02.180> not

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
then I play three times if i'm not

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.980 
then I play three times if i'm not
mistaken

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.470 

so<00:06:06.990> how<00:06:07.800> much<00:06:07.860> time<00:06:08.010> is<00:06:08.430> that<00:06:08.460> that's<00:06:08.850> a<00:06:09.180> six

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
so how much time is that that's a six

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.920 
so how much time is that that's a six
minute<00:06:09.720> video<00:06:10.550> so<00:06:11.550> I'll<00:06:11.640> play<00:06:11.910> the<00:06:12.150> intro<00:06:12.750> one

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
minute video so I'll play the intro one

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:45.610 
minute video so I'll play the intro one
more<00:06:13.110> time<00:06:13.320> slowly

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:52.580 

see<00:06:46.620> there<00:06:47.000> this<00:06:48.000> shape<00:06:48.300> I<00:06:48.630> go<00:06:51.110> play<00:06:52.110> that<00:06:52.260> base

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
see there this shape I go play that base

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.580 
see there this shape I go play that base
and<00:06:52.919> by<00:06:53.610> reflex

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
and by reflex
