00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello everyone yourself news and today we would 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.469
 continue the lesson today we will try 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.519
 make engine installation 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:20.869
 v8 with compressor let's start over 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:24.800
 we will buy the mustang mustang 1906 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.869
 right away 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.300
 We buy 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.239
 buy v8 engine block 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.050
 and about the engine block that is, in my 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:42.120
 versions are red and the most expensive 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.629
 we buy it so everything is according to the standard 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.629
 we will take 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.640
 so head bathe which we have noted 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.600
 then cylinder covers no difference 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.880
 give these now take dyes 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.880
 covers so 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:17.000
 here you will have a large selection that is 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.750
 Prime buy you the most expensive that is 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.719
 you will be 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:26.630
 and also we look by the name we buy 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:31.310
 always parts that match 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:36.520
 the name of our block is so flush 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:42.560
 systems here it is necessary to look at volts 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:47.899
 we will do so we need such 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.319
 system is called bathing 3 min take so 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:54.409
 she is one and a half thousand worth 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:59.409
 then bought the exhaust system we 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:03.280
 remove what you like here especially 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.280
 I have no preference 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.680
 So 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:19.870
 file system more often now we take two 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:26.670
 carburetor then transmission too early 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.670
 we went to a performanceist buy no2 and 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.810
 this one is dragster and compressor 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.209
 here we do not need it you can even 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:46.590
 let's not buy the chassis 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.590
 dear take so up 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.060
 key ovsky 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:03.989
 amy sue so something 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:12.780
 choose here we will take the radiator 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:12.780
 pump then then what like 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.540
 buy this one 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.970
 and filters buy more filter and more 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.780
 all we do not fit so we will be from 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.780
 this wading 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.900
 So 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:50.290
 check whether we bought everything and let's 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.290
 set all the places so 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.600
 We look that is, we installed but first 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.980
 we install 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.220
 the compressor she compressor already 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.660
 set the carburetor that is like this 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.340
 here you need to come all 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:15.020
 and already on the carburetor itself 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.020
 and we will install the filter 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.250
 a familiar picture from about afterburner 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.960
 us any afterburner 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.230
 but the picture is you so let's 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.360
 let's see here we have assembled the engine 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.700
 let's see more 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.310
 that she lacks all the principle of moving 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.230
 we collected we do not have enough to bring 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.380
 his battery 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.380
 let's see what we did 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.380
 look 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:58.420
 so we've got 742 horsepower 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:00.450
 and 1135 nanonews one way or newton not 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.240
 know is called a number 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.220
 so we look scales that is, we 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.100
 Productivity gains 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.750
 gradually and in any way here we allow 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:17.500
 he will site 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.660
 you about 3 thousand revolutions and so 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.380
 further, that is, you first or go afterwards 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:27.040
 there is a grab and then there may be 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.970
 pits all sorts of different notes overclocking you will have 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.460
 gradual 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:39.760
 and peak overclocking you will be about 7 with 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:43.840
 half a thousand turns so let's 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:48.750
 we will try to adjust Oleg himself 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.750
 engine with chassis 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.040
 so first let's start with the box 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.040
 rear drive 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.290
 basis. 63 cents and transfer time 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.150
 let's 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.310
 2 seconds make sure it so we build 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.230
 than touch 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.910
 we go here now we will configure you 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.920
 move and push the carburetor and 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:22.240
 huge on maxim increase feed 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:25.330
 mix and try to start now goes 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.900
 so great that is from the oral battery 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:36.910
 will work and look 730 with us like 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:38.800
 It was a little less than 728 which is great we 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:43.330
 let's increase the maximum turnover 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.870
 which can but the viewer is spinning well 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.870
 now check 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:53.130
 go and see 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.130
 everything is fine nothing has changed 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.870
 everything turned out fine 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:08.509
 principle now march 9 us tuned 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.770
 the following form we will assemble the undercarriage 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:15.889
 for our master 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:18.139
 then the way we are in this same video is rather 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:21.650
 all body kit done on the car and 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:25.610
 we will race in this version added 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:28.849
 map city is a pity and power to show 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.830
 and there are different races here in these 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:33.650
 races you can participate in cars and 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.000
 how to make money but although 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.840
 can be hacked through armani 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.210
 but you can also make money 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.150
 thank you 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:47.620
 watched me put huskies write 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.620
 comments everyone thank you everyone bye
