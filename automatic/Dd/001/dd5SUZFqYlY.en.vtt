each one of these like chip areas

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.419 
each one of these like chip areas
basically<00:01:20.179> a<00:01:20.420> controller<00:01:20.869> each<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.590> then

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
basically a controller each and then

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.969 
basically a controller each and then
they're<00:01:22.609> all<00:01:22.789> just<00:01:23.029> wired<00:01:23.329> up<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:24.499> the<00:01:24.619> various
