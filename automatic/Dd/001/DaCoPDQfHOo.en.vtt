00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
which is 39 gigabytes so pretty much

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.920 
which is 39 gigabytes so pretty much
twice<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.289> size

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.300

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
okay so there we go done forget it back

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:27.430

to<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.530> xbox<00:02:23.110> six<00:02:24.110> percent<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:26.210> game<00:02:26.990> half

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
to the xbox six percent of a game half

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.250 
to the xbox six percent of a game half
the<00:02:27.650> size<00:02:27.860> seven<00:02:28.580> percent<00:02:28.880> in<00:02:29.270> same<00:02:29.930> amount<00:02:30.200> of

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
the size seven percent in same amount of

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.980 
the size seven percent in same amount of
time<00:02:32.320> that's<00:02:33.320> pretty<00:02:33.530> ridiculous
