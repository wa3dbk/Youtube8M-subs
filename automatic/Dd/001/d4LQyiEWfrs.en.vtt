tool that can help you determine the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.360 
tool that can help you determine the
speed<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.870> your<00:00:06.960> hard<00:00:07.170> drives<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.950> tool<00:00:08.189> can

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
speed of your hard drives this tool can

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.190 
speed of your hard drives this tool can
be<00:00:08.429> used<00:00:08.550> on<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.940> network<00:00:09.179> map<00:00:09.510> drive<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.990> check

be used on a network map drive to check

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.839 
be used on a network map drive to check
the<00:00:10.320> speed<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.620> your<00:00:10.679> network<00:00:10.860> folder<00:00:11.400> they

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
the speed of your network folder they

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.580 
the speed of your network folder they
can<00:00:11.969> also<00:00:12.120> be<00:00:12.240> used<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.780> scuzzy<00:00:13.230> drive<00:00:13.410> if

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
can also be used on I scuzzy drive if

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.140 
can also be used on I scuzzy drive if
you<00:00:13.679> have<00:00:13.860> one<00:00:14.040> or<00:00:14.190> simply<00:00:14.639> just<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.910> sadder

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
you have one or simply just a sadder

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.300 
you have one or simply just a sadder
drive<00:00:15.389> connected<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.960> your<00:00:16.080> machine<00:00:16.310> its

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
drive connected to your machine its

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.980 
drive connected to your machine its
interface<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.970> simple<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.510> easy<00:00:18.810> to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
interface is simple and easy to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.900 
interface is simple and easy to
understand<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.920> requires<00:00:20.279> no<00:00:20.400> installation

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
understand it requires no installation

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.910 
understand it requires no installation
and<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.570> simply<00:00:21.869> runs<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.230> memory<00:00:22.529> during<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
and it simply runs in memory during the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.620 
and it simply runs in memory during the
time<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.250> using<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.640> program<00:00:23.880> it

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
time that you using the program it

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.359 
time that you using the program it
creates<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.019> small<00:00:25.289> temp<00:00:25.590> folder<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> drive

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
creates a small temp folder on the drive

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.429 
creates a small temp folder on the drive
that<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.699> testing<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.359> deletes<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.019> folder

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
that is testing and deletes that folder

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.439 
that is testing and deletes that folder
after<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.890> test<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.310> complete<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.300> really

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
after the test is complete so it really

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.089 
after the test is complete so it really
bears<00:00:30.689> no<00:00:30.869> negative<00:00:31.260> impact<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.830> your

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
like that for this particular test i

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.750 
like that for this particular test i
will<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.120> using<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.660> 64<00:00:52.260> kilobyte<00:00:52.800> default

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
will be using the 64 kilobyte default

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.209 
will be using the 64 kilobyte default
block<00:00:54.059> size<00:00:54.329> i'm<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.289> click<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.710> my<00:00:55.920> v

there's well in some cases you might see

a couple different download buttons and

a couple different download buttons and
that<00:01:50.970> might<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> bit<00:01:51.450> confusing<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.990> which

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that might be a bit confusing so which

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.710 
that might be a bit confusing so which
one<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.560> truly<00:01:52.740> want<00:01:53.040> when<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.030> hover<00:01:54.210> over

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
one do we truly want when we hover over

one do we truly want when we hover over
this<00:01:54.930> download<00:01:55.710> button<00:01:56.009> will<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.399> see

this download button will actually see

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
which says click here to download

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.950 
which says click here to download
parkdale<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.159> click<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.360> takes<00:02:00.780> us

to the download page I generally choose

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.999 
to the download page I generally choose
the<00:02:03.570> softpedia<00:02:04.140> secure<00:02:04.469> service<00:02:04.829> just

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the softpedia secure service just

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.950 
the softpedia secure service just
because<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.880> probably<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.240> lot<00:02:06.390> less<00:02:06.570> likely

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
because it's probably a lot less likely

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.029 
because it's probably a lot less likely
that<00:02:06.990> you're<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.500> any<00:02:07.649> problems

that you're going to have any problems

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.710 
that you're going to have any problems

on the link
and<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.450> course<00:02:13.480> we<00:02:13.840> save<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.500> our<00:02:14.860> local

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and of course we save it to our local

and of course we save it to our local
hard<00:02:15.610> drive<00:02:15.959> now<00:02:16.959> we're<00:02:17.110> not<00:02:17.200> going<00:02:17.379> to<00:02:17.440> go

hard drive now we're not going to go
through<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:17.799> test<00:02:18.159> because<00:02:18.250> there's<00:02:18.670> just

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
through that test because there's just

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.479 
through that test because there's just
no<00:02:18.970> point<00:02:19.209> in<00:02:19.360> doing<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.780> however<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:21.340> get

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
no point in doing that however you get

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.610 
no point in doing that however you get
the<00:02:21.610> understanding<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.269> how<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.629> works<00:02:25.620> your

the understanding of how that works your

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.350 
the understanding of how that works your
other<00:02:26.799> option<00:02:26.920> would<00:02:27.459> be<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.670> simply<00:02:28.150> go<00:02:28.330> to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
other option would be to simply go to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.660 
other option would be to simply go to
softpedia<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.500> also<00:02:30.040> type<00:02:30.220> in<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.489> term

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
parkdale that should bring up your your

parkdale that should bring up your your

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
option to download that software as well

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.569 
option to download that software as well
now<00:02:35.440> there's<00:02:35.650> many<00:02:35.799> uses<00:02:36.340> for<00:02:36.370> this

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
now there's many uses for this

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.640 
now there's many uses for this

of these drives would be the best one to
