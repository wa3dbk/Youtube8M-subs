00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240
 the video to the 3 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.179
 the conquest of the terrestrial environment carol 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.210
 look at the pictures below them 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.369
 represent the evolution of vertebrates 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.890
 that have appeared in the aquatic 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.930
 conquered in the terrestrial environment 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.310
 this transition involved the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.220
 development of some 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.730
 essential adaptive characteristics 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.219
 to face new selective pressures 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.610
 Typical of the new environment bodies 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.829
 presented useful characteristics 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.379
 survived and left descendants 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.680
 while those who did not have them 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.870
 died 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.079
 this phenomenon is called selection 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.079
 Natural 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.160
 each environment has its own 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.660
 characteristics that acts with pressures 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.270
 selective 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.760
 while the water holds the body of the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.730
 animals due to the push the environment 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.239
 terrestrial or air transport does not 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.680
 feature terrestrial animals 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.170
 need skeletons and more members 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.290
 strength to support their weight and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.689
 moving in the water there is no risk of 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.020
 dehydration because this precious liquid 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.600
 involves the whole animal but outside of it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.030
 environment, living things need to be 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.850
 structures adapted to prevent the loss of 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.680
 of aquatic animal vehicles perceive 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.939
 an environment due to the stimuli that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.000
 travels through the water 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.829
 on the other hand terrestrial organisms 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 captain stimuli that run through the air 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.009
 This requires different bodies adapted to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.680
 aquatic organisms absorb 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.360
 the oxygen gas dissolved in water 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.790
 whereas terrestrial organisms 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.670
 absorb the dissolved oxygen donate gas 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.670
 the organs performing this function are 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.649
 different and adapted to each environment 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.560
 the variation of temperature in the environment 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.110
 is slow and gradual 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.210
 while the terrestrial or air environment 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.229
 It can be abrupt and of great 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.659
 amplitude 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.960
 such a feature requires adaptations to 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.910
 keep your body temperature stable 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.869
 while in water the gametes can swim 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.659
 freely and the population with 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.120
 often outside the maternal organism 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.480
 this is not possible the dry environment in 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.879
 that fertilization occurs within the mother 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.690
 eggs deposited from the water is not at risk 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.150
 to dry 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.030
 on the other hand eggs released without soil 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.430
 need hard and impermeable shells 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.370
 which prevent dryness 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.530
 summarizing the terrestrial environment 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.610
 quite difficult characteristics for the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.030
 survival 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.650
 its conquest by vertebrates 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.170
 demanded the development of 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.720
 anatomical structures that have made 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.799
 new inhabitants able to face their 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.799
 selective people 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.950
 the fish were the first 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.349
 deteriorated 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.900
 they emerged and evolved in the environment 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.319
 aquatic systems are found in all 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.420
 seas rivers and lagoons of the planet breathe 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.030
 by means of white they move 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.000
 lateral movements of the body aided 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.280
 its foundation occurs in the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.560
 most of the time outside the female and 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.410
 if the embryos develop in water 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.389
 without the body hammer hammer though 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.819
 there are some fish configuration 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.079
 eggs are grown 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.959
 inside the mother 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.950
 they usually have the body covered 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.410
 of scales 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.410
 but some have smooth skin like the bars 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.230
 amphibians were the first 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.650
 vertebrates to explore the environment 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.690
 although it can move away from the 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.870
 water in search of food are always 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.299
 close to her when young people 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.510
 of white tadpoles and through the 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.910
 skin when adults breathe gates and 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.859
 skin that needs to be 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.250
 always wet to make the trade 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:02.349
 the tadpoles move about 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.139
 similar to fish swimming with the 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.599
 aid its tail by their adults 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.379
 they have legs that help in their 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.239
 locomotion its reproduction is quite 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.120
 dependent on water since fertilization 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.989
 and the embryos wrap themselves outside the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.639
 body keeping amphibians has 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.759
 your naked skin 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.759
 but not scaly hair or feathers 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.860
 reptiles more adapted to life outside the 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:37.900
 can live in hot and cold 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.629
 dry as the deserts 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.949
 for this they have developed characteristics 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:45.360
 that allow them to explore the environment 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:48.039
 with little loss of body water 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.219
 breathe through lungs that exchange 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:53.740
 gases directly with the atmosphere has 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:55.990
 muscular skeleton stronger than 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.719
 allow them the internal displacement without 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.120
 support provided by water 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:03.699
 its foundation is internal avoiding the 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.310
 drying the gametes the embryo can 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:09.310
 if it develops outside the mother in 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.229
 waterproof shells or inside the female 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.569
 besides these characteristics its body 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.300
 covered with climates cones or 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:23.409
 Castro to minimize a waterproof 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:24.669
 loss of water to the dry environment thus 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.680
 like the reptiles 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.169
 the birds conquered great 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.599
 independence of water they can be 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.990
 found in virtually all 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:37.899
 environments on the planet your lungs have 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.569
 projections called aerial bags that 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:42.969
 makes breathing more efficient 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.349
 its skeleton has light bones that 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.779
 make the egg easier 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:49.870
 the internal fertilization and the embryo 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.909
 always develops out of the mother on eggs 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.430
 this prevents the females from carrying the weight 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:56.830
 of the pups during the flight 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.569
 they have their bodies covered with feathers 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.889
 which help to maintain the 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.870
 body temperature 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.430
 so they can survive even in 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.490
 fairly cold regions 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.289
 finally all the birds have beaks as 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.899
 buses adapted to their habits 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.460
 food is each nozzle format 

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:14.009
 corresponds to an alimentary habit 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.229
 different 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:19.509
 the mammals conquered the planet 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.550
 Yes we can say that we humans 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:23.710
 belong to this group 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.379
 your lungs exchange gases in the atmosphere 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.500
 quite efficiently 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:31.249
 even in the case of whales and dolphins 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.579
 fully adapted mammals 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:36.859
 aquatic life using legs and wings or 

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:38.989
 fins mammals manage to 

00:06:36.859 --> 00:06:42.499
 move fairly efficiently 

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:44.749
 in all the environments of the planet its 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:47.179
 foundation is internal and the embryo 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:48.889
 develops within the mother 

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:51.229
 your chances of survival 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:53.779
 the marsupials like monotreated kangaroos 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:56.389
 with the rich monitor has strategies 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:58.729
 reproductive slightly different so 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:01.279
 as birds their body cover 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.989
 assists in maintaining the temperature 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:05.239
 mammals has a body covered with 

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:07.519
 and may also inhabit 

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:09.519
 quite cold of the planet 

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:12.319
 finally they have mammary glands 

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:14.119
 which feeds young people early in life 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.729
 greatly increasing your chances of 

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:19.779
 survival and contributing to their 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:23.239
 domain on the planet 

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:25.369
 evolution continues to gain 

00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:27.319
 terrestrial environment is not over 

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:29.089
 the pressure changes constantly 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:32.809
 and other characteristics 

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:34.609
 adaptive species are selected 

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:36.169
 accumulates new features and 

00:07:34.609 --> 00:07:39.369
 they change over time 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:42.049
 thus biodiversity 

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:44.899
