it like that as well so and as soon as
you<00:01:19.000> hit<00:01:19.150> that<00:01:19.180> chord<00:01:19.710> release<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.890> pressure

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
you hit that chord release the pressure

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.390 
you hit that chord release the pressure
of<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.430> fingers<00:01:21.760> so<00:01:22.120> it<00:01:22.300> kills<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.110> sound

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
of the fingers so it kills the sound

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.380 
of the fingers so it kills the sound
this<00:01:24.400> it<00:01:24.520> makes<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:24.760> like<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:24.940> quick<00:01:25.120> little

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
this it makes it like a quick little

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.200 
this it makes it like a quick little
chord<00:01:25.600> stab<00:01:26.220> don't<00:01:27.220> throw<00:01:27.700> off<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.940> strings

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
chord stab don't throw off the strings

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.670 
chord stab don't throw off the strings
or<00:01:28.390> anything<00:01:28.420> just<00:01:28.840> release<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.560> pressure

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
or anything just release the pressure

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.840 
or anything just release the pressure
you're<00:01:29.920> still<00:01:30.130> on<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.370> strings<00:01:30.580> you<00:01:30.670> just

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
you're still on the strings you just

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.180 
you're still on the strings you just
don't<00:01:31.659> have<00:01:31.750> any<00:01:31.900> pressure<00:01:32.080> on<00:01:32.260> them<00:01:32.409> then<00:01:33.070> you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
don't have any pressure on them then you

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.010 
don't have any pressure on them then you
repeat<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:33.610> exact<00:01:34.090> same<00:01:34.120> thing<00:01:36.780> alright<00:01:37.780> so

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
repeat that exact same thing alright so

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.020 
repeat that exact same thing alright so
you<00:01:38.080> did<00:01:38.230> it<00:01:38.350> twice<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.920> now<00:01:39.190> we<00:01:39.250> knew<00:01:39.850> bass

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
you did it twice and now we knew bass

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.190 
you did it twice and now we knew bass
line<00:01:40.300> in<00:01:40.480> the<00:01:40.540> new<00:01:40.659> chord<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.750> this<00:01:43.870> new<00:01:44.050> bass

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
line in the new chord so this new bass

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.810 
line in the new chord so this new bass
line<00:01:44.440> is<00:01:44.680> 1<00:01:45.040> 0<00:01:45.550> on<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.940> a<00:01:45.970> string<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.590> then<00:01:48.220> 3

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
line is 1 0 on the a string and then 3

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.080 
line is 1 0 on the a string and then 3
on<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.180> low<00:01:49.300> E<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:51.040> then<00:01:51.280> jump<00:01:51.700> up<00:01:51.790> and<00:01:51.970> just

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
on the low E and then jump up and just

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.120 
on the low E and then jump up and just
grab<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.390> bar<00:01:52.780> here<00:01:53.140> across<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.620> top<00:01:53.830> three

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
grab a bar here across the top three

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.960 
grab a bar here across the top three
strings<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.500> do<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.710> same<00:01:56.890> thing<00:01:57.070> play<00:01:57.850> it

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
strings and do the same thing play it

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.700 
strings and do the same thing play it
and<00:01:58.120> just<00:01:58.330> release<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.720> pressure<00:01:58.900> so<00:01:59.260> we<00:01:59.590> have

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
and just release the pressure so we have

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.260 
and just release the pressure so we have
this<00:02:02.159> now<00:02:03.159> this<00:02:03.370> next<00:02:03.610> bass<00:02:03.850> line<00:02:04.090> is

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
this now this next bass line is

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.760 
this now this next bass line is
different<00:02:04.450> it's<00:02:04.780> got<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:04.990> same<00:02:05.170> chord<00:02:05.530> at<00:02:05.650> the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
different it's got the same chord at the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.800 
different it's got the same chord at the
end<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:06.040> it<00:02:06.130> though<00:02:06.310> it's<00:02:06.790> going<00:02:06.940> to<00:02:07.000> be<00:02:07.120> open<00:02:07.600> D

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
end of it though it's going to be open D

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.720 
end of it though it's going to be open D
string<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:09.459> 3/5<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.950> all<00:02:12.129> new<00:02:12.400> D

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
string and then 3/5 it's all new D

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.500 
string and then 3/5 it's all new D
string<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.319> then<00:02:14.319> back<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.739> same<00:02:14.950> chord

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
string and then back to that same chord

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.820 
string and then back to that same chord
so<00:02:16.510> this

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.740

important to get to each chord twice now
you're<00:03:56.490> going<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.670> hit<00:03:56.760> each<00:03:56.910> chord<00:03:57.240> on<00:03:57.390> the

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
you're going to hit each chord on the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.750 
you're going to hit each chord on the
second<00:03:58.380> beat<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.830> measure<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.520> end

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
start making it back around to this

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.899 
start making it back around to this
second<00:04:40.830> verse<00:04:41.039> instead<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:41.699> doing<00:04:41.940> that<00:04:43.909> the

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
second verse instead of doing that the

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.610 
second verse instead of doing that the
Qataris<00:04:45.090> does<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.659> little<00:04:46.050> bit<00:04:46.229> different

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
Qataris does a little bit different

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.740 
Qataris does a little bit different
thing<00:04:46.889> it's<00:04:47.159> a<00:04:47.430> planned<00:04:48.030> part<00:04:48.419> though<00:04:48.599> it

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
thing it's a planned part though it

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.149 
thing it's a planned part though it
sounds<00:04:49.110> kind<00:04:49.289> of<00:04:49.349> random<00:04:49.650> but<00:04:49.680> it's<00:04:49.860> actually

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
sounds kind of random but it's actually

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.529 
sounds kind of random but it's actually
a<00:04:50.190> plan<00:04:50.430> part<00:04:50.699> because<00:04:50.879> he<00:04:50.940> does<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.240> two<00:04:51.360> times

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
a plan part because he does it two times

00:04:51.539 --> 00:05:11.059 
a plan part because he does it two times
a<00:04:51.780> row<00:04:52.099> so<00:04:53.099> it<00:04:53.159> sounds<00:04:53.340> like<00:04:53.430> this<00:05:09.530> alright<00:05:10.530> so

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069 
a row so it sounds like this alright so

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.209 
a row so it sounds like this alright so
we<00:05:11.190> have<00:05:11.370> that<00:05:11.690> third<00:05:12.690> fret<00:05:12.930> on<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.139> I'm<00:05:13.860> sorry

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219
