00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.550
 this pillar comes from the printer 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.820
 It is part of a whole room 16 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.860
 square meters more than two and a half 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.180
 meters high and eleven tons heavy 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.009
 the first completely printed room 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.330
 made of artificial sandstone with 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.140
 ornaments as from a gothic 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.140
 cathedral 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.590
 michael hans mayer and benjamin allen 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.360
 brother of the technical college in 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.700
 Zurich, the builders are the sandstone 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:46.120
 they grotesquely grotesque 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:48.519
 digital grotesque extremely detailed 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.879
 architecture from the past baroque 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.530
 churches in the rococo and was then 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.309
 Of course , the tree has so much 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.170
 lasted longer 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.030
 Stone carvers would be many many years 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:04.510
 need something comparable 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.920
 to produce only a few months needed 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.710
 however, the architects around their 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.869
 to design a walk-in room with a 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.150
 algorithm calculate each peak 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.920
 and every curve to form arises 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.200
 with classic crafts anymore 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.979
 to produce but only in 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.979
 3d printing process 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.630
 where the borders are there, I often think so 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.830
 on the scale so a precision with 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.600
 We do not have any of this technology 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.860
 limitations more what the geometries 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.020
 goes for the first time only about two days 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.170
 the 3d printer needs the layers 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.490
 of fine sand and apply 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.740
 Binder sticks to artificially 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.479
 sandstone will harden after hardening 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.680
 remaining santos of the form removed and 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.680
 can be recycled 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.810
 the team then sets the individual 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.810
 components together to form a massive space 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.960
 Everything can be individualized 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.610
 shed without a corner so you can 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.140
 individual components exactly to the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.370
 personal needs or the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.870
 to taste 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.650
 We were able to do that before 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.599
 but it was unbelievably expensive in here 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.239
 the dutch city amsterdam gen 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.560
 Architects took a step further in March 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.470
 start with the construction of the first one 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.080
 a printed house from a card house 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.970
 plastic whose items produced 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.780
 a specially developed device directly on 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.519
 the construction site 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:40.170
 then they are put together similarly 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:41.940
 like a toy from 1 3 the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.950
 Troops are about speed and about 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.890
 the material of today's building process 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.849
 Can be in times of fast growing 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.860
 megacitys no longer keep up 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.750
 that's why i believe that 3d printer 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.519
 based architecture in the next 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.640
 fifteen or twenty years always 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.640
 more important 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.709
 also other european architecture 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.530
 Offices develop concepts for houses 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.200
 the printer universe architect 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:12.780
 amsterdam came out the landscape house 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.849
 artificial sandstone the office foster 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.650
 and partner researches with the european 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.870
 Space Agency on a moon base 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.870
 printed on location from moon sand 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.290
 futuristic also the designs of soft 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.410
 kill this one from london a building 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.820
 organic like a bone that chooses 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.050
 for the old well that means you 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.970
 not so much anymore 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.560
 standardized elements must think 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.390
 and not so much anymore 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.360
 had two-dimensional elements to 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.760
 knows the typical glass wall or the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.170
 the faÃ§ade panel as elements of 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.850
 modern architecture and here we have 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.740
 maybe one again 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.050
 return of the three-dimensional too 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.890
 more complex components not only 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.490
 meet functional requirements 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.250
 must be 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.220
 this allows playful reforms as well 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.230
 at digital grotesque michael hans mayer 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.000
 and benjamin dillenburger work 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.240
 just at a continuation of the room 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.770
 with even more details you want to show 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.060
 ornate facades or walls 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.360
 do not have to cost more 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.360
 fail 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.790
 For a long time that was a luxury if you 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.950
 the past hundred or even a thousand 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.760
 thinking back years were always called 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.980
 something for emperors and kings people 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.050
 have to be told to produce 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.730
 but that is not all 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.730
 significantly more people go 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.850
 the artificial sandstone is not yet 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.480
 Stable enough for wind and weather too 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.980
 defy 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.950
 But the architects are sure 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.900
 that will soon change eccentric 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.500
 Living dreams hardly seem like that anymore 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.500
 borders
