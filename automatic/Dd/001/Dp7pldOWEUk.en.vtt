one here I saw an awesome mask number
nine<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.229> keto<00:01:04.589> mass<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.820> cool

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
nine is the keto mass this one was cool

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.780 
nine is the keto mass this one was cool
because<00:01:06.710> if<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.860> went<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.220> read<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
because if you went up to read as it

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.130 
because if you went up to read as it
would<00:01:08.880> make<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.180> dance<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.689> was<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.049> was

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
would make them dance it was it was

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.660 
would make them dance it was it was
funny<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.159> hell<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:14.040> don't<00:01:14.400> know<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.549> I

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
funny as hell and and I don't know if I

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.999 
funny as hell and and I don't know if I
lie<00:01:14.820> exactly<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.570> I'm<00:01:15.960> train<00:01:16.380> cyclists

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
lie exactly like that I'm train cyclists

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.520 
lie exactly like that I'm train cyclists
they<00:01:17.100> had<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.780> way<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> start<00:01:19.320> our

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
they had to do on the way to start our

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.929 
they had to do on the way to start our
but<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> thought<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> was<00:01:20.340> cool<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.790> could

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
but I thought it was cool that you could

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.350 
but I thought it was cool that you could
talk<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.119> give<00:01:21.420> dose<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:23.720> another<00:01:24.720> cool<00:01:25.049> mask

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
talk to give dose so another cool mask

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.149 
talk to give dose so another cool mask
number<00:01:27.360> eight<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:29.240> blasts<00:01:30.240> mask<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.920> one

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
number eight is the blasts mask this one

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.760 
number eight is the blasts mask this one
was<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> very<00:01:33.030> useful<00:01:33.210> mask<00:01:33.720> because<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.560> was

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
was a very useful mask because it was

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.880 
was a very useful mask because it was
just<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> bomb<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:36.200> mean<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.350> had<00:01:37.500> he<00:01:37.710> had

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
just like a bomb I mean it had he had

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.999 
just like a bomb I mean it had he had
one<00:01:38.159> drawback<00:01:38.490> from<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.090> normal<00:01:39.390> bomb<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.009> it

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
one drawback from a normal bomb but it

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.370 
one drawback from a normal bomb but it
was<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.490> was<00:01:41.610> basically<00:01:41.790> an<00:01:42.180> infinite<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
was it was basically an infinite one and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.630 
was it was basically an infinite one and
it<00:01:43.799> would<00:01:44.189> explode<00:01:44.579> quickly<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:46.640> little

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
it would explode quickly and a little

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.539 
it would explode quickly and a little
tool<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.909> only<00:01:50.909> drawback<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:52.860> was<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.430> it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
tool the only drawback it was that it

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.620 
tool the only drawback it was that it
would<00:01:53.640> take<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> little<00:01:54.030> while<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.450> recharge

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
would take a little while to recharge

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.830 
would take a little while to recharge
but<00:01:55.219> other<00:01:56.219> than<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.659> an<00:01:57.810> awesome<00:01:57.930> mask

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
but other than that it's an awesome mask

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.209 
but other than that it's an awesome mask
number<00:02:01.280> seven<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.610> stone<00:02:03.149> mask<00:02:03.680> this<00:02:04.680> was

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
number seven is the stone mask this was

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.819 
number seven is the stone mask this was
also<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.420> awesome<00:02:06.840> ass<00:02:07.020> because<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.649> could

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
also really awesome ass because it could

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.390

a<00:02:25.799> cool<00:02:26.549> mask<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.299> was<00:02:27.450> very<00:02:27.480> useful<00:02:28.079> in<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
a cool mask it was very useful in the
