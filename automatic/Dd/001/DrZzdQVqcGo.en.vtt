00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
this quick kill and go for the less rack

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.190 
this quick kill and go for the less rack
again<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.180> that<00:01:23.509> would<00:01:23.600> be<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.750> worst<00:01:23.990> thing

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
again and that would be the worst thing

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.840 
again and that would be the worst thing
for<00:01:24.320> in<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.890> world<00:01:25.070> for<00:01:25.250> disease<00:01:25.490> but<00:01:25.640> he's

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
for in the world for disease but he's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.100 
for in the world for disease but he's
actually<00:01:26.000> able<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.360> walk<00:01:26.539> out<00:01:26.719> of<00:01:26.750> there<00:01:26.960> but

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
actually able to walk out of there but

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.429 
actually able to walk out of there but
still<00:01:27.759> again<00:01:28.759> their<00:01:29.119> gank<00:01:29.509> rotation<00:01:30.110> was

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
still again their gank rotation was

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.709 
still again their gank rotation was
caught<00:01:30.680> out<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.909> double<00:01:32.180> support<00:01:32.539> that's

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
caught out and the double support that's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:33.940 
caught out and the double support that's
supposed<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.079> stick<00:01:33.259> together<00:01:33.350> was<00:01:33.680> able<00:01:33.859> to

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
supposed to stick together was able to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.980 
supposed to stick together was able to
get<00:01:34.039> caught<00:01:34.399> out<00:01:34.430> in<00:01:34.579> middle<00:01:35.149> swindle<00:01:35.840> gets

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
get caught out in middle swindle gets

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.539 
get caught out in middle swindle gets
hit<00:01:36.109> by<00:01:36.140> both<00:01:36.469> and<00:01:36.740> do<00:01:36.920> they<00:01:37.039> have<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.250> damage

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
hit by both and do they have the damage

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:38.950 
hit by both and do they have the damage
for<00:01:37.729> this<00:01:37.850> he's<00:01:38.000> actually<00:01:38.149> jumping<00:01:38.509> quite<00:01:38.750> low

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
for this he's actually jumping quite low

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.660 
for this he's actually jumping quite low
the<00:01:39.320> cold<00:01:39.560> snap<00:01:39.740> goes<00:01:39.890> off<00:01:40.070> as<00:01:40.250> well<00:01:40.399> as<00:01:40.520> e3

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
the cold snap goes off as well as e3

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.520 
the cold snap goes off as well as e3
coming<00:01:41.149> in<00:01:41.240> from<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.479> south<00:01:41.659> with<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.200> heel

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
coming in from the south with the heel

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.529 
coming in from the south with the heel
unable<00:01:42.859> to<00:01:42.890> do<00:01:43.159> anything<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.789> undying<00:01:44.119> TP<00:01:44.450> is

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
unable to do anything the undying TP is

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.510 
unable to do anything the undying TP is
well<00:01:44.750> kind<00:01:45.049> of<00:01:45.079> canceling<00:01:45.530> out<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.649> rotations

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
well kind of canceling out the rotations

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.669 
well kind of canceling out the rotations
from<00:01:46.670> complexity<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.420> again<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.350> just<00:01:48.380> feels

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
from complexity and again it just feels

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.469 
from complexity and again it just feels
like<00:01:48.740> mouths<00:01:49.039> is<00:01:49.219> kind<00:01:49.789> of<00:01:49.909> outmaneuvering

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
like mouths is kind of outmaneuvering

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.660 
like mouths is kind of outmaneuvering
them<00:01:50.689> right<00:01:50.810> now<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.590> they<00:01:51.710> true<00:01:51.950> I<00:01:51.979> fell<00:01:52.640> like

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
them right now so they true I fell like

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.910 
them right now so they true I fell like
that<00:01:53.060> swindon<00:01:53.719> loans<00:01:53.929> could<00:01:54.170> have<00:01:54.259> survived

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
that swindon loans could have survived

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.560 
that swindon loans could have survived
that<00:01:55.070> actually<00:01:55.490> tall<00:01:55.700> weigh<00:01:55.850> on<00:01:55.969> top<00:01:56.210> quick

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
that actually tall weigh on top quick

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.680 
that actually tall weigh on top quick
 you<00:01:57.020> going<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.259> get<00:01:57.350> gone

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
 you going to get gone

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.120 
 you going to get gone
as<00:01:57.750> well<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> studs<00:01:58.380> get<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.710> connected<00:01:58.890> with

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
as well the studs get it connected with

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.130 
as well the studs get it connected with
him<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.370> well<00:01:59.520> Moo<00:02:00.120> meander<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.720> able<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.050> pick

him as well Moo meander is able to pick

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.290 
him as well Moo meander is able to pick
up<00:02:01.230> the<00:02:01.350> last<00:02:01.500> hit<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> finally<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:03.000> see<00:02:03.150> some

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
up the last hit and finally we see some

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.740 
up the last hit and finally we see some
good<00:02:03.480> rotations<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:04.350> feel<00:02:05.190> it's<00:02:05.730> very<00:02:06.420> always

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
good rotations I feel it's very always

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.960 
good rotations I feel it's very always
fine<00:02:06.960> yeah<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.560> was<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.010> was<00:02:08.160> very<00:02:08.400> good<00:02:08.640> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
fine yeah it was it was very good to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.910 
fine yeah it was it was very good to
stay<00:02:09.210> in<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.570> game<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:10.080> was<00:02:10.290> very

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
stay in to this game it was very

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.770 
stay in to this game it was very
important<00:02:11.460> when<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.610> flies<00:02:12.210> gonna<00:02:12.480> get<00:02:12.630> gone

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
important when it flies gonna get gone

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.450 
important when it flies gonna get gone
out<00:02:12.960> as<00:02:13.080> well<00:02:13.230> he's<00:02:13.590> completely<00:02:13.740> out<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.220> mana

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
out as well he's completely out of mana

out as well he's completely out of mana
one<00:02:14.730> more<00:02:14.880> white<00:02:15.060> cliq<00:02:15.270> should<00:02:15.600> be<00:02:15.750> able<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.020> do

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
one more white cliq should be able to do

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.780 
one more white cliq should be able to do
it<00:02:16.320> he<00:02:16.740> does<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.130> shuriken<00:02:17.460> toss<00:02:17.610> as

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
it he does that the shuriken toss as

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.610 
it he does that the shuriken toss as
well<00:02:17.970> that'll<00:02:18.240> be<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.420> last<00:02:18.450> hit<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.020> that's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
well that'll be the last hit and that's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.080 
well that'll be the last hit and that's
a<00:02:19.710> bounty<00:02:20.100> hunter<00:02:20.130> track<00:02:20.580> kill<00:02:20.790> as<00:02:20.910> well

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
a bounty hunter track kill as well

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.880 
a bounty hunter track kill as well
swindle<00:02:21.810> melons<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.230> going<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.470> come<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.770> do

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
swindle melons is going to come in do

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.890 
swindle melons is going to come in do
they<00:02:23.010> have<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> detection<00:02:23.550> firms<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.750> I

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
they have the detection firms and I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.450 
they have the detection firms and I
think<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.500> very<00:02:25.590> important<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.220> they

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
think it's very important that they

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.610 
think it's very important that they
stick<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.000> doing<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.390> yeah<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.260> guess<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
stick to doing that yeah I guess the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.050 
stick to doing that yeah I guess the
problem<00:02:28.770> for<00:02:29.040> them<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> main<00:02:29.670> reason<00:02:29.700> why

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
problem for them and the main reason why

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.100 
problem for them and the main reason why
they're<00:02:30.210> not<00:02:30.240> doing<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:30.990> because

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
they're not doing it is just because

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.850 
they're not doing it is just because
they're<00:02:31.980> devoting<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:32.520> much<00:02:32.730> time<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.330> kind<00:02:33.540> of

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
they're devoting so much time to kind of

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.590 
they're devoting so much time to kind of
clearing<00:02:34.860> out<00:02:34.950> their<00:02:35.070> own<00:02:35.280> jungle<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.510> in

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
clearing out their own jungle and so in

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.570 
clearing out their own jungle and so in
this<00:02:36.690> middle<00:02:36.900> lane<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.980> should<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> big

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
this middle lane this should be the big

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.980 
this middle lane this should be the big
fighters<00:02:38.910> way<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.120> step<00:02:39.510> forward<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:39.930> the
