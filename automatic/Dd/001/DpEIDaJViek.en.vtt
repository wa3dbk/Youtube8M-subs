subject<00:00:34.290> that's<00:00:34.950> they<00:00:35.280> often<00:00:35.670> misunderstood

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
subject that's they often misunderstood

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.049 
subject that's they often misunderstood
called<00:00:38.000> modality<00:00:39.200> what<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.469> heard

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
called modality what you just heard

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.380 
called modality what you just heard
sounded<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:43.430> exotic<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> exotic

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
sounded a little exotic on the exotic

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.340 
sounded a little exotic on the exotic
side<00:00:45.800> but<00:00:47.059> really<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.360> notes<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.320> i

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
side but really the the notes that i

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.130 
side but really the the notes that i
played<00:00:49.800> were<00:00:50.160> nothing<00:00:50.670> more<00:00:50.700> than<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.870> notes

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
played were nothing more than the notes

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.470 
played were nothing more than the notes
inside<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> major<00:00:53.010> scale<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.850> major<00:00:54.030> scale<00:00:54.300> is

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
inside a major scale the major scale is

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.200 
inside a major scale the major scale is
go<00:00:55.020> away<00:00:55.350> me<00:00:55.620> foul<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.430> scaling<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
go away me foul so that scaling you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.849 
go away me foul so that scaling you
specifically<00:00:59.719> it<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> notes<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.410> that

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
specifically it was the notes in that

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.709 
specifically it was the notes in that
kind<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.399> scale<00:01:02.670> even<00:01:02.940> though<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> make<00:01:03.570> some

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
kind of a scale even though I make some

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.570 
kind of a scale even though I make some
adjustments<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.409> there<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.280> that's<00:01:05.460> what

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
adjustments in there and that's what

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.750 
adjustments in there and that's what
we're<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> talk<00:01:06.000> about<00:01:06.590> conceptually

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
we're going to talk about conceptually

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.480 
we're going to talk about conceptually
modality<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.530> nothing<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> changing<00:01:11.310> of

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
modality is nothing but a changing of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.700 
modality is nothing but a changing of
perspective<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.990> looking<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.470> something

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
perspective it's looking at something

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.850 
perspective it's looking at something
that's<00:01:14.010> clearly<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.670> thing<00:01:15.560> tilting<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that's clearly one thing tilting it and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.380 
that's clearly one thing tilting it and
making<00:01:16.979> kit<00:01:17.220> become<00:01:17.490> something<00:01:17.759> else<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
making kit become something else so I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.240 
making kit become something else so I
use<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.750> technology<00:01:19.320> sometimes<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
use the technology sometimes of a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.469 
use the technology sometimes of a
saxophone<00:01:20.850> picture<00:01:21.920> somebody<00:01:22.920> drew<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.180> tilt

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
saxophone picture somebody drew you tilt

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.030 
saxophone picture somebody drew you tilt
the<00:01:24.540> page<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.350> make<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> into<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the page and you can make it into a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.800 
the page and you can make it into a
snake<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.119> were<00:01:27.710> or<00:01:28.710> sewer<00:01:29.280> pipe<00:01:29.810> or

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
snake if you were or sewer pipe or

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.780 
snake if you were or sewer pipe or
anything<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.290> want<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:32.340> still<00:01:32.579> going

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
anything you want but it's still going

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.330 
anything you want but it's still going
to<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:32.909> clearly<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.420> saxophone<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.159> can

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to be clearly a saxophone but you can

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.310 
to be clearly a saxophone but you can
look<00:01:35.790> at<00:01:35.939> things<00:01:36.180> from<00:01:36.329> other<00:01:36.630> perspectives

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
look at things from other perspectives

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.319 
look at things from other perspectives
is<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.220> good<00:01:38.490> lesson<00:01:39.060> in

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
is that it's really a good lesson in

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.030 
is that it's really a good lesson in
life<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.259> looking<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.710> things<00:01:40.860> from

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
life to just looking at things from

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.030 
life to just looking at things from
another<00:01:41.159> perspective<00:01:41.340> sometimes<00:01:42.770> can<00:01:43.770> open

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
another perspective sometimes can open

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.020 
another perspective sometimes can open
some<00:01:44.220> things<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.110> in<00:01:46.110> modality<00:01:47.030> usually

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
some things up so in modality usually

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.359 
some things up so in modality usually
the<00:01:48.149> way<00:01:48.270> modality<00:01:48.930> gets<00:01:49.200> presented<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the way modality gets presented and it

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.710 
the way modality gets presented and it
gets<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> reasons<00:01:51.570> why<00:01:51.659> it

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
gets this is one of the reasons why it

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.420 
gets this is one of the reasons why it
gets<00:01:51.869> misunderstood<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.680> gets<00:01:52.829> presented<00:01:53.159> in

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
gets misunderstood it gets presented in

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.030 
gets misunderstood it gets presented in
a<00:01:53.520> way<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.180> up<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.140> scale<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.649> starting

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
a way of just up the scale and starting

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.969 
a way of just up the scale and starting
on<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> different<00:01:56.549> place<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.590> case<00:01:58.829> in

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
on a different place so the case in

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.880 
on a different place so the case in
point<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.880> play<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.750> D<00:02:01.049> major<00:02:01.290> scale

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.040 

and<00:02:05.890> that's<00:02:06.430> called<00:02:06.610> Ionian<00:02:07.299> they<00:02:07.570> use<00:02:07.720> Greek

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
and that's called Ionian they use Greek

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.859 
and that's called Ionian they use Greek
names<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.520> if<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.729> start<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.179> second<00:02:10.600> step

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
names and if I start on the second step

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.750 
names and if I start on the second step
of<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.200> scale<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.530> play<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.950> same<00:02:12.220> notes<00:02:12.520> in

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
of that scale and play the same notes in

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.600 
of that scale and play the same notes in
the<00:02:12.819> same<00:02:13.060> scale<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.959> sounds<00:02:14.319> like<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:17.610> and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
the same scale it sounds like this and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.699 
the same scale it sounds like this and
that<00:02:18.850> sounds<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.540> like<00:02:20.020> I'm<00:02:20.170> playing<00:02:20.290> through

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
that sounds a like I'm playing through

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.510 
that sounds a like I'm playing through

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.040 
sound major E when you hear them that
way<00:02:38.440> when<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:38.950> compare<00:02:39.420> each<00:02:40.420> step<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
way when you compare each step of the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.509 
way when you compare each step of the
scale<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.709> start<00:02:41.950> from<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.190> different

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
scale and just start from a different

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.400 
scale and just start from a different
point<00:02:42.700> they're<00:02:43.330> all<00:02:43.480> going<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.750> sound<00:02:43.959> like

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
point they're all going to sound like

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.350 
point they're all going to sound like
it's<00:02:44.590> one<00:02:44.769> big<00:02:44.980> major<00:02:45.190> scale<00:02:45.670> played<00:02:46.090> from

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
it's one big major scale played from

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.030 
it's one big major scale played from
different<00:02:47.290> notes<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.680> that's<00:02:47.800> not<00:02:47.980> very

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
different notes and that's not very

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.710 
different notes and that's not very
exciting<00:02:48.580> because<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:49.060> doesn't<00:02:49.360> have<00:02:49.390> enough

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
exciting because it doesn't have enough

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.080 
exciting because it doesn't have enough
diversity<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.590> there's<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.489> good<00:02:51.670> reason<00:02:51.880> for

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
diversity and there's a good reason for

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.509 
diversity and there's a good reason for
that<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.600> that<00:02:53.260> is<00:02:53.290> because<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.160> power<00:02:54.370> of

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
that and that is because of the power of

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.240 
that and that is because of the power of
tonality<00:02:55.080> once<00:02:56.080> we<00:02:56.230> establish<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.799> tonal

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
tonality once we establish a tonal

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.740 
tonality once we establish a tonal
center<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.730> d<00:02:58.540> that's<00:02:59.080> what<00:02:59.230> we<00:02:59.319> started<00:03:00.750> even

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
center of d that's what we started even

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.960 
center of d that's what we started even
have<00:03:01.870> my<00:03:02.019> string<00:03:02.350> tuned<00:03:02.590> down<00:03:02.799> to<00:03:03.010> D<00:03:03.190> even

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
have my string tuned down to D even

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.979 
have my string tuned down to D even
reinforce<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:06.299> don't<00:03:07.299> care<00:03:07.450> what<00:03:07.510> water<00:03:07.900> I

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
reinforce it I don't care what water I

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:15.900 
reinforce it I don't care what water I
play<00:03:08.290> these<00:03:08.470> notes<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:15.070> even<00:03:15.430> if<00:03:15.519> I<00:03:15.610> start

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
play these notes in so even if I start

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.970 
play these notes in so even if I start
on<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.150> second<00:03:16.540> step<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.930> scale<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.590> our

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
on the second step of the scale and our

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.000 
on the second step of the scale and our
mind<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.730> here<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.049> play<00:03:20.320> I<00:03:22.709> could<00:03:23.709> say<00:03:23.859> I'm

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
mind is here and I play I could say I'm

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.560 
mind is here and I play I could say I'm
playing<00:03:24.160> Dorian<00:03:24.820> but<00:03:25.090> we're<00:03:25.269> not<00:03:25.390> really

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
playing Dorian but we're not really

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.640 
playing Dorian but we're not really
hearing<00:03:25.900> Dorian<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:27.430> it's<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.060> problem<00:03:28.590> how<00:03:29.590> do

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
hearing Dorian so it's a problem how do

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.740 
hearing Dorian so it's a problem how do
you<00:03:29.799> hear<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.250> moats<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:31.600> hear<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.049> modes<00:03:32.430> by

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
you hear the moats you hear the modes by

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.729 
you hear the moats you hear the modes by
taking<00:03:34.950> this<00:03:35.950> each<00:03:36.400> mode<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.209> and

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
taking this each mode and and

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.990 
taking this each mode and and
transposing<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:39.040> in<00:03:39.130> other<00:03:39.280> ways<00:03:39.400> bringing<00:03:39.850> it

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
transposing it in other ways bringing it

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.110 
transposing it in other ways bringing it
all<00:03:40.120> from<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.570> same<00:03:40.750> starting<00:03:41.380> point<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:43.090> that

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
all from the same starting point so that

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.150 
all from the same starting point so that
you<00:03:43.390> can<00:03:43.750> actually<00:03:44.109> compare<00:03:44.769> them<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.010> each

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
you can actually compare them to each

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.970 
you can actually compare them to each
other<00:03:45.690> consider<00:03:46.690> this<00:03:46.930> fingering<00:03:47.440> i<00:03:47.560> use<00:03:47.739> for

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
other consider this fingering i use for

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.449 
other consider this fingering i use for
Phrygian<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.790> first<00:03:49.060> one<00:03:49.380> this<00:03:50.380> is<00:03:50.530> my<00:03:51.070> own<00:03:51.280> in

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
Phrygian the first one this is my own in

Phrygian the first one this is my own in
2<00:03:52.299> 3<00:03:52.870> bo3<00:03:53.410> starts<00:03:54.190> on<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.430> third<00:03:54.640> step<00:03:54.880> of<00:03:54.940> the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
2 3 bo3 starts on the third step of the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.450 
2 3 bo3 starts on the third step of the
scale<00:03:55.329> consider<00:03:55.780> this<00:03:55.930> fingering

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.800 

if<00:04:00.460> I<00:04:00.550> take<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:00.940> same<00:04:01.120> fingering<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.660> nice

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
if I take that same fingering a nice

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.630 
if I take that same fingering a nice
play<00:04:02.020> it<00:04:02.080> from<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.560> same<00:04:02.800> starting<00:04:03.370> place

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
play it from the same starting place

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.980 
play it from the same starting place
listen<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.630> this<00:04:04.750> sound<00:04:09.570> that's<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:10.810> real

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
listen to this sound that's the real

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.420 
listen to this sound that's the real
sound<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.470> Phrygian<00:04:11.860> mode<00:04:11.910> now<00:04:12.910> on<00:04:13.750> paper<00:04:14.430> it's

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
sound of Phrygian mode now on paper it's

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.070 
sound of Phrygian mode now on paper it's
the<00:04:15.610> same<00:04:15.850> relationships<00:04:16.540> i'm<00:04:16.720> playing<00:04:16.959> the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
the same relationships i'm playing the

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.460 
the same relationships i'm playing the
exact<00:04:17.350> same<00:04:17.560> fingering<00:04:17.980> listen<00:04:19.290> how<00:04:20.290> will<00:04:20.410> you

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
exact same fingering listen how will you

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.740 
exact same fingering listen how will you
can<00:04:20.590> play<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.890> drum<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:22.740> listen<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.800> this<00:04:23.890> one

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.660 

that<00:04:28.750> sounds<00:04:29.140> bright<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.590> happy<00:04:29.740> this<00:04:30.370> one

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
that sounds bright and happy this one

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:38.340 
that sounds bright and happy this one
sounds<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:37.060> sounds<00:04:37.390> exotic<00:04:37.690> but<00:04:38.110> yet

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
sounds that sounds exotic but yet

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.560 
sounds that sounds exotic but yet
mathematically<00:04:39.010> those<00:04:39.790> notes<00:04:40.060> are<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.330> same

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
mathematically those notes are the same

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.400 
mathematically those notes are the same
so<00:04:41.230> in<00:04:41.530> order<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.250> make<00:04:42.520> modes<00:04:42.820> manifest<00:04:43.570> you

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
so in order to make modes manifest you

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.830 
so in order to make modes manifest you
have<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.620> compare<00:04:45.010> them<00:04:45.220> from<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.760> same<00:04:46.030> point

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
have to compare them from the same point

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.890 
have to compare them from the same point
so<00:04:47.410> it's<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.650> good<00:04:47.800> exercise<00:04:48.130> to<00:04:48.820> create<00:04:49.630> with

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
so it's a good exercise to create with

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.500 
so it's a good exercise to create with
each<00:04:50.080> mode<00:04:50.640> this<00:04:51.640> is<00:04:51.730> level<00:04:51.910> one<00:04:52.210> just

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
each mode this is level one just

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.570 
each mode this is level one just
creating<00:04:52.930> with<00:04:53.080> them<00:04:53.230> just<00:04:53.580> experiencing

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
creating with them just experiencing

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.580 
creating with them just experiencing
their<00:04:54.730> sounds<00:04:55.210> is<00:04:55.690> to<00:04:55.750> take<00:04:56.050> your<00:04:56.290> guitar<00:04:58.590> you

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
their sounds is to take your guitar you

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.100 
their sounds is to take your guitar you

D play the D major scale or any key and

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.650 
D play the D major scale or any key and
then<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:16.300> take<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:16.570> notes<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.560> same<00:05:17.860> notes

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.630 

but<00:05:21.660> transpose<00:05:22.290> them<00:05:22.620> whatever<00:05:23.550> that

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
but transpose them whatever that

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.850 
but transpose them whatever that
whatever<00:05:24.450> those<00:05:24.630> half<00:05:24.870> step<00:05:25.140> whole<00:05:25.170> steps<00:05:25.650> r

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
whatever those half step whole steps r

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.720 
whatever those half step whole steps r
transpose<00:05:26.520> them<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.860> same<00:05:29.100> point<00:05:29.460> and

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
transpose them to the same point and

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
transpose them to the same point and
you'll<00:05:29.850> get<00:05:30.030> this<00:05:30.360> is<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.630> sound<00:05:30.870> of<00:05:30.990> Dorian

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.300 

this<00:05:36.750> is<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:36.990> original<00:05:37.080> sound<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:37.920> Dorian

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
this is the original sound of Dorian

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.400 
this is the original sound of Dorian
that<00:05:38.490> doesn't<00:05:38.790> sound<00:05:38.970> like<00:05:39.120> going<00:05:39.450> before<00:05:40.230> I

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
that doesn't sound like going before I

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.450 
that doesn't sound like going before I
transpose<00:05:41.040> it<00:05:41.250> listen<00:05:43.100> sound<00:05:44.100> like<00:05:44.250> major

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
transpose it listen sound like major

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:51.950 
transpose it listen sound like major
again<00:05:46.220> but<00:05:47.220> when<00:05:47.310> I<00:05:47.340> put<00:05:47.640> it<00:05:47.760> here<00:05:50.840> and<00:05:51.840> it's

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
again but when I put it here and it's

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.410 
again but when I put it here and it's
not<00:05:52.080> because<00:05:52.230> of<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.680> physical<00:05:52.860> drone

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
not because of the physical drone

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.790 
not because of the physical drone
because<00:05:54.420> even<00:05:54.570> without<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:55.080> physical<00:05:55.320> drone

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
because even without the physical drone

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.950 
because even without the physical drone
it's<00:05:56.490> because<00:05:56.790> of<00:05:56.820> our<00:05:57.000> tonality<00:05:57.420> and<00:05:57.720> our

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
it's because of our tonality and our

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.090 
it's because of our tonality and our
minds<00:05:58.200> again<00:05:58.680> without<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.160> drone<00:06:00.230> here's<00:06:01.230> D

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
minds again without the drone here's D

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.060 
minds again without the drone here's D
Dorian<00:06:02.400> but<00:06:02.880> not<00:06:03.060> but<00:06:03.660> not<00:06:03.840> from<00:06:04.110> d<00:06:04.380> it's

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
Dorian but not but not from d it's

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.010 
Dorian but not but not from d it's
really<00:06:05.340> a<00:06:05.610> Dorian<00:06:06.030> so<00:06:06.270> listen<00:06:06.450> it<00:06:06.720> won't<00:06:06.780> sound

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
really a Dorian so listen it won't sound

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.230 
really a Dorian so listen it won't sound
like<00:06:07.200> you<00:06:07.350> Dorian<00:06:10.880> that<00:06:11.880> sounds<00:06:12.120> like<00:06:12.150> a

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
like you Dorian that sounds like a

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.780 
like you Dorian that sounds like a
complete<00:06:13.080> major<00:06:13.290> scale<00:06:13.710> like<00:06:14.370> that's<00:06:14.580> still

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
complete major scale like that's still

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:23.840 
complete major scale like that's still
though<00:06:17.480> but<00:06:18.480> when<00:06:18.600> I<00:06:18.660> start<00:06:18.960> on<00:06:19.080> D<00:06:22.640> now<00:06:23.640> that

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
though but when I start on D now that

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.700 
though but when I start on D now that
sounds<00:06:24.030> like<00:06:24.210> though<00:06:24.570> so<00:06:25.110> when<00:06:25.260> you<00:06:25.350> do<00:06:25.470> that

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
sounds like though so when you do that

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.190 
sounds like though so when you do that
for<00:06:25.920> each<00:06:26.100> mode<00:06:26.690> and<00:06:27.690> you<00:06:27.870> do<00:06:28.050> the

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
for each mode and you do the

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.710 
for each mode and you do the
transpositions<00:06:29.010> where<00:06:29.160> you<00:06:29.280> you<00:06:30.150> transpose

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
transpositions where you you transpose

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.300 
transpositions where you you transpose
the<00:06:30.930> fingerings<00:06:31.380> back<00:06:31.590> to<00:06:31.770> the<00:06:31.890> same<00:06:32.100> place

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
the fingerings back to the same place

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.300 
the fingerings back to the same place
make<00:06:32.940> sure<00:06:32.970> you're<00:06:33.240> getting<00:06:33.360> them<00:06:33.540> right<00:06:34.310> you

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
make sure you're getting them right you

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.950 
make sure you're getting them right you
will<00:06:35.430> be<00:06:35.550> able<00:06:35.640> to<00:06:35.790> experience<00:06:36.090> each<00:06:36.540> of<00:06:36.840> the

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
will be able to experience each of the

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.320 
will be able to experience each of the
seven<00:06:37.320> modes<00:06:37.530> and<00:06:37.920> then<00:06:38.400> you<00:06:38.580> can<00:06:38.850> create<00:06:39.090> with

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
seven modes and then you can create with

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.520 
seven modes and then you can create with
them<00:06:39.540> that<00:06:39.690> little<00:06:39.930> thing<00:06:40.080> I<00:06:40.200> did<00:06:40.380> in<00:06:40.440> the

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
them that little thing I did in the

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.860 
them that little thing I did in the
beginning<00:06:40.620> was<00:06:41.070> the<00:06:41.400> linnean<00:06:42.270> move<00:06:42.510> that<00:06:42.750> was

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
beginning was the linnean move that was

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.780 
beginning was the linnean move that was
the<00:06:42.960> Mogollon<00:06:43.620> the<00:06:43.710> fourth<00:06:43.920> degree<00:06:44.100> I<00:06:44.310> forget

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
the Mogollon the fourth degree I forget

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.460 
the Mogollon the fourth degree I forget
what<00:06:44.850> I<00:06:44.940> played<00:06:45.180> but<00:06:45.390> I<00:06:45.420> was<00:06:45.600> improvising<00:06:45.960> but

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
what I played but I was improvising but

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:57.799 
what I played but I was improvising but
so<00:06:46.620> good<00:06:48.260> I<00:06:49.260> try<00:06:50.100> to<00:06:50.160> sing<00:06:50.460> in<00:06:50.700> there

00:06:57.799 --> 00:06:57.809 

00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:00.989 

so<00:06:58.809> that's<00:06:59.619> this<00:07:00.009> lesson<00:07:00.429> is<00:07:00.519> just<00:07:00.729> going<00:07:00.879> to

00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:00.999 
so that's this lesson is just going to

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:04.429 
so that's this lesson is just going to
be<00:07:01.119> to<00:07:01.389> create<00:07:01.419> modes<00:07:02.199> based<00:07:02.559> on<00:07:02.860> on<00:07:03.069> the<00:07:03.759> drum

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:04.439 
be to create modes based on on the drum

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:07.229 
be to create modes based on on the drum
stay<00:07:05.439> tuned<00:07:05.709> for<00:07:06.039> the<00:07:06.399> lesson<00:07:06.729> in<00:07:06.819> the<00:07:06.909> future
