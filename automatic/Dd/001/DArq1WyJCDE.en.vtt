more<00:01:33.329> than<00:01:33.509> 90<00:01:33.960> damage<00:01:34.280> but<00:01:35.280> anyway<00:01:35.670> now<00:01:35.970> let's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
more than 90 damage but anyway now let's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.870 
more than 90 damage but anyway now let's
do<00:01:36.329> another<00:01:36.540> test<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.380> weak<00:01:37.560> world<00:01:37.860> test<00:01:38.100> how

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
do another test the weak world test how

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.749 
do another test the weak world test how
is<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.360> m4<00:01:39.840> recoil<00:01:40.470> well<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.189> burst<00:01:41.490> fire

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
is the m4 recoil well if you burst fire

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.580 
is the m4 recoil well if you burst fire
like<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.329> then<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.840> course<00:01:43.110> recoil<00:01:43.470> isn't

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
like this then of course recoil isn't

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770 
like this then of course recoil isn't
big<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.430> small<00:01:44.640> pattern<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.509> weapon

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
big just a small pattern and the weapon

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.520 
big just a small pattern and the weapon
goes<00:01:45.990> outside<00:01:46.460> but<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.850> spray<00:01:48.180> then<00:01:48.899> goes

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
goes outside but if you spray then goes

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.200 
goes outside but if you spray then goes
go<00:01:49.799> everywhere<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.549> definitely<00:01:50.850> don't

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
go everywhere so you definitely don't

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.060 
go everywhere so you definitely don't
want<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.840> spraying<00:01:52.290> with<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.619> weapon<00:01:52.950> on

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
want to be spraying with this weapon on

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.249 
want to be spraying with this weapon on
long<00:01:53.280> ranges<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.390> most<00:01:54.600> weapons<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.079> can

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
long ranges like in most weapons it can

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.990 
long ranges like in most weapons it can
strike<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.100> spray<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.399> small<00:01:56.759> range

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
strike but if you spray on small range

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.060 
strike but if you spray on small range
then<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:58.110> will<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.649> fine

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
then you will be just fine

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.820 
then you will be just fine
you<00:01:59.159> will<00:01:59.310> most<00:01:59.460> likely<00:01:59.670> kill<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.360> enemy

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
you will most likely kill the enemy

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.830 
you will most likely kill the enemy
but<00:02:01.250> once<00:02:01.430> again<00:02:01.700> on<00:02:01.880> long<00:02:02.090> ranges<00:02:02.540> you

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
but once again on long ranges you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.080 
but once again on long ranges you
definitely<00:02:03.500> want<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.740> be<00:02:03.860> berthed<00:02:04.130> firing<00:02:04.640> so

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
definitely want to be berthed firing so

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.880 
definitely want to be berthed firing so
in<00:02:05.540> terms<00:02:05.840> of<00:02:05.960> week<00:02:06.170> well<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:06.590> actually

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
in terms of week well it actually

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.920 
in terms of week well it actually
performs<00:02:07.220> very<00:02:07.550> similar<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.240> oven<00:02:08.630> for

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
performs very similar to the oven for

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.280 
performs very similar to the oven for
and<00:02:09.280> those<00:02:10.280> were<00:02:10.490> actually<00:02:10.790> two<00:02:11.120> only<00:02:11.570> tests<00:02:12.200> I

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
and those were actually two only tests I

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.500 
and those were actually two only tests I
wanted<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.740> do<00:02:12.890> with<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.310> weapon<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.970> just<00:02:14.450> a

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
wanted to do with this weapon and just a

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.990 
wanted to do with this weapon and just a
reminder<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:15.830> isn't<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.220> review<00:02:16.550> this<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.880> an

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
reminder this isn't a review this is an

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.150 
reminder this isn't a review this is an
overview<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:17.960> am<00:02:18.170> NOT<00:02:18.350> going<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.710> give<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:18.980> guys

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
overview I am NOT going to give you guys

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.010 
overview I am NOT going to give you guys
all<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.430> statistics<00:02:20.210> I<00:02:20.330> want<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.780> tell<00:02:20.930> you

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
all the statistics I want to tell you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.870 
all the statistics I want to tell you
guys<00:02:21.140> my<00:02:21.200> thoughts<00:02:21.710> about<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.100> weapon<00:02:22.460> do<00:02:22.850> I

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
guys my thoughts about the weapon do I

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.520 
guys my thoughts about the weapon do I
think<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.240> weapon<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.630> good<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:23.990> think<00:02:24.320> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
think this weapon is good do I think the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.430 
think this weapon is good do I think the
new<00:02:24.710> m4<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.280> bad<00:02:25.730> or<00:02:26.060> good<00:02:26.300> or<00:02:26.600> all<00:02:26.960> that<00:02:27.380> stuff

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
new m4 is bad or good or all that stuff

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.730 
new m4 is bad or good or all that stuff
well<00:02:27.980> after<00:02:28.760> doing<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.150> test<00:02:29.480> well<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.500> can

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
well after doing this test well I can

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.350 
well after doing this test well I can
conclude<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.310> in<00:02:31.490> terms<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.820> damage<00:02:32.150> it

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
conclude that in terms of damage it

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.870 
conclude that in terms of damage it
performs<00:02:32.930> really<00:02:33.170> similar<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.220> old<00:02:34.580> and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
performs really similar to the old and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.210 
performs really similar to the old and
for<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.450> in<00:02:35.990> terms<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.350> recoil<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:37.010> also

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
for and in terms of recoil it also

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.910 
for and in terms of recoil it also
performs<00:02:37.850> very<00:02:38.390> similar<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.350> oven<00:02:39.710> for

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
performs very similar to the oven for

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.430 
performs very similar to the oven for
the<00:02:40.730> only<00:02:40.940> difference<00:02:41.360> could<00:02:41.720> be<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.200> fire

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
the only difference could be the fire

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.680 
the only difference could be the fire
rate<00:02:42.770> but<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.370> am<00:02:43.490> not<00:02:43.670> actually<00:02:43.880> sure<00:02:44.360> what

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
rate but I am not actually sure what

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.990 
rate but I am not actually sure what
fire<00:02:45.050> at<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.380> new<00:02:45.470> m4<00:02:45.830> has<00:02:46.100> just<00:02:46.670> because<00:02:46.910> we

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
fire at the new m4 has just because we

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.430 
fire at the new m4 has just because we
don't<00:02:47.240> have<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.510> statistics<00:02:47.660> yet<00:02:48.230> on

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
don't have the statistics yet on

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.800 
don't have the statistics yet on
Wikipedia<00:02:49.130> so<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.790> can't<00:02:50.210> really<00:02:50.360> check<00:02:50.630> that

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
Wikipedia so I can't really check that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.330 
Wikipedia so I can't really check that
information<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.560> don't<00:02:51.830> want<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.130> give<00:02:52.250> you

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
information I don't want to give you

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.360 
information I don't want to give you
guys<00:02:52.520> some<00:02:52.760> false<00:02:53.030> information<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.500> but<00:02:55.250> in

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
guys some false information so but in

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.400 
guys some false information so but in
terms<00:02:55.610> of<00:02:55.790> everything<00:02:55.970> else<00:02:56.420> besides<00:02:57.050> fire

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
terms of everything else besides fire

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.760 
terms of everything else besides fire
rate<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:58.250> new<00:02:58.370> m4<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:59.060> pretty<00:02:59.330> much<00:02:59.450> identical

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
rate the new m4 is pretty much identical

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.710 
rate the new m4 is pretty much identical
to<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.890> old<00:03:01.070> one<00:03:01.580> but<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.330> only<00:03:02.480> big

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
to the old one but the only big

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.780 
to the old one but the only big
difference<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:03.290> course<00:03:03.350> is<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.920> sounder<00:03:04.520> if

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
difference of course is the sounder if

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.850 
difference of course is the sounder if
you<00:03:05.030> will<00:03:05.300> like<00:03:05.540> silenced<00:03:06.020> weapons<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.680> if

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
you will like silenced weapons and if

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.350 
you will like silenced weapons and if
you<00:03:06.980> like<00:03:07.130> killing<00:03:07.310> enemies<00:03:07.730> with<00:03:07.880> silencers

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
you like killing enemies with silencers

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.050 
you like killing enemies with silencers
sneaky<00:03:09.290> peeky<00:03:09.890> like<00:03:10.100> then<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.940> would

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
sneaky peeky like then you would

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.790 
sneaky peeky like then you would
definitely<00:03:11.330> when<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:11.810> look<00:03:11.989> at<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.200> new<00:03:12.320> m4

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
definitely when I look at the new m4

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.449 
definitely when I look at the new m4
over<00:03:13.520> the<00:03:13.670> old<00:03:13.910> one<00:03:14.209> but<00:03:14.660> otherwise<00:03:15.020> I<00:03:15.620> really

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
over the old one but otherwise I really

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.100 
over the old one but otherwise I really
don't<00:03:16.700> see<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.940> reason<00:03:17.360> why<00:03:17.390> should<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.840> switch

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
don't see a reason why should I switch

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.960 
don't see a reason why should I switch
from<00:03:18.170> all<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:18.770> four<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.580> new<00:03:19.760> one

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
from all that four to the new one

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.360 
from all that four to the new one
because<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.720> damage<00:03:21.020> is<00:03:21.140> identical<00:03:21.830> fire

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
because the damage is identical fire

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.400 
because the damage is identical fire
rate<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.880> guess<00:03:23.239> is<00:03:23.450> identical<00:03:24.050> but<00:03:24.170> I'm<00:03:24.260> not

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
rate I guess is identical but I'm not

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.890 
rate I guess is identical but I'm not
sure<00:03:24.620> about<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.750> everything<00:03:26.750> else

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
sure about that and everything else

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.810 
sure about that and everything else
pretty<00:03:27.410> much<00:03:27.650> identical<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.610> only

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
pretty much identical to the only

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.270 
pretty much identical to the only
difference<00:03:29.239> is<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.450> silencer<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.200> also<00:03:30.920> the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
difference is the silencer and also the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.270 
difference is the silencer and also the
new<00:03:31.520> m4<00:03:31.910> has<00:03:32.120> one<00:03:32.330> very<00:03:32.690> big<00:03:33.020> disadvantage<00:03:33.470> and

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
new m4 has one very big disadvantage and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.360 
new m4 has one very big disadvantage and
is<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.180> magazine<00:03:35.600> size<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.050> only<00:03:36.230> 20<00:03:36.830> rounds

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
is the magazine size it's only 20 rounds

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.280 
is the magazine size it's only 20 rounds
I<00:03:37.459> found<00:03:38.000> myself<00:03:38.209> spraying<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:38.900> weapon<00:03:39.230> a

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
I found myself spraying this weapon a

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.500 
I found myself spraying this weapon a
lot<00:03:39.500> on<00:03:39.680> close<00:03:39.920> range<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.489> that's<00:03:41.120> where<00:03:41.390> the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
lot on close range and that's where the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.120 
lot on close range and that's where the
spraying<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.110> whole<00:03:42.350> magazine<00:03:42.620> and

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
spraying of the whole magazine and

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.190 
spraying of the whole magazine and
somehow<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.239> need<00:03:44.300> to<00:03:44.540> switch<00:03:44.720> my<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.080> my

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
somehow I need to switch my to my

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.530 
somehow I need to switch my to my
secondary<00:03:45.709> and

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
secondary and

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.350 
secondary and
I<00:03:46.599> find<00:03:47.200> myself<00:03:47.379> just<00:03:47.709> needing<00:03:48.610> more<00:03:48.879> bullets

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
I find myself just needing more bullets

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.690 
I find myself just needing more bullets
for<00:03:49.540> this<00:03:49.689> weapon<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.560> this<00:03:50.859> is<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.159> biggest

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
for this weapon so this is the biggest

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.209 
for this weapon so this is the biggest
disadvantage<00:03:52.450> this<00:03:52.810> weapon<00:03:53.290> has<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:54.040> if<00:03:54.129> you

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:54.219 
disadvantage this weapon has and if you

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.179 
disadvantage this weapon has and if you
guys<00:03:54.400> are<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.909> sprite<00:03:55.390> kind<00:03:55.689> of<00:03:55.810> people<00:03:56.200> the

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
guys are the sprite kind of people the

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:59.819 
guys are the sprite kind of people the
people<00:03:57.370> who<00:03:57.640> just<00:03:58.120> want<00:03:58.719> to<00:03:58.810> get<00:03:59.019> on

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
people who just want to get on

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.099 
people who just want to get on
close-range<00:04:00.609> gunfights<00:04:01.209> with<00:04:01.480> their<00:04:01.750> assault

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
close-range gunfights with their assault

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.830 
close-range gunfights with their assault
rifles<00:04:02.590> then<00:04:02.829> I<00:04:03.329> don't<00:04:04.329> think<00:04:04.390> this<00:04:04.569> is<00:04:04.720> the

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
rifles then I don't think this is the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.289 
rifles then I don't think this is the
right<00:04:04.959> gun<00:04:05.230> for<00:04:05.409> you<00:04:05.530> i<00:04:05.739> really<00:04:06.400> suggest<00:04:06.700> going

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
right gun for you i really suggest going

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.440 
right gun for you i really suggest going
and<00:04:07.629> switching<00:04:08.470> back<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.859> all<00:04:09.069> them<00:04:09.310> for<00:04:09.579> just

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
and switching back to all them for just

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.660 
and switching back to all them for just
because<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:10.900> gun<00:04:11.170> has<00:04:11.409> a<00:04:11.439> very<00:04:11.829> very<00:04:12.310> low

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
because this gun has a very very low

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.089 
because this gun has a very very low
magazine<00:04:13.180> size<00:04:13.420> but<00:04:14.290> at<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.680> end<00:04:14.859> of<00:04:14.980> the

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
magazine size but at the end of the

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.699 
magazine size but at the end of the
video<00:04:15.370> we<00:04:16.299> can<00:04:16.539> conclude<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:17.079> both<00:04:17.470> efforts

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
video we can conclude that both efforts

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.460 
video we can conclude that both efforts
are<00:04:18.100> very<00:04:18.669> very<00:04:19.030> similar<00:04:19.509> the<00:04:19.720> new<00:04:19.870> one<00:04:20.079> that

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
are very very similar the new one that

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.990 
are very very similar the new one that
pretty<00:04:20.650> much<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.919> only<00:04:20.949> difference<00:04:21.639> is<00:04:21.849> the

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
pretty much the only difference is the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.040 
pretty much the only difference is the
silencer<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:22.930> possibly<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.830> fire<00:04:24.099> rate<00:04:24.430> but

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
silencer and possibly the fire rate but

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.469 
silencer and possibly the fire rate but
do<00:04:26.050> i<00:04:26.080> prefer<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.650> new<00:04:26.830> m4<00:04:27.220> over<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:27.820> old<00:04:28.060> one

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
do i prefer the new m4 over the old one

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.260 
do i prefer the new m4 over the old one
I<00:04:28.509> definitely<00:04:29.259> don't<00:04:29.800> just<00:04:30.460> because<00:04:30.759> of<00:04:30.940> that

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
I definitely don't just because of that

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.240 
I definitely don't just because of that
magazine<00:04:31.539> size<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.349> just<00:04:32.889> can't<00:04:33.130> imagine

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
magazine size I just can't imagine

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.460 
magazine size I just can't imagine
myself<00:04:33.639> playing<00:04:34.120> through<00:04:34.419> a<00:04:34.449> full<00:04:34.960> round

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
myself playing through a full round

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.300 
myself playing through a full round
using<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.430> 20<00:04:36.880> round<00:04:36.910> assault<00:04:37.780> rifle<00:04:38.289> man<00:04:38.860> that

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
using a 20 round assault rifle man that

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.980 
using a 20 round assault rifle man that
is<00:04:39.460> something<00:04:39.910> wrong<00:04:40.180> with<00:04:40.360> this<00:04:40.539> gun<00:04:40.780> I

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
is something wrong with this gun I

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.659 
is something wrong with this gun I
really<00:04:41.380> don't<00:04:41.590> understand<00:04:42.009> how<00:04:42.070> people<00:04:42.220> are

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
really don't understand how people are

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.790 
really don't understand how people are
gonna<00:04:42.820> use<00:04:43.120> this<00:04:43.300> I<00:04:43.509> think<00:04:44.199> with<00:04:44.349> time<00:04:44.380> people

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
gonna use this I think with time people

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.499 
gonna use this I think with time people
are<00:04:45.190> gonna<00:04:45.580> say<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:45.849> this<00:04:46.150> gun<00:04:46.330> is

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
are gonna say that this gun is

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.629 
are gonna say that this gun is
underpowered<00:04:47.229> just<00:04:47.620> because<00:04:47.889> of<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.370> low

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
underpowered just because of the low

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.240 
underpowered just because of the low
magazine<00:04:49.539> size<00:04:49.840> of<00:04:50.199> course<00:04:50.500> silencer<00:04:50.979> would

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
magazine size of course silencer would

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.339 
magazine size of course silencer would
benefit<00:04:51.760> me<00:04:51.940> on<00:04:52.180> many<00:04:52.780> different<00:04:52.990> situations

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
benefit me on many different situations

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.310 
benefit me on many different situations
but<00:04:54.340> it's<00:04:54.550> not<00:04:54.789> worth<00:04:55.270> sacrificing<00:04:55.690> the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
but it's not worth sacrificing the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.830 
but it's not worth sacrificing the
magazine<00:04:56.740> size<00:04:56.949> for<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.639> silencer<00:04:58.180> at<00:04:58.599> least

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
magazine size for the silencer at least

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.409 
magazine size for the silencer at least
that's<00:04:59.050> my<00:04:59.139> own<00:04:59.349> opinion<00:04:59.669> anyway<00:05:00.669> guys<00:05:00.849> I<00:05:01.120> will

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
that's my own opinion anyway guys I will

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.210 
that's my own opinion anyway guys I will
be<00:05:01.449> playing<00:05:01.840> around<00:05:01.990> with<00:05:02.349> the<00:05:02.500> new<00:05:02.620> m4<00:05:03.010> for

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
be playing around with the new m4 for

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.420 
be playing around with the new m4 for
quite<00:05:03.400> some<00:05:03.580> time<00:05:03.820> but<00:05:04.449> I<00:05:04.870> ultimately<00:05:05.710> prefer

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
quite some time but I ultimately prefer
