 your attention a rehabilitation center 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.050
 the social work does not offer us that but 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.330
 I am grateful to such a place so much 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.180
 nurses like doctors because 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.180
 everything is treated with affection and that affection 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.470
 it's like who only helps every day 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.470
 a little more 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.370
 how moving is the good story 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.680
 away from fiction and unexpectedly 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.300
 guillermo francella was transformed into a 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.159
 really major actor in the story 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.869
 real real life more life than ever 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.130
 it's not that your work your legacy 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.590
 television what we see every day 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.080
 contributed to kenzo progressively 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.630
 recover basic movements the mood in 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.070
 this case was the maximum engine your stress 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.680
 that you can not leave a record and 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.420
 then pour in Guillermo lands 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.950
 francella here the actor who gave him back 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.620
 the smile see 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.920
 I always loved everything related to 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.650
 humor all that is comedy and I give myself 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.099
 permanent account which way and you see that 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.950
 in the other the smile consoled to see me or 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.349
 be that one knows what can cause 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.660
 knows that there were many years ago this 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.680
 complicity with the viewer 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.690
 this thing as they rescue he does not 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.860
 I need to talk about what 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.400
 gestual laughs 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.400
 bolt 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.590
 recover a wonderful sense without a doubt 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.430
 some guillermo this hope that 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.239
 that's improving from seeing you from 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.810
 your looks accomplices but of course clear 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.330
 it's more I need you the breath of the world 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.430
 the family all in verbal form or the 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.230
 notes I know there are now a lot of 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.130
 journalists watching wanting to see him 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.110
 see it 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.420
 and I am now in the middle of shooting a 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.460
 movie but I feel like a little while 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.370
 make me and be able to visit him 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.460
 I would love to love it because I'm 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.200
 very sad because because he talked about that 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.690
 I did not want to disappoint you more 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.120
 family some guy his age 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.420
 reaches that extreme that what happened to him 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.370
 the head of wanting to commit suicide by 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.440
 what about feeling that the family is 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.510
 disappointed with him but meanwhile 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.840
 you have the camera if you want to make a 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.819
 gesture nothing tense 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.730
 They told me you 're a little better 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.460
 that you laugh a little with me or pretty 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.840
 good 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:54.680
 I fill myself full of love all this 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.470
 what is happening to you fight the fight the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.320
 what is worth 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.960
 What did you do? 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.550
 something your family will wonder if you 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.160
 you want to recover and you said yes 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.520
 a gesture I wish it with the soul with the 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.490
 heart and I love that you have fun 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.170
 I will try to see you personally and 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.170
 they see their beloved the best for you 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.540
 if you can hear us if someone tells you 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.070
 can you transmit you have a second 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.890
 opportunity and surely you will be able to 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.570
 seize definitely and franche 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.160
 what can we expect from Guillermo nothing 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.200
 an exceptional being so surely 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.810
 are going to find and of course yes that the 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.300
 smile heals that humor helps to live 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.550
 better to save life and to complete it the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.380
 consecrated actor william francella 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.690
 because he was looking at him in a program 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.780
 of television when enzo smiled 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.800
 bewildering doctors and specialists 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.610
 showing signs of a possible 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.610
 recovery I am very happy that there is 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.670
 had the reaction that was in shape 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.380
 vegetative and now it 's 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:03.639
 with certain reflexes and I laugh a lot 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.189
 I obviously get excited 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.990
 now the doctors and their psychologist 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.819
 consider that looking at the problems of 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.009
 humor and especially those of franch was 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.629
 would be key to recovery 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:17.379
 of the young man but he started in the 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:20.259
 santojanni where they did not give much 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:23.199
 life time they always said no 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.460
 I was going back that I was never going to go 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.949
 ahead 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.280
 after the social work sent us to a 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:33.520
 geriatric and good geriatric 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.430
 ended very badly ended up getting a 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.150
 bacteria came with a lot of fever to this 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.990
 place ideas carlos took forward 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.729
 first that doctors nurses 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:50.199
 everything is treated with love to him and he 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:53.710
 feels comfortable here and good the 3 today 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:56.289
 TV and the program that you put on that 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.990
 franche we put the change 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.479
 riding visibly excited by the 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.849
 reach of his characters the actor 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.880
 He sent a message to enzo who wants 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:09.460
 know soon that dear nothing 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.540

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.660
 that can recover you 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.520
 to be with us again 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.580
 fascinates you can return some of 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.350
 joy that you had lost and that you 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.370

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.569
 but that you come back with us 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.759
 I have much hope so be it 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:34.260
 and you will achieve it I am sure I am young 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:36.560
