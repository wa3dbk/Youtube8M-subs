00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.430
 hello friends let's now make a 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.880
 program in java that allows us to order 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.810
 upward 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.440
 descending mind three numbers 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.050
 entered by keyboards we go to our 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.860
 ahmed links I already bring you the code as 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.590
 always now let's give it a little 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.630
 review so that you have it clear and 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.960
 also if they do not understand it in 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.970
 this part of the video can they 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.710
 visit it you can visit the blog the 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.670
 Facebook page where you 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.670
 find the book code 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.299
 the basics we already declare our 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.729
 public and the public that tati what main 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.040
 let's declare variable integers 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.799
 whole bird and I know we 're going to 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.830
 serve for the first three numbers 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.149
 let's find out where the higher number is 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.880
 let's find out where the term is 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.040
 medium and which is the least for this 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.780
 way to order them up or 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.540
 descending mind as is our 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.330
 need 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.460
 now the scanner declares it with the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.860
 variable reader without forgetting 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.250
 import the bookstore is meat 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.530
 with a system auto and nine we put dice 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.509
 three numbers return all three in order 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.640
 ascending in this case we will make 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.070
 in ascending order 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.130
 from minor to major with a system 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.430
 priceline where you ask us for the first 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.220
 number with the variable ay with the reader 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.650
 maximum point to ask us the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.190
 first variable then equal with the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.110
 number two and with the number 13 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.670
 and there we simply do 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.250
 simple operations to be able 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.340
 and directly capture the largest number 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.380
 and the smaller number of the three numbers 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.110
 then we can simply join that 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.030
 give us the conditions that is greater 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.650
 aby is also older 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.730
 simply the biggest one is going to be 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.880
 otherwise directly if b is 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.000
 greater and greater makes the greater will be b 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.150
 obviously and if none of 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.239
 these two conditions the biggest will be zero 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.810
 in this way we give you the variable 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.420
 we're going to give you now it looks 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.370
 correspond 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.750
 then to find the minor always 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.140
 we will simply put the conditions at 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.290
 reverse and we put that there is lower abya 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.799
 minor does in this case the minor would be 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.890
 otherwise it will be less 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.510
 and smaller so then the minor will be 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.819
 if none of these two is met 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.550
 conditions simply the least sentence 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.660
 for the average, it is calculated 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.810
 directly making the sum of the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.930
 three numbers entered minus the sum 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.150
 of the greater number plus the smaller number of 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.200
 this way the average term is calculated 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.440
 rather said that it would be the one that 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.010
 there is a bigger good member of this 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.440
 shape let's calculate it then the one 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.709
 go in the middle is going to be equal to more than 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.360
 more than as I told them less the sum 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:46.550
 of the largest number and the least gay number 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.200
 then we make a print system for 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.959
 to be able to give a space and ordered like this 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.670
 prime system and we put the order 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.489
 ascending of the entered numbers is 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.930
 and we simply put the variables that 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:03.300
 we have less more but it is a space 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.150
 medium in greater 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.280
 and we execute it 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.530
 and let's see let's enter three 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.530
 numbers three random numbers 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.959
 and we can see that the ascending order of 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.389
 the numbers entered is 2 5 and 8 for 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.330
 any for any amount of 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.310
 numbers 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.610
 we enter will give us the 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.520
 exact order now if we want to lower 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.870
 from major to minor or descending 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.689
 we just have to change him 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:42.000
 here this greater would have to be first 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:44.960
 and the first one would have to be last 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.960
 and in this way 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.280
 in this way we would be orderly 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.300
 of descending mind the results of the 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.900
 new we enter three numbers 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.240
 and we have the order of the descending 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.580
 three numbers that we have entered 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.210
 waiting for you to have served them 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.849
 forget to visit the facebook blog 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.949
 also that there is the the 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.990
 source code if they do not understand it 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.030
 do not forget to comment like 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.000
 subscribe so they can have access 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.509
 to more videos of this type and solving 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.860
 your problems in java good that has been 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.860
 everything and until next time
