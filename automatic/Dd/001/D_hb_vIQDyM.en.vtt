that<00:00:35.010> are<00:00:37.050> stabilizing<00:00:38.050> earth<00:00:38.820> as<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:41.200> know

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
that are stabilizing earth as you know

that are stabilizing earth as you know
the<00:00:41.649> population<00:00:41.890> on<00:00:42.579> earth<00:00:42.610> is<00:00:43.120> grown<00:00:44.050> and<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
the population on earth is grown and it

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.540 
the population on earth is grown and it
will<00:00:45.579> continue<00:00:45.699> to<00:00:46.089> do<00:00:46.359> so<00:00:46.629> I<00:00:47.190> want<00:00:48.190> you<00:00:48.399> to

will continue to do so I want you to

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.739 
will continue to do so I want you to
know<00:00:48.609> that<00:00:50.339> there<00:00:51.339> is<00:00:51.489> no<00:00:51.730> great<00:00:51.999> danger<00:00:52.600> on

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
know that there is no great danger on

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:55.139 
know that there is no great danger on
the<00:00:53.079> basis<00:00:53.589> of<00:00:53.800> numbers<00:00:54.309> though<00:00:54.579> it<00:00:54.760> seems

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
the basis of numbers though it seems

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.430 
the basis of numbers though it seems
that<00:00:55.960> there<00:00:56.199> is<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.420> situation<00:00:58.719> is<00:00:59.499> this

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that there is the situation is this

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.829 
that there is the situation is this
within<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.620> next<00:01:02.829> 20<00:01:03.339> years<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.600> population

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
within the next 20 years the population

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.760 
within the next 20 years the population
will<00:01:05.740> gradually<00:01:06.550> very<00:01:07.300> gradually<00:01:07.770> very

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
will gradually very gradually very

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.060 
will gradually very gradually very
gently<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.520> benevolently<00:01:10.890> begin<00:01:11.890> to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
gently and benevolently begin to

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.360 
gently and benevolently begin to
decrease<00:01:12.550> on<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.420> basis<00:01:14.020> of<00:01:14.200> reduced<00:01:14.890> birth

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
decrease on the basis of reduced birth

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.730 
decrease on the basis of reduced birth
rates<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.860> no<00:01:18.189> other<00:01:18.219> reason<00:01:18.579> I<00:01:19.740> know

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
rates and for no other reason I know

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.100 
rates and for no other reason I know
that<00:01:21.070> there's<00:01:21.729> been<00:01:21.939> some<00:01:22.210> predictions<00:01:22.840> by

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
that there's been some predictions by

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.749 
that there's been some predictions by
others<00:01:23.579> well<00:01:24.579> intended<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:26.460> suggests<00:01:27.460> that

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
others well intended that suggests that

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.420 
others well intended that suggests that
the<00:01:28.390> population<00:01:29.020> will<00:01:29.409> be<00:01:29.560> reduced<00:01:30.009> due<00:01:30.280> to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
the population will be reduced due to

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.730 
the population will be reduced due to
some<00:01:30.700> catastrophes<00:01:31.630> but<00:01:31.930> that<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.289> not<00:01:32.680> the

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
some catastrophes but that is not the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.719 
some catastrophes but that is not the
case<00:01:33.399> Oh<00:01:33.789> certainly<00:01:34.780> there'll<00:01:35.619> be<00:01:35.710> storms<00:01:36.490> and

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
case Oh certainly there'll be storms and

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.399 
case Oh certainly there'll be storms and
earthquakes<00:01:36.909> just<00:01:37.600> like<00:01:37.810> always<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:39.250> nothing

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
earthquakes just like always but nothing

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.170 
earthquakes just like always but nothing
greater<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:42.729> what<00:01:43.240> has<00:01:43.420> always<00:01:43.810> been<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.909> I

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
greater then what has always been so I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
leaving the planet before your time you

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.030 
leaving the planet before your time you
know

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
know

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.890 
know
last<00:02:02.040> year<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.549> talked<00:02:02.880> about<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.720> that

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
last year we talked about this and that

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.479 
last year we talked about this and that
and<00:02:03.930> many<00:02:04.380> things<00:02:04.970> for<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.090> yeoeun<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.869> lien

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
and many things for the yeoeun a lien

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:15.830 
and many things for the yeoeun a lien
but<00:02:09.470> speaking<00:02:10.470> more<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:12.110> 2009<00:02:14.270> it's<00:02:15.270> important

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
but speaking more to 2009 it's important

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.059 
but speaking more to 2009 it's important
for<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.230> understand<00:02:17.390> only<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:19.800> is

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
for you to understand only that this is

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.490 
for you to understand only that this is
going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.000> first<00:02:21.330> year<00:02:21.989> of<00:02:22.910> many<00:02:23.910> years

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
going to be the first year of many years

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.410 
going to be the first year of many years
when<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.739> will<00:02:25.950> feel<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> sense<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:27.030> stability

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
when you will feel a sense of stability

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.270 
when you will feel a sense of stability
I<00:02:29.780> want<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.019> keep<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.440> mind<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.010> what

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
I want you to keep in mind that what

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.520 
I want you to keep in mind that what
you're<00:02:32.489> feeling<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.030> stability<00:02:33.569> some<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.350> you

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
you're feeling is stability some of you

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.949 
you're feeling is stability some of you
will<00:02:35.160> confuse<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:36.090> with<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.360> feeling<00:02:36.870> of

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
will confuse this with a feeling of

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.110 
will confuse this with a feeling of
being<00:02:37.200> stuck<00:02:38.660> but<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:40.019> not<00:02:40.319> about<00:02:40.620> stuckness

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
being stuck but it's not about stuckness

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.449 
being stuck but it's not about stuckness
okay<00:02:42.230> it's<00:02:43.230> about<00:02:43.470> stability<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:47.220> have

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
okay it's about stability so you have

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.150 
okay it's about stability so you have
four<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.209> six<00:02:48.480> months<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:49.080> look<00:02:49.260> around<00:02:49.560> decide

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
four to six months to look around decide

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.680 
four to six months to look around decide
whether<00:02:50.690> you're<00:02:51.690> happy<00:02:52.200> with<00:02:52.590> your<00:02:52.769> job<00:02:53.069> if
