00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.000
 episode of the d Indian then if you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.359
 have watched before the video on flapi 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 stern 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.840
 not that I released my first hope 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.920
 where I actually explain to you that this 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.540
 week his letter we can eventually we go 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.099
 to be interested in the phenomenon flapi birds 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.990
 is rather what he spawned because 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.090
 flapi butter of itself 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.910
 I have nothing to worry about 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.750
 these games after hell animate the game 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.000
 so we will talk about three games 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.500
 different who are in the vein flying 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.400
 birds 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.930
 as I tell you also I do not 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.070
 I'm not interested in history 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.720
 happened around them why the game 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.040
 was removed I stamp it on the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.390
 coquillard as it's not allowed a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.309
 force so much that the cairo is done in 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.540
 two but we're going to look at the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.219
 other things so in the first Monday 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.930
 said I showed you flattered beautiful game 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.980
 created by paca with a generator that 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 allows you to do your own 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.960
 Flapi own birds is this time 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.520
 we will be interested in you know I like 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 talk often about jams actually 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.090
 competitions we can create the games 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.360
 like the wolf doom dr or the global game 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.980
 jam 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.210
 there we will be interested in a jam that 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.500
 is called the hijab flop or people 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.120
 had to create their own version 9 the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.219
 pub order is so today we're going 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.870
 try flipboard game that has been shown 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.460
 get on indie games actually this is where 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.530
 I learned about the existence of the hijab flap 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.790
 is why I was talking to you tulle in 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.200
 particular well just because 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.130
 that it is beautiful that is to say that the guy has 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.150
 makes an effort 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.770
 and again it's a trial version and 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.880
 his writings to chew not if you see one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.880
 will start playing against that 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:21.720
 this one is the hardest I find from 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.159
 flapi byrne themed games will say this 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.540
 what is the inertia of patients with 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.530
 the bird must be done it's not 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.369
 that we flatter and where I told you 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 it was super nervous 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.299
 that's where flapi buckle it was great 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.479
 nervous of the blow I could go very 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.710
 far 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.710
 quite easily unhappiness am here because 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.420
 that I think it's just gorgeous 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.590
 what I do not know how he did this 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.110
 effect this paper effect this scrolling 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.890
 like that a little rounded that gives 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.420
 really feel like seeing a 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.979
 paper version but I find it 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.280
 beautiful I came to talk about it because 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.020
 that still happen to make a 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.299
 hibberd flap emulation like that and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.170
 make it the guy said to himself what is that 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.649
 I intend to make the game more 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.869
 interesting 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.570
 he did his own to his graphics 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.500
 particular universe I find he has 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:13.790
 fucking done by paid during so that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.990
 your shit because it's always good 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.490
 I find it beautiful the screen 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.720
 more home with cardboard and all that 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.720
 I think it's really good school 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.840
 I do not know anything about design 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.910
 of video games I do not know how he has 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.470
 did if he took pictures of two 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.820
 real decors cardboard cap and cap a 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.350
 sort of scroll or flash or what 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.240
 but it's pretty 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:42.980
 So congratulations sir before the effects 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:46.940
 shaded if they 're cool so that was 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.140
 my best score is actually four in 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.980
 fact have to play a little with death must 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.420
 really reach the last moment 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.480
 before I jump here I touched 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.480
 in hindsight it was the cessation of worship 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.019
 is there it's hard to have because she 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.470
 and would have burnt there is the shadow that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:12.440
 suggest that the pipe is there I did 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:18.890
 my worst score I did zero there he has 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:21.170
 been nice on the xbox and here I have 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.340
 the impression that what to do then on 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.570
 so I of course did not arrive 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.709
 because you saw that my best 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.019
 score it was 4 but that's it 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.190
 speed up the game on get in games there 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.510
 same message like what is a beautiful 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.150
 surprise when you arrive at 30 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.260
 so of course I saw that I have two 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.360
 left hands and that I am right-handed 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.560
 of course I'll never get to that score 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.870
 miraculous but if you ever have to 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.610
 you get there pardon do not hesitate to 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.810

 cheats do not tell me I did 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.269
 three and a half million 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:04:00.700

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.810

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.950
 let's do a fail it's hot then 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:18.949
 I feel like it's going a little bit 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:23.900
 faster at the cutter yeah okay 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:25.220
 what are they how did I do 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.130
 to go as far as I explained 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.150
 me that please I know 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.380
 absolutely not how did I do to 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.669
 to do 27 months because that was 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.620
 really absolute panic I just 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:42.949
 looked at the decor of the nets what and 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.270
 wednesday is actually it's suddenly more 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.440
 interesting because it's happening 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.699
 and I would like to know what is 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.160
 happens after suddenly it gives 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.090
 interests at stake 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.259
 so you see what is already there 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.880
 digs your head deep inside 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.530
 much more than flapi butter 4 years 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.610
 I was millions and again I am even 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.180
 not sure if it was not free flyff 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.380
 birds but here is what they had 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.570
 rewards of a flop of hours of 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.280
 signal say it in the comments 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.909
 what i do not know i 'm not happy 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.900
 I'm not interested in it 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.360
 now I am curious to know this 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.050
 happens when we dig deeper 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.270
 and shit 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.100

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.640
 you managed a nice thing happened to 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.820
 make this concept of faye game 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.390
 the absolute interesting is not easy and 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.030
 managed and constraints we persevere in 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.050
 back do something but also 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.270
 like your stern father that we can not 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.500
 drink I leave you on this joke I 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.850
 will try to do a little more my 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.440
 new high score 27 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.440
 I know that we are tending right there for the shot 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.360
 I am very well played the shot 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:06:04.340
 he was super nice on lightbox 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:06.890
 again that's why I have 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.420
 missed the speed bonus there no go 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.620
 a little last time we see this 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.900
 that it gives I warned you to 6 to 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.730
 dien you are very short but the concepts 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.120
 of these games there its still a 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.050
 times the kaka game cdc does that these games 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.490
 peanuts we say go this is the 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.630
 last pair does not at all and 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.630
 after we take ten kilos he is alone 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.290
 it's the depressive side of onia 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.620
 benefits feel so lonely without the 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.620
 music too 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.210

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.590
 myself do not hesitate to the assembly and 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:51.170
 to put it in your own on the 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:52.460
 bieber is not very hard when we 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.580
