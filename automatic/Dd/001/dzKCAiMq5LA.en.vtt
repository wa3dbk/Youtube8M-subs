00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
process behind this I think that there

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.690 
process behind this I think that there
are<00:01:16.530> multiple<00:01:16.770> ways<00:01:17.070> getting<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:17.520> of

are multiple ways getting out of

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.160 
are multiple ways getting out of
conversation<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:18.360> there<00:01:18.540> are<00:01:18.659> very<00:01:18.990> few

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
conversation but there are very few

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.800 
conversation but there are very few
reasons<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.159> alright<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> next<00:01:21.030> time<00:01:21.330> you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
reason and that's unfortunate it'd be

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.149 
reason and that's unfortunate it'd be
nice<00:02:04.170> if<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.409> could<00:02:04.469> all<00:02:04.649> live<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.009> world

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
nice if we could all live in a world

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.740 
nice if we could all live in a world
where<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.549> could<00:02:05.670> take<00:02:05.820> people<00:02:05.969> as<00:02:06.299> they<00:02:06.540> are

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
where we could take people as they are

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.480 
where we could take people as they are
but<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.530> can't

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
but we can't

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.580 
but we can't
rarely<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.240> fact<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.780> would<00:02:09.960> venture<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.350> say

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
rarely in fact I would venture to say

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.850 
rarely in fact I would venture to say
that<00:02:11.210> everyone<00:02:12.210> are<00:02:12.840> just<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.230> bunch<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.560> like

people and that's unfortunate it's not
somebody's<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.900> reason<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.560> we

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
somebody's the reason that we

unfortunately and this this is like like
harkens<00:02:44.610> back<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.030> days<00:02:45.150> when<00:02:45.510> we<00:02:45.540> used<00:02:45.660> to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
harkens back to the days when we used to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.690 
harkens back to the days when we used to
stereotype<00:02:46.440> everything<00:02:47.040> because<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.580> don't

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
stereotype everything because I don't

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.210 
stereotype everything because I don't
know<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:47.910> noticed<00:02:48.180> we<00:02:48.300> started<00:02:48.750> off

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
know if you noticed we started off

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.040 
know if you noticed we started off
stereotyping<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:51.030> kind<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.810> it's

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
stereotyping like it's kind of like it's

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.930 
stereotyping like it's kind of like it's
how<00:02:52.230> our<00:02:52.530> brains<00:02:52.860> function<00:02:53.490> we<00:02:53.610> started

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
how our brains function we started

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.600 
how our brains function we started
stereotyping<00:02:54.690> food<00:02:55.170> as<00:02:55.470> nourishing<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.460> we

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
stereotyping food as nourishing and we

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.880 
stereotyping food as nourishing and we
stereotype<00:02:56.850> bears<00:02:57.510> as<00:02:57.810> dangerous<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.830> it

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
stereotype bears as dangerous and it

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.280 
stereotype bears as dangerous and it
kind<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.280> got<00:02:59.460> us<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.790> where<00:02:59.820> we<00:03:00.060> are<00:03:00.290> so

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
kind of got us to where we are so

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.170 
kind of got us to where we are so
unfortunately<00:03:02.070> it's<00:03:02.340> functioned<00:03:02.850> in<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.000> way

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
unfortunately it's functioned in a way

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.090 
unfortunately it's functioned in a way
that<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.080> ingrained<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.710> us<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:04.980> it's

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
that it's so ingrained in us that it's

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.410 
that it's so ingrained in us that it's
hard<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.490> like<00:03:05.610> step<00:03:05.820> away<00:03:05.970> from<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.390> so

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
hard to like step away from it so

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.840 
hard to like step away from it so
