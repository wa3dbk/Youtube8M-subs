Blues<00:03:17.010> maybe<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:19.620> light<00:03:19.860> blue<00:03:20.190> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
Blues maybe the light blue the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.430 
Blues maybe the light blue the
chartreuse<00:03:22.140> color<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.860> lime<00:03:23.730> green<00:03:24.030> color<00:03:24.440> so

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
chartreuse color the lime green color so

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.260 
chartreuse color the lime green color so
