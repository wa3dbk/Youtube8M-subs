00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
this mass so i'll put the link below for

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.700 
this mass so i'll put the link below for
where<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> got<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.539> from<00:00:45.899> online<00:00:46.200> these

where I got this one from online these
were<00:00:46.980> quite<00:00:47.280> expensive<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.239> they<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.110> have

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
detail is going to come up in this and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.230 
detail is going to come up in this and
you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> little<00:01:16.890> feathers<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.000> side

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
you have the little feathers on the side

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.480 
you have the little feathers on the side
and<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.290> glitter<00:01:19.619> around<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.070> outside

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
and then the glitter around the outside

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.700 
and then the glitter around the outside
and<00:01:20.820> then<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.270> tied<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.960> round<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> back<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and then I tied this round the back of

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.179 
and then I tied this round the back of
my<00:01:22.740> head<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.689> little<00:01:25.500> bow<00:01:25.830> at

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
my head if you can see a little bow at

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.980 
my head if you can see a little bow at
the<00:01:26.220> back<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.570> probably<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:27.960> very

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the back and it's probably not very

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.219 
the back and it's probably not very
neatly<00:01:28.380> delicate<00:01:28.860> moment<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.659> tied<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
neatly delicate moment so I tied that

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.899 
neatly delicate moment so I tied that
with<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> bow<00:01:31.829> around<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.189> back<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.729> have

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
with a bow around the back you do have

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.730 
with a bow around the back you do have
the<00:01:32.970> option<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.509> having<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> stick<00:01:34.470> as

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the option of having it on the stick as

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.069 
the option of having it on the stick as
well<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.909> honest<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.390> lose<00:01:36.780> everything

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
well but to be honest I lose everything

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.249 
well but to be honest I lose everything
anyway<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.579> thought<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.240> best<00:01:39.600> tie<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:39.960> on

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
anyway so I thought I best tie this on

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.380 
anyway so I thought I best tie this on
to<00:01:40.439> my<00:01:40.470> head<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.549> can't<00:01:41.880> lose<00:01:42.150> it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
to my head so that I can't lose it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.200 
to my head so that I can't lose it
anywhere<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.920> didn't<00:01:44.280> go<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.610> stick<00:01:44.909> if

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
anywhere so I didn't go for the stick if

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.490 
anywhere so I didn't go for the stick if
you<00:01:45.450> don't<00:01:45.659> want<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:45.899> your<00:01:46.049> face<00:01:46.200> all<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.470> time

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
you don't want on your face all the time

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.230 
you don't want on your face all the time
obviously<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.549> one<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.880> stick<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
obviously go for one with the stick and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.880 
obviously go for one with the stick and
then<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.630> take<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.960> off<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> just

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
