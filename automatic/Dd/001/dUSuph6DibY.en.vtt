00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.700
 [Music] 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.700
 [Applause] 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.260
 hello how about youtube friends I hope 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.700
 that they are very well the day and 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.320
 let's see four new games that 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.580
 they are pretty good and also very 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.320
 recommended for you to try them is 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.029
 then cultivating and so good 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.070
 we start with the program that is called 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.810
 sky word in this case we have a game 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.820
 very much what is Monument Valley 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.439
 many people met him at stake very 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.529
 classic strategy pretty pretty 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.540
 good in which then we here 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.100
 we have two modes we give for example to 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.829
 classism in this case then what 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.059
 we find for example the same 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.550
 graphics that we found from manuel voley 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.750
 we have here in a kind 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.260
 well here we have what is the part 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.260
 of the number that can be the score 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.280
 not so good in that mission here is 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.320
 for example to be going up there is a 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.999
 Circulito South then we have to give 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.739
 late on the screen since we have to 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.510
 to do is to go climbing then regret 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.460
 some obstacles for example there 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.679
 we scale now with the azulito ay 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.109
 we climb there, we climb there, we climb 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.150
 we scale we do not have to wait and we go 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.090
 downloading clear if we wait much 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.790
 life more than one lap then what 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.250
 is going to happen is that it goes to the little ball 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.390
 will end and we will not be able to play 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.140
 well we are again with full and a 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.700
 very game 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.950
 As you can see we have the screen as 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.750
 if we're going to give the play and puts 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.760
 commissions with our character you can 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.650
 go destroying these Nazis that we see 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.450
 over here and we have different bonuses 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.520
 with all the games one is making a 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.229
 a little bit more complicated is done a bit 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.300
 monotonous perhaps at the moment that 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.890
 We have been playing for a while, we already had 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.080
 so more movements new movements 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.259
 other scenarios, we know that 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.759
 we had fights like this kind of games 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.380
 and it was very cool so it belongs 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.020
 I hope you can enjoy it and like 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.420
 can you see I'm fighting bowling 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.750
 I have my three days up can choose 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.759
 the left side and then the best the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.070
 better personal time but he puts the 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.899
 right because we have a james mode 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.780
 joyce brings a mind to our 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.240
 yeyo warriors let's fight let's go to 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.009
 get our coins so let's go 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.660
 also does from levels in addition to 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.030
 have the opportunity to equipment in 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.920
 different scenarios x and themes I'm use 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.380
 In the jungle, I have to go to the store. 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.060
 buying then things medals and some 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.260
 items to improve so we're going to 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.640
 fight here a little bit so we achieve 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.069
 we're going here 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.840
 start louis then say for example 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.680
 the face 20 enemies good here we have 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.300
 that defeat 20 friends that's our 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.950
 our our return is good in that 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.300
 we do all and we go if we need 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.450
 for real we can in the different 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.450
 hits 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.500
 and one very entertaining pretty good 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.569
 after fighting and also from 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.450
 money all this subject that then they 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:54.370
 I liked many of you but I did not 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.420
 are left 90 percent is called james played 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.830
 very entertaining 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.500
 the very simple second subject that 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.030
 we have this herat block and we're going to 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.920
 give it play and then we have to do 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.330
 climbing not for example climbing going 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.000
 level up every time we have 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.260
 the obstacle is going we're going to go 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.180
 going up as you can see if for example 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.610
 I have an obstacle in any step 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.650
 they will reach only half of the gelatin 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.970
 then it will be doing much more 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.380
 small or it's going to be that when it's over 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.150
 the jelly because we lose another by 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.790
 example if the whole step there by 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.930
 example does a little piece there not long 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.720
 reaches to pass then the game 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.489
 entertaining and we passed it full 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.560
 there we already spent almost complete castling a 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.790
 little bit of final overflow there nothing 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.739
 reached past then good games 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.810
 this complicated so I also hope 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.610
 that we can enjoy good that 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.590
 we are facing sneijder min game 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.319
 the mythical snake game 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.790
 we found in these screens very bad 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.540
 in terminals with stretches maybe 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.700
 little ones 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.379
 so good the game the theme is 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.000
 the same as we have two points points 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.159
 as for example the controls we are going to 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.299
 see the controls we have the adjustments 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.510
 for the model for example that we have 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.920
 the ipad here we have the tab 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.840
 we have here good to make them lightning 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.879
 let's play with equipped let's put 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.040
 the biggest and good size we are going to 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.720
 play then see why not 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.800
 we have part of the language I'm ready 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.980
 kicks and we give new game 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.180
 so well there it is we go up 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.160
 there it is for the graphics if they are not 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.140
 the same in that time we are taking 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.180
 here and then every time the 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.380
 longer tail and it's also going to go 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.690
 doing we are appearing the 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.470
 obstacles that we are going to prevent 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.150
 let's get to the biggest that is not 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.580
 objective afterwards is going to be the test 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.860
 big here in wrong to do the most 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.470
 big possible our snake and 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.790
 you can also say that I all 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.500
 items that we must collect the food for 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.840
 feed that snake that becomes more 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.310
 big not so good without more 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.020
 dismissal with this 25 games pretty 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.450
 interesting I hope you liked it
