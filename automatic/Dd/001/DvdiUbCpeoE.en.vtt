 recommend you subscribe to the channel 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.570

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.090
 some commercials and wish mikroft 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.840
 he releases them not so often but they 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.220
 very high quality and what we went 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.710
 Hello dear friends with you were 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.149
 kings and today would like to talk that 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.770
 there will be a long-awaited update 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:40.700
 michroft facts cherries version 090 so 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.340
 let's go to the main thing here 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.400
 there will be new options for generating the world yes 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.300
 us it will appear cave generation options 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.520
 option to generate high grass option 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.250
 sizing for the generated world 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.130
 or already generated world of options 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.600
 regenerate generating super plane and 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:05.000
 so let's go now to the mobs before 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.170
 I might add that is the edge of the wanderer 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 enderman will add villagers 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.930
 may be still add 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.070
 Gusta 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.000
 Well, in principle, there may be other mobs 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.000
 like slugs hell slugs and so on 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.530
 so now let's move on to the generation 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.860
 the world we now have caves 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.520
 yes we will have caves worlds will be 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.670
 optionally infinite that is not 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.140
 there will be no limits 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.890
 minecraft you will have infinite peace and 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.210
 so what will we go on as the game 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.259
 the caves will also go to the village like mycroft 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.940
 saw maybe make a portal to hell 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.030
 ok that is sitting on 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.220
 will not do not for the reactor of the mountains and in 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.380
 Basically everything will be fine the same 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.369
 there will be abandoned mines this that is 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.100
 down below 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.440
 from boards here such here with a web there 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.929
 where spawn mobs there chests everywhere 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.000
 such mines will also continue 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.290
 there will be new biomes necessarily new 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.930
 biomes what else will be a bonus 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.299
 and all the volumes are happy and amide from while 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.400
 versions except resource intensive and add 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.569
 some straight exclusive biomes for 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.359
 minecraft poke edishn 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.470
 so now we go to the last part 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:38.989
 add blocks and objects 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:42.030
 different and I donâ€™t know for sure 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.840
 new receipt of items among themselves 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.859
 This I do not really understand what it is but 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.269
 let's still see what 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.859
 the developers started 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:55.200
 and the last is textures separate 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.310
 textures for the top of the logs and 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.099
 different trees 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.889
 This is a big plus change of grass depending 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.959
 from home it was also noticed in 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:07.260
 different biome different grass color 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.609
 grass texture will not change if not 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.120
 updated open gl 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.709
 Well, who knows, he knows, and basically pumpkin 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.859
 you can wear it on your head 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.939

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.569

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.909
