00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.960
 find today so today 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.910
 it's going to be a special recipe 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 for beginners so I'm going to you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.250
 show how to make pancakes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.710
 light pancakes so today I'm going 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.060
 to make my pancakes so without the robot 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.980
 obviously so I'm going to show you a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.529
 little technique to make your pancakes 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
 without lumps with a whip so for 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:41.900
 this recipe you simply need 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.900
 so bazire whip so let's go 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.940
 so at first what are we going 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.470
 make 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:01:01.840
 so I'll get closer so we're going 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:04.210
 just break the eggs so what 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.960
 I do it first is that I take 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.700
 so my vanilla sugar 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.940
 I pour it with I'm going to bleach so 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.830
 the eyes were there so I'm sugar 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.320
 vanilla I made homemade if you 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.520
 want me to give you the recipe you 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.050
 tell me in comment and I will make you 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.860
 the recipe so vanilla sugar is 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.880
 really easy 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:30.729
 so I put the equivalent of 2 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.020
 bag of vanilla sugar and go 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.540
 for elbow grease 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.619
 so me what I do in general is 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.450
 that jacqueline my salad bowl and I'm going 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.640
 show you this side so jacqueline 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.860
 mansas said so and I wish in this 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.860
 meaning there by making big gestures 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:12.340
 slightly is the interest I'm going 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.870
 add my flour 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.820
 so my frozen flour beforehand sieved 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.720
 so I'm walking I work like 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.569
 so I put a tablespoon of 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:36.840
 flour in rain is today 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:40.730
 the salad bowl bee and I wish so 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.730
 you want to review the gesture I'm doing 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.180
 So there is the whipping by d 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.180
 arc 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.480
 it will just allow you 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.720
 to incorporate air into your dough and that 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.780
 will make it lighter so you can 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.849
 so use this advice for all your 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.380
 other inclined preparations always 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:10.230
 your salad bowl and whip a circle 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.750
 you are forced to force it is enough 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.910
 just to make great masters and 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.450
 although back is here so I 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.900
 continue with the same system I put 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.790
 a tablespoon and hop we could 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.560
 put a little more but the fact 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.870
 to gradually get back that's okay 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.230
 avoid having any lumps 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.230
 his family 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.540
 so there when you see that she 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.189
 begins to have the consistency of a 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.569
 pac of a cake dough so she 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.760
 starts to be a little bit thick 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.590
 you can start adding a 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.930
 little bit so you can start 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.730
 to add the liquids will not add 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:21.350
 a little bit of milk to relax the 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:22.849
 dough there and I relax gently 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.780
 so you do this operation of which 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:29.449
 you alternate between liquids and the 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:35.259
 flour until you have so 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:35.259
 totally finished your pancake batter 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.870
 and so that's when you're done 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.639
 to add the milk the consistency 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.310
 look like these and you can 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.310
 so glimpse with miracle that he 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.650
 there are no lumps so now 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:58.720
 you will end up adding so the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.720
 beer you gently add beer 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:06.520
 you stir this time without inclined 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.520
 the salad bowl very slowly 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.510
 and that's the consistency of your 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.580
 dough 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.010
 so the beer will allow your 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.130
 would go on to your pancake batter to be 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.370
 much lighter and she will give a 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.840
 little bit of the road and then add 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.260
 now you can add your to 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.170
 Rome 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.740
 if you can add the dress of the 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.170
 orange rom or orange blossom or 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.500
 to add a little more ben ali 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.580
 you can add them at this stage 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:45.370
 I'll add a little bit of 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:58.630
 rum because we love the band so there I 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:06:01.300
 add a little cap and that's it and 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.370
 so now you 're going to film 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.950
 your salad bowl and you go the m a 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.910
 hour in the refrigerator 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.910
 then you will be able then 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.450
 so one hour in the refrigerator then 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.880
 you will be able to simply so 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.300
 buttered your your stove with a cotton 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.130
 soaked and cook your pancakes 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.650
 so I hope this video will have you 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.910
 more and you'll have to help here I'm you 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.270
 say to you very soon I make you full of 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.270
