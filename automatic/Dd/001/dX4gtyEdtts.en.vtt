00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.360
 today we are going to be more sentimental 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.790
 from normal welcome guys to the top 5 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.110
 saddest moments of the anime 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.110
 pokemon we started 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.380
 everyone knows how hard it was 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.390
 to get his first pokemon but 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.759
 what really complicated was telling him a 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.710
 goodbye forever in the neuro 5 we have 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.900
 the farewell of the toilet free the ass 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.820
 he leaves when he meets his future partner 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.150
 no doubt he is worthy of a position in 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.150
 this top 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.520
 As is this moment, I know that 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.739
 will define this pokemon in one 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.450
 word would be sweetheart because that's what 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.489
 that both had between them in the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.050
 number four we have the rebel char 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.520
 hoist so you realize in this 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 same episode that is one of the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.030
 weaker jackets of the place so 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.129
 that in the end he decides to stay for 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.750
 become stronger a hard blow for us 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.800
 at that time but that would definitely be 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.800
 for good in the future 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.239
 I wanted to have this scene because I 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.280
 It moved a lot and is undoubtedly one of 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.200
 my favorite at number 3 we have the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.630
 farewell to the club with the mesh 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.400
 picacho de ace this scene is special to me 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.500
 because it reflects the great friendship that 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.320
 pokemon can be done without a doubt 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.320
 absolutely absolutely wonderful 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.730
 but more wonderful is this scene 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.010
 in number 2 we have the big farewell 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.880
 of the three main characters of the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.920
 anime 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.020
 mystic and brock say goodbye to their 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.660
 ways to face different challenges 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.510
 in their lives for me there will never be a trio 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.510
 of characters so good in this anime 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.539
 To this scene they have plenty of words in 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.909
 the number 1 guys we have the 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.369
 explosion that turned into stone 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.110
 for a few minutes that moment captivated 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.750
 both the pokemon change is that the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.759
 that made them cry and feel guilty 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.440
 picacho is reluctant to accept death 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.590
 of your partner until suddenly and 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.239
 through her tears as she relived one 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.239

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.890
