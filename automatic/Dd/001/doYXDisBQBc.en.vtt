00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.630 

another<00:00:04.170> one<00:00:04.380> that<00:00:04.410> we<00:00:04.740> particularly<00:00:05.279> liked

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
another one that we particularly liked

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.379 
another one that we particularly liked
on<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.850> flat<00:00:07.069> you<00:00:08.069> know<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.580> Alex<00:00:09.210> load

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
on the flat you know this is a Alex load

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:22.570 
on the flat you know this is a Alex load
of

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.609 

and<00:00:22.789> I<00:00:23.210> think<00:00:23.300> she's<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.750> first<00:00:24.050> one<00:00:24.289> to<00:00:24.349> make

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
and I think she's the first one to make

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:39.530 
and I think she's the first one to make
a<00:00:24.650> circle<00:00:25.099> before<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:25.519> first<00:00:25.699> job

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.510 

I<00:00:39.630> actually<00:00:40.290> didn't<00:00:40.620> mind<00:00:40.740> that<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.010> didn't

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I actually didn't mind that I didn't

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.950 
I actually didn't mind that I didn't
mind<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> seven<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.300> actually<00:00:42.450> liked<00:00:42.810> this

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
mind the seven I actually liked this

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.750 
mind the seven I actually liked this
effing<00:00:43.380> and<00:00:43.560> I<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:44.010> how<00:00:44.160> she<00:00:44.220> slipped<00:00:44.610> inside

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
effing and I like how she slipped inside

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.760 
effing and I like how she slipped inside
there<00:00:45.240> that<00:00:45.450> was<00:00:45.570> nice<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.470> I<00:00:47.090> I<00:00:48.090> don't<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
there that was nice you know I I don't I

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.590 
there that was nice you know I I don't I
don't<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.210> you<00:00:51.210> know<00:00:51.330> it's<00:00:51.480> not

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
don't think it's you know it's not

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.320 
don't think it's you know it's not
really<00:00:51.900> necessary<00:00:55.790> it's<00:00:56.790> not<00:00:56.970> really

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
really necessary it's not really

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.390 
really necessary it's not really
necessary<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.290> have<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> six<00:00:59.250> I

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
necessary that you have to do the six I

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.229 
necessary that you have to do the six I
thought<00:00:59.550> she<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.790> a<00:00:59.820> little<00:00:59.970> late<00:01:00.090> getting

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
thought she was a little late getting

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.200 
thought she was a little late getting
the<00:01:00.660> seven<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.080> the<00:01:01.200> ASPCA<00:01:01.739> wall<00:01:02.280> yeah<00:01:02.850> she

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the seven to the ASPCA wall yeah she

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.469 
the seven to the ASPCA wall yeah she
could<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.510> closed<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.050> up<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.410> bit

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.570 

and<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.690> was<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:09.990> too<00:01:10.229> rough<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:10.830> never

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and that was just too rough and never

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:41.910 
and that was just too rough and never
got<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.940> trot<00:01:12.180> done

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.240 

that<00:01:42.549> was<00:01:42.700> well<00:01:42.909> done<00:01:43.090> there<00:01:43.360> I<00:01:43.390> like<00:01:43.570> that

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.260 

then<00:01:50.250> again<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.640> force<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:50.970> getting<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
then again this force is getting a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.670 
then again this force is getting a
little<00:01:51.570> mouthy<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> looks<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.380> she's<00:01:52.530> in

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
little mouthy it looks like she's in

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.620 
little mouthy it looks like she's in
some<00:01:52.920> sort<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.220> snap<00:01:53.520> all<00:01:53.790> she<00:01:54.000> flatted<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
some sort of snap all she flatted in a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.920 
some sort of snap all she flatted in a
pelham<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:57.090> know<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.330> maybe<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.840> know

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
pelham you know and maybe you know

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.609 
pelham you know and maybe you know
that's<00:01:59.330> maybe<00:02:00.330> this<00:02:00.600> first<00:02:00.810> jumps<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.259> one<00:02:01.440> bit

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
that's maybe this first jumps in one bit

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.490 
that's maybe this first jumps in one bit
in<00:02:01.740> flats<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.159> another<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.670> he<00:02:02.759> definitely

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
in flats in another but he definitely

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.230 
in flats in another but he definitely
flatted<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.710> pelham<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.340> now<00:02:05.850> we've<00:02:06.090> gone

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
flatted in a pelham and now we've gone

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.150 
flatted in a pelham and now we've gone
back<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> snap<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.259> he<00:02:07.380> looks<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:07.979> he's

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
back to the snap on he looks like he's

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:23.910 
back to the snap on he looks like he's
just<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:09.000> rooting<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.450> little<00:02:09.690> bit

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.290 

you<00:02:24.400> know<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.520> think<00:02:24.610> they're<00:02:24.910> all<00:02:25.030> gonna<00:02:25.180> be

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
you know I think they're all gonna be

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.670 
you know I think they're all gonna be
able<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.510> get<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.870> five<00:02:26.080> done<00:02:26.380> they're<00:02:26.590> all

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
able to get the five done they're all

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.200 
able to get the five done they're all
gonna<00:02:26.800> get<00:02:27.070> there<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.460> five<00:02:27.490> but<00:02:27.940> again<00:02:28.180> I

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
gonna get there in five but again I

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.980 
gonna get there in five but again I
still<00:02:28.900> think<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:30.040> know<00:02:30.330> ideally<00:02:31.330> for<00:02:31.780> me<00:02:31.960> I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
still think you know ideally for me I

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.600 
still think you know ideally for me I
think<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.410> need<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.590> catch<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.100> triple<00:02:33.460> bar<00:02:33.580> a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
think you need to catch the triple bar a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.070 
think you need to catch the triple bar a
little<00:02:33.880> better<00:02:34.060> out<00:02:34.210> of<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.360> turn<00:02:34.600> so<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.900> can

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
little better out of the turn so you can

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.320 
little better out of the turn so you can
shape<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.710> five<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.460> then<00:02:36.580> be<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.210> the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
shape that five and then be in on the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.250 
shape that five and then be in on the
last<00:02:37.540> five

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
last five

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.440 
last five
she<00:02:38.680> caught<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.860> little<00:02:39.130> bit<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.520> dead<00:02:39.760> triple

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
she caught a little bit of a dead triple

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.270 
she caught a little bit of a dead triple
bar<00:02:40.600> she<00:02:40.870> had<00:02:40.960> to<00:02:41.050> step<00:02:41.260> up<00:02:41.440> in<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.710> five<00:02:41.920> so

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
bar she had to step up in the five so

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.180 
bar she had to step up in the five so
she<00:02:42.420> couldn't<00:02:43.420> really<00:02:43.770> be<00:02:44.770> thinking<00:02:45.130> about

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
she couldn't really be thinking about

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.590 
she couldn't really be thinking about
getting<00:02:45.580> into<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.940> next<00:02:46.180> five<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.390> think

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
getting into the next five I think

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.930 
getting into the next five I think
ideally<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.590> first<00:02:47.950> five<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.400> want<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.670> bend

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
ideally that first five you want to bend

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.760 
ideally that first five you want to bend
it<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.300> keep<00:02:49.480> coming<00:02:49.959> so<00:02:50.110> you're<00:02:50.260> coming<00:02:50.530> back

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
it and keep coming so you're coming back

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.670 
it and keep coming so you're coming back
the<00:02:51.010> other<00:02:51.040> way<00:02:51.250> for<00:02:51.400> that
