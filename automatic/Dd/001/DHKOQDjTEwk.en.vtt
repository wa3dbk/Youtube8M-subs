00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
and then all of the ones I saw which is

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.650 
and then all of the ones I saw which is
about<00:00:51.260> six<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:51.770> them<00:00:51.920> this<00:00:52.360> there's<00:00:53.360> a<00:00:53.420> line

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
about six of them this there's a line

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.630 
about six of them this there's a line
there<00:00:53.690> like<00:00:54.350> it's<00:00:54.530> textured<00:00:55.010> but<00:00:55.250> then<00:00:55.430> the

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
there like it's textured but then the

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.220 
there like it's textured but then the
paint<00:00:55.880> is<00:00:56.059> off<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:56.660> can't<00:00:56.899> feel<00:00:57.110> the

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
paint is off and you can't feel the

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.690 
paint is off and you can't feel the
texture<00:00:57.590> on<00:00:57.649> any<00:00:57.860> of<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.100> other<00:00:58.219> one<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:58.640> I

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
texture on any of the other one so I

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.520 
texture on any of the other one so I
don't<00:00:58.850> know<00:00:58.910> what's<00:00:59.090> up<00:00:59.239> with<00:00:59.270> that<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.780> then

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
don't know what's up with that and then

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.459 
don't know what's up with that and then
the<00:01:00.649> lines<00:01:00.890> if<00:01:01.129> you<00:01:01.160> look<00:01:01.370> closely<00:01:01.670> they<00:01:02.059> don't

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
the lines if you look closely they don't

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.810 
the lines if you look closely they don't
really<00:01:03.469> line<00:01:03.770> up<00:01:03.800> as<00:01:04.129> well<00:01:04.309> as<00:01:04.430> they<00:01:04.580> should<00:01:04.610> I

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
really line up as well as they should I

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.240 
really line up as well as they should I
know<00:01:04.970> that<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.930> curve<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.590> lightning

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
know that the the curve of the lightning

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.980 
know that the the curve of the lightning
throws<00:01:07.550> it<00:01:07.729> off<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:07.910> bit<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:08.539> they<00:01:08.660> line<00:01:08.840> up

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
throws it off a bit so they line up

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.840 
throws it off a bit so they line up
better<00:01:09.170> than<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:09.560> looks<00:01:09.830> at<00:01:10.009> first<00:01:10.039> but<00:01:10.700> it's

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
better than it looks at first but it's

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.270 
better than it looks at first but it's
still<00:01:11.000> just<00:01:11.060> not<00:01:11.390> quite<00:01:11.810> right<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.619> then<00:01:13.130> the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
still just not quite right and then the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.830 
still just not quite right and then the
shoulder<00:01:13.610> lines<00:01:13.850> they<00:01:14.090> don't<00:01:14.240> even<00:01:14.360> come<00:01:14.659> all

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
shoulder lines they don't even come all

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.149 
shoulder lines they don't even come all
the<00:01:14.930> way<00:01:14.960> around<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:15.619> it's<00:01:15.740> just<00:01:15.920> kind<00:01:16.100> of

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
the way around so it's just kind of

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.910 
the way around so it's just kind of
disappointing<00:01:17.200> that's<00:01:18.200> really<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.650> biggest

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
disappointing that's really the biggest

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.240 
disappointing that's really the biggest
gripe<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.460> have<00:01:19.869> because<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.440> hugely

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
gripe I have because the hugely

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.429 
gripe I have because the hugely
oversized<00:01:23.090> hood<00:01:23.450> which<00:01:23.810> just<00:01:24.110> kind<00:01:24.320> of

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
oversized hood which just kind of

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:25.980 
oversized hood which just kind of
pressure<00:01:25.070> fits<00:01:25.400> into<00:01:25.670> place

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
pressure fits into place

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.990 
pressure fits into place
awkwardly<00:01:27.140> it's<00:01:28.100> really<00:01:28.460> hard<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.729> get<00:01:28.850> in

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
awkwardly it's really hard to get in

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.600 
awkwardly it's really hard to get in
place<00:01:29.150> though<00:01:29.979> but<00:01:30.979> either<00:01:31.100> way<00:01:31.310> it's<00:01:31.549> just

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
place though but either way it's just

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.640 
place though but either way it's just
really<00:01:32.030> really<00:01:32.420> way<00:01:32.780> too<00:01:32.840> big<00:01:33.290> it<00:01:33.470> looks

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
really really way too big it looks

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.320 
really really way too big it looks
stupid<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.640> good<00:01:34.790> thing<00:01:34.939> about<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.180> is

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
stupid so the good thing about that is

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.539 
stupid so the good thing about that is
it<00:01:35.570> comes<00:01:35.750> off<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:36.740> can<00:01:36.920> probably<00:01:37.130> just

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
it comes off so you can probably just

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:38.740 
it comes off so you can probably just
take<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:37.820> off<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.000> never<00:01:38.270> look<00:01:38.509> at<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.630> again

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
take that off and never look at it again

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.910 
take that off and never look at it again
since<00:01:39.140> it's<00:01:39.320> really<00:01:39.439> ugly

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
since it's really ugly

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.950 
since it's really ugly
he<00:01:40.520> does<00:01:40.670> have<00:01:40.790> some<00:01:40.880> newly<00:01:41.270> sculpted<00:01:41.450> parts

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
he does have some newly sculpted parts

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.350 
he does have some newly sculpted parts
namely<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.820> lightning<00:01:43.820> bolt<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.150> then<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
namely the lightning bolt and then the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.359 
namely the lightning bolt and then the
gauntlets<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:44.900> things<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.409> boots<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:46.280> it

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
gauntlets and things the boots so it

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.830 
gauntlets and things the boots so it
looks<00:01:46.520> pretty<00:01:46.759> cool<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.150> Gold's<00:01:47.479> nice<00:01:47.659> and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
looks pretty cool the Gold's nice and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.499 
looks pretty cool the Gold's nice and

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
metallic the Blue has like white shading

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.910 
metallic the Blue has like white shading
in<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:50.840> make<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:50.990> look<00:01:51.110> like<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.500> split<00:01:51.770> up

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
in it to make it look like it split up

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.100 
in it to make it look like it split up
so<00:01:52.189> that's<00:01:52.340> pretty<00:01:52.549> good<00:01:52.850> Cape<00:01:53.570> looks<00:01:53.810> good

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
so that's pretty good Cape looks good

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.740 
so that's pretty good Cape looks good
the<00:01:54.409> gold<00:01:54.650> around<00:01:54.799> it<00:01:55.070> is<00:01:55.159> done<00:01:55.369> well<00:01:55.750> nicely

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
the gold around it is done well nicely

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.319 
the gold around it is done well nicely
sculpted<00:01:56.860> it's<00:01:57.860> just<00:01:58.070> not<00:01:58.850> as<00:01:58.970> good<00:01:59.090> as<00:01:59.210> it

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
sculpted it's just not as good as it

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:00.429 
sculpted it's just not as good as it
should<00:01:59.360> have<00:01:59.630> been<00:01:59.780> this<00:01:59.960> should<00:02:00.200> have<00:02:00.290> all

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
should have been this should have all

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.859 
should have been this should have all
just<00:02:00.590> been<00:02:00.710> textured<00:02:01.340> like<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.909> was<00:02:02.119> on<00:02:02.450> the

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
just been textured like it was on the

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.830 
just been textured like it was on the
flash<00:02:03.439> I<00:02:03.920> think<00:02:04.340> flash<00:02:04.549> maybe<00:02:05.180> not<00:02:05.420> flash<00:02:05.659> but

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
flash I think flash maybe not flash but

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.130 
flash I think flash maybe not flash but
I'm<00:02:05.899> pretty<00:02:06.079> sure<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.470> Batman<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.549> Superman

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
I'm pretty sure and Batman and Superman

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.630 
I'm pretty sure and Batman and Superman
what<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.170> made<00:02:09.320> the<00:02:09.440> figures<00:02:09.739> way<00:02:10.130> way<00:02:10.399> way

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
what I made the figures way way way

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.729 
what I made the figures way way way
better<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.239> then<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.350> know<00:02:12.470> there's<00:02:12.680> just

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
better and then you know there's just

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.920 
better and then you know there's just
the<00:02:13.280> general<00:02:13.760> quality<00:02:13.940> control<00:02:14.510> like<00:02:14.720> there's

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
the general quality control like there's

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.509 
the general quality control like there's
some<00:02:15.079> gold<00:02:15.260> missing<00:02:15.680> here<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> lot<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.340> them

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
some gold missing here a lot of them

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.699 
some gold missing here a lot of them
have<00:02:16.730> scratches<00:02:17.060> on<00:02:17.359> the<00:02:17.510> blue<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.109> it<00:02:18.530> could

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
have scratches on the blue so it could

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.710 
have scratches on the blue so it could
have<00:02:18.799> been<00:02:18.829> a<00:02:18.919> little<00:02:19.100> bit<00:02:19.310> better<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:20.570> head

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
have been a little bit better the head

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.830 
have been a little bit better the head
sculpt<00:02:21.079> is<00:02:21.260> really

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
sculpt is really

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.900 
sculpt is really
though<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.500> think<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.040> about<00:02:23.160> perfect

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
though I think it's just about perfect

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.390 
though I think it's just about perfect
it<00:02:24.480> looks<00:02:24.690> really<00:02:25.010> exactly<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.099> way<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.310> would

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
it looks really exactly the way I would

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.220 
it looks really exactly the way I would
want<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.760> look<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.060> I'm<00:02:27.270> happy<00:02:27.569> about<00:02:27.660> that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
want it to look so I'm happy about that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.080 
want it to look so I'm happy about that
as<00:02:28.410> far<00:02:28.590> as<00:02:28.620> articulation<00:02:29.370> goes<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.790> head<00:02:29.970> is

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
as far as articulation goes the head is

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.670 
as far as articulation goes the head is

go<00:02:31.770> up<00:02:31.950> or<00:02:32.099> down<00:02:32.130> barely<00:02:32.610> at<00:02:32.670> all<00:02:32.700> though<00:02:33.030> so

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
go up or down barely at all though so

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.979 
go up or down barely at all though so
that's<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.510> big<00:02:33.720> problem<00:02:34.050> for<00:02:34.110> me<00:02:34.410> does<00:02:35.160> swivel

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the past but probably okay I mean it

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.080 
the past but probably okay I mean it
definitely<00:02:49.319> could<00:02:49.709> be<00:02:49.739> better<00:02:50.040> does<00:02:50.849> have<00:02:51.060> a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
definitely could be better does have a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.820 
definitely could be better does have a

waist twist underneath the belt which is

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.070 
waist twist underneath the belt which is
a<00:02:52.980> softer<00:02:53.459> plastic<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.330> kind<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.569> warps<00:02:54.870> as

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
a softer plastic so it kind of warps as

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.380 
a softer plastic so it kind of warps as
you<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:56.130> twist<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.519> body<00:02:56.700> around<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.269> it's

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
you just twist the body around so it's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.770 
you just twist the body around so it's
okay<00:02:57.799> standard<00:02:58.799> hip<00:02:59.069> articulation<00:02:59.569> DCU<00:03:00.569> C

ankle there's no ankle rocker just the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.150 
ankle there's no ankle rocker just the
ankle<00:03:09.090> pivot<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:09.630> pretty<00:03:10.319> basic<00:03:10.769> figure<00:03:11.099> I

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
ankle pivot so pretty basic figure I

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.309 
ankle pivot so pretty basic figure I
mean<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.459> looks<00:03:11.610> cool<00:03:11.730> but<00:03:12.569> definitely<00:03:12.989> not<00:03:13.110> as

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
mean it looks cool but definitely not as

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.470 
mean it looks cool but definitely not as
good<00:03:13.410> as<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.739> was<00:03:13.920> hoping<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:14.370> out<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.330> an

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
good as I was hoping for out of an

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.140 
good as I was hoping for out of an
exclusive<00:03:16.140> figure<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.709> don't<00:03:17.610> know<00:03:17.849> if<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:18.000> did

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
exclusive figure I don't know if I did

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.220 
exclusive figure I don't know if I did
this<00:03:18.239> already<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.630> I'll<00:03:18.690> do<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.840> again<00:03:18.930> real

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
this already so I'll do it again real

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.670 
this already so I'll do it again real
quick

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680

he stands six and a half inches tall
almost<00:03:22.910> exactly<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.349> he<00:03:25.349> looks<00:03:25.560> good<00:03:25.769> he's

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
almost exactly so he looks good he's

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.130 
almost exactly so he looks good he's
definitely<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.340> nice<00:03:26.489> display<00:03:26.820> piece<00:03:27.000> but<00:03:27.750> he's

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
definitely a nice display piece but he's

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.259 
definitely a nice display piece but he's
not<00:03:28.320> nearly<00:03:28.650> as<00:03:28.799> good<00:03:28.980> as<00:03:29.220> he<00:03:29.400> could<00:03:29.670> have<00:03:29.910> been

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
not nearly as good as he could have been
