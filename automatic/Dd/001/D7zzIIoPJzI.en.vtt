00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.180
 are all experts are very good 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.070
 here with this new video tutorial a 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.500
 more time a video to show them how 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.719
 root your mobile since I believe that 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.239
 these are the videos that most 

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:32.129
 interest since in my channel both in the 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.110
 channel like on my facebook page I've 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.420
 received hundreds of questions every day 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.129
 about how to root your mobile that at the same time 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.590
 is the method that I have does not work 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.180
 I already have two or three methods 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.670
 there in my channel for those who do not 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.170
 follow if you are interested in rooting 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.180
 your mobile phone, well, there you will find 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.620
 several methods and I bring you one more in 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.790
 the description of this video will be 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.430
 leaving the application that we are going to 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.720
 use is called frama root for all 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.300
 those who want to copy it can 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.820
 try the since this of the rut there is not a 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.530
 universal method that can surround all 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.719
 the mobiles is a lie when you 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.670
 come in a video that says rootear 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.680
 any android there are many methods 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.860
 some methods work with some equipment 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.149
 and other methods with different equipment and 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.369
 So good because it remains to 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.909
 go testing to see what method you 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.539
 works 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.740
 well let's proceed first of all 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.700
 is leaving you as I say the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.350
 description of the video of this application 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.670
 that we see here at the bottom is 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.350
 called frama root over here is 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.520
 appearing the name and of any 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.539
 way in the video description of 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.950
 there they go down 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.719
 they install it like any other 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.490
 application if you have never installed 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.709
 applications outside of what is the plays 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.380
 thor you just have to activate 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:42.390
 unknown origins in settings of the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.390
 system here where it says 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.310
 and security and we go here where it says 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.860
 unknown origins simply 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.070
 we mark this box and it is already 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.930
 we can activate it we can install it 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.450
 application because if not otherwise 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.430
 will not let us install it 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.789
 well once it is installed simply 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.220
 we are going to open this method because they can 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.649
 find information in the bx forum 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.400
 adabel or pers on what models are the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.170
 that can surround but well these this 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.940
 I 'm telling you since I usually 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.580
 they ask that if you can surround such 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.989
 model and they leave me there their models and 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.730
 unfortunately, I do not have all 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.709
 the equipment to prove it is evident 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.630
 so it's all left for you to owe us 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.319
 find the application information or 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.420
 try just to see if it works 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.549
 good once the application is open here 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.290
 at the top usually 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.690
 three options appear here I appear 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.380
 two there are times he says for example here 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.500
 in my case it says install superes usa and 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.640
 at the bottom it says a while 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.340
 A third option usually appears 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.720
 that says install super usher that comes 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.819
 to be practically the same is 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.560
 simply to test if you do not 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.870
 it works, you can try the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.239
 different options just do not use 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.790
 this one that says a rap since this is for 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.469
 do the opposite to remove the root 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.319
 for example here I am going to select 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:09.599
 install super s 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.189
 and then here in this same part 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.620
 we can go testing with each one to see 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.689
 how does the one that normally works 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.069
 recommends is this that says aragon or 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.499
 fasting that sometimes appears that says 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.970
 great good in this case I'm going to 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:24.730
 select this aragon 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.630
 and here it is already finished like this 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.670
 simple 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.800
 here he tells us that after 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.620
 satisfactory 'the super use the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.260
 installed binaries you just have to 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.600
 restart the phone we give ok and if 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.250
 It does not automatically restart Us 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.300
 we do it manually here I'm going to 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.930
 be manually but restart and we're going to 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.930
 wait for your garment 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.110
 as you can see the method is really 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.210
 very easy 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.420
 or expulsion to this application as they 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.000
 I say with hundreds of good models and then 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.520
 there is nothing left but to try each one 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.440
 to see if it works 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.940
 about what are the advantages and 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.890
 disadvantages that also usually I 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.080
 they ask good not to do so long 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.940
 the video jumped me that step I avoid 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.230
 explain that since there are hundreds of 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.360
 videos also that we can find 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.610
 right here on youtube about the advantages 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.650
 and disadvantages if you do not know for 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.810
 that the robot works or what to see 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.590
 what age advantage do I recommend you 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.270
 look for the right here on youtube and go to 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.160
 find hundreds of videos about for 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.610
 what is root and what are its 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.610
 advantages and disadvantages 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.900
 well here we have entered 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.350
 well here we have entered already and we can 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.600
 let's find that we have installed 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.920
 this application that we see here that in 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.560
 screen 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.070
 here we can see it called super 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.690
 Its super is USA and if it is not installed 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.250
 this application good well we know that 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.470
 our phone did not break 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.390
 correctly and if it appears as in my 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.310
 case means that it has been sprayed 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.560
 satisfactorily here simply the 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.800
 we open 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.260
 and here we give no thanks and pop 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.760
 so simple what I'm going to open here 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.440
 application that asks me for permits 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.750
 superuser just to check that 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.950
 it works here is it is not asking 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.470
 permission I give you allow 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.390
 and it's fully functional we 're going 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.890
 to the super user and here we see the 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.650
 application that is giving you permissions 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.680
 superuser good friends well so 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.150
 simple surrounds our android here 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.490
 in this case I am using a 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.930
 samsung galaxy no 2 but I repeat 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.550
 they work as models I've 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.220
 used this application to root 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.190
 what are the range of the lg series 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.410
 optimus and it has worked very well for me 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.970
 I tell you this application a signal to 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.160
 let them know which model works best 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.430
 that nothing works with android version 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.410
 4.3 down with kitkat practically 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.870
 I have not seen it work and I've 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.870
 tested and not then it does not work but if 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.980
 they have the ejecting and they are heard and bill 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.350
 Well, I think it will work for them 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.030
 in most models good 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.800
