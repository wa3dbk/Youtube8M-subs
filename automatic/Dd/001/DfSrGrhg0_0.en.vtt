00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.530
 everyone is chasing fashion mod make a game 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.720
 In the film for over a year does not go away with 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.119
 mobile gaming market and already in order 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.700
 fed up in early March 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.289
 companies warner brothers and they already 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.900
 made a game for the operating system 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.269
 android and ayos game out but 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.580
 the developers did very cleverly and not 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.410
 began to do the last level therefore 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.960
 we can only guess what 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.449
 ended the second part of the 300 Spartans 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.000
 as the plot of this picture says after 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.129
 Leonid defeats to Sparta soldiers in the union 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.409
 with Admiral Themistocles provided 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.080
 the ability to fall heart and all his 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.030
 Persian army even despite the long-standing 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.430
 feud two powerful state 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.680
 had to unite and oppose 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.199
 invincible tyrant what ended this 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.059
 the war and whether it will end we can 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.430
 learn only after watching a movie 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.129
 1 after launch that catches the eye 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.170
 This is a disgusting translation into Russian 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.159
 partially its absence 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.990
 but there is one but it is a version of the game 100 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.120
 it means without bugs just can not be 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.000
 move on setting the game options 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.220
 very scarce and there is only the possibility 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.440
 disconnect shoes yes yes these are the same bugs 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.110
 transfer and disable you can actually 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.000
 learning video section is nothing special 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.650
 simple slider for brightness control 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.780
 audio is also trite 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.850
 volume effects and music function 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.140
 connect the social network facebook for 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.440
 order to share your results 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.720
 Well, finally, the choice of language here as much as 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.900
 attention three english 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.820
 languages you have done well three English 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.040
 but on mighty greats laid as 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.560
 we say we have people bolt 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.080
 back to our excellent Russification 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.760
 now it's time to go on the first mission yes 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.400
 and by the way during the loading level 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.729
 description of him on the English ships 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.400
 the sea of ​​ships in the sea raging from the storm 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.409
 the sea is very noticeable but the game designers 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.120
 very much wanted to convey the light and itself 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.490
 picture of the film because she is there 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.679
 really catchy graphics you 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.680
 still come back it is worth saying a few words about 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.659
 the management is pretty good yes I even 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.270
 I will say more what to play 300 Spartans 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.600
 with such control whether 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.850
 oh roughly one button yes yes about 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.950
 the joystick can be almost forgotten but 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.960
 unless there are no enemies near and need 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.790
 go further on the ship and me 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.010
 one attack button and our hero will 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.320
 jump from one enemy to another also 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.060
 looking for them too you can beat in general 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.260
 it is not clear what kind of audience was 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.990
 calculated management 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.090
 but but here is really not cool cool 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.340
 the gameplay also does not smell stupid 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.370
 it is stupid to cut enemies with a sword 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.290
 all stand and cut it seemed if you 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.510
 doing a movie game and releasing and 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.320
 before the release of this movie the game 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.660
 should leave 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.670
 great emotions and make the viewer go 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.740
 on the film and see what is over 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.690
 four level game but it looks like 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.240
 the programmer decided to spoil the fee 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.360
 filmmakers and make a game for owl 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.470
 thinking if you could not pass it 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.540
 you that you are distracted back in 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.850
 the game or rather go again charts 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.160
 let's not even be sad about 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.500
 drawn muscles and see a little 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.230
 Further namely on the sea that's where 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.940
 spent all the power graphics workers it 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.160
 really cool no complaints 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.170
 causes a huge plus for this game 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.800
 sound component of the game slightly 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.870
 unclear 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.090
 like a mouth almost two stadiums a 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.130
 I fight only three enemies 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.110
 perhaps it is the screams of the neighboring ships 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.740
 which are located on kilometers 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.080
 away from me 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.550
 oh well hope that at least one 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.750
 Russian-speaking company developer 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.640
 warner brothers 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.790
 see my displeasure and fix it 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.390
 minor but still flaws after playing with 300 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.520
 Spartans 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.560
 I forgot about Russian for some time 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.630
 a language that was somewhere behind the screen 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.880
 and painted the press and even started 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.070
 enjoy a little game but she 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.680
 ended what we have in the end 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.780
 so everything is very simple still raw but quite 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.410
 playable toy called 300 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.450
 Spartans 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.900
 this game is justified only by its 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.870
 version 100 she plays once and then 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.060
 for half an hour this is a prime example of not chasing 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.010
 for fashion film advertising through creation 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.410
 games can how to unleash it yet 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.690
 stronger and ruin hire hope 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.220
 the film is not exactly like the game 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.530
 but we did not see the continuation 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.630
 mobile copy of the film I will wait 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.530
 further updates and therefore put 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.870
 water assessment with an advance of schedule 4 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.240
 gameplay 4 management 3 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.910
 the game has much to strive for but beyond 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.250
 The plot of the film, too, do not go with 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.820
 you watched the game Michael, thank you all for 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.800
 viewing 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.810
 you can leave your opinion about the game and 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.810
 evaluate the release of all successful games
