I'm going to use a little bit of

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.280 
I'm going to use a little bit of
cornflour<00:02:41.510> it's<00:02:42.510> going<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.810> act<00:02:43.020> like<00:02:43.170> a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
cornflour it's going to act like a

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.950 
cornflour it's going to act like a
binding<00:02:43.860> agent<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:45.060> just<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.600> little<00:02:45.720> bit

binding agent so just a little bit

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.610 
binding agent so just a little bit
perhaps<00:02:47.480> because<00:02:48.480> we<00:02:48.510> do<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.290> egg-white

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
perhaps because we do have the egg-white

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.230 
perhaps because we do have the egg-white
in<00:02:50.460> there<00:02:50.970> as<00:02:51.150> well<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.400> mix<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.640> up<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:56.240> little

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
in there as well so mix this up a little

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.530 
in there as well so mix this up a little
bit<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.810> lemon<00:02:58.170> juice<00:02:59.180> give<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.360> nice

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
bit of the lemon juice give it a nice

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.850 
bit of the lemon juice give it a nice
tang<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:02.120> lastly<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.720> egg<00:03:03.900> white<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.830> just

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
tang and lastly the egg white you just

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:13.910 
tang and lastly the egg white you just
want<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.420> beat<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.660> up<00:03:06.900> slightly

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.059 

now<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.370> just<00:03:15.400> mix<00:03:16.390> this<00:03:16.599> up<00:03:16.810> well<00:03:17.319> and<00:03:17.650> these

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
now you just mix this up well and these

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.520 
now you just mix this up well and these
are<00:03:18.129> pan-fried<00:03:18.939> so<00:03:19.299> they're<00:03:19.510> really<00:03:19.989> healthy

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
are pan-fried so they're really healthy

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.530 
are pan-fried so they're really healthy
just<00:03:21.129> take<00:03:21.310> up<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.549> little<00:03:21.670> bit<00:03:21.909> of<00:03:22.060> oil<00:03:22.209> and

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
just take up a little bit of oil and

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.819 
just take up a little bit of oil and
they<00:03:22.659> get<00:03:23.139> done<00:03:23.319> in<00:03:23.469> a<00:03:23.499> minute

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
they get done in a minute

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.300 
they get done in a minute
chicken<00:03:24.459> cooks<00:03:24.730> really<00:03:25.359> fast<00:03:25.510> so<00:03:26.230> that's<00:03:26.889> it

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
chicken cooks really fast so that's it

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.339 
chicken cooks really fast so that's it
so<00:03:27.849> what<00:03:28.030> we're<00:03:28.209> going<00:03:28.359> to<00:03:28.389> do<00:03:28.599> now<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:29.079> we've

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
so what we're going to do now is we've

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.379 
so what we're going to do now is we've
got<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.709> two<00:03:29.859> sets<00:03:30.099> of<00:03:30.250> ingredients<00:03:30.939> and<00:03:31.120> we

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
got the two sets of ingredients and we

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.319 
got the two sets of ingredients and we
need<00:03:31.569> to<00:03:31.810> combine<00:03:32.469> both<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.159> them<00:03:33.370> I'm<00:03:34.269> just

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
need to combine both of them I'm just

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:42.690 
need to combine both of them I'm just
going<00:03:34.719> to<00:03:34.930> add<00:03:35.139> the<00:03:35.500> wet<00:03:36.099> ingredients<00:03:41.700> feel

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
going to add the wet ingredients feel

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.929 
going to add the wet ingredients feel
free<00:03:42.969> to<00:03:42.999> use<00:03:43.329> your<00:03:43.510> hands<00:03:43.959> if<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:45.010> really

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
free to use your hands if you really

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.080 
free to use your hands if you really
want<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.329> or<00:03:47.079> else<00:03:47.409> a<00:03:47.829> fork<00:03:48.189> will<00:03:48.700> actually

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
want to or else a fork will actually

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.659 
want to or else a fork will actually
just<00:03:49.299> do<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.719> job<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.219> one<00:03:51.219> key<00:03:51.489> ingredient

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
just do the job and one key ingredient

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.809 
just do the job and one key ingredient
of<00:03:52.299> course<00:03:52.569> that<00:03:52.810> needs<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.230> go<00:03:53.379> in<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.829> some

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
of course that needs to go in is some

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.369 
of course that needs to go in is some
salt<00:03:56.099> so<00:03:57.099> that's<00:03:57.939> the<00:03:58.269> salt<00:03:58.540> right<00:03:58.959> at<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.230> end

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
salt so that's the salt right at the end

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.479 
salt so that's the salt right at the end
now

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
now

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.369 
now
while<00:04:00.760> I'm<00:04:00.969> mixing<00:04:01.150> this<00:04:01.569> I'm<00:04:01.810> just<00:04:02.139> going<00:04:02.319> to

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
while I'm mixing this I'm just going to

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.679 
while I'm mixing this I'm just going to
turn<00:04:02.590> on<00:04:02.829> the<00:04:03.099> heat<00:04:03.310> we<00:04:03.639> need<00:04:03.819> to<00:04:03.939> get<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.299> pan

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
turn on the heat we need to get a pan

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.140 
turn on the heat we need to get a pan
hot<00:04:05.139> so<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.680> can<00:04:05.769> leave<00:04:06.129> this<00:04:06.340> on<00:04:06.609> a<00:04:06.879> medium

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
hot so you can leave this on a medium

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.899 
hot so you can leave this on a medium
high<00:04:07.840> heat<00:04:07.919> now<00:04:08.919> there<00:04:09.099> are<00:04:09.219> two<00:04:09.639> ways<00:04:09.879> that

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
high heat now there are two ways that

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.619 
high heat now there are two ways that
you<00:04:10.329> could<00:04:10.540> make<00:04:10.750> up<00:04:10.989> these<00:04:11.530> chicken<00:04:12.040> balls

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
you could make up these chicken balls

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.599 
you could make up these chicken balls
the<00:04:13.629> easiest<00:04:14.049> would<00:04:14.379> be<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.739> just<00:04:14.949> form<00:04:15.340> them

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
the easiest would be to just form them

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.749 
the easiest would be to just form them
and<00:04:15.849> lay<00:04:16.780> them<00:04:16.810> onto<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.500> heated<00:04:18.130> pan<00:04:18.459> which

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:18.759 
and lay them onto the heated pan which

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.449 
and lay them onto the heated pan which
will<00:04:19.419> have<00:04:19.599> a<00:04:19.630> little<00:04:19.810> bit<00:04:19.989> of<00:04:20.019> oil<00:04:20.229> or<00:04:20.680> if<00:04:21.340> you

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
will have a little bit of oil or if you

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.760 
will have a little bit of oil or if you
want<00:04:21.639> to<00:04:21.699> get<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.060> shape<00:04:22.300> really<00:04:22.750> right<00:04:22.990> you

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
want to get the shape really right you

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.390 
want to get the shape really right you
could<00:04:23.979> use<00:04:24.220> bamboo<00:04:25.090> skewers<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.099> use<00:04:27.099> the

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
could use bamboo skewers and use the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.700 
could use bamboo skewers and use the
meat<00:04:27.610> onto<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.300> skewer<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.840> then<00:04:28.930> gently

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
meat onto the skewer and then gently

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.210 
meat onto the skewer and then gently
roll<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:30.610> onto<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.150> pan<00:04:31.409> although<00:04:32.409> the<00:04:32.979> hand

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
roll it onto the pan although the hand

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.430 
roll it onto the pan although the hand
technique<00:04:33.729> just<00:04:34.090> works<00:04:34.389> great<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.110> the

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
technique just works great so the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.550 
technique just works great so the
ingredients<00:04:35.680> are<00:04:36.159> nicely<00:04:36.400> mixed<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.449> a<00:04:38.289> pan

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
ingredients are nicely mixed and a pan

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.159 
ingredients are nicely mixed and a pan
is<00:04:38.830> nice<00:04:39.039> and<00:04:39.099> hot<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.940> am<00:04:40.030> just<00:04:40.870> going<00:04:41.080> to

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
is nice and hot I am just going to

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.899 
is nice and hot I am just going to
drizzle<00:04:41.380> some<00:04:41.770> oil<00:04:43.050> onto<00:04:44.050> this<00:04:44.289> pan<00:04:44.699> we<00:04:45.699> just

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
drizzle some oil onto this pan we just

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.240 
drizzle some oil onto this pan we just
go<00:04:46.060> into<00:04:46.150> shallow<00:04:46.449> fry<00:04:46.840> so<00:04:47.440> not<00:04:47.620> too<00:04:47.830> much<00:04:47.949> oil

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
go into shallow fry so not too much oil

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.620 
go into shallow fry so not too much oil
and<00:04:49.770> what<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:50.949> could<00:04:51.190> do<00:04:51.490> is<00:04:51.759> when<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.389> want

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
and what you could do is when you want

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.320 
and what you could do is when you want
to<00:04:52.750> form<00:04:53.050> these<00:04:53.320> you<00:04:53.949> could<00:04:54.130> just<00:04:54.340> even<00:04:54.759> add<00:04:54.909> a

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
to form these you could just even add a

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.950 
to form these you could just even add a
little<00:04:55.479> bit<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.440> oil<00:04:56.699> to<00:04:57.699> your<00:04:57.940> hand

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
little bit of the oil to your hand

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.150 
little bit of the oil to your hand
so<00:05:00.960> slightly<00:05:01.550> breezy<00:05:02.720> so<00:05:03.720> that<00:05:03.930> it's<00:05:04.740> just

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
so slightly breezy so that it's just

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.260 
so slightly breezy so that it's just
easier<00:05:05.729> for<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:07.550> form<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.880> ball<00:05:09.060> than

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
easier for you to form the ball than

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.890 
easier for you to form the ball than
they<00:05:09.360> do<00:05:09.509> not<00:05:09.630> stick<00:05:10.199> to<00:05:10.949> your<00:05:11.099> hand<00:05:11.360> so<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.660> am

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
they do not stick to your hand so I am

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.600 
they do not stick to your hand so I am
just<00:05:13.259> going<00:05:13.410> to<00:05:13.470> use<00:05:13.530> my<00:05:13.860> hands<00:05:14.250> that<00:05:14.400> is<00:05:14.490> the

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
just going to use my hands that is the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.350 
just going to use my hands that is the
best<00:05:14.789> technique<00:05:15.319> to<00:05:16.319> make<00:05:16.830> these<00:05:17.330> couple<00:05:18.330> of

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
best technique to make these couple of

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.749 
best technique to make these couple of
ways<00:05:18.599> you<00:05:18.870> could<00:05:19.050> do<00:05:19.229> this<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:20.130> just<00:05:20.370> need<00:05:20.550> to

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
ways you could do this you just need to

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.559 
ways you could do this you just need to
form<00:05:21.060> them<00:05:21.300> into<00:05:21.330> slightly<00:05:22.280> cylindrical

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
form them into slightly cylindrical

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.439 
form them into slightly cylindrical
elongated<00:05:24.569> shape<00:05:24.900> and<00:05:25.680> I<00:05:26.280> am<00:05:26.340> going<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.610> put<00:05:27.270> it

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
elongated shape and I am going to put it

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.189 
elongated shape and I am going to put it
right<00:05:27.690> here<00:05:28.340> onto<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.460> pan<00:05:29.699> these<00:05:30.630> get<00:05:30.960> done

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
right here onto the pan these get done

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.430 
right here onto the pan these get done
so<00:05:31.530> fast<00:05:32.090> so<00:05:33.090> it<00:05:33.180> is<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.300> great<00:05:33.630> last-minute

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
so fast so it is a great last-minute

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.969 
so fast so it is a great last-minute
snack<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:35.759> you<00:05:35.820> could<00:05:36.599> do<00:05:36.780> maybe<00:05:36.990> eight<00:05:37.590> or

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
snack and you could do maybe eight or

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.110 
snack and you could do maybe eight or
ten<00:05:38.340> together<00:05:38.820> in<00:05:39.210> one<00:05:39.900> go<00:05:40.139> all<00:05:40.440> on<00:05:41.400> a<00:05:41.669> medium

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
ten together in one go all on a medium

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.700 
ten together in one go all on a medium
heat<00:05:43.729> okay<00:05:44.729> so<00:05:45.000> these<00:05:45.180> are<00:05:45.360> looking<00:05:45.630> good<00:05:45.900> we

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
heat okay so these are looking good we

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.070 
heat okay so these are looking good we
are<00:05:46.800> going<00:05:46.949> to<00:05:47.039> turn<00:05:47.190> them<00:05:47.460> over<00:05:47.639> I<00:05:48.060> think<00:05:48.570> the

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
are going to turn them over I think the

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.890 
are going to turn them over I think the
bottom<00:05:49.440> side<00:05:49.830> seems<00:05:50.250> done<00:05:51.210> we<00:05:51.539> could<00:05:51.720> just

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
bottom side seems done we could just

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.890 
bottom side seems done we could just
check<00:05:53.180> that's<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.389> color<00:05:54.630> you're<00:05:54.840> looking

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
check that's the color you're looking

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.070 
check that's the color you're looking
for<00:05:55.409> like<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.800> medium<00:05:56.280> brown<00:05:56.789> not<00:05:57.330> too<00:05:57.599> dark

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.700 

what<00:06:01.080> you<00:06:01.259> could<00:06:01.530> do<00:06:01.770> is<00:06:02.039> use<00:06:02.490> a<00:06:03.259> fork<00:06:04.259> perhaps

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
what you could do is use a fork perhaps

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.640 
what you could do is use a fork perhaps
to<00:06:05.220> help<00:06:05.370> you<00:06:05.669> turn<00:06:06.659> it<00:06:06.810> over<00:06:06.990> and<00:06:09.080> these<00:06:10.080> this

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
to help you turn it over and these this

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.480 
to help you turn it over and these this
just<00:06:11.419> goes<00:06:12.419> so<00:06:12.630> fast<00:06:12.870> once<00:06:13.320> you<00:06:13.500> make<00:06:13.710> them<00:06:14.009> you

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
just goes so fast once you make them you

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.640 
just goes so fast once you make them you
probably<00:06:14.820> not<00:06:15.030> have<00:06:15.300> too<00:06:15.690> many<00:06:15.900> left<00:06:16.139> once

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
probably not have too many left once

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.760 
probably not have too many left once
they're<00:06:16.949> done<00:06:17.509> so<00:06:18.509> we'll<00:06:18.690> just<00:06:18.900> get<00:06:19.169> the<00:06:19.409> other

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
they're done so we'll just get the other

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.330 
they're done so we'll just get the other
side<00:06:20.130> to<00:06:20.400> brown<00:06:21.210> in<00:06:21.449> as<00:06:21.659> well<00:06:22.050> okay<00:06:23.039> so<00:06:23.099> these

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
side to brown in as well okay so these

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.909 
side to brown in as well okay so these
are<00:06:23.400> pretty<00:06:23.759> much<00:06:24.000> done<00:06:24.389> they've<00:06:25.199> taken<00:06:25.409> about

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
are pretty much done they've taken about

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.189 
are pretty much done they've taken about
maybe<00:06:26.310> four<00:06:27.030> to<00:06:27.210> five<00:06:27.419> minutes<00:06:27.659> on<00:06:28.050> either

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
maybe four to five minutes on either

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.580 
maybe four to five minutes on either
side<00:06:28.849> and<00:06:29.849> again<00:06:30.090> the<00:06:30.419> way<00:06:30.539> you<00:06:30.570> want<00:06:30.930> to<00:06:31.050> make

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
side and again the way you want to make

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.070 
side and again the way you want to make
sure<00:06:31.620> that<00:06:31.949> they're<00:06:32.159> cooked<00:06:32.400> is<00:06:32.750> you<00:06:33.750> ensure

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
sure that they're cooked is you ensure

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.749 
sure that they're cooked is you ensure

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
that there is no pink part of the

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.680 
that there is no pink part of the
chicken<00:06:36.199> showing<00:06:37.199> on<00:06:37.500> this<00:06:37.740> and<00:06:38.509> these<00:06:39.509> are
