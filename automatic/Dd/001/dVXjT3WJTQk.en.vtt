00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.720 

here's<00:00:19.910> a<00:00:20.060> new<00:00:20.830> labyrinth<00:00:21.830> cell<00:00:22.220> technique

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
here's a new labyrinth cell technique

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.880 
here's a new labyrinth cell technique
you<00:00:23.000> start<00:00:23.330> with<00:00:23.540> a<00:00:23.570> normal<00:00:24.140> labyrinth<00:00:24.620> cell

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
you start with a normal labyrinth cell

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.960 
you start with a normal labyrinth cell
which<00:00:25.070> means<00:00:25.100> dead<00:00:25.760> center<00:00:26.770> cell<00:00:27.770> in<00:00:28.460> the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
which means dead center cell in the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.860 
which means dead center cell in the
beginning<00:00:32.140> in<00:00:33.140> other<00:00:33.410> words<00:00:33.710> this<00:00:34.130> square<00:00:34.870> is

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
beginning in other words this square is

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:46.540 
beginning in other words this square is
not<00:00:36.340> you<00:00:37.340> know<00:00:39.670> all<00:00:40.670> wide<00:00:44.950> this<00:00:45.950> one<00:00:46.220> is<00:00:46.370> more

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
not you know all wide this one is more

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.220 
not you know all wide this one is more
closed<00:00:46.880> in<00:00:47.180> because<00:00:47.600> it's<00:00:47.780> in<00:00:47.900> the<00:00:48.020> dead

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
closed in because it's in the dead

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.490 
closed in because it's in the dead
center<00:00:48.559> of<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.800> cards<00:00:50.290> that's<00:00:51.290> how<00:00:51.440> you

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
center of the cards that's how you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
center of the cards that's how you
started

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.700 

now<00:00:56.520> instead<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.060> calculating<00:00:57.450> too<00:00:58.170> much<00:00:58.380> over

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
now instead of calculating too much over

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.130 
now instead of calculating too much over
here<00:00:58.740> I<00:00:59.280> normally<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.300> make<00:01:00.690> sure<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.960> covers

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
here I normally just make sure it covers

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.939 
here I normally just make sure it covers
the<00:01:01.440> entrance<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.610> corner<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
the entrance and this corner and

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:18.410 
the entrance and this corner and
obviously<00:01:04.949> sideways<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.240> room<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
obviously sideways like the room so the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.270 
obviously sideways like the room so the
second<00:01:19.170> technique<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:21.680> what<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> told<00:01:23.010> you<00:01:23.160> not

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
second technique is what I told you not

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.180 
second technique is what I told you not
to<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> beginning<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:25.680> reason<00:01:26.070> is

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
to do in the beginning the reason is

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.690 
to do in the beginning the reason is
because<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.060> more<00:01:27.300> stable<00:01:28.190> this<00:01:29.190> bottom

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
because this is more stable this bottom

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.300 
because this is more stable this bottom
floor<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.540> made<00:01:30.770> but<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.950> harder

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
floor that I just made but it's harder

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.230 
floor that I just made but it's harder
to<00:01:32.340> build<00:01:32.869> exactly<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.060> higher

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
to build exactly like that on the higher

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.010 
to build exactly like that on the higher
floors

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
floors

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
floors
it's<00:01:37.590> sort<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.100> square<00:01:39.860> you're<00:01:40.860> gonna

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it's sort of that square you're gonna

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.020 
it's sort of that square you're gonna
slowly<00:01:41.399> open<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.060> square

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.410 

and<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.630> will<00:01:47.810> note

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and you will note

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.870 
and you will note
wieder<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.140> square<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.190> more<00:01:50.370> chances

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
wieder that square is the more chances

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.170 
wieder that square is the more chances
you<00:01:50.940> have<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:52.020> there<00:01:52.890> being<00:01:53.159> enough<00:01:53.460> room<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you have of there being enough room to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:05.610 
you have of there being enough room to
make<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.790> labyrinth<00:01:57.860> seal

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.680 

sometimes<00:02:06.620> it's<00:02:06.920> risky<00:02:07.430> but<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.700> can<00:02:08.060> stick

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
sometimes it's risky but you can stick

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.490 
sometimes it's risky but you can stick
your<00:02:08.720> finger<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.590> through<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.280> entrance<00:02:10.819> and

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
your finger in through the entrance and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.750 
your finger in through the entrance and
repair<00:02:12.500> with<00:02:12.860> your<00:02:13.100> finger<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:16.010> basic

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
repair with your finger the the basic

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.250 
repair with your finger the the basic
cell<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:21.260> -<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:23.180> can<00:02:23.390> repair<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.020> outer

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
cell and - you can repair the outer

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.350 
cell and - you can repair the outer
walls<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:26.480> actual<00:02:26.900> labyrinth<00:02:27.470> part<00:02:28.330> with<00:02:29.330> a

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
walls the actual labyrinth part with a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.979 
walls the actual labyrinth part with a
card<00:02:29.840> like<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:34.239> cover<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.450> corner<00:02:35.810> and

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
card like this so cover the corner and

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.699 
card like this so cover the corner and
the<00:02:36.170> entrance<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:37.450> way<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:39.230> seems<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.680> work

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
the entrance that way this seems to work

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:48.920 
the entrance that way this seems to work
just<00:02:39.890> fine

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.880 

you

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:08.660 

and<00:02:56.190> I'm<00:02:56.580> almost<00:02:56.790> out<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.180> cards<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.460> whole

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
and I'm almost out of cards so the whole

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.670 
and I'm almost out of cards so the whole
tower<00:03:09.000> wants<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.600> lean<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.320> right

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
tower wants to lean to the right

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.980 
tower wants to lean to the right
I<00:03:10.920> mean<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.580> left<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.510> I'm<00:03:12.600> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.780> stop

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
I mean to the left so I'm going to stop

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.030 
I mean to the left so I'm going to stop
building<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:14.370> center<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.290> cells<00:03:16.290> more

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
building the center of the cells more

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.620 
building the center of the cells more
towards<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.730> right

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.130 

that<00:03:23.630> way<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:25.430> way<00:03:25.460> is<00:03:25.910> put<00:03:26.660> back<00:03:26.870> on

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
that way the the way is put back on

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.850 
that way the the way is put back on
track

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.910 

you

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.910 

you<00:03:39.920> can<00:03:40.159> make<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:41.170> square<00:03:42.170> more<00:03:42.409> towards<00:03:42.769> the

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
you can make the square more towards the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.000 
you can make the square more towards the
right<00:03:43.150> by<00:03:44.150> making<00:03:44.329> sure<00:03:44.629> making<00:03:45.530> sure<00:03:45.799> this

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
right by making sure making sure this

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:57.910 
right by making sure making sure this
bottom<00:03:46.370> card<00:03:46.640> is<00:03:48.370> more<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.810> this<00:03:50.810> way<00:03:56.769> that<00:03:57.769> way

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
bottom card is more to this way that way

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.399 
bottom card is more to this way that way
the<00:03:58.069> center<00:03:58.430> of<00:03:58.519> that<00:03:58.730> cell<00:03:59.060> is<00:03:59.299> more<00:03:59.989> towards

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
the center of that cell is more towards

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.619 
the center of that cell is more towards
the<00:04:00.560> right<00:04:00.739> of<00:04:00.769> that<00:04:01.069> sour<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.670> that<00:04:02.269> is<00:04:02.420> my

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
the right of that sour and that is my

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:13.449 
the right of that sour and that is my
last<00:04:02.870> card<00:04:09.159> down<00:04:10.159> this<00:04:10.400> thing's<00:04:10.730> not<00:04:12.459> although

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
last card down this thing's not although

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.610 
last card down this thing's not although
I<00:04:13.730> did<00:04:14.060> mention<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:14.480> if<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.959> cards<00:04:15.290> are<00:04:15.379> both

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
I did mention that if the cards are both

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.580 
I did mention that if the cards are both
this<00:04:15.950> way<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:17.180> way<00:04:17.479> red<00:04:17.870> side<00:04:18.139> that<00:04:18.410> way

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
this way and this way red side that way

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.310 
this way and this way red side that way
then<00:04:19.130> build<00:04:19.549> a<00:04:19.699> white<00:04:20.090> side<00:04:20.479> out<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:21.019> it's

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
then build a white side out and it's

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.730 
then build a white side out and it's
easier<00:04:21.769> I<00:04:22.210> heard<00:04:23.210> from<00:04:23.449> the<00:04:23.630> pros<00:04:23.990> that<00:04:24.020> it's

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
easier I heard from the pros that it's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.330 
easier I heard from the pros that it's
harder<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:26.270> card<00:04:26.570> stack<00:04:26.990> if<00:04:27.289> the<00:04:27.800> cards<00:04:28.190> are

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
harder to card stack if the cards are

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.870 
harder to card stack if the cards are
all<00:04:28.370> warped<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.930> do<00:04:30.169> not<00:04:30.380> bend<00:04:30.919> them<00:04:31.220> on

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
all warped so do not bend them on

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.409 
all warped so do not bend them on
purpose

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
purpose

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.439 
purpose
you<00:04:35.419> might<00:04:35.750> want<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.050> unbend<00:04:36.590> them<00:04:37.060> but<00:04:38.060> the

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
you might want to unbend them but the

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.800 
you might want to unbend them but the
natural<00:04:38.690> bow<00:04:39.410> is<00:04:39.770> still<00:04:40.009> gonna<00:04:40.250> be<00:04:40.550> there<00:04:40.810> so

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810

so um this is just to show you guys that

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.640 
so um this is just to show you guys that
if<00:05:21.400> you<00:05:21.430> only<00:05:21.730> have<00:05:21.880> bicycle<00:05:22.660> cards<00:05:22.930> that's

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
if you only have bicycle cards that's

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:30.510 
if you only have bicycle cards that's
not<00:05:26.100> too<00:05:27.100> much<00:05:27.130> of<00:05:27.850> a<00:05:27.970> valid<00:05:28.390> excuse<00:05:29.050> I<00:05:29.520> will

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
not too much of a valid excuse I will

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.620 
not too much of a valid excuse I will
admit<00:05:30.880> this<00:05:31.060> is<00:05:31.300> pretty<00:05:31.690> difficult<00:05:33.180> so<00:05:34.180> I<00:05:34.210> will

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
admit this is pretty difficult so I will

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.980 
admit this is pretty difficult so I will
recommend<00:05:36.150> getting<00:05:37.150> some<00:05:37.510> not<00:05:38.400> bicycle<00:05:39.400> cards

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
recommend getting some not bicycle cards

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.460 
recommend getting some not bicycle cards
but<00:05:40.990> anyway<00:05:42.540> it's<00:05:43.540> not<00:05:43.750> totally<00:05:44.290> necessary

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
but anyway it's not totally necessary

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.620 
but anyway it's not totally necessary
but<00:05:45.160> it<00:05:45.310> is<00:05:45.460> a<00:05:45.490> challenge<00:05:46.030> and<00:05:46.270> it's<00:05:46.390> pretty

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
but it is a challenge and it's pretty

00:05:46.630 --> 00:06:22.999 
but it is a challenge and it's pretty
fun
