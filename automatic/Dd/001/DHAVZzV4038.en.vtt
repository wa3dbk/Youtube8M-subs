good visual clues to where the leak is
it<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.510> important<00:00:37.080> to<00:00:37.110> understand<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.800> when

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
it is important to understand that when

it is important to understand that when

doing an automotive HVAC leak test the
first<00:00:41.519> step<00:00:41.820> should<00:00:41.850> always<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> visual

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
first step should always be a visual

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:45.950 
first step should always be a visual
inspection<00:00:44.000> there<00:00:45.000> are<00:00:45.150> two<00:00:45.299> basic<00:00:45.720> ways<00:00:45.750> to
