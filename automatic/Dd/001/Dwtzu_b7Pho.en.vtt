00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:08.460
 The last week was crazy 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.710
 exciting week because it was e3 2015 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.049
 many games were announced 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.099
 many other games were shown and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.080
 I was with my colleagues 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.910
 from playing tips and even mona on the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.189
 fair about the games directly yourself 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.000
 try 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.350
 according to the last week want 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Of course we still have our highlights 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.599
 let pass and you can see that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.609
 now the three of 2015 was the hammer of it 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.560
 There were so many cool games too 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.170
 well-known names have convinced black 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.440
 ops assassin's creed and what is there 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.000
 everything was still my personal 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.160
 highlight if I now of these 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 big name, what is it? 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.500
 that it's so fast that that has me 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.180
 totally reminiscent of quake and I am pleased 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
 me on the shotgun and the chainsaw 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.910
 That may be a bit boring 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.320
 but my biggest highlight was 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.489
 probably the announcement of 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.559
 final fantasy 7 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.899
 I am pleased to be believed, we 15 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.460
 years on a remake and now happens 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.210
 is finally i have no idea how he is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.600
 that wants to do that 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.970
 a game that was 15 118 20 years ago 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.710
 seemed to make pretty pretty and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.159
 still playable for today's standards 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.840
 do 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.770
 no idea how that should work 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.750
 but I trust the guys because of that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.780
 Know exactly how valuable this ip is 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.009
 and if you pack that 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.900
 then i think i will have a little 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.750
 problem with the fans my personal 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.950
 Highlight was horizon because that was a 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.020
 I do not play with it at all 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.580
 I have stopped at the fair 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.869
 somehow got into this pk and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.310
 suddenly against the trailer going around 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.530
 At the beginning I thought so was 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.390
 It certainly will not be so 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.759
 mine and then suddenly this came 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.770
 Robot just out of nowhere 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.210
 out yes I thought it was pretty cool because 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.070
 the mixture simply from these two 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.750
 worlds this science fiction thing but 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.060
 not that typical science fiction 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.649
 but with nature elements mix totally 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.149
 class looks like the gamecom of 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.229
 guerrilla games and that's why you can 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.090
 actually rely on it 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.710
 that the gameplay is good, everything we do 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.329
 until now seen in the trailer looks 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.040
 very promising from the developer 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.509
 has promised me locally that it 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.040
 give a lot of roleplaying elements 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.899
 should there be synonymous dialogues 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.119
 which involve moral decisions 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.640
 All this sounds like something constructive 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.160
 I like it very much and then 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.229
 There was still a little game there 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.940
 I also have to do that again 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.310
 to the heart 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.900
 And that is broken that the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.300
 developer said that was so 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.960
 ajar all day and it has too 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.110
 played like this 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.480
 boss fight with each crowd and with 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.130
 a very sugar sweet graphic that 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.110
 you should also have a look if 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.060
 It's my biggest surprise outside 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.160
 The fair was personally bound 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.080
 so I did not expect because 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.090
 the first trailer totally looked like one 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.160
 mobile out so something that does me though 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.540
 but many people do not like it 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.220
 I was a little scared that 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.570
 whole into a pure multiplayer thing 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.820
 and then maybe not 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.690
 could be cool 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.220
 However, we have at the fair 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.170
 learn that it is also a singleplayer 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.940
 Mode gives or a campaign 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.010
 which can be played through in the head 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.330
 the whole thing felt with all the heroes 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.850
 which I could totally try 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.320
 fluid to totally fun and ultimately 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.610
 somehow very strong after one 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.620
 Borderlands what me as old 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.010
 Of course borderlands fan crazy 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.780
 pleased 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.760
 for all these reasons and of course 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.620
 also because of the comic stick lux and the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.330
 All the heroes are the ones 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.490
 replay value just very very strong 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.080
 I will be extremely excited about lifting 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.020
 Battle Bonn and more than that 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.640
 I thought at the beginning 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.080
 Another game that I like to do 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.900
 would call short that would be so for me 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.470
 a kind of otto robo people fallout 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.270
 shelter has me totally personal 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.560
 alone excited this announcement of 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.180
 geese that you willingly to the fair 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.090
 go fallout 4 show what by the way synonymous 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.410
 looks great then hey say it 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.510
 is also loud scheller and that is 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.940
 all very cute and totally great 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.980
 designed really liquid beautiful 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.380
 little games for ios and then say 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.269
 here on stage, just do it 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.090
 but sometimes with on your iphone 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.400
 and download it now 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.660
 that inspired me because something like that 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.160
 I always like it when you are 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.800
 really can get started right away and 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.239
 just because it's all people 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.470
 played in the snakes at the fair 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.450
 it is already for me 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.010
 thus under the game of the fair that 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.540
 second highlight is not that big 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.010
 but at least as cute 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.820
 actually much lower I speak 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.290
 from a level 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.850
 probably the gdl wants to play with this game 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.320
 from the own image something polish up 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.360
 because she is something different than this 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.680
 Great games but I believe it 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.090
 works because it's insane how 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.890
 far away from the announcement, I still thought 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.269
 Well, let's see that will be a bit 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.160
 calculated it we have such a 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.500
 Sweet mennicken and it's outside in 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.550
 the nature and cuddly but damn that 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.220
 the game is really working 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.290
 great is a really clever bus 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.820
 has company with a great look with 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.620
 a team of water really damn much 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.030
 heart blood and I believe it 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.410
 It's great that was ours 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.330
 highlights and concludes 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.010
 Of course the big question was what was 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.720
 now your highlight what has you on 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.520
 best which player by am 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.660
 best liked which announcement gives 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.970
 it may also be a game for you 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.170
 That would totally disappoint us 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.400
 Everybody is interested in writing it 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.720
 below in the comments 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.310
 and if you are not sure anymore 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.650
 Look what was shown 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.240
 past on giga de / 3 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.700
 for since you can now again all 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.800
 news all trailer all previews everything 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.700
 catch up with what appeared in the e3 week 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.700
 is a lot of fun
