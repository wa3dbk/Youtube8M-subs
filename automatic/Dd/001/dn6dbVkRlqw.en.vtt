corner<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:35.010> other<00:02:35.220> way<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.810> make<00:02:36.810> another

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
corner the other way and make another

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.700 
corner the other way and make another
line<00:02:37.910> forming<00:02:38.910> an<00:02:39.000> X<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> point<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.560> that

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
line forming an X and the point of that

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.650 
line forming an X and the point of that

anything hanging over either side and

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.790 
anything hanging over either side and
that<00:03:14.520> gets<00:03:14.700> more<00:03:14.880> tricky<00:03:15.240> when<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.800> the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
that gets more tricky when you do the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.060 
that gets more tricky when you do the
two<00:03:17.010> opposite<00:03:17.460> ends<00:03:18.470> make<00:03:19.470> sure<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.770> do<00:03:19.920> this

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
two opposite ends make sure to do this

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.950 
two opposite ends make sure to do this
side<00:03:20.340> straight<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:20.880> middle<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.660> this<00:03:24.810> is

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
side straight to that middle and this is

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.600 
side straight to that middle and this is
a<00:03:24.990> really<00:03:25.410> good<00:03:25.530> project<00:03:25.740> for<00:03:25.980> your<00:03:26.130> kids<00:03:26.400> to
