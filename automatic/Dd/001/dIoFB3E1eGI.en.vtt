going to go to the end but I think Miami

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.850

but<00:03:29.670> personally<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.180> think<00:03:30.630> FSU's<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.470> little

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
but personally I think FSU's a little

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.300 
but personally I think FSU's a little
bit<00:03:31.829> overrated<00:03:32.190> that's<00:03:32.790> me<00:03:33.079> I<00:03:34.100> think<00:03:35.100> it's

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
bit overrated that's me I think it's

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.530 
bit overrated that's me I think it's
going<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.640> be<00:03:35.700> fought<00:03:36.060> until<00:03:36.269> about<00:03:36.420> the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
going to be fought until about the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.240 
going to be fought until about the
fourth<00:03:36.810> quarter<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:37.920> think

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
fourth quarter and then I think

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.259 
fourth quarter and then I think
Oklahoma's<00:03:38.700> going<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.880> pull<00:03:39.030> away<00:03:39.120> and

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
Oklahoma's going to pull away and

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.819 
Oklahoma's going to pull away and
they're<00:03:39.600> gonna<00:03:39.660> win<00:03:39.840> by<00:03:39.959> two<00:03:40.019> touchdowns<00:03:40.230> I
