hello<00:00:00.390> everyone<00:00:00.810> today<00:00:01.050> we're<00:00:01.230> looking<00:00:01.380> at

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
hello everyone today we're looking at

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.999 
hello everyone today we're looking at
the<00:00:01.740> MIT<00:00:02.100> Windows<00:00:02.850> virus<00:00:03.360> now<00:00:04.350> it<00:00:04.589> looks<00:00:04.770> like

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
the MIT Windows virus now it looks like

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.280 
the MIT Windows virus now it looks like
a<00:00:05.040> text<00:00:05.759> document<00:00:05.899> normally<00:00:06.899> if<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.080> had<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
a text document normally if you had the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.740 
a text document normally if you had the
default<00:00:07.710> setting<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.250> Windows<00:00:08.580> 98<00:00:08.940> you

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
default setting on Windows 98 you

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.360 
default setting on Windows 98 you
wouldn't<00:00:10.050> be<00:00:10.139> able<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.380> see<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.710> executable

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
wouldn't be able to see the executable

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.259 
wouldn't be able to see the executable
so<00:00:12.240> you'd<00:00:12.540> probably<00:00:12.840> run<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.830> from<00:00:14.549> wherever

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
so you'd probably run this from wherever

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.810 
so you'd probably run this from wherever
you<00:00:15.420> go<00:00:15.599> thinking<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.230> was<00:00:16.320> legit<00:00:16.680> but<00:00:17.520> before

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
you go thinking it was legit but before

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.580 
you go thinking it was legit but before
we<00:00:17.940> run<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.270> I'm<00:00:18.779> gonna<00:00:18.930> go<00:00:19.140> ahead<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.410> show

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
we run it I'm gonna go ahead and show

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.620 
we run it I'm gonna go ahead and show
you<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:20.039> there's<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.609> few<00:00:20.880> files<00:00:21.300> that

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
you that there's a few files that

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.720 
you that there's a few files that
Windows<00:00:21.990> uses<00:00:22.410> whenever<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> restart<00:00:23.460> into

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
Windows uses whenever you restart into

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.189 
Windows uses whenever you restart into
dos<00:00:24.109> like<00:00:25.109> Dell<00:00:25.380> tree<00:00:26.119> 19<00:00:27.119> kilobytes<00:00:27.720> or<00:00:27.990> so

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
dos like Dell tree 19 kilobytes or so

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.400 
dos like Dell tree 19 kilobytes or so
and<00:00:28.859> they're<00:00:29.849> all<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.330> they're<00:00:31.260> all

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
and they're all here they're all

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.089 
and they're all here they're all
functioning

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
functioning

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.950

however<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.940> virus<00:00:33.300> goes<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> its<00:00:33.840> way

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
however this virus goes out of its way

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.500 
however this virus goes out of its way
to<00:00:34.130> overwrite<00:00:35.130> them<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:36.120> let's<00:00:36.239> go<00:00:36.329> ahead<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
to overwrite them so let's go ahead and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.130 
to overwrite them so let's go ahead and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
however it's zero bytes so it's been
