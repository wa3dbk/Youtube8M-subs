Cut<00:02:05.900> Pro<00:02:06.190> so<00:02:07.190> that's<00:02:07.340> pretty<00:02:07.580> unique<00:02:07.640> that's

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
Cut Pro so that's pretty unique that's

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.860 
Cut Pro so that's pretty unique that's
coming<00:02:08.510> soon<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.429> we<00:02:10.429> have<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.640> movie<00:02:11.060> shot<00:02:11.540> by

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870

film by Peter Jackson that he shot with
the<00:02:20.450> first<00:02:20.660> couple<00:02:21.290> cameras<00:02:21.770> we<00:02:21.920> had<00:02:22.100> freshly

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
the first couple cameras we had freshly

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.530 
the first couple cameras we had freshly
baked<00:02:22.940> out<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.239> oven<00:02:28.180> there's<00:02:29.180> healthy

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
baked out of the oven there's healthy

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.760 
baked out of the oven there's healthy
skepticism<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.260> then<00:02:30.380> there's<00:02:30.530> kind<00:02:30.739> of

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
skepticism and then there's kind of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.410 
skepticism and then there's kind of
foolish<00:02:30.950> skepticism<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:32.060> know<00:02:32.150> if<00:02:32.270> you're<00:02:32.390> a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
foolish skepticism you know if you're a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.520 
foolish skepticism you know if you're a
healthy<00:02:32.720> skeptic<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.230> you're<00:02:33.350> just

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
healthy skeptic and you're just

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.740 
healthy skeptic and you're just
interested<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.910> embracing<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.480> but<00:02:35.600> you're

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
interested and embracing it but you're

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.210 
interested and embracing it but you're
just<00:02:35.989> worried<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:36.350> this<00:02:36.680> thing<00:02:36.890> might<00:02:36.920> just

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
just worried that this thing might just

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.460 
just worried that this thing might just
be<00:02:37.340> too<00:02:37.520> good<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.790> be<00:02:37.880> true<00:02:37.930> well<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.350> know

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
be too good to be true well you know

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.660 
be too good to be true well you know
that's<00:02:39.620> okay<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:39.980> mean<00:02:40.190> there's<00:02:40.310> nothing<00:02:40.430> wrong

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
that's okay I mean there's nothing wrong

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.850 
that's okay I mean there's nothing wrong
with<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.940> it's<00:02:41.510> almost<00:02:41.630> too<00:02:42.230> impossible<00:02:42.500> to

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
with that it's almost too impossible to

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.900 
with that it's almost too impossible to
believe<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.340> something<00:02:43.550> like<00:02:43.730> this<00:02:43.850> is

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
believe that something like this is

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.670 
believe that something like this is
going<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.150> come<00:02:44.239> out<00:02:44.330> there<00:02:44.840> wasn't<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.290> working

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
going to come out there wasn't a working

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.170 
going to come out there wasn't a working
model<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.100> industry<00:02:46.489> had<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.820> that<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.060> was

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
model the industry had it that it was

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.880 
model the industry had it that it was
just<00:02:47.420> like<00:02:47.570> vaporware<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.709> was

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
just like vaporware that it was

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.310 
just like vaporware that it was
non-existent<00:02:49.310> yet<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.060> within<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.989> short

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
non-existent yet and within a short

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.930 
non-existent yet and within a short
amount<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.680> time<00:02:51.739> these<00:02:52.100> guys<00:02:52.130> managed<00:02:52.820> to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
amount of time these guys managed to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.210 
amount of time these guys managed to
pull<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.450> working<00:02:54.140> model<00:02:54.290> together<00:02:54.680> we<00:02:54.920> just

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
pull a working model together we just

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.340 
pull a working model together we just
saw<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.400> new<00:02:55.640> Peter<00:02:55.940> Jackson<00:02:56.570> short<00:02:56.870> film<00:02:57.170> on

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
it and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.410 
it and
quite<00:02:59.040> impressed<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.610> mean<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.790> physically<00:03:00.299> saw

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
quite impressed I mean I physically saw

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.970 
quite impressed I mean I physically saw
the<00:03:00.629> camera<00:03:01.049> i<00:03:01.080> touch<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.500> camera<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.799> looked

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
the camera i touch the camera I looked

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.130 
the camera i touch the camera I looked
in<00:03:02.069> its<00:03:02.220> viewfinder<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.540> working<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:03.989> me

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
in its viewfinder so it's working to me

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.830 
in its viewfinder so it's working to me
it's<00:03:05.040> not<00:03:05.190> smoking<00:03:05.819> mirrors<00:03:06.209> like<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.420> lot<00:03:06.720> of

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
it's not smoking mirrors like a lot of

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.960 
it's not smoking mirrors like a lot of
the<00:03:06.930> other<00:03:07.080> systems<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.430> see<00:03:08.670> here<00:03:08.700> at<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
the other systems that I see here at the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.660 
the other systems that I see here at the
enemy<00:03:09.150> or<00:03:09.480> like<00:03:10.080> in<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.290> past<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:11.010> seemed<00:03:11.489> from

what they said has come true some things

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.170 
what they said has come true some things
they've<00:03:27.150> scaled<00:03:27.480> back<00:03:27.659> on<00:03:27.900> but<00:03:28.170> they've

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
they've scaled back on but they've

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.130 
they've scaled back on but they've

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
continued to the development process

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.339 
continued to the development process
amazingly<00:03:31.950> quickly<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.840> seems<00:03:34.049> like<00:03:34.200> they've

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
amazingly quickly it seems like they've
