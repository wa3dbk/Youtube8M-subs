00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
okay we're going to talk about warping

okay we're going to talk about warping
the<00:00:05.040> multi<00:00:05.609> loom<00:00:05.819> today<00:00:06.770> this<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.570> four<00:00:09.570> inch

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
the multi loom today this is a four inch

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.220 
the multi loom today this is a four inch
that's<00:00:11.250> already<00:00:11.610> finished<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.630> knit

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
that's already finished this is knit

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.490 
that's already finished this is knit
picks<00:00:13.790> fingering<00:00:14.790> weight<00:00:14.820> yarn<00:00:15.440> and<00:00:16.440> I

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
picks fingering weight yarn and I

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.230 
picks fingering weight yarn and I
thought<00:00:16.650> I'd<00:00:16.830> use<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.220> lightweight<00:00:17.520> yarn<00:00:17.970> so

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
thought I'd use this lightweight yarn so

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.849 
thought I'd use this lightweight yarn so
maybe<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.840> could<00:00:18.960> see<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> little<00:00:19.410> better<00:00:19.619> what

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
maybe you could see a little better what

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.970 
maybe you could see a little better what
was<00:00:19.949> happening<00:00:20.480> this<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> 4<00:00:22.109> inch<00:00:22.350> multi

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
was happening this is a 4 inch multi

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.650 
was happening this is a 4 inch multi
that<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.609> started<00:00:24.380> weaving<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:26.269> but<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.300> think

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
that I started weaving on but I think

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.529 
that I started weaving on but I think
I'll<00:00:27.810> use<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.230> 2<00:00:28.439> inch<00:00:28.680> because<00:00:29.359> it'll<00:00:30.359> go<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
I'll use the 2 inch because it'll go a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.530 
I'll use the 2 inch because it'll go a
little<00:00:30.810> faster<00:00:32.300> okay

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
little faster okay

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.160 
little faster okay
this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> 2<00:00:34.290> inch<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.630> loom<00:00:36.630> has<00:00:36.899> this

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
this is the 2 inch the loom has this

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.369 
this is the 2 inch the loom has this
small<00:00:37.770> pin<00:00:38.760> down<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.690> mark<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> starting

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
small pin down here to mark the starting

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.250 
small pin down here to mark the starting
corner<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> should<00:00:41.010> be<00:00:41.190> toward<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.360> the

that's<00:00:53.489> all<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.910> about<00:00:54.860> you<00:00:55.860> start<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.730> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that's all I know about you start with a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.810 
that's all I know about you start with a
slipknot<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.280> most<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.699> these

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
slipknot as you do on most of these

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.039 
slipknot as you do on most of these
looms<00:01:00.890> they<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.070> over<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.460> top<00:01:02.579> two<00:01:03.210> pins<00:01:03.600> and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
looms they go over the top two pins and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.219 
looms they go over the top two pins and
the<00:01:04.170> bottom<00:01:04.470> two<00:01:04.619> pins<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.030> side<00:01:06.299> there

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.950 

then<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.380> bring<00:01:10.590> your<00:01:10.650> yarn<00:01:11.010> around<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:12.600> next

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
then you bring your yarn around the next

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
then you bring your yarn around the next
two<00:01:13.140> pins<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.830> into<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> slot<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.610> but

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
two pins and into the slot you go up but

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.429 
two pins and into the slot you go up but
it<00:01:17.759> doesn't<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.420> slot<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.990> time<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
it doesn't go in the slot this time it

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.190 
it doesn't go in the slot this time it
goes<00:01:19.619> past<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.210> around<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> next

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
goes past the one and around the next

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.530 
goes past the one and around the next
two<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.490> between<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.150> first<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
two so you go between the first and

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.380 
two so you go between the first and
second<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.140> around<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> next<00:01:25.979> two<00:01:26.390> between

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
second and around the next two between

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.620 
second and around the next two between
the<00:01:27.509> first<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.930> second<00:01:28.350> around<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> next<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
the first and second around the next to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.870 
the first and second around the next to
repeat<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.810> across<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:32.100> instructions<00:01:32.729> are

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
repeat that across the instructions are

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.120 
repeat that across the instructions are
the<00:01:32.970> same<00:01:33.259> whether<00:01:34.259> they're<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.829> little

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the same whether they're for this little

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.640 
the same whether they're for this little
two<00:01:35.310> inch<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.790> whether<00:01:35.970> they're<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.560> any<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
two inch or whether they're for any of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.920 
two inch or whether they're for any of
the<00:01:37.740> other<00:01:37.890> sizes<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> exactly<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the other sizes you do it exactly the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.249 
the other sizes you do it exactly the
same<00:01:39.960> way<00:01:40.369> come<00:01:41.369> down<00:01:41.670> between<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.899> last<00:01:43.079> two

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
same way come down between the last two

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.539 
same way come down between the last two
pins<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.820> last<00:01:45.030> pin<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> corner<00:01:45.869> pin<00:01:46.549> okay

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
pins the last pin in the corner pin okay

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.450 
pins the last pin in the corner pin okay
now<00:01:48.030> you're<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> come<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.460> around

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
now you're going to come up and around

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.289 
now you're going to come up and around
that<00:01:50.850> slot<00:01:51.299> through<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.049> slot<00:01:52.820> back<00:01:53.820> over

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
that slot through that slot back over

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.719 
that slot through that slot back over
between<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.229> second<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.799> third<00:01:55.920> pins<00:01:56.460> on

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
between the second and third pins on

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.230 
between the second and third pins on
this<00:01:56.909> side<00:01:57.829> so<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.979> go<00:01:59.159> around<00:01:59.250> those<00:01:59.610> two<00:01:59.939> and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
this side so you go around those two and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.569 
this side so you go around those two and
you<00:02:00.299> come<00:02:00.479> back<00:02:00.689> through<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> slot<00:02:02.210> then<00:02:03.210> it's

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
you come back through the slot then it's

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.160 
you come back through the slot then it's
between<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.850> first<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.240> second<00:02:06.689> around<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
between the first and second around the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.710 
between the first and second around the
next<00:02:07.469> two<00:02:08.030> you're<00:02:09.030> going<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.539> back

next two you're going to be going back

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.830 
next two you're going to be going back
through<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> slot<00:02:11.060> between<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.450> first<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
through the slot between the first and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.699 
through the slot between the first and
second

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
second

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.080 
second
around<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> next<00:02:14.640> two<00:02:14.939> I<00:02:16.519> hope<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.670> can<00:02:17.849> see

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
around the next two I hope you can see

around the next two I hope you can see
this<00:02:18.329> because<00:02:18.599> it's<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.439> little<00:02:19.680> awkward

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
this because it's a little awkward

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.130 
this because it's a little awkward
winding<00:02:22.079> it<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.349> way<00:02:23.569> okay<00:02:24.569> when<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.840> get<00:02:24.959> up

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
to this corner you go there's two here

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.559 
to this corner you go there's two here
two<00:02:29.250> here<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.609> you're<00:02:29.909> going<00:02:30.060> around<00:02:30.239> these

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
two here so you're going around these

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.160 
two here so you're going around these
three<00:02:30.900> pins<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.620> then<00:02:32.459> back<00:02:32.700> down<00:02:33.170> between

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
three pins and then back down between

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.759 
three pins and then back down between
the<00:02:34.319> second<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.799> third<00:02:36.889> and<00:02:37.889> up<00:02:39.439> around<00:02:40.439> two

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
the second and third and up around two

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.300 
the second and third and up around two
and<00:02:41.639> up<00:02:42.120> you'll<00:02:42.599> come<00:02:42.870> up<00:02:43.019> into<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.829> slot<00:02:44.099> this

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
and up you'll come up into the slot this

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.089 
and up you'll come up into the slot this
time<00:02:44.989> okay<00:02:45.989> then<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.290> go<00:02:46.439> around<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.859> empty

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
time okay then you go around the empty

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.890 
time okay then you go around the empty
peg<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.639> one<00:02:47.790> next<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:48.689> it's

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
peg and the one next to it so it's

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.000 
peg and the one next to it so it's
around<00:02:49.709> two<00:02:51.709> down<00:02:52.709> through<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.489> slot<00:02:55.010> around

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
around two down through the slot around

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.369 
around two down through the slot around
those<00:02:56.250> two<00:02:57.469> up<00:02:58.469> to<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.829> slot<00:02:59.099> down<00:03:00.079> around<00:03:01.079> two

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
those two up to the slot down around two

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.869 
those two up to the slot down around two
and<00:03:02.959> skip<00:03:03.959> one<00:03:04.230> same<00:03:04.680> thing<00:03:04.980> okay<00:03:05.459> now<00:03:05.669> you're

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
and skip one same thing okay now you're

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.220 
and skip one same thing okay now you're
back<00:03:06.060> down<00:03:06.329> here<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:09.239> this<00:03:09.419> corner<00:03:09.689> this<00:03:10.079> is

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
back down here to this corner this is

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.170 
back down here to this corner this is
where<00:03:10.379> you<00:03:10.530> start<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:11.159> actual<00:03:11.489> weaving<00:03:12.000> so

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
where you start the actual weaving so

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.149 
where you start the actual weaving so
we're<00:03:12.329> going<00:03:12.419> to<00:03:12.480> go<00:03:12.689> around<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.139> Loom<00:03:13.349> four

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
we're going to go around the Loom four

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:21.770 
we're going to go around the Loom four
times<00:03:14.719> one<00:03:16.129> two<00:03:17.659> three<00:03:19.459> four<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.790> wind<00:03:21.479> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
times one two three four you wind the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.009 
times one two three four you wind the
yarn<00:03:22.169> around<00:03:22.979> the<00:03:23.280> outside<00:03:23.819> gives<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.930> an

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
yarn around the outside gives you an

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.780 
yarn around the outside gives you an
easy<00:03:25.169> measurement<00:03:25.829> as<00:03:25.949> you<00:03:26.099> see<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.310> skipped<00:03:26.669> a

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
easy measurement as you see I skipped a

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.659 
easy measurement as you see I skipped a
little<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.209> I'll<00:03:27.359> just<00:03:27.599> add<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> little<00:03:28.669> down

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
little so I'll just add a little down

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:39.530 
little so I'll just add a little down
here

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:48.399 

got<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.890> blunt<00:03:41.890> needle

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.890 

thread<00:03:49.099> the<00:03:49.129> needle<00:03:49.280> which<00:03:49.819> should<00:03:50.329> be<00:03:50.480> quite

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
thread the needle which should be quite

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.229 
thread the needle which should be quite
easy<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:51.530> obviously<00:03:52.159> isn't<00:03:52.430> gonna<00:03:52.700> work

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
easy and obviously isn't gonna work

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.640 
easy and obviously isn't gonna work
the<00:03:53.810> first<00:03:54.049> time<00:03:59.139> it's<00:04:00.139> not<00:04:00.260> going<00:04:00.379> to<00:04:00.469> work<00:04:00.560> a

you will always go over if you're doing

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.400 
you will always go over if you're doing
a<00:04:22.160> pattern<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:22.700> don't<00:04:22.730> count<00:04:23.240> that<00:04:23.360> one<00:04:23.720> but

to<00:06:32.280> fall<00:06:32.460> apart<00:06:32.690> okay<00:06:34.280> so<00:06:35.280> basically<00:06:35.490> that's

to fall apart okay so basically that's

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.170

it<00:06:39.350> you'll<00:06:40.350> end<00:06:40.560> up<00:06:40.680> with<00:06:41.520> a<00:06:41.550> small<00:06:41.880> square

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
it you'll end up with a small square

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.260 
it you'll end up with a small square
that<00:06:42.390> looks<00:06:42.630> like<00:06:42.840> this<00:06:43.080> one
