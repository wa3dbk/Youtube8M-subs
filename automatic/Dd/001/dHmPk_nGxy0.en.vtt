00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.700
 Just b It is our design 2 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.570
 Having various functions a 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.269
 It is a panel , etc. will take space on the right side 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.390
 Hmm 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.530
 It is when is the mother-in-law Inter 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:24.460
 The kind of daikon leaves may be quite small, but it may be a cooperative standard 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.460
 And I think we also can be performed easily certain in called Toka is the adoption of soup professional in Cinco 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.860
 The application is now Kedomo It is also now I had a look at the photo shock 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.770
 Switch over 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.770
 We are starting a silver design 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:55.520
 For example, it means that to produce the paper media as a breeder in such form 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:59.170
 I think that the place was often do what what Toka is a confirmation of the final color 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:03.100
 This time is 99% of rigged rgb 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.430
 Since there however say that color calibration has been taken in such a way that 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.900
 Even without the You're Asaza part-time workers say the confirmation of the next section 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.190
 I think that one can see Riku on the monitor for 12 minutes 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.960
 I will 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.500
 Also but we You are me actually this is to expand 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.409
 It is 5 in bigger size 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.000
 Even though is I Now size 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.270
 Since it also can you go in larger size 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.490
 Where is it necessary to reduce 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.490
 It can be expanded and confirmed 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.440
 That's where you say 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.540
 After all color is of course work is also wide 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.350
 It can be used very efficiently 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 In addition it is one of the web-like guitar display manager 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:57.540
 My mother told me earlier, but yesterday I thought it was very effective for me 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.540
 Though it works like this now 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.560
 For example, from the client 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.399
 The pdf of law and politics has been sent 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.399
 I will appraise a little 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.270
 It is a necessary part in 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.270
 Flavored salmon 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.800
 For example, correction space 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.800
 Hey That's right 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.320
 The day that I have been around here 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.320
 If you have to 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.630
 This is right 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.630
 now 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:49.700
 You can see it, it's a large space, it's split up now 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:54.230
 This has become a function of easy kindergarten 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.879
 First, move to the space where you need it 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.879
 Then I want to fix this part 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.070
 I will expand a little in the form of 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.780
 In age after age you are indesign 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.780
 This is better than above 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:21.170
 Here is smooth now 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.170
 Can you plan what has been fixed in the chain ? 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:32.520
 It is necessary to work while switching various applications . 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.760
 Depending on the wide screen, it is easy to do the work of the ramen shop which was maintained as needed 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.760
 To go 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:44.590
 Also while it is an example in the meaning of work while 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.590
 Look at the website 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:56.580
 For example how to test an empty video 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.580
 It is that part if there is a very part of the information, such as anxious now 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:08.950
 When pulling as information to the mark when something while watching here 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.950
 So far I think that there was a movement direction only with a wide screen 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:21.170
 Actually this is what ustream did for me the other day 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.770
 But while looking at what's this it 's another task to worry about what a par here 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.800
 Pick up 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.379
 This is a very fine setting too 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.379
 The good child can be purchased at garden 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.800
 Unfortunately 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.800
 The big one 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.790
 I thought to 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:23.210
 And the fact that the well is fine in it more than Lecco functions are also the by friendly 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.210
 We feel myself 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:33.560
 Well, as you saw, it's a design tool that's actually working. 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.750
 If this display compatibility is good 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:45.490
 I think and also people of the producer, especially those who use digital difference 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.490
 Well, as an app media, it's easy to spend money with a card reader here 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.960
 I also thought 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.650
 By all means It is Tomo here also told the Inter and take advantage of our Pretty part tool 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.540
 It is 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:03.850
 If it is written that further efficiency of design work is written 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:06.240
 Since it has contrary prevention It is here monitor all means to raise rockfish, even those of you 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.240
 If you can 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.139
 I would like to be more from me Thank you very much
