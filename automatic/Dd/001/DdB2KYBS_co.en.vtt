what are your thoughts on the trend of
trainers<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:09.840> drivers<00:00:10.349> using<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.800> social

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
trainers and drivers using the social

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.680 
trainers and drivers using the social
media<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.639> discuss<00:00:12.030> their<00:00:12.210> horses<00:00:12.509> before

media to discuss their horses before

media to discuss their horses before
they<00:00:12.870> race<00:00:13.110> well<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.130> think<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.429> great<00:00:14.549> I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
they race well I think it's great I

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.980 
they race well I think it's great I
think<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:14.969> part<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.269> today<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.690> new<00:00:15.809> wage

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
think it's part of today the new wage

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.349 
think it's part of today the new wage
you<00:00:16.260> know<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:17.130> have<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.400> gift<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.910> time<00:00:18.060> horse

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
you know we have the gift of time horse

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.170 
you know we have the gift of time horse
racing<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.350> little<00:00:19.590> back<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.820> time<00:00:21.029> so

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
racing it's a little back of the time so

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.700 
racing it's a little back of the time so
this<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.510> another<00:00:21.779> step<00:00:22.050> closer<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
this is just another step closer to the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.560 
this is just another step closer to the
new<00:00:23.250> age<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> great<00:00:24.060> idea<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.390> teach

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
new age it's a great idea to teach

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.269 
new age it's a great idea to teach
people<00:00:24.750> current<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
people current and I like the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.000 
people current and I like the
interaction<00:00:26.580> I'm<00:00:27.269> not<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.019> does<00:00:28.800> it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
interaction I'm not one that does it

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.370 
interaction I'm not one that does it
there<00:00:29.220> but<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.849> each<00:00:30.029> his<00:00:30.060> own<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:31.170> guess

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
there but to each his own and I guess

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.780 
there but to each his own and I guess
that<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.710> young<00:00:31.890> people<00:00:32.309> have<00:00:32.430> been<00:00:32.489> very

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
that the young people have been very

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.970 
that the young people have been very
successful<00:00:33.480> at<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:33.989> shows<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
successful at it this shows that the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.190 
successful at it this shows that the
guys<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.399> do<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> lot<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> success

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
guys that do it do have a lot of success

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100 
guys that do it do have a lot of success
it's<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.860> anything<00:00:38.160> else<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.610> guess<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.989> have

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
it's like anything else I guess you have

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.139 
it's like anything else I guess you have
to<00:00:40.230> catch<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.800> times<00:00:41.070> there's<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:41.969> not

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
to catch up with times there's just not

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.319 
to catch up with times there's just not
my<00:00:42.329> thing<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:44.399> see<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.000> people

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
my thing but I can see that the people

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.430 
my thing but I can see that the people
that<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.809> doing<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.520> successful<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.240 

as<00:00:52.440> long<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.370> stays<00:00:56.329> I<00:00:58.010> don't<00:00:59.010> think<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
as long as it stays I don't think you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.099 
as long as it stays I don't think you
should<00:00:59.399> give<00:00:59.550> exact<00:00:59.969> strategy<00:01:00.570> away<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.870> know

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
should give exact strategy away you know

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
should give exact strategy away you know
then<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.559> other<00:01:01.680> drivers<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
then the other drivers see it or the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.429 
then the other drivers see it or the
other<00:01:02.879> trainer<00:01:03.180> SIA<00:01:03.510> tell<00:01:03.809> their<00:01:03.989> driver<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
other trainer SIA tell their driver and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.490 
other trainer SIA tell their driver and
then<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> little<00:01:06.140> fix<00:01:07.140> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
then it can get a little fix kind of the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.950 
then it can get a little fix kind of the
surprise<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.240> think<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
surprise out of it but I think it's a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.399 
surprise out of it but I think it's a
good<00:01:10.049> idea<00:01:10.820> well<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.939> guess<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.510> info<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.260> they

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
good idea well I guess a info that they

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
good idea well I guess a info that they
can<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> fans<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:15.150> good<00:01:15.450> thing<00:01:15.659> I

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
is a good thing I'm not sure that can

come back to bite you I think not sure
that's<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> real<00:01:29.100> good<00:01:29.189> idea<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:30.090> already

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that's a real good idea it's already

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.630 
that's a real good idea it's already
what<00:01:30.479> works<00:01:30.659> out<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.290> doesn't<00:01:31.740> it's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
what works out but if it doesn't it's

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.819 
what works out but if it doesn't it's
not<00:01:32.790> much<00:01:32.939> fun<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.110> definitely<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.530> lot

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
not much fun but it's definitely a lot

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.249 
not much fun but it's definitely a lot
of<00:01:34.860> betters<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.579> probably<00:01:35.909> and

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
of betters like it probably and

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.260 
of betters like it probably and
something<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.740> think

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
something like I think

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.870 
something like I think
some<00:01:39.260> major<00:01:39.740> betters<00:01:40.280> might<00:01:40.460> not<00:01:40.580> like<00:01:40.729> it<00:01:40.760> as

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
some major betters might not like it as

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.130 
some major betters might not like it as
much<00:01:40.909> because<00:01:41.180> they<00:01:41.360> come<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.659> qualifiers

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
much because they come the qualifiers

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.630 
much because they come the qualifiers
they<00:01:42.320> study<00:01:42.590> all<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:42.770> kind<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.159> stuff<00:01:43.250> dawned

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
they study all that kind of stuff dawned

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.330 
they study all that kind of stuff dawned
and<00:01:44.420> they<00:01:45.049> get<00:01:45.200> guys<00:01:45.650> like<00:01:45.680> going<00:01:46.010> on<00:01:46.100> Twitter

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
to use and maybe take a look at and see

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.900 
to use and maybe take a look at and see
maybe<00:03:37.770> they<00:03:38.010> miss<00:03:38.190> something<00:03:38.430> maybe<00:03:38.730> they

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
maybe they miss something maybe they

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.550 
maybe they miss something maybe they
didn't<00:03:39.180> know<00:03:39.210> something<00:03:39.630> there's<00:03:40.260> lots<00:03:40.440> of

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
didn't know something there's lots of

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.280 
didn't know something there's lots of
times<00:03:40.770> where<00:03:41.180> maybe<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.300> felt<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.840> didn't

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
times where maybe I felt that I didn't

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.490 
times where maybe I felt that I didn't
give<00:03:43.410> my<00:03:43.500> horse<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.830> very<00:03:44.010> good<00:03:44.160> trip<00:03:44.370> or<00:03:44.610> or<00:03:45.500> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
give my horse a very good trip or or the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.000 
give my horse a very good trip or or the
horse<00:03:46.790> wasn't<00:03:47.790> on<00:03:48.030> his<00:03:48.360> a-game<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.890> I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
horse wasn't on his a-game and and I

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.100 
horse wasn't on his a-game and and I
fully<00:03:50.190> expect<00:03:50.370> me<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.730> be<00:03:50.940> on<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.480> next<00:03:51.630> at<00:03:51.930> the

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
fully expect me to be on the next at the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.380 
fully expect me to be on the next at the
next<00:03:52.380> start<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.800> mean<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.520> those<00:03:54.000> types<00:03:54.240> of

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
next start I mean that those types of

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.150 
next start I mean that those types of
things

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
things

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.740 
things
I<00:03:56.220> think<00:03:56.580> our<00:03:56.700> industry<00:03:56.850> especially<00:03:57.240> more

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
I think our industry especially more

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.860 
I think our industry especially more
than<00:03:57.900> any<00:03:58.050> other<00:03:58.380> any<00:03:58.740> other<00:03:58.950> industry<00:03:59.220> where

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
than any other any other industry where

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.120 
than any other any other industry where
it<00:04:00.870> should<00:04:01.140> be<00:04:01.260> really<00:04:01.470> beneficial<00:04:01.950> for

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
it should be really beneficial for

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.290 
it should be really beneficial for
people<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.640> are<00:04:02.790> looking<00:04:03.630> for

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
people that are looking for

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.300 
people that are looking for
looking<00:04:06.020> for<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.230> inside<00:04:06.530> track<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.070> speak

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
looking for the inside track so to speak

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.930 
looking for the inside track so to speak
I<00:04:08.020> think<00:04:09.020> it's<00:04:09.110> great<00:04:09.320> but<00:04:09.790> everyone<00:04:10.790> just

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
I think it's great but everyone just

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.890 
I think it's great but everyone just
kind<00:04:11.060> of<00:04:11.090> got<00:04:11.210> to<00:04:11.240> be<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.390> little<00:04:11.570> more<00:04:11.690> careful

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
kind of got to be a little more careful

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.050 
kind of got to be a little more careful
what<00:04:12.410> they<00:04:12.440> say<00:04:12.770> you<00:04:13.010> can't<00:04:13.250> get<00:04:13.370> yourself<00:04:13.730> in

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
what they say you can't get yourself in

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.700 
what they say you can't get yourself in
trouble<00:04:14.150> saying<00:04:14.480> certain<00:04:14.780> things<00:04:14.810> but<00:04:15.680> I

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
trouble saying certain things but I

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.910 
trouble saying certain things but I
think<00:04:16.360> overall<00:04:17.360> people<00:04:17.630> just<00:04:17.810> do<00:04:18.440> it<00:04:18.530> properly

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
think overall people just do it properly

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.170 
think overall people just do it properly
and<00:04:19.130> use<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.430> for<00:04:19.459> what<00:04:19.670> it<00:04:19.760> should<00:04:19.790> be<00:04:20.030> used

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
and use it for what it should be used

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.550 
and use it for what it should be used
for<00:04:20.300> then<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.050> can<00:04:21.140> be<00:04:21.230> great<00:04:21.380> for<00:04:21.500> the

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
for then it can be great for the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.730 
for then it can be great for the
industry<00:04:22.600> well<00:04:23.600> if<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:23.870> works<00:04:24.110> for<00:04:24.380> them<00:04:24.500> and

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
industry well if it works for them and

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.500 
industry well if it works for them and
it's<00:04:25.340> probably<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:25.760> good<00:04:25.880> thing<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.240> don't<00:04:26.300> see

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
it's probably a good thing I don't see

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.750 
it's probably a good thing I don't see
any<00:04:26.780> harm<00:04:27.050> coming<00:04:27.440> from<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:27.950> you're<00:04:28.400> involved

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
any harm coming from it you're involved

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.300 
any harm coming from it you're involved
with<00:04:28.850> more<00:04:29.030> people<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:30.010> you<00:04:31.010> know<00:04:31.100> they're

with more people and you know they're

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.350 
with more people and you know they're
probably<00:04:31.550> used<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:32.000> be<00:04:32.120> prolong<00:04:32.450> anyways<00:04:33.020> I

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
probably used to be prolong anyways I

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.450 
probably used to be prolong anyways I
love<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:35.540> you<00:04:35.660> know<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:35.960> it's<00:04:36.710> great<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:37.100> gives

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
overall I think the more information

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.079 
overall I think the more information
that<00:06:38.439> you<00:06:38.469> can<00:06:38.680> give<00:06:38.830> the<00:06:39.129> public<00:06:39.459> the<00:06:39.699> battery

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:40.089 
that you can give the public the battery

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:42.239 
that you can give the public the battery
you<00:06:40.629> know<00:06:40.749> we<00:06:40.869> should<00:06:41.050> be<00:06:41.080> as<00:06:41.529> transparent<00:06:41.830> as

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:42.249 
you know we should be as transparent as

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:44.670 
you know we should be as transparent as
we<00:06:42.339> possibly<00:06:42.399> can<00:06:43.059> be<00:06:43.270> and<00:06:43.300> if<00:06:44.110> it<00:06:44.289> gives<00:06:44.409> a

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
we possibly can be and if it gives a

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.439 
we possibly can be and if it gives a
better<00:06:45.039> an<00:06:45.309> edge<00:06:45.459> and<00:06:45.699> he<00:06:45.759> takes<00:06:45.969> the<00:06:46.089> interest

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
better an edge and he takes the interest

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:48.119 
better an edge and he takes the interest
and<00:06:46.599> the<00:06:46.659> driver<00:06:46.990> the<00:06:47.259> trainer<00:06:47.499> wants<00:06:47.800> to<00:06:47.919> be

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
and the driver the trainer wants to be

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:49.350 
and the driver the trainer wants to be
telling<00:06:48.430> them<00:06:48.520> I<00:06:48.610> think<00:06:48.789> it's<00:06:48.909> good<00:06:49.330> for

telling them I think it's good for

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.439 
telling them I think it's good for
everybody<00:06:49.689> it's<00:06:50.019> a<00:06:50.080> win-win
