00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.249 
material for years and one of the one of
the<00:00:11.509> concepts<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.630> talk<00:00:12.780> about<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.110> something

Tajima jiu-jitsu matches a lot as a guy
will<00:00:41.100> look<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.520> long<00:00:41.700> way<00:00:41.850> home<00:00:41.879> when<00:00:42.360> if

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
will look for the long way home when if

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.750 
will look for the long way home when if
he<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.469> open<00:00:43.620> his<00:00:43.860> mind<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.190> his<00:00:44.280> eyes<00:00:44.460> he

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
he was to open his mind in his eyes he

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.090 
he was to open his mind in his eyes he
would<00:00:44.850> see<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> shorter<00:00:45.329> way<00:00:45.450> home<00:00:45.649> yeah<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.920> see

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
would see a shorter way home yeah so see

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.959 
would see a shorter way home yeah so see
no<00:00:47.190> VCT<00:00:47.460> close<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> 11<00:00:48.270> closest<00:00:48.600> target<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
no VCT close to 11 closest target is

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.430 
no VCT close to 11 closest target is
it's<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.420> performance<00:00:51.780> enhancement

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
it's a it's a performance enhancement

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.490 
it's a it's a performance enhancement
filter<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.879> you're<00:00:54.030> doing<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.840> again

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
filter so what you're doing is is again

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.260 
filter so what you're doing is is again
instead<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.579> after<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.879> favorite

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

move<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.320> said<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.829> know<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> long

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
move or like you said you know the long

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.029 
move or like you said you know the long
way<00:00:59.520> cuz<00:00:59.850> that's<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> comfortable<00:01:00.600> way<00:01:01.039> you

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
way cuz that's the comfortable way you

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.349 
way cuz that's the comfortable way you
know<00:01:02.129> people<00:01:02.399> haven't<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.730> targets<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
know people haven't have targets and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.850 
know people haven't have targets and
openings<00:01:03.750> all<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> time<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.589> look<00:01:04.799> at

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
openings all the time so if you look at

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.100 
openings all the time so if you look at
everybody<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> grid<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.270> every<00:01:06.900> part

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
everybody just as a grid and every part

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.179 
everybody just as a grid and every part
of<00:01:07.170> their<00:01:07.320> body<00:01:07.350> was<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> potential<00:01:08.340> target<00:01:10.189> you

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
of their body was a potential target you

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.190 
of their body was a potential target you
start<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.520> move<00:01:11.670> differently<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.360> sometimes

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
start to move differently and sometimes

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.460 
start to move differently and sometimes
you'll<00:01:13.860> you'll<00:01:14.340> you'll<00:01:15.080> set<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> boost<00:01:16.409> so

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
you'll you'll you'll set up a boost so

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
you'll you'll you'll set up a boost so
the<00:01:16.590> application<00:01:17.130> directly<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.759> let's<00:01:18.000> say

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the application directly for let's say

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.390 
the application directly for let's say
jujitsu<00:01:18.689> would<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:22.400> behaviorally

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
jujitsu would be to to behaviorally

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.380 
jujitsu would be to to behaviorally
feign<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.119> realistic<00:01:25.100> effort<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:27.119> could

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
feign a realistic effort to what could

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.660 
feign a realistic effort to what could
be<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.780> target<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.890> person<00:01:29.100> has<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.400> defend

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
be a target the person has to defend

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.100 
be a target the person has to defend
again<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.119> against<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> they<00:01:30.840> set<00:01:31.020> up

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
again it's against it they set up

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.600 
again it's against it they set up
something<00:01:31.320> else<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.710> people<00:01:31.979> play<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.400> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
something else so people play that you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
something else so people play that you

that's that's organizing orchestrating

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.260 
that's that's organizing orchestrating

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
slides out a little bit so you go to the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.480 
slides out a little bit so you go to the
you<00:01:52.350> know<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.500> ankle<00:01:52.890> lock<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.250> that's<00:01:53.369> how

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
you know the ankle lock and that's how

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.580 
you know the ankle lock and that's how
people<00:01:53.640> see<00:01:54.000> literally<00:01:54.899> closest<00:01:55.439> weapon

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
people see literally closest weapon

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.950 
people see literally closest weapon
closest<00:01:56.009> target<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.460> opposed<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.360> thinking

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
closest target as opposed to thinking

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.410 
closest target as opposed to thinking
way<00:01:58.229> outside<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.680> box<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.460> we've<00:02:00.060> always<00:02:00.270> used

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
way outside the box so we've always used

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.139 
way outside the box so we've always used
it<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.259> performance<00:02:01.680> model<00:02:02.219> we've<00:02:02.969> also

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
it as a performance model we've also

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.880 
it as a performance model we've also
used<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.750> protective<00:02:04.320> model<00:02:04.619> because

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
used it as a protective model because

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.590 
used it as a protective model because
the<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.310> dangerous<00:02:05.640> fighters<00:02:06.299> may<00:02:06.540> be

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the really dangerous fighters may be

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.100 
the really dangerous fighters may be
looking<00:02:06.960> at<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.330> in<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.869> way

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
looking at you you know in in that way

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.059 
looking at you you know in in that way
and<00:02:10.289> we<00:02:10.379> talked<00:02:10.530> about<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.920> know<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
and we talked about you know the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.220 
and we talked about you know the
psychology<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.760> predator<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.420> prey<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.930> a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
psychology of predator and prey and a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.710 
psychology of predator and prey and a
lot<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.530> times<00:02:13.709> it's<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:15.150> know<00:02:15.270> two

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
lot of times it's it's it's you know two

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.860 
lot of times it's it's it's you know two
people<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.230> equal<00:02:16.800> stature<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.540> how

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
people of equal stature in and how

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.180 
people of equal stature in and how
they're<00:02:19.110> looking<00:02:19.470> at<00:02:19.590> each<00:02:19.709> other<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.010> going

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
they're looking at each other is going

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.280 
they're looking at each other is going
to<00:02:20.250> determine<00:02:20.489> things<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.629> it's<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> it's

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
to determine things and it's the it's

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.900 
to determine things and it's the it's
the<00:02:22.470> person<00:02:23.040> if<00:02:23.099> this<00:02:23.250> shortest<00:02:23.610> distance

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the person if this shortest distance

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.660 
the person if this shortest distance
between<00:02:23.970> two<00:02:24.750> points<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.230> straight<00:02:25.319> line

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
between two points is a straight line

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.240 
between two points is a straight line
though<00:02:26.670> again<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.209> use<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.480> as<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.660> metaphor

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
though again we use that as a metaphor

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.190 
though again we use that as a metaphor
then<00:02:29.250> what<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.030> what<00:02:30.569> does<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.870> move

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
then what is that what does that move

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.940 
then what is that what does that move
that's<00:02:31.620> gonna<00:02:31.739> make<00:02:32.099> me<00:02:33.230> react<00:02:34.230> as<00:02:34.530> opposed<00:02:34.830> to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
that's gonna make me react as opposed to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.740 
that's gonna make me react as opposed to
respond<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:35.670> psychologically<00:02:36.209> if<00:02:36.629> I'm<00:02:36.720> a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
respond so psychologically if I'm a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.729 
respond so psychologically if I'm a
fighter<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.670> hit<00:02:38.970> my<00:02:39.690> closest<00:02:40.290> target

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
fighter in and you hit my closest target

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.740 
fighter in and you hit my closest target
what<00:02:41.610> that's<00:02:41.790> going<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:41.970> do<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.209> produce<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
what that's going to do is produce the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.380 
what that's going to do is produce the
greatest<00:02:43.050> reaction<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:44.160> me<00:02:44.640> emotional

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
greatest reaction in me emotional

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.660 
greatest reaction in me emotional
psychological<00:02:45.780> physical<00:02:46.319> put<00:02:47.069> me<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.280> flux

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
psychological physical put me in flux

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.920 
psychological physical put me in flux
and<00:02:47.940> give<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.330> best<00:02:48.480> chance<00:02:48.599> to

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
and give you the best chance to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.740 
and give you the best chance to
capitalize<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:51.569> is<00:02:51.720> very

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
capitalize on that it this is very

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.600 
capitalize on that it this is very
esoteric<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.590> very<00:02:52.739> subtle<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.280> not<00:02:53.430> so

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
esoteric and very subtle it's not so

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.240 
esoteric and very subtle it's not so
it's<00:02:54.300> not<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.510> same<00:02:54.720> as<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.739> know<00:02:55.860> well

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
it's not the same as like you know well

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.440 
it's not the same as like you know well
I'm<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.400> gonna<00:02:56.519> charge<00:02:56.879> him<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.180> take<00:02:57.330> him

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
I'm just gonna charge him and take him

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.880 
I'm just gonna charge him and take him
down<00:02:57.659> you<00:02:58.170> know<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.500> know<00:02:58.709> that's

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
down you know that you know that's

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.430 
down you know that you know that's
that's<00:02:59.659> it's<00:03:00.659> not<00:03:00.720> what<00:03:00.930> we're<00:03:01.050> talking<00:03:01.379> about

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
that's it's not what we're talking about

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.199 
that's it's not what we're talking about
and<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:01.830> there's<00:03:02.010> there's<00:03:02.220> there's<00:03:02.610> some<00:03:02.849> you

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
and so there's there's there's some you

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.509 
and so there's there's there's some you
know<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.330> few<00:03:03.659> very<00:03:03.930> deep<00:03:04.230> elements<00:03:05.099> one<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.400> to

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
know a few very deep elements one is to

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.449 
know a few very deep elements one is to
always<00:03:05.550> think<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.390> as<00:03:07.349> a<00:03:07.409> 360<00:03:08.250> degree

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
always think of it as a 360 degree

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.309 
always think of it as a 360 degree
principle<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.239> says<00:03:09.450> well<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:10.050> know<00:03:10.140> what

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
principle that says well you know what

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.800 
principle that says well you know what
am<00:03:10.409> i<00:03:10.500> exposing<00:03:10.920> myself<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:12.150> my<00:03:12.330> opponent

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
am i exposing myself to to my opponent

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.350 
am i exposing myself to to my opponent
so<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.530> if<00:03:14.129> somebody<00:03:14.670> does<00:03:14.849> something<00:03:15.000> it's

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
so if if somebody does something it's

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.449 
so if if somebody does something it's
telegraphic<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.319> me<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.739> gives<00:03:16.950> me<00:03:17.099> between

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
telegraphic to me that gives me between

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.330 
telegraphic to me that gives me between
stimulus<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.000> response<00:03:18.470> you've<00:03:19.470> got<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.890> gap

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
stimulus and response you've got a gap

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.830 
stimulus and response you've got a gap
time<00:03:20.640> between<00:03:21.060> there<00:03:21.239> that's<00:03:21.450> where<00:03:21.599> we<00:03:21.629> make

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
time between there that's where we make

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.070 
time between there that's where we make
decisions<00:03:22.319> if<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.459> shorten<00:03:23.879> that<00:03:24.300> time<00:03:24.690> I

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
decisions if I shorten that time I

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.330 
decisions if I shorten that time I
change<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.099> amount<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:27.260> analytic

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
change the amount of analytic

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.030 
change the amount of analytic
neuromuscular<00:03:29.659> responses<00:03:30.659> I<00:03:30.750> can<00:03:30.900> make<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:31.860> we

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
neuromuscular responses I can make so we

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.460 
neuromuscular responses I can make so we
produce<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.610> greatest<00:03:33.060> amount<00:03:33.239> of

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
produce the greatest amount of

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.509 
produce the greatest amount of
psychological<00:03:34.470> impact<00:03:34.890> if<00:03:35.159> we're<00:03:35.340> less

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
psychological impact if we're less
