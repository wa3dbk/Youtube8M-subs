00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
big blob here this is not right this is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.600 
big blob here this is not right this is
it<00:00:40.680> at<00:00:40.829> least<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.309> pretty<00:00:41.879> yes<00:00:43.190> one<00:00:44.190> two<00:00:44.579> three

it at least not pretty yes one two three
you<00:00:45.539> need<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.410> make<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.649> pedal<00:00:47.390> fat<00:00:48.390> from

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you need to make the pedal fat from

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.760 
you need to make the pedal fat from
outside<00:00:49.520> this<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> pedal<00:00:51.180> shape<00:00:51.660> right<00:00:52.079> fat

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
outside this is a pedal shape right fat

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.990 
outside this is a pedal shape right fat
from<00:00:53.070> outside<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.640> close<00:00:56.969> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
from outside and the more it's close to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.270 
from outside and the more it's close to
the<00:00:57.420> center<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:59.070> smaller<00:00:59.520> it<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:02.160> will

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the center the smaller it is so we will

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.760 
the center the smaller it is so we will
do<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> flower<00:01:02.969> real<00:01:03.629> flower<00:01:05.240> 11<00:01:06.240> pedal<00:01:07.250> to

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
do a flower real flower 11 pedal to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:22.570 
do a flower real flower 11 pedal to
swing

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.360 

this<00:01:23.240> way<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.690> that<00:01:23.870> easy<00:01:24.170> for<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.740> see<00:01:24.950> so
