it<00:05:15.690> does<00:05:15.870> work<00:05:16.110> heyhow<00:05:17.010> yes<00:05:17.340> then<00:05:17.580> there<00:05:17.730> is

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
it does work heyhow yes then there is

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.000 
it does work heyhow yes then there is
the<00:05:18.000> way<00:05:18.180> also<00:05:18.690> to<00:05:18.930> place<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.350> wire<00:05:19.530> there's

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
the way also to place the wire there's

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.550 
the way also to place the wire there's
only<00:05:20.160> one<00:05:20.370> direction<00:05:20.630> it<00:05:21.630> can't<00:05:21.900> go<00:05:21.990> backwards

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
only one direction it can't go backwards

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.980 
only one direction it can't go backwards
otherwise<00:05:22.860> it's<00:05:23.130> bird<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.610> wrong<00:05:23.790> way<00:05:24.000> anyhow

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
otherwise it's bird the wrong way anyhow
