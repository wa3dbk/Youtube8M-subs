00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 very good kids how are you but 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.310
 I'm great, perfectly 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.379
 welcome to a new video on my channel 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.660
 today I bring you a little game that has 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.519
 a game started in check we were going 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.639
 losing and at the end so curiously 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.080
 we managed to overcome the game 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.029
 Quite more I know how to put you 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.189
 little things in the background when in the ballet or 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.439
 in the comic camouflage I love this 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.449
 camouflage and good as you will be reading 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.640
 in the title I do not know what title I will put 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.779
 but something about how good I am a commentator 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.360
 of the top snipers of optique esp to see what 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.240
 I explain if it is true that I have 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.700
 knowing black 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.830
 a lot of time and I've done some that 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.920
 another collaboration in leaving of notiese of 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.900
 Some other time and talking to him 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.810
 He said that if I would be interested then 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:52.520
 back to optic to stay with the section 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.350
 of the top snipers and what you think and do 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.640
 very much that I did not do it and I say good 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.750
 come then for me was going to be fixed in the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.810
 optique snipers tops esp the truth 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.180
 is that I am very happy because 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:12.270
 have again I am this opportunity 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.200
 and I'm not very excited I'm going to 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.159
 tell because last weekend 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.719
 I was in Madrid in the weekend japan 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.640
 I liked nothing because I did not think either 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:25.850
 nothing interesting to record then if it's 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.170
 true that yes yes recorded videoblogs the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.759
 videoblogs we like but in their 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.250
 simple video blog because it did not add anything 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.619
 the case that I was in the weekend japan and 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.090
 I was with black with ricky with a lot 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.740
 people and I jumped black fire and the whole of 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.259
 the hyper this week that I say that 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.719
 this is cards you tell me that on Monday 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.619
 that starts on Monday I say has the best 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.780
 to this new monday to my house then I 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.099
 I had to stay at home on Monday 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.479
 ricky because in Madrid I stayed at home 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:58.250
 from ricky I had to take your computer 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.649
 select all the clips the problem 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.380
 it's not the problem is that ricky has mac 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.659
 I do not know how to use mac in my turn 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.270
 windows and I optima lost with everything from 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.850
 a roundabout and afternoon 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.320
 he told me good blas if you have a lot 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.510
 in fact if you have a lot of work then nothing 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.150
 I'm looking for someone, whatever I do 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.130
 late like five hours without exaggerating or 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.250
 less more than ricky helped me because if 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.820
 not for five hours to see me all 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.880
 clips select the clips that were worth and 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:33.720
 in putting it with its respective intro 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.870
 my face and I know that later I 'm 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.270
 looking at the top and if I do not see it I 'll leave it 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.310
 that came down from the description and the top 2 of 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.700
 skill yes that really should be 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.950
 in position 1 but is in a house 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.630
 who does not know with a computer that he does not 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.320
 dominate with a mic that is not yours and 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.730
 I know if it came out well on top and 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.800
 this week so good on Monday already 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.090
 you know the all the sniper tops are 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.760
 It goes up on Mondays so every Monday 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.440
 I'm going to stop by the channel 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.300
 before but what I did read that he told me 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.210
 many people that because I did not do the top 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.520
 snipers commented on by pro player 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.630
 it is clear that pro player is a 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.510
 My character in my channel and not apart 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.480
 I think it's pro player on the channel 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.030
 the tcp well he likes too much 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.010
 people so that's something more people 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.870
 of my channel that if one day I feel like it 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.030
 comment anything like pro player 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.670
 Well, if pro player wants to be 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.310
 I will comment but I will not do anything 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.200
 has it sticking commenting with pro player 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.330
 ok and who is the clear that he and a 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.750
 lots of comments also in the 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.300
 video and all the roll that I can not get 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.580
 to pro player on that channel because it's not 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.660
 my channel and is not used to the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.100
 people to see that kind of videos is worth it 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.480
 I guess since you are all so 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.830
 intelligent and so you will understand it and not 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.180
 little more than commenting I think it has 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.560
 to comment one more thing but I do not 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.690
 agreement right now so if I do not 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.180
 agreement will be what 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.099
 that was not important so 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.549
 every Monday I'm going to have the 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.500
 projector channel 12 sp with top snipers 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.109
 As I said, I'm very excited 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.949
 I have a lot of desire and the example 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.989
 it's over I had just had the one which 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.639
 freeze kill as if it was the 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.050
 taxation if I had done it well 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.699
 I could have taken out the geek water 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.660
 Campero if I put the fellow in front 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:31.460
 I covered my vision and I died 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.680
 so nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.990

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.240
