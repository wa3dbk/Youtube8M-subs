time and a lot of money you're not sort
of<00:01:15.289> replacing<00:01:15.979> parts<00:01:16.279> that<00:01:16.429> don't<00:01:16.609> need

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
of replacing parts that don't need

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.330 
of replacing parts that don't need
replacing<00:01:17.329> and<00:01:17.689> it<00:01:18.529> saves<00:01:18.799> you<00:01:18.950> getting<00:01:19.249> out

replacing and it saves you getting out

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.489 
replacing and it saves you getting out
multimeters<00:01:20.029> and<00:01:20.270> all<00:01:20.359> sorts<00:01:20.689> of<00:01:20.779> all<00:01:21.200> sorts

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
multimeters and all sorts of all sorts

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.849 
multimeters and all sorts of all sorts
of<00:01:21.560> stuff<00:01:21.799> so<00:01:23.139> so<00:01:24.139> some<00:01:24.289> of<00:01:24.349> the<00:01:24.469> features<00:01:24.590> of

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
of stuff so so some of the features of

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.760 
of stuff so so some of the features of
this<00:01:25.189> you<00:01:25.639> can<00:01:25.880> record<00:01:26.479> save<00:01:27.109> and<00:01:27.380> play<00:01:27.499> back

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
this you can record save and play back

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.719 
this you can record save and play back
your<00:01:28.069> data<00:01:29.029> so<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:30.319> can<00:01:30.499> you<00:01:30.799> can<00:01:31.279> plug<00:01:31.549> in<00:01:31.669> the

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
your data so you can you can plug in the

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.480 
your data so you can you can plug in the
machine<00:01:31.849> basically<00:01:32.740> go<00:01:33.740> for<00:01:33.919> a<00:01:34.009> drive<00:01:34.219> and

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
machine basically go for a drive and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.830 
machine basically go for a drive and
record<00:01:34.819> what<00:01:34.999> all<00:01:35.149> your<00:01:35.329> what<00:01:35.719> all<00:01:35.779> the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
record what all your what all the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.099 
record what all your what all the
sensors<00:01:36.169> are<00:01:36.289> doing<00:01:37.240> analyze<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.450> l8<00:01:38.810> state

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
sensors are doing analyze that l8 state

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.219 
sensors are doing analyze that l8 state
which<00:01:39.319> is<00:01:39.439> obviously<00:01:39.740> pretty<00:01:39.919> useful<00:01:41.109> you<00:01:42.109> can

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
which is obviously pretty useful you can

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.620 
which is obviously pretty useful you can
check<00:01:42.469> there<00:01:42.709> the<00:01:42.889> land<00:01:43.099> area<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.639> censor<00:01:44.270> the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
check there the land area to censor the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.999 
check there the land area to censor the
evap<00:01:44.989> system<00:01:46.119> you<00:01:47.119> can<00:01:47.270> view<00:01:47.539> live<00:01:48.380> data<00:01:48.709> as

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
evap system you can view live data as

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.289 
evap system you can view live data as
well<00:01:49.249> but<00:01:49.489> in<00:01:49.989> graph<00:01:50.989> format<00:01:51.380> as<00:01:52.189> well<00:01:52.399> as<00:01:52.579> just

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
well but in graph format as well as just

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.809 
well but in graph format as well as just
sort<00:01:53.479> of<00:01:53.509> like<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.869> figures<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.310> it's<00:01:55.609> kind<00:01:55.789> of

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
sort of like the figures so it's kind of

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:56.919 
sort of like the figures so it's kind of
that's<00:01:55.999> kind<00:01:56.119> of<00:01:56.299> quite<00:01:56.509> cool<00:01:56.659> I'm<00:01:56.749> looking

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
that's kind of quite cool I'm looking

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.179 
that's kind of quite cool I'm looking
forward<00:01:57.169> to<00:01:57.289> testing<00:01:58.039> that<00:01:58.099> out<00:01:59.799> you<00:02:00.799> can<00:02:00.829> also

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
forward to testing that out you can also

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.069 
forward to testing that out you can also
obviously<00:02:01.459> you<00:02:01.939> know<00:02:02.059> the<00:02:02.299> most<00:02:02.450> basic<00:02:02.899> level

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
obviously you know the most basic level

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:09.550 
obviously you know the most basic level
read<00:02:03.859> and<00:02:04.219> clear<00:02:04.520> fall<00:02:04.909> codes<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:09.380> yeah

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
read and clear fall codes and yeah

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.800 
read and clear fall codes and yeah
that's<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:09.920> I'm<00:02:10.009> just<00:02:10.129> gonna<00:02:10.280> gonna<00:02:10.789> take<00:02:11.689> it

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
that's it I'm just gonna gonna take it

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.020 
that's it I'm just gonna gonna take it
outside<00:02:11.959> I've<00:02:12.439> got<00:02:12.469> a<00:02:13.659> it's<00:02:14.659> a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
outside I've got a it's a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.240 
outside I've got a it's a
Forney's<00:02:15.330> car<00:02:15.750> with<00:02:16.140> Viterbo<00:02:16.680> that's<00:02:17.010> all<00:02:17.130> I'm

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
Forney's car with Viterbo that's all I'm

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:27.500 
Forney's car with Viterbo that's all I'm
gonna<00:02:17.370> say<00:02:25.490> okay<00:02:26.490> so<00:02:26.550> I'm<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:26.880> gonna<00:02:27.000> show

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
gonna say okay so I'm just gonna show

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.120 
gonna say okay so I'm just gonna show
you<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.780> couple<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.050> features<00:02:28.230> if<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
you a couple of features if the the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.510 
you a couple of features if the the
serious<00:02:29.580> six<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.739> mighty<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
serious six this is in the mighty the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.720 
serious six this is in the mighty the
mighty<00:02:32.790> Toyota<00:02:33.270> Yaris<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.980> just<00:02:34.980> created<00:02:35.550> a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
mighty Toyota Yaris I just created a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.900 
mighty Toyota Yaris I just created a
fault<00:02:35.940> code<00:02:36.150> by<00:02:36.420> unplugging<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.350> MAF<00:02:37.500> sensor

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
fault code by unplugging the MAF sensor

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.460 
fault code by unplugging the MAF sensor
so<00:02:38.910> we're<00:02:39.450> gonna<00:02:39.540> see<00:02:39.780> if<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.110> pick<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.380> up

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
so we're gonna see if it can pick it up

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.790 
so we're gonna see if it can pick it up
and<00:02:40.739> then<00:02:41.040> hopefully<00:02:41.250> clear<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:42.680> it's<00:02:43.680> gonna

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
and then hopefully clear it it's gonna

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.720 
and then hopefully clear it it's gonna
put<00:02:44.069> ignition<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:47.160> live<00:02:49.459> connect<00:02:50.459> to

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
put ignition on to to live connect to

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:07.730 
put ignition on to to live connect to
the<00:02:50.820> car<00:02:51.380> takes<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.470> few<00:02:52.620> seconds

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.270 

okay<00:03:08.740> so<00:03:09.100> read<00:03:09.520> codes<00:03:12.750> should<00:03:13.750> be<00:03:14.130> checked<00:03:15.130> the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
okay so read codes should be checked the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.520 
okay so read codes should be checked the
car<00:03:15.490> before<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.330> there's<00:03:16.510> no<00:03:16.660> codes<00:03:16.960> now<00:03:17.290> so

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
car before and there's no codes now so

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.340 
car before and there's no codes now so
it's<00:03:17.980> gonna<00:03:18.100> be<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.660> something<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:19.900> there<00:03:20.080> now

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.920 

cool<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:23.770> that's<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:24.070> p0<00:03:24.700> 100<00:03:25.270> mass<00:03:25.600> or<00:03:25.900> volume

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
cool so that's a p0 100 mass or volume

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.030 
cool so that's a p0 100 mass or volume
airflow<00:03:26.770> a<00:03:26.950> circuit<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.930> that's<00:03:29.080> good<00:03:32.040> let's

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
airflow a circuit so that's good let's

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:41.740 
airflow a circuit so that's good let's
go<00:03:33.250> back<00:03:34.110> try<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.230> clear<00:03:35.440> that

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:53.910 

sorry<00:03:42.440> ray<00:03:42.950> skates<00:03:46.900> yes<00:03:47.900> I<00:03:48.290> am<00:03:48.470> sure

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.180 

okay<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:56.080> claims<00:03:57.080> have<00:03:57.230> now<00:03:57.380> been<00:03:57.560> cleared<00:03:57.830> so

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
okay so claims have now been cleared so

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.140 
okay so claims have now been cleared so
if<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.700> go<00:03:58.880> back<00:03:59.050> three<00:04:00.050> codes

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
if I go back three codes

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.080 
if I go back three codes
DTC's<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:04.100> vehicle<00:04:04.370> has<00:04:04.490> no<00:04:04.520> float<00:04:04.850> codes

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
DTC's the vehicle has no float codes

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:13.270 
DTC's the vehicle has no float codes
Wilson<00:04:10.630> you<00:04:11.630> know<00:04:11.660> just<00:04:12.140> turn<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.770> car<00:04:12.950> on<00:04:13.010> now

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
Wilson you know just turn the car on now

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.820 
Wilson you know just turn the car on now
and<00:04:13.550> I<00:04:13.700> have<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.450> look<00:04:14.570> at<00:04:14.720> some<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.170> data

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
and I have a look at some of the data

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.849 
and I have a look at some of the data
graphing<00:04:16.430> which<00:04:16.609> I<00:04:20.470> think<00:04:21.470> could<00:04:21.560> be<00:04:21.620> pretty

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
graphing which I think could be pretty

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:30.510 
graphing which I think could be pretty
pretty<00:04:22.580> useful<00:04:23.000> in<00:04:23.150> diagnosing<00:04:23.900> some<00:04:24.470> funds

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.710 

so<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.580> can<00:04:31.850> you<00:04:32.090> got<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.270> couple<00:04:32.450> of<00:04:32.540> choices

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
so you can you got a couple of choices

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.690 
so you can you got a couple of choices
you<00:04:33.050> can<00:04:33.200> you<00:04:33.590> can<00:04:33.770> kind<00:04:33.950> of<00:04:34.010> either<00:04:34.220> view<00:04:34.460> all

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
you can you can kind of either view all

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.150 
you can you can kind of either view all
the<00:04:34.820> data<00:04:35.230> in<00:04:36.230> kind<00:04:36.560> of<00:04:36.620> numerical<00:04:37.040> format<00:04:39.160> you

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
the data in kind of numerical format you

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.909 
the data in kind of numerical format you
say<00:04:40.400> go<00:04:40.640> the<00:04:40.990> coolant<00:04:41.990> temperature<00:04:42.140> is

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
say go the coolant temperature is

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.460 
say go the coolant temperature is
permanent<00:04:43.550> vehicle<00:04:43.970> speeds<00:04:44.210> but<00:04:44.510> I'm<00:04:44.810> parked

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
permanent vehicle speeds but I'm parked

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:53.840 
permanent vehicle speeds but I'm parked
up<00:04:45.680> side

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.879 

intake<00:04:54.850> air<00:04:55.090> temperature<00:04:55.440> my<00:04:56.440> data<00:04:58.889> during

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
intake air temperature my data during

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.409 
intake air temperature my data during
this<00:05:00.100> fair<00:05:01.030> enough<00:05:01.240> I<00:05:01.389> suppose<00:05:02.040> but<00:05:03.240> it's<00:05:04.240> kind

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
this fair enough I suppose but it's kind

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.760 
this fair enough I suppose but it's kind
of<00:05:04.450> more<00:05:04.600> interesting<00:05:05.230> to<00:05:06.810> do<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:07.960> graphically

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
of more interesting to do it graphically

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.230 
of more interesting to do it graphically
like<00:05:09.070> a<00:05:09.310> graph<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.770> if<00:05:11.889> I<00:05:12.010> just<00:05:12.220> go<00:05:12.430> for<00:05:12.700> coolant

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
like a graph so if I just go for coolant

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:24.790 
like a graph so if I just go for coolant
temperature<00:05:14.280> engine<00:05:15.300> rpm

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.770 

so<00:05:25.669> I'm<00:05:25.879> not<00:05:25.970> sure<00:05:26.060> how<00:05:26.270> well<00:05:26.449> it's<00:05:26.569> coming

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
so I'm not sure how well it's coming

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.050 
so I'm not sure how well it's coming
from<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.050> screen<00:05:27.229> but<00:05:27.349> I<00:05:28.009> can<00:05:28.669> see<00:05:28.789> it<00:05:28.910> quite

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
from the screen but I can see it quite

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.180 
from the screen but I can see it quite
well<00:05:29.240> in<00:05:29.360> real<00:05:29.509> life<00:05:29.720> you<00:05:29.900> can<00:05:30.080> see<00:05:30.979> that<00:05:31.129> you

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
well in real life you can see that you

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.100 
well in real life you can see that you
got<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.460> black<00:05:31.879> bar<00:05:32.150> is<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.599> the<00:05:32.900> cooler

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
got the black bar is the the cooler

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.550 
got the black bar is the the cooler
temperature<00:05:33.860> and<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:35.180> red<00:05:35.360> one<00:05:35.599> is<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:35.900> the

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
temperature and the red one is the the

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.260 
temperature and the red one is the the
revs<00:05:36.770> per<00:05:37.069> minute<00:05:37.400> so<00:05:38.030> I<00:05:39.759> just<00:05:40.759> give<00:05:40.909> the<00:05:41.060> Frog

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
revs per minute so I just give the Frog

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.040 
revs per minute so I just give the Frog
away<00:05:42.729> pretty<00:05:43.729> heavy<00:05:43.970> engine<00:05:44.300> rising<00:05:44.720> up<00:05:44.840> there

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
away pretty heavy engine rising up there
