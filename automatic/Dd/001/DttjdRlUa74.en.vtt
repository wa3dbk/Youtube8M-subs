00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.169
 I do not complicate 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.570
 finally decided 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.169
 Ears Zurich really go the tour 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.689
 the DL write the blue haze in the 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.449
 percent 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.990
 after the 4-1 talk at Beijing at night 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.519
 Be cock

 please wait 27 No Nokia for a win 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.100
 sprayed the eyes 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.810
 The bicyclists should always show their need of high binder eyes that is 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.350
 to unpack 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.740
 that around 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.740
 we wanted 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.170
 so that offered 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.870
 then we have here 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.170
 supervised this class 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.600
 now you have to go no often enough 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.619
 Trend so with Windows Vista Euro and defeat you have percent 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.149
 thanks to say 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.850
 Percent result 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.300
 "You could be here 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.190
 to run at Bundesliga side against SC Heerenveen 40 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520
 So here 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.470
 made NK 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.670
 not KH anyway 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.720
 percent 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.070
 and press okay 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.810
 about the delivery 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.899
 then she's going to spit out my first-order curved that should be 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.930
 or as I do not 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.660
 Down because of 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.369
 below you will find one in the ranks of participants is a 2 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.020
 my God 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.210
 then he makes a right click 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.810
 Alflen with 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.810
 brakeman 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.940
 then services has things love 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.630
 Percent I have already staged this but is Zachrich until now 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.089
 I have been anyway 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:13.839
 So there is no need to have anything in Duisburg and be that big 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.869
 be written 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.209
 through the rows 4 distress 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.959
 then it should be clear 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.049
 so that's easy 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.049
 these files and pact them all 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:30.799
 and 70 just a not so good Waltham quotes him in the 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.799
 Ortenau want to let go in Oberding Plan crime 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.859
 then this message comes the pressure is okay 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.669
 then could close soon 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:48.029
 their start min the force now I do not know if I started the action 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.729
 Lehmann 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.729
 Eaton 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.919
 Yakin 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.389
 so clarify van Veen Xinet 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.869
 Euro at SU 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.869
 the tendency can 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.159
 the KÃ¶lsch 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.579
 so now 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.069
 there it is again it says here Esters 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.399
 Great I go or inventory 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.679
 and in Chemnitz I believe that this gene is open 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.449
 You can always do that as he can activate and deactivate, for example, Sven Betz Play 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:35.459
 The Willicher could make it that way Trockels could 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.169
 Percent to Moosburg 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.169
 even a small one 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.769
 he's stuck on Mr 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.319
 what you group 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.089
 a little explanation 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:51.299
 Erich Heftes so if I could use their block from the custom I just 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.299
 Jentzsch workshops 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.459
 ips-cells unimportant 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:03.629
 Here you really see 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.779
 We are still a few spent 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.909
 personally 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.559
 so far 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.559
 but for example, Google is solved 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.199
 accept 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.709
 for example 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.409
 it just could not sit down 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.409
 I also do not know just whispering percent but why 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.249
 we can 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:29.639
 and that could be the lion Nolan and her 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.539
 Seitz for explanation 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.710
 pressed in itk services 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.759
 gets the exactly one Sister Act 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.529
 is discovered 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.139
 just a blog 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.559
 if we now lettering so the 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.659
 is via ctrl or ctrl 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:48.979
 Shift 2 percent 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.979
 left click on Conti and eleven blocks 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.460
 it is still a bit St is the power 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.479
 and the number of drug-related deaths 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.279
 as you see 20 para 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.699
 had been made more individual by the century 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.699
 percent 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.050
 Dr 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.319
 and so you might have to build quite a distance and could always be in it 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.969
 such 70 remains 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.479
 Michels remains healthy 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.150
 so I am one now 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.389
 until the end it was still Bissendorfer Staufen for it 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.759
 should we want them to say all of us now 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.759
 Everything Tehran / Vienna Wellington 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.159
 1 in hand pressed font 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.359
 and scripts are star with Graz 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.789
 that is a 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:44.680
 percent 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.879
 to be with puts 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.879
 Cut the Zeppelin wood 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.969
 l 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.189
 yes I buy the TuS 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.110
 no goals fell and 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.789
 will comment Appel you know 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:05.999
 and percent 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.859
 Boris Palmer but also rip-off
