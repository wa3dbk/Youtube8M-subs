00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
so this is a battery here inside this

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.500 
so this is a battery here inside this
one<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.119> called<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.050> juicy<00:00:22.890> pack<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.820> it's

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
one this called the juicy pack and it's

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.080 
one this called the juicy pack and it's
sixteen<00:00:25.350> thousand<00:00:26.099> eight<00:00:26.340> hundred<00:00:26.369> milliamps

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
sixteen thousand eight hundred milliamps

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.900 
sixteen thousand eight hundred milliamps
now<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> put<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.590> into<00:00:28.800> perspective<00:00:29.010> usually

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
now to put that into perspective usually

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.610 
now to put that into perspective usually
an<00:00:30.000> iphone<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.769> around<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:33.230> 1500<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.440> like

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
an iphone is around like 1500 to like

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.280 
an iphone is around like 1500 to like
2000<00:00:35.100> milliamps<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:36.420> one<00:00:36.660> will<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.200> able

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
2000 milliamps so this one will be able

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.440 
2000 milliamps so this one will be able
to<00:00:37.710> charge<00:00:38.010> an<00:00:38.250> iphone<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> couple<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.239> times

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
to charge an iphone a couple of times

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.010 
to charge an iphone a couple of times
and<00:00:40.370> even<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.879> get<00:00:42.210> an<00:00:42.480> android<00:00:42.840> device

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and even like get an android device

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
which easily is a little bit bigger like

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.410 
which easily is a little bit bigger like
m2000<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.600> 3000<00:00:49.500> milliamps<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.160> mean<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.300> can

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
m2000 to 3000 milliamps I mean you can

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.180 
m2000 to 3000 milliamps I mean you can
kind<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.719> charge<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.710> an<00:00:52.860> android<00:00:53.160> device

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
kind of charge like an android device

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.549 
kind of charge like an android device
five<00:00:53.579> times<00:00:53.879> maybe<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.870> an<00:00:55.110> iPhone<00:00:55.440> like

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
let's see here if we can only focus on

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.749 
let's see here if we can only focus on
the<00:01:43.829> display<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:44.970> when<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.329> dark

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
it's when it this when you see it in

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.680 
it's when it this when you see it in
real<00:02:14.640> life<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:15.240> me<00:02:16.340> now<00:02:17.340> let's<00:02:17.790> try<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.120> out<00:02:18.300> see

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
real life on me now let's try it out see

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.750 
real life on me now let's try it out see
if<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.900> works<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.470> basically<00:02:19.830> how<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:19.950> works<00:02:20.370> is

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
if it works so basically how it works is

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.810 
if it works so basically how it works is
that<00:02:21.620> first<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:23.160> do<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.520> normal

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
that first you do have the normal

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.410 
that first you do have the normal
regular<00:02:24.380> cable<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.250> do<00:02:26.490> get<00:02:26.730> along<00:02:27.090> with
