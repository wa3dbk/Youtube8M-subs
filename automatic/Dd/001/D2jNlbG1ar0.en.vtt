00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.820
 So friends May holidays on example 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.430
 to the fullest and so we continue 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.230
 continue to lead our course html master 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.330
 thank you by the way for likes for what 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.039
 share my videos today we will 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.499
 continue with the forms 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.810
 and let's start with the input field 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:25.689
 the phone let's copy the box for 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.589
 email insert it below 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:33.430
 let's we replace gmail on phone tel 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:35.290
 background is great rick white I also delete this 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.110
 attribute here where we 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.590
 Attributes about and idi value change to 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.980
 background 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.020
 so that we specify the field 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.690
 to enter the phone us attribute value 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.910
 Type should be changed to the body with the mind in 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.960
 available browsers this will be the usual 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.660
 text field 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.240
 but if you sit for example from the phone and 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.070
 and click on it then you instead 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.830
 keyboard character 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.840
 A keyboard will appear to enter exactly 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.360
 numbers is there are numbers in general, all 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.299
 the necessary buttons to enter the phone number 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.010
 and immediately let us have joy 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.500
 I introduce you to another very interesting 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.420
 an attribute called max lance 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.610
 he specifies the maximum amount 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.250
 characters that can be entered 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.950
 form well how do you know the phone numbers 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.810
 they are limited in length I don't remember 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.720
 how many in the international format for 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.150
 I have 13 characters but I donâ€™t remember exactly 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.260
 let's check for example we bring here 5 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.240
 give them still reduce 12345 and then what 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.920
 i don't press anything else 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 afraid that is the maximum we can here 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.000
 lead 5 characters 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.190
 let us put here 13 and immediately 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.159
 saying that this attribute max lens you 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.280
 can apply and for water and soap and for 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.049
 bada any text and so on what about 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.360
 I think this is clear now let's 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.420
 move on to the next field for example we 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.560
 we also want to ask our visitor 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.070
 copy paste below 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.810
 enter your website address if there is 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.720
 let's we write here 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.289
 specify the site and let's write here 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.509
 is there a max lense let's we remove 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.150
 let's we write for example web here and 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.400
 here so that we start working 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.760
 we specify yrl now our browser it 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.349
 check here besides data entry on 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.390
 correct data entry for example 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.640
 let's we are basic here 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.829
 something like that and here for example I will enter 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.560
 Abracadabra click send and see 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:34.129
 see the website url as long as we do not keep 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.459
 normal http address : slash slash 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.260
 master css dot com and now we 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.569
 we can send this whole thing 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.670
 There is a check, so you can also 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.370
 use by the way on mobiles too 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.920
 here are these fields new e-mail phone site 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.780
 when we click on them if the browser is there 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.299
 advanced then there will be displayed 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.389
 corresponding keyboard for input 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.400
 It is the site of the phone and mail officially 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:01.370
 will be chosen and the characters that are more often 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.829
 just the next field we live it 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.139
 immediately warn remove from here 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.389
 because she doesn't fit in here 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.519
 This is a site search box. 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.040
 so immediately say that she was not originally 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.109
 works for this you need a handler 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.230
 let's change the value of the attributes 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.720
 Search here, enter the query 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.699
 specify the site let it remain this inscription 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.739
 because we will immediately remove this field 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.660
 from here and so here are friends to 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.209
 it worked we need to specify 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.579
 attribute to flop and now look in what 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.409
 the difference seems to be the same field but when we 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.639
 start driving him here with us 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.949
 a cross appears 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.930
 yes if we click it the field will start 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.790
 cleaned up and so basically with this field 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.159
 clear now let's get my out 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.870
 remove it we do not need the path and enter 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.030
 last field today 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.970
 it is already quite old used 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.129
 for a long time here here for example it will be 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.470
 form of registration on the site yes to him here 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.169
 write your password and so here 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.449
 enter password here let's change 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:02.479
 napas and here is the value of the type attribute 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:04.400
 we will have a passport here now and 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:07.159
 now see when we enter here 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.030
 any kind of information she is hiding behind 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.639
 dots 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.650
 here so this business all works well well 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.079
