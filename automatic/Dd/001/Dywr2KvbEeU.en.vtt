00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.450
 explanations 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.799
 Let's start by talking about the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.520
 channels I had a channel called 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.189
 giovanna samara that I created in 2009 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.509

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:37.320

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.180
 August practically September of the year 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.280
 past 2013 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.189
 I started posting my first series 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.270
 d da semes that was the island's challenge 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.189
 deserted 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.930
 That's when I changed the channel name. 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.390
 to giovanna week 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.110
 life followed the crime series and everything 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.850
 more 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.680
 the channel began to grow but still 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.350
 so I had many subscribers who 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.250
 were on the channel because of the songs and 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.619
 others were because of the games 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.770
 best of the game place there that I did 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.010
 I created a new gilcemar channel that 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:21.440

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.120

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.370

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.460

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.230

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.110

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.700

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.160
 city ​​at the time I paid $ 99 nowadays 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.360

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.170

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.570

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.180

 if I'm not mistaken or record games I did 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.580

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.490
