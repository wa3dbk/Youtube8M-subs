Apple<00:03:18.400> watch<00:03:18.519> apps<00:03:18.939> is<00:03:20.400> okay

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
Apple watch apps is okay

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.219 
Apple watch apps is okay
the<00:03:21.879> experience<00:03:22.329> you<00:03:22.419> get<00:03:22.569> really<00:03:22.840> depends<00:03:23.169> on

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:23.229 
the experience you get really depends on

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.809 
the experience you get really depends on
the<00:03:23.349> functionality<00:03:23.919> built<00:03:24.099> into<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.609> watch

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
the functionality built into the watch

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.089 
the functionality built into the watch
app<00:03:25.120> but<00:03:25.540> for<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:25.720> most<00:03:25.870> part<00:03:26.109> they<00:03:26.439> work<00:03:26.769> kind

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
app but for the most part they work kind

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.520 
app but for the most part they work kind
of<00:03:27.189> well<00:03:27.400> they're<00:03:28.030> just<00:03:28.269> slow<00:03:28.689> if<00:03:29.349> you're

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
of well they're just slow if you're

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.020 
of well they're just slow if you're
going<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.769> open<00:03:29.859> up<00:03:30.040> an<00:03:30.159> app<00:03:30.280> on<00:03:30.489> your<00:03:30.579> watch<00:03:30.819> to

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
going to open up an app on your watch to

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.189 
going to open up an app on your watch to
do<00:03:31.150> something<00:03:31.479> you're<00:03:31.629> probably<00:03:31.810> doing<00:03:32.109> it

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
do something you're probably doing it

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.449 
do something you're probably doing it
because<00:03:32.409> it's<00:03:32.560> faster<00:03:32.949> than<00:03:33.069> pulling<00:03:33.340> out

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
because it's faster than pulling out

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.939 
because it's faster than pulling out
your<00:03:33.489> phone<00:03:33.609> but<00:03:34.329> in<00:03:34.449> a<00:03:34.540> lot<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.930> cases<00:03:35.169> Apple

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
your phone but in a lot of cases Apple

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.429 
your phone but in a lot of cases Apple
watch<00:03:36.099> apps<00:03:36.340> are<00:03:36.579> so<00:03:37.060> slow<00:03:37.389> that<00:03:37.659> you<00:03:37.930> might<00:03:38.290> as

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
watch apps are so slow that you might as

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.349 
watch apps are so slow that you might as
well<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.859> take<00:03:39.040> out<00:03:39.189> your<00:03:39.310> phone<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.729> do<00:03:40.239> the

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
well just take out your phone and do the

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.119 
well just take out your phone and do the
same<00:03:40.509> action<00:03:40.930> at<00:03:41.079> the<00:03:41.319> same<00:03:41.500> speed<00:03:41.859> on<00:03:42.069> a

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
same action at the same speed on a

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.879 
same action at the same speed on a
bigger<00:03:42.759> screen<00:03:43.060> there<00:03:43.989> are<00:03:44.079> some<00:03:44.349> good<00:03:44.590> Apple

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
bigger screen there are some good Apple

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.499 
bigger screen there are some good Apple
watch<00:03:45.009> apps<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.579> lot<00:03:45.849> of<00:03:45.939> the<00:03:46.030> built-in<00:03:46.359> ones

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:46.509 
watch apps a lot of the built-in ones

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.449 
watch apps a lot of the built-in ones
are<00:03:46.720> actually<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.139> best<00:03:47.349> and<00:03:47.650> they<00:03:48.040> also<00:03:48.189> tend

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
are actually the best and they also tend

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.129 
are actually the best and they also tend
to<00:03:48.579> make<00:03:48.759> more<00:03:49.000> use<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.479> digital<00:03:49.750> crown

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
to make more use of the digital crown

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.899 
to make more use of the digital crown
but<00:03:50.709> for<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:50.889> most<00:03:51.040> part<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.489> would<00:03:51.579> describe

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
but for the most part I would describe

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.960 
but for the most part I would describe
the<00:03:52.150> app<00:03:52.299> experience<00:03:52.659> as<00:03:53.139> smooth<00:03:54.009> but<00:03:54.669> not

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
the app experience as smooth but not

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.629 
the app experience as smooth but not
fast<00:03:55.329> you<00:03:56.169> really<00:03:56.620> have<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.919> want<00:03:57.189> to<00:03:57.310> use<00:03:57.489> the

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
fast you really have to want to use the

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.069 
fast you really have to want to use the
watch<00:03:57.819> to<00:03:58.060> use<00:03:58.180> those<00:03:58.329> apps<00:03:58.540> but<00:03:58.810> it's<00:03:58.930> really

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
watch to use those apps but it's really

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.319 
watch to use those apps but it's really
best<00:03:59.409> at<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.919> notifications<00:04:00.759> so<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.090> Apple

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
best at is notifications so the Apple

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.059 
best at is notifications so the Apple
watch<00:04:01.449> is<00:04:01.689> really<00:04:02.139> good<00:04:02.290> at<00:04:02.469> just<00:04:02.739> quietly

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
watch is really good at just quietly

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.979 
watch is really good at just quietly

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.170 
to without ever touching my phone and
that's<00:04:17.380> what<00:04:17.620> smartwatches<00:04:18.070> should<00:04:18.820> be<00:04:18.969> good

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
that's what smartwatches should be good

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.300 
that's what smartwatches should be good
at<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.989> haptic<00:04:20.169> engine<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.859> watch<00:04:21.039> the

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
at the haptic engine in the watch the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.310 
at the haptic engine in the watch the
vibration<00:04:21.760> motor<00:04:21.940> is<00:04:22.150> actually<00:04:22.599> really<00:04:23.020> good

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
vibration motor is actually really good

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.409 
vibration motor is actually really good
too<00:04:23.500> it's<00:04:23.650> much<00:04:23.830> cleaner<00:04:24.219> and<00:04:24.430> better<00:04:24.940> feeling

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
too it's much cleaner and better feeling

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.670 
too it's much cleaner and better feeling
it's<00:04:25.810> almost<00:04:26.020> like<00:04:26.199> a<00:04:26.229> tap

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
it's almost like a tap

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.020 
it's almost like a tap
on<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.830> wrists<00:04:27.070> much<00:04:27.430> better<00:04:27.669> feeling<00:04:27.940> than

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
on the wrists much better feeling than

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.879 
on the wrists much better feeling than
any<00:04:28.210> other<00:04:28.330> SmartWatch<00:04:28.720> I've<00:04:28.870> used<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:29.350> it

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
any other SmartWatch I've used and it

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.920 
any other SmartWatch I've used and it
uses<00:04:30.130> that<00:04:30.490> subtle<00:04:30.880> tap<00:04:31.090> vibration<00:04:31.630> for<00:04:31.810> not

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
uses that subtle tap vibration for not

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.990 
uses that subtle tap vibration for not
only<00:04:32.050> notifications<00:04:32.770> but<00:04:33.340> reminders<00:04:33.850> and

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
only notifications but reminders and

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.550 
only notifications but reminders and
stuff<00:04:34.210> so<00:04:34.389> like<00:04:34.509> the<00:04:34.630> activity<00:04:35.020> tracker<00:04:35.259> which

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
stuff so like the activity tracker which

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.230 
stuff so like the activity tracker which
reminds<00:04:36.070> me<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.310> stand<00:04:36.550> up<00:04:36.729> every<00:04:36.820> once<00:04:37.090> in<00:04:37.180> a

reminds me to stand up every once in a

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.090 
reminds me to stand up every once in a
while<00:04:37.389> to<00:04:37.600> reach<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.960> fitness<00:04:38.289> goals<00:04:38.500> that

while to reach the fitness goals that

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.499 
while to reach the fitness goals that
was<00:04:39.280> cool<00:04:39.520> unless<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:39.970> was<00:04:40.060> telling<00:04:40.300> me<00:04:40.330> to

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
was cool unless it was telling me to

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.290 
was cool unless it was telling me to
stand<00:04:40.750> up<00:04:40.900> in<00:04:41.139> class<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:42.100> also<00:04:42.580> it's<00:04:42.910> used<00:04:43.120> for

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
stand up in class and also it's used for

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.749 
stand up in class and also it's used for
force<00:04:43.870> touch<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.800> Apple<00:04:45.039> watch's<00:04:45.340> display
