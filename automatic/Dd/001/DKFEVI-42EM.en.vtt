00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.490
 well my people here I bring you a new 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.619
 gameplay this time is a trick 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.770
 this trick is to get out of the 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.670
 table easily because I see this from 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.650
 the table but super complicated 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.460
 nothing to the gun I recommend 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:34.030
 to put marathon and light way yo 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.910
 that's what I did and the other thing is that when 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.900
 jump with the high school yo 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.730
 try to jump with the primary no no 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.790
 I tried it many times but it did not work out 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.410
 with this one I get out of here they throw a 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.040
 little and when making jump 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.260
 They rotate the camera as you are running one 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.410
 take a little to the side run and 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.040
 rotate the camera from here they can change 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.050
 you can look for here better pay you 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.790
 can look at the ones inside 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.040
 they can kill can not see 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.240
 this nothing and now for being here 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.180
 we jump and get off the map 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.909
 they can not enter for houses for 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.640
 house can not enter but they can 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.320
 sorry can see inside the house 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.040
 and shoot those who are inside 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.860
 houses 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.420
 they can go all around like 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.160
 now that I got into the corridors 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.740
 of pérez through the corridors where 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.540
 they leave me answer 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.000
 this the houses where they can only 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.720
 see the and then of course if you want to 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.940
 multiplayer 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.280
 As you can see you can kill those who 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.220
 they are in the vicinity 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.670
 in multiple and I recommend that 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.840
 do not use that they do not kill the kiel camps 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.990
 the last enemy that does not kill him 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.539
 and do not do it when they do it in 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.469
 hardcore so that people do not see it and 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:04.280
 so they do not go and as you can see the 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:06.890
 my friend climbed 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.030
 The other thing I want them to have is the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.209
 that jump and do not jump high and do not 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.250
 They do not kill that they will need a lot 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.520
 how can you see 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.650
 the partner was below the map and I 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.470
 he shot me and no matter how much I 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.470
 they shot they did not kill him if he killed me 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.470
 important lightweight marathon and what's 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.140
 that when they fall from 'the site 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.290
 high do not die here the two of us 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.980
 we climbed and we both threw ourselves well 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.980
 we throw the two 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.330
 if there is an enemy that is also what 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.880
 do the two can be killed under the 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.600
 Map 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.600
 wrong 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.500
 the other is the other 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.720
 you have to be very careful because if 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.580
 they run for off the map as they go to 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.100
 vélez in these moments if they run out 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.330
 of the map what it does is that it falls 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.340
 you see there you have to be very careful 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.760
 all over the map and I run and I have not 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.460
 fallen but here if this but nothing that 's 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.780
 all the video this I hope you like 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.340
 if you like to like it please 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.010
 keep doing the videos of these 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.010
 things and nothing see you until the next
