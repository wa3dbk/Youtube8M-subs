00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
disappointment was that the internet

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.889 
disappointment was that the internet
browser<00:01:55.750> does<00:01:56.020> not<00:01:56.200> open<00:01:56.560> all<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.399> web<00:01:57.520> sites

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:22.120 

I<00:02:15.130> gathered<00:02:16.130> in<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.350> loads<00:02:21.590> websites<00:02:22.040> just

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
I gathered in so it loads websites just

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.010 
I gathered in so it loads websites just
fine<00:02:22.490> but<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.090> browser<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.570> really<00:02:23.840> very

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
fine but it the browser is really very

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.860 
fine but it the browser is really very
slow<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:25.670> does<00:02:25.850> have<00:02:26.030> kinetic<00:02:26.360> scrolling

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
slow and it does have kinetic scrolling

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.720 
slow and it does have kinetic scrolling
which<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.500> very<00:02:27.770> cool<00:02:28.010> thing<00:02:28.070> for<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.550> phone

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
which is a very cool thing for a phone

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
which is a very cool thing for a phone
like<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:31.000> although<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.240> screen<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:32.600> not

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
like this and although the screen is not

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.110 
like this and although the screen is not
so<00:02:32.930> touch<00:02:33.110> sensitive<00:02:33.530> but<00:02:33.740> it<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:34.820> scroll

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
so touch sensitive but it you can scroll

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.620 
so touch sensitive but it you can scroll
through<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.510> just<00:02:35.810> like<00:02:36.650> any<00:02:36.920> other<00:02:37.070> phone<00:02:37.370> and

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
through it just like any other phone and

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.410 
through it just like any other phone and
it<00:02:38.630> loads<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.530> webpages<00:02:40.340> fully<00:02:40.850> but<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.240> takes

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
it loads the webpages fully but it takes

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.540 
it loads the webpages fully but it takes
a<00:02:41.540> very<00:02:41.660> long<00:02:41.780> time<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.320> load<00:02:42.500> them<00:02:42.710> so<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
a very long time to load them so the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.130 
a very long time to load them so the
browser<00:02:43.790> could<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:44.150> been<00:02:44.300> improved<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.870> lot

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
browser could have been improved a lot

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.100 
browser could have been improved a lot
but<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.680> does<00:02:46.370> work<00:02:46.580> back<00:02:46.970> button<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.540> certain

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
it does not support multi-touch so there

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.020 
it does not support multi-touch so there

automatically as you can see here which

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.040 
automatically as you can see here which
is<00:03:49.520> a<00:03:49.550> cool<00:03:49.730> feature<00:03:49.970> that<00:03:50.120> we<00:03:50.420> did<00:03:50.630> not<00:03:50.810> know

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
is a cool feature that we did not know

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.250 
is a cool feature that we did not know
about<00:03:51.080> but<00:03:51.920> it<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.190> working<00:03:52.790> really<00:03:53.420> nicely<00:03:53.570> in

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
about but it is working really nicely in

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.160 
about but it is working really nicely in
fact

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.830 

so<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:01.070> cool<00:04:01.250> feature<00:04:01.520> going<00:04:02.330> back<00:04:02.480> into<00:04:02.750> the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
so the cool feature going back into the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.260 
so the cool feature going back into the
menu<00:04:03.170> we<00:04:03.500> can<00:04:03.650> also<00:04:03.830> look<00:04:04.130> at<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.820> video

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
menu we can also look at the video

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.500 
menu we can also look at the video
recording<00:04:05.720> capability<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.940> does<00:04:08.120> record

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
recording capability and it does record

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.160 
recording capability and it does record
video<00:04:09.050> in<00:04:10.090> VGA<00:04:11.090> format<00:04:11.800> but<00:04:12.800> it<00:04:13.730> should<00:04:14.000> be

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
video in VGA format but it should be

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.560 
video in VGA format but it should be
pretty<00:04:15.170> alright<00:04:15.650> and<00:04:15.950> there<00:04:16.940> seems<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.300> be<00:04:17.450> no

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
pretty alright and there seems to be no

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.810 
pretty alright and there seems to be no
pixelation<00:04:18.230> and<00:04:18.440> I<00:04:18.590> will<00:04:18.770> have<00:04:18.920> a<00:04:18.950> video<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.610> a

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
pixelation and I will have a video and a

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.810 
pixelation and I will have a video and a
photo<00:04:20.060> sample<00:04:20.510> on<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.780> I<00:04:21.170> can<00:04:21.560> review<00:04:21.830> page<00:04:22.070> so

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
photo sample on the I can review page so

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.630 
photo sample on the I can review page so
you<00:04:22.880> can<00:04:23.090> have<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.240> look<00:04:23.390> at<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.600> closely<00:04:24.640> the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
you can have a look at that closely the

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.160 
you can have a look at that closely the
interface<00:04:26.030> seems<00:04:26.300> really<00:04:26.600> fast<00:04:26.870> and

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
interface seems really fast and

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.890 
interface seems really fast and
intuitive<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:28.100> does<00:04:28.670> not<00:04:28.820> seem<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.210> be<00:04:29.420> giving

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
intuitive and does not seem to be giving

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.500 
intuitive and does not seem to be giving
us<00:04:30.020> any<00:04:30.170> trouble<00:04:30.410> for<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.860> time<00:04:31.070> being<00:04:31.510> so

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510

coming<00:04:32.780> back<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.140> main<00:04:33.290> screen<00:04:33.620> I'll<00:04:34.190> just

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
coming back to the main screen I'll just

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.140 
coming back to the main screen I'll just
quickly<00:04:35.090> show<00:04:35.390> you<00:04:35.420> the<00:04:36.070> dialer<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:37.280> is<00:04:37.520> it<00:04:37.970> has

quickly show you the dialer it is it has
large<00:04:38.390> numbered<00:04:39.170> keys<00:04:39.410> so<00:04:39.620> it<00:04:39.710> is<00:04:39.860> very<00:04:40.070> fairly

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
large numbered keys so it is very fairly

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.550 
large numbered keys so it is very fairly
easy<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.030> die<00:04:41.300> even<00:04:41.960> with<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.170> resistive

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
easy to die even with the resistive

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.590 
easy to die even with the resistive
touchscreen<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.670> dialer<00:04:44.000> is<00:04:44.030> really

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
touchscreen the dialer is really

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.840 
touchscreen the dialer is really
responsive<00:04:45.140> and<00:04:45.320> every<00:04:46.070> time<00:04:46.280> that<00:04:46.310> you<00:04:46.610> tap
