00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
there and the charges the case and then

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.140 
there and the charges the case and then
it<00:02:01.470> charges<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.860> phone<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.369> well<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:02.970> can

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
have both of these things charging so it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.510 
have both of these things charging so it
does<00:02:05.610> create<00:02:05.970> more<00:02:06.270> power<00:02:06.540> um<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.369> down

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
does create more power um and then down

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.249 
does create more power um and then down
here<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.360> headphone<00:02:09.750> jack<00:02:09.780> which

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
things down here amplify it this one is

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.240 
things down here amplify it this one is
the<00:03:22.050> speaker<00:03:22.380> this<00:03:22.470> one<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.800> microphone

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
the speaker this one is the microphone

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.460 
the speaker this one is the microphone
so<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.489> can<00:03:23.610> still<00:03:23.850> hear<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.480> talk<00:03:24.660> fine

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
phone um it does I believe it does

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.540 
phone um it does I believe it does
amplify<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.350> music<00:03:31.739> by<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.890> little<00:03:32.250> bit<00:03:32.400> just

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
amplify the music by a little bit just

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.870 
amplify the music by a little bit just
because<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.180> louder<00:03:33.690> or<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.350> bigger<00:03:34.880> range

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
because it is a louder or a bigger range

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.110 
because it is a louder or a bigger range
of<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:37.200> ability<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.280> stdout<00:03:38.430> even<00:03:38.970> know<00:03:39.030> what

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
of the ability to stdout even know what

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.320 
of the ability to stdout even know what
I'm<00:03:39.209> saying<00:03:39.450> right<00:03:39.540> now<00:03:39.720> but<00:03:40.620> yeah<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:41.519> think<00:03:42.000> it

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
I'm saying right now but yeah I think it

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.059 
I'm saying right now but yeah I think it
does<00:03:42.360> amplify<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.930> music<00:03:43.319> just<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.680> little<00:03:43.920> bit

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
does amplify the music just a little bit

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.750 
does amplify the music just a little bit
um<00:03:45.380> over<00:03:46.380> all<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.709> cases<00:03:46.920> it's<00:03:47.370> pretty<00:03:47.640> nice

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
um over all the cases it's pretty nice

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.170 
um over all the cases it's pretty nice
pretty<00:03:48.239> durable<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.900> did<00:03:49.380> drop<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.890> on<00:03:50.100> the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
pretty durable I did drop it on the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.449 
pretty durable I did drop it on the
cement<00:03:51.180> ones<00:03:51.450> which<00:03:52.410> marked<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:52.890> up<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
cement ones which marked it up on the

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.199
