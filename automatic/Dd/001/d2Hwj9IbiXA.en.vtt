idea<00:02:06.080> I've<00:02:06.200> particles<00:02:06.740> turned<00:02:06.950> off<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:07.310> this

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
idea I've particles turned off so this

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.199 
idea I've particles turned off so this
may<00:02:07.640> not<00:02:07.670> work<00:02:07.880> was<00:02:08.300> fun<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.599> nearest<00:02:08.959> animal

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
along off of the floor and I get trapped

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.420 
along off of the floor and I get trapped
with<00:03:00.840> all<00:03:00.990> these<00:03:01.110> pigs<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> one<00:03:02.190> chicken

block when it comes in contact with

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.640 
block when it comes in contact with
basically<00:03:09.180> anything

basically what it does a mob has a

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.530 
basically what it does a mob has a
chance<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.250> moving<00:03:45.430> towards<00:03:45.939> it<00:03:46.090> depending<00:03:46.540> on

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
chance of moving towards it depending on

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.410 
chance of moving towards it depending on
what<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:47.079> inside<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.620> bait<00:03:47.799> spike<00:03:48.359> what<00:03:49.359> is

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
what is inside the bait spike what is

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.809 
what is inside the bait spike what is
there<00:03:49.510> any<00:03:49.599> have<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.780> say<00:03:49.930> ok<00:03:51.329> basically<00:03:53.819> we

is another one spice at the bottom if I

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.190 
is another one spice at the bottom if I
weren't<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.329> creative<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:07.780> would<00:04:07.900> be<00:04:07.959> taking

damage spikes are a little glitchy as

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.460 
damage spikes are a little glitchy as
you<00:04:10.000> can<00:04:10.150> see<00:04:10.359> I'm<00:04:10.450> bouncing<00:04:10.959> around<00:04:11.049> on<00:04:11.319> them

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
you can see I'm bouncing around on them

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.939 
you can see I'm bouncing around on them
for<00:04:11.980> some<00:04:12.670> arbitrary<00:04:13.329> reason<00:04:16.739> here's<00:04:17.739> the

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
for some arbitrary reason here's the

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.159 
for some arbitrary reason here's the
campfire<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:18.880> alternate<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.660> texture<00:04:19.989> for

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
campfire I alternate the texture for

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.490 
campfire I alternate the texture for
that<00:04:20.349> after<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.919> crowd<00:04:22.349> basically<00:04:23.349> the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
that after the crowd basically the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.550 
that after the crowd basically the
campfire<00:04:23.979> can<00:04:24.190> be<00:04:24.310> used<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.880> cook<00:04:25.560> basically

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
campfire can be used to cook basically

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.689 
campfire can be used to cook basically
anything<00:04:27.099> from<00:04:27.460> what<00:04:27.669> I<00:04:27.729> see<00:04:28.800> with<00:04:29.800> would<00:04:30.340> only

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
anything from what I see with would only

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.600 
anything from what I see with would only
would<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.240> nothing<00:04:31.599> else<00:04:31.750> will<00:04:31.990> work

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
would it nothing else will work

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.270 
would it nothing else will work
work<00:04:32.819> as<00:04:33.449> to<00:04:33.629> who<00:04:33.750> would<00:04:33.960> can<00:04:34.740> be<00:04:34.830> used<00:04:34.979> to<00:04:35.069> cook

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
work as to who would can be used to cook

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.129 
work as to who would can be used to cook
I<00:04:35.430> don't<00:04:35.460> know<00:04:35.699> this<00:04:35.909> mutton<00:04:36.240> perhaps<00:04:36.719> let's

this later I'll get to that spike block

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.050 
this later I'll get to that spike block
which<00:05:06.880> I'm<00:05:08.250> disappointed<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.340> say<00:05:09.580> I<00:05:09.610> can't
