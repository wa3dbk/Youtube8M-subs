00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.830
 today we make a dish 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.809
 easy and fast a cod back in 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.700
 gratin then for this recipe you 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.139
 are going to need 600 g of back of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.960
 cod 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.630
 three Belgian shallots 4 spoons 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.170
 thick cream soup 50 g 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.900
 gruyère a walnut of butter of white wine 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.369
 for cooking salt of pepper and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.210
 paprika 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.660
 before we start let's 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.489
 preheat the oven 250 degrees to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.440
 start chiseling the shallots 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.420
 so always the same technique a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.980
 first time in the length then 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.320
 we make slices horizontally and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.910
 after we cut one last time to 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.480
 laverty that will allow you to have 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.829
 a very fine and regular cut 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.440
 we will quietly reduce our 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.730
 shallots over low heat in butter on 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 but it's really that she can 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.270
 to get out quietly is not 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.410
 color 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.120
 do not hesitate to add a nice dose 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.409
 of butter you know butter is a 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.799
 flavor enhancer 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.220
 then add salt pepper and 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.290
 paprika 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.909
 so needless to too much salt you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.130
 see the place enough you who 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:21.900

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.009
 white wine and fresh cream and that's it 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.570
 so now let's leave our 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.250
 sauce quietly takes a few 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.130
 minutes you'll see you're going to have 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.430
 superb white wine smells 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.049
 shallots and crème fraîche drop the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.000
 cod back in the gratin dish 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.060

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.000

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.009
 breadcrumbs that will give a side yet 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.290
