00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.139
 another star wars trailer however the 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.959

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.820
 from behind the scenes the first 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.340
 seconds are to get nostalgic and 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.950
 to make it clear that this time there will be 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.610
 less green screen and more scenarios 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.629
 real after seeing known images 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.660
 including alcor corridors 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.690
 millennium and art where you got to see 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.000
 a few seconds of this new character what 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.120
 more tasty is that it is not digital is a 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.210
 year antonio as before apparently from 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.030
 latex well worked as an assistant 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.460
 or slave next door that reminds us of 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.190
 immediate to java maybe it's a 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.239
 mercenary a merchant the following is 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.239
 wonderful 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.969
 you take in detail of a series you 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.899
 more advanced and destroyed perhaps after a 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.869
 shooting 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.149
 look at the detail this is undoubtedly the 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.220
 recreation of the fall and destruction of 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.320
 foot before moving to 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.820
 of digital ally what shows us 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.790
 the dedication that we will see in the film 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.940
 in the last part some frames of the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.580
 final finish the following is mark hamer 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.510
 lux counting his experience in the shooting 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.380
 nothing has changed but everything changed 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.380
 wenger 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.650
 in this frame we see what would be a 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.800
 new battleship class executor in him a 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.890
 Imperial soldier carrying a rebel 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.190
 a cell or an interrogation 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.660
 then the winner of oscar lupita ni yo 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.690
 embodying his digital character that 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.690
 it would be this his name would be more canada 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 one 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:17.160
 I know that universal excélsior old life 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.160
 watch 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.480
 aware 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.520
 then the actor oscar isaac in his role 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.020
 of mere flea running under his ex 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.510
 wing 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.510
 the descent of the villain broth king 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.700
 the well-known mental actor and co simon pegg 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.819
 is a confessed fan of the saga for it 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.000
 asked to act for free and as an extra in the 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.860
 film the behind camera leaves us in 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.409
 Of course the care they have put in a 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.409
 character as endearing as you we 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.780
 and back to the andrónico workshop and 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.750
 disguises is all real without a doubt this 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.140
 offers another level of texture detail 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.140
 to the movie 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.090
 the replica real scale of the cabin 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.190
 command of the millennial falcon another message 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.400
 subliminal the director wants the 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.440
 hardware episode 7 look as real 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.690
 possible 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.880
 many of us complain about the excess 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.430
 digital effects I am george lucas in 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.040
 because the last trilogy is behind 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.940
 cameras makes it clear to us that we have been 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.940
 listened to 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.940

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.489

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.370

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.780

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.000
 with our feeling with a shot 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:46.719
