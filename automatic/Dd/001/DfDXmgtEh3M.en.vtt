the two like i said this is the the in
box<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.879> which<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.390> very<00:00:58.350> simple<00:00:58.680> actually

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
box one which is very simple actually

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.349 
box one which is very simple actually
it's<00:00:59.730> just<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.270> plastic<00:01:00.629> um<00:01:02.149> this<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
it's just the plastic um this is not a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.579 
it's just the plastic um this is not a
clam<00:01:03.629> show<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.930> don't<00:01:04.110> even<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> call

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
clam show I don't even know what to call

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.580 
clam show I don't even know what to call
it<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:04.949> um<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.750> ships<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.350> very

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
it but um it is if it ships out very

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.560 
it but um it is if it ships out very
simply<00:01:07.770> too<00:01:08.159> because<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.549> breaks<00:01:08.970> down<00:01:09.119> very

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
simply too because it breaks down very

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.640 
simply too because it breaks down very
very<00:01:10.380> easily<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.549> goes<00:01:11.729> flat<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:13.229> you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
very easily like it goes flat so if you

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.990 
very easily like it goes flat so if you
um<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> don't<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.580> use<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> at

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
um you know you don't want to use it at

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.730 
um you know you don't want to use it at
what<00:01:15.150> certain<00:01:15.420> time<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.960> store<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.530> put

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
what certain time you can store it put

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.399 
what certain time you can store it put
it<00:01:16.830> away<00:01:16.970> it's<00:01:17.970> simple<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.840> it'd<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.140> better

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
it away it's simple but it'd be better

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.080 
it away it's simple but it'd be better
boom<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> again<00:01:20.100> that's<00:01:20.580> how<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.759> put<00:01:21.000> it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
boom and again that's how you put it

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
boom and again that's how you put it
back<00:01:21.470> if<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.619> want<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> use<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:22.979> there<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.640> go

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
back if you want to use it there you go

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
back if you want to use it there you go
think<00:01:24.630> there's<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> little<00:01:24.930> blue<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.380> but

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
think there's a little blue there but

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.100 
think there's a little blue there but
now<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.119> yeah<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.540> put<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> figure<00:01:27.930> in

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
now and yeah just put the figure in

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.590 
now and yeah just put the figure in
there<00:01:29.600> just<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:31.189> close<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.520> put<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
there just like this close it up put the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.830 
there just like this close it up put the
tongue<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.020> by<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.710> bing<00:01:34.950> bada<00:01:35.310> boom<00:01:35.810> wait<00:01:36.810> a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
tongue in by the bing bada boom wait a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.530 
tongue in by the bing bada boom wait a
minute<00:01:37.049> now<00:01:37.259> better<00:01:37.560> film<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.040> very<00:01:38.759> simple<00:01:39.240> um

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
minute now better film so very simple um

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.840 
minute now better film so very simple um
it's<00:01:40.259> very<00:01:40.500> nice<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.340> takes<00:01:41.579> about

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it's very nice it actually takes about

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.289 
it's very nice it actually takes about
the<00:01:41.909> same<00:01:42.030> space<00:01:42.810> maybe<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.880> pretty<00:01:45.149> much

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the same space maybe it's pretty much

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.219 
the same space maybe it's pretty much
the<00:01:45.360> same<00:01:46.820> overall<00:01:47.820> surface<00:01:48.180> area<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the same overall surface area that the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
the same overall surface area that the
actual<00:01:49.710> amoeba<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> box<00:01:50.700> would<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:51.119> so

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
actual amoeba in the box would take so

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.210 
actual amoeba in the box would take so
it's<00:01:51.390> not<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:51.869> making<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> any<00:01:52.829> bigger

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
it's not like it's making it any bigger

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.950 
it's not like it's making it any bigger
the<00:01:53.460> only<00:01:53.670> difference<00:01:54.030> would<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.689> can't

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the only difference would be you can't

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.810 
the only difference would be you can't
put<00:01:55.200> anything<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.829> here<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.490> were<00:01:56.640> like

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
put anything on here if you were like

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.490 
put anything on here if you were like
stacking<00:01:57.240> them<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.630> way<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.200> won't<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
stacking them that way you won't have to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.530 
stacking them that way you won't have to
stack<00:01:58.649> them<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.860> top<00:01:59.240> which<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.270> not<00:02:00.509> bad

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
stack them on top which is not bad

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.010 
stack them on top which is not bad
they're<00:02:00.869> actually<00:02:01.229> pretty<00:02:01.350> sturdy<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.799> saw

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
they're actually pretty sturdy I saw

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.060 
they're actually pretty sturdy I saw

little<00:04:55.240> surface<00:04:55.840> here<00:04:56.080> where<00:04:56.319> it<00:04:56.650> doesn't

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
little surface here where it doesn't

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.350 
little surface here where it doesn't
really<00:04:57.189> move<00:04:57.430> that<00:04:57.669> much<00:04:57.849> it's<00:04:58.090> not<00:04:58.210> that
