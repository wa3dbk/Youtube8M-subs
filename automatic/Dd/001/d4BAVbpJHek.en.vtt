okay<00:00:08.230> I'm<00:00:08.440> standing<00:00:09.010> looking<00:00:09.460> at<00:00:09.580> the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
okay I'm standing looking at the

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.759 
okay I'm standing looking at the
proposed<00:00:10.120> landing<00:00:10.629> site<00:00:10.930> and<00:00:11.610> from<00:00:13.769> this

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:14.769 
proposed landing site and from this

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.160 
proposed landing site and from this
corner<00:00:15.160> of<00:00:15.280> the<00:00:15.309> curb<00:00:15.610> over<00:00:16.119> that<00:00:16.509> shed<00:00:16.840> is

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
corner of the curb over that shed is

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.359 
corner of the curb over that shed is
approximately<00:00:18.099> 40<00:00:18.550> sheep<00:00:19.259> and<00:00:20.259> another<00:00:20.710> 45

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
approximately 40 sheep and another 45

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.759 
approximately 40 sheep and another 45
oak<00:00:21.669> to<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:22.029> edge<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:23.500> about<00:00:24.340> 45<00:00:24.789> across<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
oak to the edge and about 45 across the

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.490 
oak to the edge and about 45 across the
front<00:00:27.039> I<00:00:28.029> don't<00:00:28.570> think<00:00:29.140> there'd<00:00:29.320> be<00:00:29.380> any

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
front I don't think there'd be any

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.159 
front I don't think there'd be any
obstruction<00:00:30.250> for<00:00:30.369> a<00:00:30.430> tail<00:00:30.670> rotor<00:00:31.050> over<00:00:32.050> the

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
obstruction for a tail rotor over the

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:39.420 
obstruction for a tail rotor over the
bank<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:36.780> there<00:00:37.780> would<00:00:38.050> be<00:00:38.080> a<00:00:38.650> fair<00:00:39.070> bit<00:00:39.309> of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
bank and there would be a fair bit of

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.350 
bank and there would be a fair bit of
room<00:00:39.699> on<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.809> far<00:00:41.080> side<00:00:41.350> of<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.559> shed<00:00:41.860> that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
room on the far side of the shed that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.530 
room on the far side of the shed that
would<00:00:43.360> come<00:00:43.540> rotor<00:00:43.839> down<00:00:44.170> on<00:00:44.440> on<00:00:45.159> that<00:00:45.460> side<00:00:45.729> so

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.939 

you're<00:00:49.540> basically<00:00:49.960> you're<00:00:50.199> workable<00:00:50.620> area<00:00:50.739> is

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
you're basically you're workable area is

00:00:50.949 --> 00:01:04.719 
you're basically you're workable area is
45<00:00:51.400> by<00:00:51.580> 45<00:00:52.000> with<00:00:52.360> that<00:00:52.720> extra<00:00:54.570> over<00:00:55.570> there

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.109 

okay<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:05.420> am<00:01:05.930> at<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.009> other<00:01:07.159> proposed<00:01:07.700> landing

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
okay I am at the other proposed landing

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.030 
okay I am at the other proposed landing
site<00:01:08.890> which<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.750> corner<00:01:11.750> of<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.080> grassy

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
site which is the corner of the grassy

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.780 
site which is the corner of the grassy
area<00:01:14.380> where<00:01:15.380> I'm<00:01:15.649> standing<00:01:17.350> how<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.520> pass<00:01:19.520> that

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
area where I'm standing how to pass that

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.180 
area where I'm standing how to pass that
trailer<00:01:20.360> is<00:01:21.520> clear<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:22.820> from<00:01:23.390> that<00:01:23.570> hedge

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
trailer is clear and from that hedge

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.510 
trailer is clear and from that hedge
over<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:27.649> bank<00:01:27.860> where<00:01:28.039> that<00:01:28.130> tall<00:01:28.369> grass

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
over to the bank where that tall grass

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.520 
over to the bank where that tall grass
starts<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:29.360> about<00:01:29.570> 50<00:01:30.049> feet<00:01:31.390> so<00:01:32.390> you're<00:01:32.689> pretty

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
starts is about 50 feet so you're pretty

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.190 
starts is about 50 feet so you're pretty
much<00:01:33.710> unlimited<00:01:35.049> on<00:01:36.049> this<00:01:36.439> dimension<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:38.720> a

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
much unlimited on this dimension and a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.440 
much unlimited on this dimension and a
50-foot<00:01:42.789> working<00:01:43.789> space<00:01:44.119> across<00:01:46.450> this

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
50-foot working space across this

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.169 
50-foot working space across this
material<00:01:47.960> trailer<00:01:48.459> two<00:01:49.459> trailers<00:01:49.850> could<00:01:50.060> be

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
material trailer two trailers could be

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.840 
material trailer two trailers could be
moved

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
moved

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.090 
moved

if you decide on the spot as you can see

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.779 
if you decide on the spot as you can see
over<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.780> head<00:01:59.929> you<00:02:00.229> know<00:02:00.709> hydropower<00:02:01.610> or

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
over the head you know hydropower or

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.870 
over the head you know hydropower or
anything<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.880> only<00:02:04.880> power<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:06.399> across<00:02:07.399> the

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
anything the only power is across the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.530 
anything the only power is across the
quarter<00:02:08.569> behind<00:02:08.899> me<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.470> down<00:02:10.269> along<00:02:11.269> that

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
quarter behind me and down along that

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:21.670 
quarter behind me and down along that
far<00:02:11.840> edge<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:16.000> fairly<00:02:17.000> flat<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:20.680> wide

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
far edge it was fairly flat and wide

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:31.750 
far edge it was fairly flat and wide
open<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:27.609> in<00:02:28.609> the<00:02:28.790> Triangle<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:30.760> clear

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
open so this is in the Triangle of clear

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.539 
open so this is in the Triangle of clear
land<00:02:32.079> up<00:02:33.079> on<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:34.090> at<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.269> intersection<00:02:35.989> of

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
land up on the at the intersection of

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:50.810 
land up on the at the intersection of
Reath<00:02:37.549> road<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.230> marina<00:02:39.230> way

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.970 

I'm<00:02:51.820> just<00:02:52.090> walking<00:02:52.390> I'm<00:02:52.930> on<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.350> other<00:02:53.620> side

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
I'm just walking I'm on the other side

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.750 
I'm just walking I'm on the other side
of<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.460> clearly<00:02:54.850> now<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:56.430> as<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.490> can<00:02:57.640> see

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
of that clearly now and as you can see

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.000 
of that clearly now and as you can see
it's<00:02:58.030> pretty<00:02:58.360> wide<00:02:58.600> open<00:02:59.130> and<00:03:01.740> again<00:03:02.740> all

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
it's pretty wide open and again all

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.720 
it's pretty wide open and again all
those<00:03:04.530> trailers<00:03:05.530> that's<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.310> there<00:03:06.520> can<00:03:06.700> be

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
those trailers that's it there can be

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.120 
those trailers that's it there can be
moved
