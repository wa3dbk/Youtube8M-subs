00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.580
 welcome to a new revive petrovelli min in this opportunity 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.360
 we will see the deadly game kombat 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.539
 for ace genesis 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.199
 this a new teenage game to the code for we have blood 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.709
 codhes advent pace supports sales 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.529
 with that we started to put on blood 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.930
 that to a limitation had been put due to the great controversy that woke up 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.710
 this game 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.359
 for the subject just the blood 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.160
 we could observe that at that time there were no games with blood i 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.649
 this scene is much better than super nintendo because of this modality 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.940
 that a code should already be set to play as is in the goalkeeper 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.070
 let's see now 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.700
 the origin of people that exists in this game have brought us to be 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.340
 your game has 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.809
 a number of seven characters we do not have a sonic aires 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.350
 why not 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.570
 salsero a sony speak 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.730
 scorpion sugar and radio 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.360
 not only was the sony story that is percent and pretty good he is a 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.420
 star said liu 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.530
 will try 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.620
 I showed that not only 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.450
 p 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.490
 he was acting the movie comes but with good fighter that martial 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.310
 the gaming experience is based on that 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.550
 the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.920
 morte as to its surroundings generated by the gods 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.680
 mortal combat 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.490
 and there is the resolution that he did obtain the tournament is 'between wolves' 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.290
 the characters the earth 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.280
 it has arrived 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.470
 following 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.460
 ten consecutive tournaments won by the mud that can govern 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 the earth 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.530
 being able to generate the chaos that we will see later in next mortal kombat 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.460
 it's a very good martial arts game well let's see him 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.840
 there is a punch people 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.910
 and it is to say that it is sanz a his boss osama bolus 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.979
 a character half man half aragon 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.139
 that says voters have 2000 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.969
 years 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.349
 Of course we are fighting with a lot of good and sony that has 10 front 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.870
 movement for example the leg are nuances back and forth 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.559
 has agreed 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.589
 as we will see there is a good technique that was used a lot of it 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.989
 and back 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:31.810
 and later 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.519
 pearl to kick 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.899
 they have time 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.149
 we can observe different movements in finals 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.540
 currently not 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.929
 he has not left 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.039
 but character that more 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.329
 percent 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.549
 they were chosen in this game was salseros cabalcor pion 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.279
 they are the classic characters 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.279
 let's lose ourselves now 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:00.659
 that's why he said that the background decorations are also very good 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.829
 your opponent's version does not have bigger character better defined 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.569
 but 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.749
 percent 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.059
 in many cases which and was much better in the version you want genesis 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.239
 so he estimated this version chosen to make the realillo 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.849
 d now let's continue let's select loas at 0 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.429
 not the most emblematic characters of the deadly kombat 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.489
 salcedo pt is quite basic he is a child know 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.469
 the delinquent 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.019
 which 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.019
 he has killed accordion that just that he had to fight 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.450
 and scorpion well in search of revenge against sanchez learned that salsero 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:44.839
 tournament table and the 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:47.079
 He was sent to kill him 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.669
 and look at this sculpture the statues of backgrounds with the characters 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.719
 in truth, very good 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:01.539
 let's keep fighting 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:04.539
 against corruption 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:10.619
 the people that have been digitized to that great defense law had regards 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:11.839
 chifa iter 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.839
 they were coming for percent and tenacity extracted 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:17.810
 lugo 8 manuel terÃ¡n digitized character 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.999
 a new programming technique 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:22.840
 Chivas ensures fatality 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.800
 oil checks out the head 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 and we showed it to all the people I reprobated 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.779
 this was the deadly kombat in for genesis and we know that 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:36.000
 good is my son 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.370
 if you are not going to be happy because we said is that I need to show 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.759
 I'm not a fan 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.590
 the super nintendo 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.590
 good but as they were next previous for different consoles 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.270
 the cable ensures a chongo
