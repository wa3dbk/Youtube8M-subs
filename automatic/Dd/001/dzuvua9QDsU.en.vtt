00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
and recon I've had a soul engineer

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.630 
and recon I've had a soul engineer
supporting<00:00:37.310> recon<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:39.280> basically<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.489> first

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
supporting recon and basically the first

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.599 
supporting recon and basically the first
thing<00:00:40.940> he<00:00:40.969> talks<00:00:41.360> about<00:00:41.539> is<00:00:42.050> how<00:00:42.559> they<00:00:42.770> change

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
thing he talks about is how they change

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.450 
thing he talks about is how they change
the<00:00:43.940> classes<00:00:44.480> so<00:00:44.660> each<00:00:44.840> of<00:00:45.079> them<00:00:45.430> has<00:00:46.430> their

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
the classes so each of them has their

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.500 
the classes so each of them has their
own<00:00:46.760> little<00:00:48.190> punch<00:00:49.190> as<00:00:49.640> you<00:00:49.789> can<00:00:49.940> say<00:00:50.149> I<00:00:50.180> guess

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
own little punch as you can say I guess

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.509 
own little punch as you can say I guess
and<00:00:51.730> so<00:00:52.730> he<00:00:52.850> says<00:00:53.149> if<00:00:53.629> you're<00:00:54.469> like<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.340> be<00:00:55.489> a

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
and so he says if you're like to be a

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.750 
and so he says if you're like to be a
lone<00:00:55.850> wolf<00:00:56.180> Claire<00:00:56.899> you<00:00:57.829> can<00:00:58.070> do<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:58.489> now

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
lone wolf Claire you can do that now

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.319

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.259 
because I mean you can run around with
one<00:01:02.510> class<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.230> do<00:01:03.589> some<00:01:03.800> damage<00:01:04.070> but<00:01:04.670> he<00:01:05.120> also

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
one class and do some damage but he also

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.110 
one class and do some damage but he also
says<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:05.720> as<00:01:06.410> always<00:01:06.650> if<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:07.730> play<00:01:07.940> the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
squad the teamwork will obviously get

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.580 
squad the teamwork will obviously get
you<00:01:10.370> far<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:13.220> will<00:01:13.490> be<00:01:13.610> effective<00:01:14.530> so<00:01:15.530> I

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
you far and you will be effective so I

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.160 
you far and you will be effective so I

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
guess my dad he's just that's for like

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.050 
guess my dad he's just that's for like
Call<00:01:18.410> of<00:01:18.440> Duty<00:01:18.770> players<00:01:19.070> who<00:01:19.370> might<00:01:19.550> transfer

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
Call of Duty players who might transfer

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.690 
Call of Duty players who might transfer
over<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.300> battlefield<00:01:20.810> 3<00:01:21.110> since<00:01:21.950> most<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.490> them

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
over to battlefield 3 since most of them

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.760 
over to battlefield 3 since most of them
are<00:01:22.880> lone<00:01:23.060> wolf<00:01:23.300> players<00:01:23.660> that<00:01:24.260> might<00:01:24.470> cater

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
are lone wolf players that might cater

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.970 
are lone wolf players that might cater
to<00:01:25.040> them<00:01:25.450> so<00:01:26.450> that's<00:01:26.630> good<00:01:26.870> I<00:01:26.900> guess<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.650> then

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
to them so that's good I guess and then

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.000 
to them so that's good I guess and then
the<00:01:28.460> first<00:01:28.640> class<00:01:28.940> he<00:01:29.090> talks<00:01:29.330> about<00:01:29.560> is<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
the first class he talks about is the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.080 
the first class he talks about is the
assault<00:01:31.780> which<00:01:32.780> has<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.560> change<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.550> it<00:01:34.820> from

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
assault which has a change to it from

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.720 
assault which has a change to it from
previous<00:01:35.750> from<00:01:36.620> battlefield<00:01:37.070> bad<00:01:37.220> company<00:01:37.340> 2

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
previous from battlefield bad company 2

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.000 
previous from battlefield bad company 2
which<00:01:37.970> one<00:01:38.120> if<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.360> apply<00:01:38.660> so<00:01:39.410> basically<00:01:39.770> the

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
which one if you apply so basically the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.710 
which one if you apply so basically the
assault<00:01:40.400> you<00:01:40.550> can<00:01:40.760> even<00:01:40.850> have<00:01:40.970> grenade

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
assault you can even have grenade

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.460 
assault you can even have grenade
launcher<00:01:42.230> or<00:01:42.580> medic<00:01:43.580> kit<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.180> you<00:01:45.170> can<00:01:45.290> pick

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
launcher or medic kit and you can pick

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.980 
launcher or medic kit and you can pick
between<00:01:45.650> those<00:01:46.040> two<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.270> they<00:01:47.360> decided<00:01:47.870> to

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
between those two and they decided to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.050 
between those two and they decided to
change<00:01:48.230> give<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.590> medical<00:01:49.130> abilities<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.700> salt

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
change give a medical abilities to salt

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.050 
change give a medical abilities to salt
because<00:01:51.070> apparently<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.220> know<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.610> assaults

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
because apparently you know the assaults

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.340 
because apparently you know the assaults
always<00:01:53.300> to<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.450> front<00:01:53.720> lines<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.230> that's

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
always to the front lines and that's

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.710 
always to the front lines and that's
what<00:01:54.470> once<00:01:54.620> the<00:01:54.740> dying<00:01:55.040> is<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:56.150> they<00:01:56.390> thought

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
what once the dying is so they thought

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.420 
what once the dying is so they thought
that<00:01:56.750> it'll<00:01:57.170> be<00:01:57.200> most<00:01:57.470> useful<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.160> assault

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
that it'll be most useful to the assault

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.300 
that it'll be most useful to the assault
guy<00:01:59.290> so<00:02:00.290> I'm<00:02:00.500> guessing<00:02:00.710> if<00:02:01.040> you're<00:02:01.160> going<00:02:01.250> to

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
guy so I'm guessing if you're going to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.650 
guy so I'm guessing if you're going to
be<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.430> lone<00:02:01.610> wolf<00:02:01.850> it<00:02:02.000> probably<00:02:02.240> is<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.390> grenade

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
be a lone wolf it probably is a grenade

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.940 
be a lone wolf it probably is a grenade
launcher<00:02:03.050> if<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.260> want<00:02:03.410> to<00:02:03.470> help<00:02:03.530> your<00:02:03.710> team

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
launcher if you want to help your team

he<00:02:11.720> says<00:02:11.989> it's<00:02:12.200> really<00:02:12.319> it's<00:02:12.560> not<00:02:12.739> much<00:02:12.890> change

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
he says it's really it's not much change

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.149 
he says it's really it's not much change
you<00:02:14.420> get<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.719> RPGs<00:02:15.409> you<00:02:15.769> can<00:02:15.920> blow<00:02:16.129> up

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
you get the RPGs you can blow up

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.240 
you get the RPGs you can blow up
vehicles<00:02:17.000> block<00:02:17.780> walls<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.560> reveal<00:02:18.769> anything

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
vehicles block walls to reveal anything

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.900 
vehicles block walls to reveal anything
position<00:02:20.410> repair<00:02:21.410> vehicles<00:02:21.670> but<00:02:22.670> he<00:02:22.760> also

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
position repair vehicles but he also

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.500 
position repair vehicles but he also
says<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.790> will<00:02:25.910> be<00:02:26.060> loaded<00:02:26.480> with

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
says that that you will be loaded with

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.980 
says that that you will be loaded with
that<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.530> can<00:02:27.560> have<00:02:27.830> carbine<00:02:28.340> weapons<00:02:28.990> which

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
that you can have carbine weapons which

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.930 
that you can have carbine weapons which
make<00:02:30.440> which<00:02:30.830> can<00:02:31.070> make<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.430> class<00:02:31.670> very

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
make which can make the class very

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.550 
make which can make the class very
versatile<00:02:32.630> so<00:02:33.530> that's<00:02:34.100> good<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.400> guess<00:02:34.490> and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
versatile so that's good I guess and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.030 
versatile so that's good I guess and
then<00:02:36.560> he<00:02:36.800> goes<00:02:36.980> into<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.430> engineer<00:02:38.300> class

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
then he goes into the engineer class

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.550 
then he goes into the engineer class
which<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.220> basically<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.450> mean<00:02:42.200> not<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
which is basically I mean not the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.560 
which is basically I mean not the
engineer<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.100> just<00:02:43.280> said<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.430> he<00:02:44.000> goes<00:02:44.209> into

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
engineer I just said that he goes into

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.890 
engineer I just said that he goes into
the<00:02:45.190> detail<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.430> support<00:02:46.940> class<00:02:47.090> which

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
the detail to the support class which

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.230 
the detail to the support class which
basically<00:02:48.440> has<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.800> biggest<00:02:49.190> changes<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:50.000> it

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
basically has the biggest changes to it

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.110 
basically has the biggest changes to it
now<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.709> two<00:02:51.950> big<00:02:52.310> things<00:02:52.550> for<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.880> support

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
now the two big things for the support

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.870 
now the two big things for the support
class<00:02:53.300> or<00:02:53.660> suppressive<00:02:54.200> fire<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.610> five

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
class or suppressive fire and the five

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.410 
class or suppressive fire and the five
pod<00:02:56.209> so<00:02:56.989> basically<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.530> bipod<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:59.030> just<00:02:59.209> put

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
pod so basically the bipod you just put

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.960 
pod so basically the bipod you just put
it<00:02:59.540> down<00:02:59.570> with<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.470> so<00:03:00.709> equipped<00:03:00.920> your<00:03:01.130> L&amp;G<00:03:01.610> put

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
it down with it so equipped your L&amp;G put

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.850 
it down with it so equipped your L&amp;G put
it<00:03:02.060> down<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.570> it<00:03:02.720> gives<00:03:03.320> you<00:03:03.440> increased

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
it down and it gives you increased

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.420 
it down and it gives you increased
accuracy<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.970> recoil<00:03:05.510> reduction<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.430> he

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
accuracy and recoil reduction and he

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.870 
accuracy and recoil reduction and he
said<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.390> can<00:03:08.570> fire<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:09.489> whole<00:03:10.489> clip<00:03:10.730> of

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
said that you can fire a whole clip of

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.850 
said that you can fire a whole clip of
LMG<00:03:11.390> right<00:03:11.780> is<00:03:11.959> holding<00:03:12.260> your<00:03:12.350> finger<00:03:12.500> with

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
LMG right is holding your finger with

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.160 
LMG right is holding your finger with
the<00:03:12.950> help<00:03:13.100> of<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.280> bipod<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:14.540> I<00:03:14.600> mean<00:03:14.840> that'll

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
the help of the bipod so I mean that'll

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.860 
the help of the bipod so I mean that'll
help<00:03:15.260> out<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.530> lot<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.370> all<00:03:17.270> you<00:03:17.360> have<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.540> do<00:03:17.690> is

go either go prone or kneel or stand in
front<00:03:21.200> of<00:03:21.350> something<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:21.770> can<00:03:21.950> support<00:03:22.160> the

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
front of something I can support the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.490 
front of something I can support the
bipod<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.450> put<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:23.720> down<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:24.080> just<00:03:24.290> start

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
bipod and you put it down you just start

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.470 
bipod and you put it down you just start
shooting<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:25.280> then<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:25.940> second<00:03:26.330> feature

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
shooting and then the second feature

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.740 
shooting and then the second feature
suppressive<00:03:27.230> fire<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:29.030> basically<00:03:29.600> if<00:03:29.660> you

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
suppressive fire is basically if you

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.490 
suppressive fire is basically if you
start<00:03:30.019> shooting<00:03:30.500> an<00:03:30.590> arrow<00:03:30.830> area<00:03:31.640> of<00:03:31.820> an<00:03:31.940> enemy

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
start shooting an arrow area of an enemy

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.070 
start shooting an arrow area of an enemy
he<00:03:33.500> will<00:03:33.850> restrain<00:03:34.850> will<00:03:35.090> show<00:03:35.360> graphical

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
he will restrain will show graphical

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.560 
he will restrain will show graphical
blur<00:03:36.290> effect<00:03:37.030> because<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.180> bullets<00:03:38.480> are

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
blur effect because the bullets are

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.800 
blur effect because the bullets are
swimming<00:03:38.810> by<00:03:39.110> which<00:03:39.739> tells<00:03:40.100> him<00:03:40.580> like<00:03:41.450> not<00:03:41.660> to

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
swimming by which tells him like not to

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.840 
swimming by which tells him like not to
pop<00:03:42.019> his<00:03:42.200> head<00:03:42.230> out<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.590> cover<00:03:42.860> it'll<00:03:43.730> also

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
pop his head out of cover it'll also

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.759 
pop his head out of cover it'll also
affect<00:03:44.360> your<00:03:44.570> accuracy<00:03:45.140> because<00:03:45.500> I<00:03:45.620> mean

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
affect your accuracy because I mean

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.680 
affect your accuracy because I mean
realize<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.370> applets<00:03:46.790> blind<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.209> am<00:03:47.390> pretty

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
realize the applets blind I am pretty

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.509 
realize the applets blind I am pretty
