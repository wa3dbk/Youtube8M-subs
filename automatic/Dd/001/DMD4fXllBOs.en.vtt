Hi, we're at Wheatley Provincial Park. I'm
with Jim, and we're just here trying to reel

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.460
in some cool things. And I think I've got
something Jim. And I think it's pretty big.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.540
Looks like a beauty Doug.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.820
It's a monster.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.260
So Doug, here we are at Wheatley Provincial

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.380
Park, and one of the coolest things we have here is the kids fishing derby.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.260
And it takesplace in the creek system here and out in
Lake Erie. We've been doing it for over 15

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.380
years now, and it's the weekend before Labour
Day. I usually have 100 kids fishing and

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.940
we usually measure between two and three-hundred fish in that time period, and we have a lot of fun.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.660
Another great thing about Wheatley
Park is our Carolinian Forest. We're surrounded

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:10.320
here by Red Oaks and White Oaks, and Tulip
Trees, Sassafraz -- all of which are only

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.700
found way down south. This is an example of
one of our Carolinian species. This is a Sassafraz.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.700
And one of the unique things about it is it
has three different styles of leaves on the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.050
same tree. This is normal -- this is what
you would see most of the time.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.060
Like this one -- three, three lobes I guess you call them?

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.000
Here's two. Two lobes. And here's a single.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.880
Look at that. All on the same tree.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.180
So what tree do we have here Jim?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.480
Well this is a Swamp White Oak!

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.960
I'm a pretty good climber, I'll see how high I can get. Hey Jim! Jim...

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.660
I'm going to need some help!

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.080
Well Doug, I've shown you an awful lot of great things here

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.100
at Wheatley Provincial Park, and this is,
by far, the coolest thing that we have.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.660
This is our Halloween celebration and it takes place on Thanksgiving weekend. And as you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.810
can see, a lot of the sites are decorated
and the kids go trick or treating. About 300

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.040
kids trick or treating and walking the parks.
We close the roads, and it's just, it's the best

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:44.560
Jim, what do you think -- an angel?
Or cowboy? Or, angel cowboy?! I knew he wouldn't like it
