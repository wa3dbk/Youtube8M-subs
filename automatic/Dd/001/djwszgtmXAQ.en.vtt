want<00:00:24.010> to<00:00:24.100> paint<00:00:24.340> each<00:00:25.240> piece<00:00:25.660> individually<00:00:26.340> so

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
want to paint each piece individually so

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.150 
want to paint each piece individually so
I'll<00:00:28.030> show<00:00:28.300> you<00:00:28.330> all<00:00:29.080> the<00:00:29.620> pieces<00:00:29.800> together

I'll show you all the pieces together

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.479 
I'll show you all the pieces together

and paint it and show you what it looks

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.509 
and paint it and show you what it looks
like<00:00:33.579> when<00:00:33.789> it's<00:00:33.910> done<00:00:34.469> okay<00:00:35.469> so<00:00:35.499> this<00:00:36.010> is<00:00:36.249> the

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
like when it's done okay so this is the

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.279 
like when it's done okay so this is the
lid<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:38.559> can<00:00:38.589> print<00:00:39.309> off<00:00:39.670> this<00:00:40.210> piece<00:00:40.749> it

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
lid you can print off this piece it

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.130 
lid you can print off this piece it
comes<00:00:41.800> as<00:00:42.039> one<00:00:42.280> all<00:00:42.550> piece<00:00:42.820> with<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.870> bumps

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
comes as one all piece with the bumps

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.910 
comes as one all piece with the bumps
attached<00:00:45.989> otherwise<00:00:46.989> you'll<00:00:47.260> have<00:00:47.379> to<00:00:47.589> put<00:00:47.800> it

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
attached otherwise you'll have to put it

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.880 
attached otherwise you'll have to put it
together<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.870> inside<00:00:50.260> it's<00:00:50.890> just<00:00:51.219> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
together on the inside it's just the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.899 
together on the inside it's just the
inside<00:00:53.890> of<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.219> lid<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.899> there's<00:00:59.190> M<00:01:00.190> here

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
inside of a lid and there's M here

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.590 
inside of a lid and there's M here
that's<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.510> little<00:01:02.260> bit<00:01:02.409> raised<00:01:02.879> from<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.239> rest

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
that's a little bit raised from the rest

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.719 
that's a little bit raised from the rest
of<00:01:04.719> the<00:01:04.780> shell<00:01:05.019> it's<00:01:05.439> so<00:01:06.159> that<00:01:06.310> you<00:01:06.369> have<00:01:06.700> a

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
of the shell it's so that you have a

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.179 
of the shell it's so that you have a
guide<00:01:07.350> when<00:01:08.350> you're<00:01:08.500> painting<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:09.070> M

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
guide when you're painting the M

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.109 
guide when you're painting the M
otherwise<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.420> would<00:01:10.659> be<00:01:10.689> pretty<00:01:11.170> hard<00:01:11.740> to

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
otherwise it would be pretty hard to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.529 
otherwise it would be pretty hard to
paint<00:01:13.119> that<00:01:13.270> M<00:01:13.479> without<00:01:13.659> any<00:01:14.500> guides<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:16.030> the

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
paint that M without any guides so the

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.539 
paint that M without any guides so the
other<00:01:16.659> way<00:01:16.840> you<00:01:16.899> can<00:01:17.170> do<00:01:17.409> it<00:01:17.439> is<00:01:17.799> by<00:01:18.219> printing

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
other way you can do it is by printing

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.330 
other way you can do it is by printing
in<00:01:18.820> pieces<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.930> then<00:01:20.409> just<00:01:20.799> put<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.130> pieces

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
in pieces and then just put the pieces

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.630 
in pieces and then just put the pieces
together<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.619> first<00:01:23.829> you<00:01:24.039> need<00:01:24.189> to<00:01:24.219> print<00:01:24.460> your

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
together so first you need to print your

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.359 
together so first you need to print your
button<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.479> same<00:01:25.719> button<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:27.130> same

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
button the same button and the same

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.469 
button the same button and the same
outer<00:01:27.820> shell

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
outer shell

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.649 
outer shell
that's<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.560> original<00:01:30.430> one<00:01:30.609> just<00:01:31.210> this<00:01:31.420> one's

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
that's the original one just this one's

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.889 
that's the original one just this one's
only<00:01:32.020> going<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.289> be<00:01:32.380> used<00:01:32.619> for<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:33.070> base<00:01:33.189> and<00:01:33.899> a

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
only going to be used for the base and a

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.440 
only going to be used for the base and a
new<00:01:35.590> inner<00:01:36.549> ring<00:01:36.880> where<00:01:37.450> there's<00:01:37.689> holes<00:01:38.430> for

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
new inner ring where there's holes for

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.810 
new inner ring where there's holes for
the<00:01:40.450> bumps<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:41.079> be<00:01:41.350> placed<00:01:41.710> in<00:01:42.100> because<00:01:42.670> they

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
the bumps to be placed in because they

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.490 
the bumps to be placed in because they
take<00:01:43.030> up<00:01:43.149> some<00:01:43.359> space<00:01:43.570> on<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.929> inside<00:01:44.259> of<00:01:44.409> the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
take up some space on the inside of the

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.800 
take up some space on the inside of the
shell<00:01:44.710> so<00:01:45.429> this<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:46.030> your<00:01:46.179> new<00:01:46.329> inner<00:01:46.600> ring<00:01:46.899> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
shell so this is your new inner ring and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.099 
shell so this is your new inner ring and
little<00:01:49.810> m<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.490> put<00:01:52.299> it<00:01:52.420> in<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.659> front<00:01:52.840> of<00:01:52.960> the

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
little m so put it in the front of the

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.740 
little m so put it in the front of the
master<00:01:53.500> ball<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.039> your<00:01:54.820> bumps<00:01:55.299> here<00:01:55.539> gonna

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
master ball and your bumps here gonna

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.310 
master ball and your bumps here gonna
need<00:01:55.990> two<00:01:56.289> of<00:01:56.320> them<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:57.749> your<00:01:58.749> normal<00:01:58.899> outer

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
need two of them and your normal outer

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.929 
need two of them and your normal outer
shell<00:01:59.649> with<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.189> holes<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.710> when<00:02:03.579> you<00:02:03.670> put<00:02:03.850> it

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
shell with the holes so when you put it

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.899 
shell with the holes so when you put it
all<00:02:04.030> together<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.869> got<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.320> make<00:02:05.439> sure<00:02:05.649> that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
all together you got to make sure that

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.160 
all together you got to make sure that
the<00:02:07.170> bump<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.440> in<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.920> right<00:02:09.069> orientation<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
the bump is in the right orientation the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.910 
the bump is in the right orientation the
up

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
up

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.460 
up
has<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> curve<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.840> goes<00:02:15.020> towards

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
has a curve on it so that goes towards

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.650 
has a curve on it so that goes towards
the<00:02:15.560> top<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:18.280> master<00:02:19.280> ball<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.510> can

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
the top of the master ball so you can

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.589 
the top of the master ball so you can
see<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.959> goes<00:02:21.110> on<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.770> bottom<00:02:21.920> there

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
see it goes on the bottom there

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.759 
see it goes on the bottom there
and<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.209> see<00:02:26.420> there's<00:02:27.049> some<00:02:27.469> support

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
and you can see there's some support

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.949 
and you can see there's some support
material<00:02:28.519> in<00:02:28.700> there<00:02:29.049> in<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:30.290> M<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:32.150> helps

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
material in there in the M it helps

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.920 
material in there in the M it helps
print<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.489> top<00:02:34.909> of<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.150> M<00:02:35.329> so<00:02:35.689> that<00:02:35.810> it

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
print the top of the M so that it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.679 
print the top of the M so that it
doesn't<00:02:36.230> fall<00:02:36.459> okay<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:37.519> I'm<00:02:38.359> just<00:02:38.420> gonna

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
doesn't fall okay so I'm just gonna

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.289 
doesn't fall okay so I'm just gonna
speed<00:02:39.140> this<00:02:39.170> part<00:02:39.590> up<00:02:39.799> because<00:02:40.220> it's<00:02:41.090> kind<00:02:41.269> of

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
speed this part up because it's kind of

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.880 
speed this part up because it's kind of
boring<00:02:41.540> watching<00:02:42.049> me<00:02:42.170> paint<00:02:42.379> everything<00:02:43.000> but

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
boring watching me paint everything but

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.229 
boring watching me paint everything but
basically<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.250> use<00:02:46.459> normal<00:02:46.609> Eckert<00:02:47.120> of

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
basically I just use normal Eckert of

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.580 
basically I just use normal Eckert of
paint<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:49.250> bought<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.939> at<00:02:50.090> Michael's<00:02:50.590> I'll

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
paint and I bought it at Michael's I'll

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.649 
paint and I bought it at Michael's I'll
go<00:02:51.769> over<00:02:51.889> some<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.370> paint<00:02:52.760> later<00:02:53.150> on<00:02:53.450> as<00:02:53.689> well

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
go over some the paint later on as well

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.940 
go over some the paint later on as well
and<00:02:56.659> how<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.319> mix<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:58.420> color<00:02:59.500> for<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.590> bumps

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
and how to mix that color for the bumps

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.280 
and how to mix that color for the bumps
it's<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:01.579> a<00:03:01.700> mixture<00:03:02.269> of<00:03:02.389> some<00:03:02.810> purples<00:03:03.169> and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
it's just a mixture of some purples and

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.280 
it's just a mixture of some purples and
whites<00:03:03.379> and<00:03:03.799> reds<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.629> I<00:03:05.629> like<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.930> paint<00:03:06.139> the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
whites and reds and I like to paint the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.949 
whites and reds and I like to paint the
insides<00:03:06.709> with<00:03:07.129> a<00:03:07.159> silver<00:03:07.549> I<00:03:07.879> think<00:03:08.659> it<00:03:08.780> makes

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
insides with a silver I think it makes

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.990 
insides with a silver I think it makes
it<00:03:09.079> look<00:03:09.260> more<00:03:09.290> like<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.799> metal<00:03:10.159> poker<00:03:10.489> ball<00:03:10.760> and

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
it look more like a metal poker ball and

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.470 
it look more like a metal poker ball and
then<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:11.989> put<00:03:12.439> de<00:03:12.709> gloss<00:03:13.189> finish<00:03:13.669> on<00:03:13.849> everything

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
then I put de gloss finish on everything

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.839 
then I put de gloss finish on everything
to<00:03:15.109> make<00:03:15.319> it<00:03:16.359> feel<00:03:17.359> like<00:03:17.389> that<00:03:17.750> acrylic<00:03:18.079> paint

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
to make it feel like that acrylic paint

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.330 
to make it feel like that acrylic paint
anyway<00:03:19.849> so<00:03:20.079> this<00:03:21.079> is<00:03:21.139> a<00:03:21.290> all<00:03:21.859> the<00:03:22.129> pieces

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
anyway so this is a all the pieces

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.740 
anyway so this is a all the pieces
painted<00:03:22.849> and<00:03:25.000> if<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.329> start<00:03:26.780> with<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:28.750> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
painted and if you start with the the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.990 
painted and if you start with the the
one<00:03:29.930> where<00:03:30.079> you<00:03:30.169> build<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.560> parts<00:03:30.889> I'll<00:03:31.489> put

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
one where you build the parts I'll put

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.399 
one where you build the parts I'll put
in<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.239> M<00:03:33.159> to<00:03:34.159> show<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:34.810> what<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.989> M<00:03:36.139> looks

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
in the M to show you what the M looks

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:42.909 
in the M to show you what the M looks
like<00:03:39.579> you<00:03:40.579> know<00:03:40.639> I'm<00:03:41.060> trying<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:42.109> push<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.799> in

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
like you know I'm trying to push it in

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.089 
like you know I'm trying to push it in
slowly<00:03:43.569> because<00:03:44.569> I<00:03:44.720> don't<00:03:44.930> want<00:03:45.139> the<00:03:45.709> paint<00:03:45.949> to

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
slowly because I don't want the paint to

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:55.229 
slowly because I don't want the paint to
rub<00:03:46.430> off<00:03:46.609> on<00:03:46.639> it<00:03:47.949> so<00:03:48.949> put<00:03:49.609> the<00:03:49.760> button<00:03:50.060> in<00:03:50.209> too

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.490 

you<00:03:56.239> can<00:03:56.419> see<00:03:58.180> some<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.329> paint<00:03:59.629> gets

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
you can see some of the paint gets

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.099 
you can see some of the paint gets
rubbed<00:04:00.769> off<00:04:01.010> on<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.400> sides<00:04:01.699> if<00:04:02.269> you<00:04:02.810> paint

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
rubbed off on the sides if you paint

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.580 
rubbed off on the sides if you paint
inside<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.859> circle<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:05.239> try<00:04:05.479> not<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.690> but

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
inside the circle so try not to but

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.159 
inside the circle so try not to but
otherwise<00:04:06.919> just<00:04:07.329> trying<00:04:08.329> to<00:04:08.419> scrape<00:04:08.720> off<00:04:08.930> any

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
otherwise just trying to scrape off any

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.339 
otherwise just trying to scrape off any
paint<00:04:09.530> that<00:04:09.739> gets<00:04:09.919> transferred<00:04:10.400> on<00:04:10.579> to<00:04:11.349> the

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
paint that gets transferred on to the

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.280 
paint that gets transferred on to the
pieces<00:04:12.709> so<00:04:13.010> that's<00:04:13.189> the<00:04:13.370> inner<00:04:13.489> ring<00:04:13.760> anyway

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
pieces so that's the inner ring anyway

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.360 
pieces so that's the inner ring anyway
with<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.650> button<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:17.829> we'll<00:04:18.829> put<00:04:19.039> in<00:04:19.190> the

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
with the button and we'll put in the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.629 
with the button and we'll put in the
bumps<00:04:19.759> from<00:04:20.599> the<00:04:20.989> master<00:04:21.349> ball<00:04:21.500> again<00:04:22.310> make

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
bumps from the master ball again make

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.939 
bumps from the master ball again make
sure<00:04:22.820> they're<00:04:23.030> oriented<00:04:24.020> right<00:04:25.270> again

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
sure they're oriented right again

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.440 
sure they're oriented right again
pushing<00:04:27.949> slowly<00:04:28.610> son<00:04:28.880> I<00:04:29.120> don't<00:04:29.570> rub<00:04:30.289> any<00:04:30.500> paint

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
pushing slowly son I don't rub any paint

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.830 
pushing slowly son I don't rub any paint
I'm<00:04:32.450> also<00:04:32.659> just<00:04:32.900> lining<00:04:33.590> it<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:35.300> that

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
I'm also just lining it so that

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.100 
I'm also just lining it so that
like<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.980> top<00:04:37.250> of<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.610> bump<00:04:37.850> doesn't<00:04:38.330> hit<00:04:38.570> the

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
like the top of the bump doesn't hit the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.090 
like the top of the bump doesn't hit the
inside<00:04:39.740> of<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.910> master<00:04:41.480> ball<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:42.139> mark<00:04:42.740> any<00:04:42.950> of

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
inside of the master ball to mark any of

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.580 
inside of the master ball to mark any of
the<00:04:43.190> paint<00:04:43.419> so<00:04:44.419> that's<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:44.810> master<00:04:45.080> ball<00:04:45.380> lid

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
the paint so that's the master ball lid

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
the paint so that's the master ball lid
and<00:04:47.080> that's<00:04:48.080> what<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:48.980> looks<00:04:49.160> like<00:04:49.310> with<00:04:49.580> the

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
and that's what it looks like with the

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.520 
and that's what it looks like with the
pieces<00:04:50.000> in<00:04:50.330> it<00:04:50.450> and<00:04:50.690> as<00:04:50.900> you<00:04:51.050> can<00:04:51.169> see<00:04:51.230> the

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
pieces in it and as you can see the

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.270 
pieces in it and as you can see the
inside<00:04:51.889> you<00:04:52.130> can<00:04:52.310> see<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:53.060> bumps<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:54.280> that's

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
inside you can see the bumps and that's

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.930 
inside you can see the bumps and that's
why<00:04:55.550> we<00:04:55.790> need<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.180> special<00:04:57.169> inner<00:04:57.650> ring<00:04:58.100> those

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
why we need the special inner ring those

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.970 
why we need the special inner ring those
gaps<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.950> it<00:05:01.280> just<00:05:01.639> fits<00:05:01.880> on<00:05:02.030> like<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.980> then

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
gaps and it just fits on like that then

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.920 
gaps and it just fits on like that then
you<00:05:04.100> put<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.550> base<00:05:04.820> on<00:05:06.490> there<00:05:07.490> we<00:05:07.820> have<00:05:08.060> it<00:05:08.240> the

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
you put the base on there we have it the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.950 
you put the base on there we have it the
master<00:05:09.680> ball<00:05:09.830> and<00:05:10.520> I<00:05:10.730> think<00:05:11.000> it<00:05:11.150> feels<00:05:11.720> really

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
master ball and I think it feels really

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.310 
master ball and I think it feels really
good<00:05:12.169> in<00:05:12.320> your<00:05:12.440> hand<00:05:12.680> it<00:05:13.040> I<00:05:13.820> printed<00:05:14.480> at<00:05:14.690> nine

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
good in your hand it I printed at nine

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.230 
good in your hand it I printed at nine

other lid that's printed all in one
piece<00:05:27.130> I<00:05:29.530> want<00:05:30.530> to<00:05:30.620> be<00:05:30.710> careful<00:05:30.950> when<00:05:31.220> you're

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
piece I want to be careful when you're

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.330 
piece I want to be careful when you're
putting<00:05:31.520> them<00:05:31.790> together<00:05:32.800> again<00:05:33.800> with<00:05:33.979> paint

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
putting them together again with paint

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:44.980 
putting them together again with paint

transfer and line up the pack and the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.850 
transfer and line up the pack and the
pressure<00:05:45.290> should<00:05:45.680> keep<00:05:46.220> it<00:05:46.370> together<00:05:47.860> but

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
pressure should keep it together but

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.630 
pressure should keep it together but
there<00:05:49.190> it<00:05:49.280> is
