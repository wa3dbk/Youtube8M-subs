00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.470
 my name is 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.700
 I had to be a photographer and also able to 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.710
 ambassador for Kamera Express 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.150
 we know the guest on and 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.920
 for a very exclusive first hands 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.020
 view of the new cameras released this year 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.900
 to know will come true and well 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.980
 the canon eos 5ds that i am here in my 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.770
 hands have 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.450
 and the little brother the eos 5ds r where i like that 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.730
 once even briefly will come back to 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.220
 the cameras position themselves between it 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.500
 current flagship the 1dx and the 5d 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.930
 Mark III and have some specific 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.400
 characteristics you today revu 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.440
 want to pass 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.570
 the core and eos 5ds appears in appearance 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.559
 in many ways on the canon eos 5d 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.449
 mark iii 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.920
 the camera is a few grams lighter than 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.960
 his little brother but further 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.460
 the same dimensions 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.949
 this ken him body is again manufactured 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.970
 made of high-quality magnesium alloy 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.129
 photography among all 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.080
 weather conditions ideal for 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.180
 landscape great gift aimed 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.850
 are the best recording 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.500
 whatever the weather is, the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.040
 camera equipped with a nice big one 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.750
 100% search just like the 5d mark iii 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.060
 In addition, it has large clear view 2 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.619
 LCD screen with an anti-reflection layer 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.479
 reflections and flare during 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.479
 minimize recording viewing 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.080
 just like the 7d mark 2 is the camera 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.940
 now equipped with a usb 3 port 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.990
 but that is actually not surprising too 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.240
 to mention 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.980
 know in short embroider in appearance with 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.110
 the 5ds on the success of 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.610
 previous models but inside the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.740
 cameras are nevertheless some striking 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.460
 to state differences with which 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.070
 a new generation 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.080
 SLRs ushers 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.000
 but on the canon eos 1dx and the canon 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.880
 eos 5d mark iii still equipped with 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.250
 18 point 1 and 22 point 3 respectively 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.560
 megapixels and new cameras 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.110
 pass on the limits of 35mm sensors 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.909
 and within the highest number of pixels ever 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.640
 in the full-frame sensor, an impressive 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.930
 5 to 6 megapixels 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.060
 thus the cameras offer a 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.650
 unparalleled image quality 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.940
 whether it's landscape photography 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.049
 architecture fashion or portrait photography 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.759
 for private or professional use 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.379
 the 5ds promises to be a camera 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.920
 for the photographer with an eye for 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:17.400
 Detail the 50 megapixels once sensor 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.409
 in the eos 5ds and the eos 5ds r can do so much 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.629
 detail data that recordings 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.099
 can be printed on extremely large 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.069
 formats without losing and 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.969
 Image quality occurs also without 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.710
 quality loss selective 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.760
 image cropping possible 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.140
 to use the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.920
 recording programs with a crop factor 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.060
 of 1.3 and 1.6 times 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.560
 the new one also plays a role 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.750
 advanced measurement sensor with spots 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.890
 detection in both cameras is important 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.730
 role 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.950
 flashing lights of artificial light 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.630
 sources such as LED lamps and fluorescent beams 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.220
 sometimes takes care of it in the past 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.500
 fluctuations in light measurement and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.030
 color balance which makes big differences 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.740
 could arise in the area of ​​you 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.850
 exposure 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.680
 the new measurement sensor with spots 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.540
 detection ensures consistent 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.330
 accurate light measurement and color balance 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.800
 under the most difficult circumstances 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.260
 most SLR cameras 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.750
 including the 1dx 5d mark iii and the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.940
 use the 5ds just mentioned and 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.800
 run filter that is for the sensor 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.000
 placed to display digital artifacts 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.920
 occur such as Marie and false colors 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.020
 such filters provide somewhat 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.910
 a softening of the image for 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.710
 situations where the all sharpest 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.430
 inclusion is green and and in addition 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.560
 also the eos 5ds r from that is 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.690
 performed with a run cancellation 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.100
 filter to the resolution of the sensor and 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.020
 the visible image quality 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.170
 while maximizing the chance of marie 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.670
 and false colors is minimal all this 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.850
 Megapixel violence is naturally beautiful 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.830
 but not entirely without consequences 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.090
 the recordings and so detailed that the 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.100
 minor errors 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.690
 are being brought 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.160
 hence also know that for quite some time 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.990
 is busy with technical innovations 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.410
 with an eye to the future 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.120
 so the 5ds and the 5ds r are equipped with 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.920
 the mirror vibration control system 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.840
 causing vibrations from the mirror 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.720
 are muted and blur as a result 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.310
 of vibrations is measured 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.410
 also know him for years working on the 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.540
 optics to be renewed , including the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.040
 glass and the coating used this high 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.080
 ability to resolve 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.850
 support 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.000
 this results in beautiful new ones 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.900
 objective like the one published in 2012 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.610
 know 2470 two point 8 version 2 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.980
 and what about last year 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.070
 1635 four point zero objective appeared 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.630
 with built-in image stabilizer now comes 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.810
 know with the new ultra large 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.300
 collectively know the new 1124 four 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.730
 point 0 thus stretched linear through which 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.320
 straight lines do not have barrel shaped signs and 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.700
 appear right in it 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.560
 final image 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.750
 so you do not need software afterwards 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.460
 to correct and you lose as a result 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.560
 know nothing about your viewing angle 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.090
 1124 has the grand grandiose on 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.290
 zoom range in the world 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.510
 and I ca n't wait to get this objective 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.130
 in combination with the new 5ds 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.330
 use 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.590
 I'll have to go there for a little while 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.900
 wait since this is about 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.540
 pre-production models of the 5ds and the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.950
 5ds r so we'll be there later this year 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.390
 back again 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.460
 now all those extra megapixels have up to 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.590
 a result, the file size at 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.990
 relative to the 1dx and the 5d mark iii 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.400
 has increased enormously with the falling 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.960
 prices of hard drives and 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.050
 flash memory this will not be a problem 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.280
 but the camera needs the images 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.490
 of course less reasonable pace 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.770
 able to process to realize that 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.050
 has know the 5ds and the 5ds r 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.420
 Equipped with the same fast target digit 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.570
 6 processors that we found earlier 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.370
 in the canon eos 7d mark 2 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.230
 now you do n't want the same of the 5ds 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.390
 expect speed as from the 7d mark 2 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.630
 since that camera is equipped with 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.280
 a 20 megapixel apsc sensor and just like 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.570
 the 1st x is intended for absolute 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.550
 speed 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.010
 the 5ds is by using these two 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.630
 powerful digit 6 processors 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.460
 however, still able to get one 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.640
 deliver continuous recording from but 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.140
 up to five frames per second the evil 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.330
 focus does the five that is also not inferior 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.190
 for speed samples such as the 1dx and the 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.170
 7d mark 2 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.420
 the camera is equipped just like the 1dx 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.210
 with the advanced 61 points 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.700
 autofocus system with 41 brush 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.890
 auto focus points to cover the entire image 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.450
 field unrivaled level 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:19.140
 sharpness and accuracy 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.700
 and just like the 7d mark 2 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.860
 keep the camera moving subjects 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.210
 easily in focus with english in 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.850
 television tracking and recognition 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.410
 autofocus system that both faces 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.990
 as color adds 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.910
 both the 5ds and the 5ds r offer one 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.390
 unique combination of resolution and 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.580
 speed 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.280
 which is certainly not suitable for the camera 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.650
 makes both buddies for action photography 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.360
 are available from June 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.190
 just like me you can't wait and 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.110
 do you want to be the first of dutch belgium 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.770
