00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
race like we saw in the Kentucky Derby

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.759 
race like we saw in the Kentucky Derby
where<00:02:38.519> speed<00:02:39.209> was<00:02:39.540> all<00:02:39.750> over<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.290> place<00:02:40.470> at

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
where speed was all over the place at

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.160 
where speed was all over the place at
the<00:02:40.860> beginning<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> race<00:02:41.549> you<00:02:42.330> should<00:02:42.870> be

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the beginning of the race you should be

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.809 
the beginning of the race you should be
flying<00:02:43.530> at<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.830> end<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.280> race<00:02:44.489> because

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
flying at the end of that race because

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.270 
flying at the end of that race because
you<00:02:44.970> were<00:02:45.090> never<00:02:45.299> used<00:02:45.720> at<00:02:46.049> any<00:02:46.200> part<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
you were never used at any part of the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.500 
you were never used at any part of the
race<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:48.150> even<00:02:48.599> though<00:02:48.630> on<00:02:49.019> paper<00:02:50.060> it's<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.239> good

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
race so even though on paper it's a good

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.630 
race so even though on paper it's a good
reason<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.079> say<00:02:52.260> hey<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.680> horse<00:02:52.950> cousin<00:02:53.340> can

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
reason to say hey this horse cousin can

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.050 
reason to say hey this horse cousin can
improve<00:02:54.209> it's<00:02:55.049> also<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.500> built-in<00:02:56.010> excuse<00:02:56.700> that

find<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.370> winner's<00:04:33.550> circle<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:34.870> think<00:04:35.590> that

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
find the winner's circle I think that

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.860 
find the winner's circle I think that
this<00:04:35.860> horse<00:04:36.130> with<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.000> leaven<00:04:37.419> postpositions

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
this horse with the leaven postpositions

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.010 
this horse with the leaven postpositions
going<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.440> get<00:04:38.680> an<00:04:39.220> easier<00:04:39.669> trip<00:04:40.090> he's<00:04:40.750> going

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
going to get an easier trip he's going

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.559 
going to get an easier trip he's going
to<00:04:41.080> be<00:04:41.259> he<00:04:41.560> has<00:04:41.650> tactical<00:04:42.190> speed<00:04:42.699> that'll<00:04:43.449> be

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
to be he has tactical speed that'll be

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.719 
to be he has tactical speed that'll be
laying<00:04:43.840> off<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.380> first<00:04:44.680> set<00:04:45.039> of<00:04:45.160> horses<00:04:45.580> with

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
laying off that first set of horses with

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.059 
laying off that first set of horses with
the<00:04:45.849> speed<00:04:46.210> so<00:04:47.139> he'll<00:04:47.349> have<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:47.530> jump<00:04:47.860> on<00:04:48.009> the

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
the speed so he'll have a jump on the

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.749 
the speed so he'll have a jump on the
closer's<00:04:48.699> and<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.870> only<00:04:50.289> knock<00:04:50.889> or<00:04:51.220> question

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
closer's and the only knock or question

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.740 
closer's and the only knock or question
on<00:04:51.970> vyjack<00:04:52.840> is<00:04:53.050> can<00:04:53.199> he<00:04:53.229> get<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.590> distance<00:04:54.750> but

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
on vyjack is can he get the distance but

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.529 
on vyjack is can he get the distance but
I<00:04:55.990> say<00:04:56.470> if<00:04:56.740> he<00:04:57.400> couldn't<00:04:57.819> get<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.150> distance

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
I say if he couldn't get the distance

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.409 
I say if he couldn't get the distance
why<00:04:59.319> did<00:04:59.620> they<00:04:59.770> skip<00:05:00.159> the<00:05:00.400> Preakness<00:05:00.940> which

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
why did they skip the Preakness which

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.420 
why did they skip the Preakness which
would<00:05:01.569> have<00:05:01.630> been<00:05:01.690> a<00:05:01.780> shorter<00:05:02.199> race<00:05:02.409> and<00:05:02.710> point

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
would have been a shorter race and point

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.820 
would have been a shorter race and point
