00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.369
 sixties cumulative fan per series 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.529

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.109
 mireille dubois 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.829

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.279
 so the haye for the finishes 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.489
 but these programs and cypresses 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.819
 a bentley 6 the rain continues presents itself 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.260
 duguay who are afraid

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 listen to what I saw was saying a lame in the left lane 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.350
 it's only a quarter-time 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.470
 So this is it 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.750
 he will be a super series 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.200
 afp - paris which is finished 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.410
 so first of all resorted 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.580
 but the glue 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.710
 but there like that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.570
 e 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.270
 % 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.250
 already collaborated 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.670
 so free 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.760
 qualcomm 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.760
 these had not reached the expectations are great 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.330
 percent believe that 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.440
 m 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.880
 a little 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.840
 suddenly a smooth like this 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840
 you have to base your head 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.020
 you cut 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.060
 you pay 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.830

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.190
 at worst it is expected that what was more 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.920
 you want 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.369
 marc heno tourcoing 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.049
 loeb after a word after doing that 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.629

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.659
 stendhal 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.659

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.469
 first of the technique 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.749
 and you're fooling 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.639
 when you have two countries that have a little strong 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.559
 cost you in all per cent i believe that by then a coupe 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.309
 glue rise 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.489
