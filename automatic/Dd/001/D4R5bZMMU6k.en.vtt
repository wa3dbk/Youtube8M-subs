00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
with increasing vault space was that it

point2 comes out for those of you on ps3

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
vault because it takes up too much

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.550 
vault because it takes up too much
memory<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.270> guess<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> point<00:02:07.259> where<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
memory I guess to the point where the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.260 
memory I guess to the point where the
game<00:02:07.770> can't<00:02:08.160> handle<00:02:08.550> all<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.970> stuff

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
game can't handle all that stuff

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.900 
game can't handle all that stuff
happening<00:02:09.750> at<00:02:09.840> once<00:02:10.080> at<00:02:10.349> least<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.099> ps3<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
happening at once at least on ps3 and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.680 
happening at once at least on ps3 and
xbox<00:02:12.450> 360

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
xbox 360

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.840

ps4<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.230> xbox<00:02:14.590> one<00:02:14.680> will<00:02:14.830> continue<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.670> work

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
ps4 and xbox one will continue to work

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.450 
ps4 and xbox one will continue to work
as<00:02:16.090> normal<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.630> will<00:02:17.050> not<00:02:17.290> experience<00:02:17.890> this

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
as normal and will not experience this

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.880 
as normal and will not experience this
sacrifice<00:02:19.270> so<00:02:20.020> there's<00:02:20.230> some<00:02:20.410> insight<00:02:20.710> as<00:02:20.860> to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
sacrifice so there's some insight as to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.040 
sacrifice so there's some insight as to
why<00:02:21.310> they<00:02:21.550> can't<00:02:21.820> just<00:02:21.910> give<00:02:22.240> us<00:02:22.390> five<00:02:22.420> hundred

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
why they can't just give us five hundred

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.810 
why they can't just give us five hundred
slots<00:02:23.380> for<00:02:23.590> everything<00:02:24.010> it's<00:02:24.160> very<00:02:24.340> cool<00:02:24.550> them

design and technical process is like

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.680 
design and technical process is like
behind<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.490> lot<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.790> these<00:02:33.910> things<00:02:34.120> happening

I'm<00:02:34.840> sure<00:02:35.320> if<00:02:35.440> Bungie<00:02:35.710> just<00:02:35.920> said<00:02:36.100> oh<00:02:36.310> yeah<00:02:36.700> 24

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360

I'm sure if Bungie just said oh yeah 24
36<00:02:37.720> 24<00:02:38.260> slots<00:02:38.530> then<00:02:39.010> people<00:02:39.310> would<00:02:39.430> just<00:02:39.550> be

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
36 24 slots then people would just be

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.100 
36 24 slots then people would just be
complaining<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.330> they<00:02:40.570> weren't<00:02:40.720> getting
