00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello everyone today we 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.490
 will compare the sony xperia z3 with the 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.170
 samsung with its 5 we'll see which one is 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.510
 the best we go we start 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.980
 as usual by the design section 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.599
 so samsung and sony or a big point 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.259
 common when they created their z3 and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.240
 theirs 5 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.529
 indeed both have been criticized 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.480
 for staying a little too close 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.670
 z 2 and 2,4 respectively well 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.260
 heard the critics basically did not 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.789
 wrong but some improvements on 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.180
 2014 models will still be the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.220
 difference 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.050
 we can start with the z3 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.029
 wins him in style with a frame in 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.710
 rounded aluminum not only very 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.949
 elegant but also protective in case of 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.930
 fall 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.880
 because yes sony for that's all for the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.530
 rest we are on the usual xperia with 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.300
 a glass slab in the front as in 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.280
 the back and a rather geometric look 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 the calacs cs5 is it without a doubt 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.730
 a real samsung the physical button 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.930
 central is witness to it just as the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.890
 remain positions and buttons 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.840
 physical and camera 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.760
 especially his frame is an imitation 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.899
 plastic aluminum that will age 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.820
 Moreover, much less well than the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.230
 true to him of the ispa gaza 3 he has to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.030
 the back a heart rate monitor a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.350
 little more from samsung is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 as well as a fingerprint scanner at 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.440
 the front note that they are both 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.760
 water resistant a first at 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.799
 samsung or a good old habit 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.820
 at sony's if i will choose the best 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.799
 design between the two 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 personally i will choose the s5 for 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.979
 his excellent grip in fact his 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.900
 pretty adhesive and matte material to 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.299
 the back is nice enough it allows 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.799
 to keep the s5 well in hand but the z3 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.000
 with cams a nice advantage of quality of 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.710
 manufacturing not just for its 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.150
 materials used but also for 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.680
 the elegant appearance that it will offer from 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.930
 first look is a draw 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.400
 in design 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.750
 so let's move on to the screen now 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.250
 terms of size and definition the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.960
 two are almost similar 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.850
 Full HD in both cases 5 Hangover 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.509
 inch for 3 and 5 1 inch helpers 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.250
 for the 5 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.659
 however the z3 is still going 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.270
 dimensions be slightly larger 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.590
 than the 5 despite a smaller screen 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.909
 side view quality the users have 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.590
 tend to prefer the wheel of 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.540
 samsung at lcd de sony 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.880
 indeed the colors seem more 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.869
 strong I have humility is more intense and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.829
 it simply gives a 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.810
 better quality printing 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.909
 in reality and two are pretty good 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.540
 and answer differently according to the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.219
 ambient light 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.600
 but in the end even if the colors or 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.799
 by a hole a little more fat on 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.079
 the experience of the three you will only be 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.600
 frankly not disappointed neither by the z3 nor by 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.189
 the s5 in terms of systems the z3 the s5 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.450
 turn each under android 4 with a 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.009
 version a little bit more recent on 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.450
 two and three and they each have 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.380
 an overlay builder very 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.780
 complete and customizable and named 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.220
 and touchwiz the goal here is not to 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.450
 inventory features 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.070
 that each of these interfaces without 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.660
 to be able to offer you that would be good too 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.490
 long but we can note that 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.930
 each in its own way will offer you 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.510
 anyway an excellent experience 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.890
 xperia user will be really perfect 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.510
 if you are a gamer or if you 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.070
 use your smartphone to watch 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.240
 videos take pictures finally brief 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.370
 everything that revolves around content 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.930
 media while targeting a May 5 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.400
 public is slightly different a little 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.990
 bit more professional and a little more this 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.250
 all-in-one looks like we can 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.260
 find you I'm a little too much 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.640
 invasive compared to xp to huy who him 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.500
 is very clean but it's mostly a 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.060
 question of taste in the end noted that sony 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.850
 has a tendency to put these devices to 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.020
 day faster than samsung and this 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.030
 can be of particular importance 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.540
 now with the arrival of android 5.0 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.730
 lollipop 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.800
 performance side one tackles and from 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.320
 smartphones a dragon 801 snap clocked at 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.210
 2,5 giguÃ¨re a quadricoeur of course 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.010
 but the z3 is still better 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.600
 thanks to its 3 gig of ram while the a5 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.250
 it stops at 2 it's a bit of a pity 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.240
 besides the s worry a plus 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.440
 conducive to being used 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.600
 professionally and therefore to do 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.920
 turn multitasking permanently a 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.970
 gigabyte of extra ram would have everything 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.110
 likewise welcome but in 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.220
 let's all remember that these 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.900
 two smartphones we will offer you a 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.160
 very good performances and we are 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.590
 well high end audio on each side 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.610
 on the verge of battery the galaxy s 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.200
 worried a great surprise 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.120
 even if the energy saving mode 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.600
 ultra we can easily hold more 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.850
 one day 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.130
 sony knew him some worries of this 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.750
 side there but has counted on the z3 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.280
 to catch up the result is good 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.930
 you will be able to hold roughly 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.090
 a day or more without any worry 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.650
 he too has an ultra energy mode 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.150
 which is very convenient in case of emergency 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.770
 the only point that may be able to do 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.420
 tip the scales towards the s5 and well 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.500
 heard his removable battery which is 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.360
 well practical in the long run 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.800
 we now go to the camera 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.300
 which is probably the most 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.459
 interesting from this comparison since 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.750
 sony as samsung have both 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.910
 raised a lot of interest at this point there 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.410
 on the paper the sensor of 20.7 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.570
 megapixels of the z3 looks awesome 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.370
 and the reality to be disappointing you 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.600
 somehow the colors are actually 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.310
 a little stronger than expected 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.800
 even though the detail accuracy is fine 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.150
 there on the side of the s1 we have a camera 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.070
 16-megapixel camera that does a job 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.300
 excellent its interface is full of 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.040
 resources but will be more adapt 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.300
 maybe those who do not want too much 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.870
 take the head select directly 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.280
 a preset mode 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.299
 while the narrow ones will have him l 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.639
 benefit of leaving you carte blanche 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.169
 on all settings 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.699
 it has already come time to conclude this 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.310
 comparative while what about these two 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.780
 then the 5 is very good but the 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.060
 z3 for me a little too often 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.260
 underestimated indeed the notoriety of 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.610
 sony may not be the same as 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.220
 samsung and it's a shame 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.600
 in the end we hope that each of his 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.100
 brands will still offer a real 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.690
 change for 2015 because for now 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.250
 each one stays a little too much in these 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.270
 beaten tracks but the strait is 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.889
 really a nice option if you 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.780
 look for a powerful smartphone and 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.430
 current if we really had to choose 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.449
 between the two personally it's 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.770
 true that I will leave anyway rather 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.970
 on the a5 but it's more for 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.979
 design issues and interfaces 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.690
 little question for the end the dock the 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.370
 best according to you and especially why 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.840
 tell me in the comments and 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.830
 then we'll see each other again soon do not forget 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.630
 to go for a ride on a druid 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.470
 point fr and above all to subscribe to 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.889
 our youtube channel 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.889
 ciao
