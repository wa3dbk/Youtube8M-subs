00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.820 

I'm<00:00:08.970> just<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.450> discuss<00:00:09.780> how<00:00:10.050> we<00:00:10.080> run<00:00:10.590> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
I'm just going to discuss how we run a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.860 
I'm just going to discuss how we run a
network<00:00:11.340> system<00:00:11.490> which<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> basic

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
network system which is a basic

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.269 
network system which is a basic
gravity-fed<00:00:13.670> system<00:00:14.929> it<00:00:15.929> consists<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.560> some

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
gravity-fed system it consists of some

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.679 
gravity-fed system it consists of some
basic<00:00:18.289> parts<00:00:19.289> they<00:00:20.010> take<00:00:20.279> which<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.150> sent<00:00:21.510> at<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
basic parts they take which is sent at a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.259 
basic parts they take which is sent at a
higher<00:00:21.900> level<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.590> system<00:00:23.029> it's<00:00:24.029> filled

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
higher level to the system it's filled

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.689 
higher level to the system it's filled
with<00:00:24.330> nutrient<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:26.930> brain<00:00:27.930> which<00:00:28.859> controls<00:00:29.250> it

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
with nutrient a brain which controls it

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.340 
with nutrient a brain which controls it
which<00:00:30.480> has<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> barrel<00:00:31.080> vinner<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:34.050> valve

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
which has a barrel vinner and this valve

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.490 
which has a barrel vinner and this valve
controls<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> water<00:00:35.070> level<00:00:35.430> from<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> tank

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
controls the water level from the tank

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.950 
controls the water level from the tank
that's<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> same<00:00:37.739> way<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> pump<00:00:38.370> does<00:00:38.960> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
that's the same way that a pump does it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080 
that's the same way that a pump does it
actually<00:00:40.230> knows<00:00:40.379> how<00:00:41.309> much<00:00:41.460> water<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> give<00:00:42.030> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
actually knows how much water to give to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.410 
actually knows how much water to give to
the<00:00:42.149> plants<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.460> each<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.850> brain<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.270> then

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the plants and each the brain is then

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.660 
the plants and each the brain is then
connected<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.960> all<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.350> pots<00:00:46.590> using<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> common

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
connected to all the pots using a common

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.189 
connected to all the pots using a common
hose<00:00:48.710> I'll<00:00:49.710> demonstrate<00:00:50.719> with<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.870> plant

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
hose I'll demonstrate with this plant

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.780 
hose I'll demonstrate with this plant
here

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.900 

that<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:55.480> sits<00:00:55.690> in<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.890> new<00:00:57.010> trend<00:00:57.310> which<00:00:57.880> is

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
that it sits in the new trend which is

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.950 
that it sits in the new trend which is
at<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.180> same<00:00:58.360> level<00:00:58.690> as<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.230> brain<00:01:00.960> basically

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
at the same level as the brain basically

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.350 
at the same level as the brain basically
the<00:01:02.200> valve<00:01:02.410> understands<00:01:03.250> that<00:01:03.910> if<00:01:04.059> this<00:01:04.180> was

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
the valve understands that if this was

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.330 
the valve understands that if this was
sitting<00:01:04.570> in<00:01:04.660> a<00:01:04.750> source<00:01:05.020> of<00:01:05.170> water<00:01:05.380> we<00:01:06.130> would

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
sitting in a source of water we would

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.150 
sitting in a source of water we would
know<00:01:07.090> that<00:01:07.120> that<00:01:07.660> would<00:01:07.840> be<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.350> full<00:01:08.890> saucer

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
know that that would be a full saucer

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.090 
know that that would be a full saucer
and<00:01:09.640> that<00:01:09.970> would<00:01:10.090> be<00:01:10.180> an<00:01:10.240> empty<00:01:10.390> saucer<00:01:11.100> what

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
and that would be an empty saucer what

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.490 
and that would be an empty saucer what
what<00:01:12.460> Bob<00:01:12.940> does<00:01:13.210> is<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:13.570> fills<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.110> up<00:01:14.200> until

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
what Bob does is it fills it up until

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.680 
what Bob does is it fills it up until
its<00:01:14.650> source<00:01:14.890> of<00:01:15.070> depth<00:01:15.220> of<00:01:15.670> nutrient<00:01:16.150> which

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
its source of depth of nutrient which

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.510 
its source of depth of nutrient which
the<00:01:16.810> plant<00:01:17.050> can<00:01:17.200> then<00:01:17.320> soak<00:01:17.560> up<00:01:17.740> in<00:01:17.890> years<00:01:18.190> and

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
the plant can then soak up in years and

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.550 
the plant can then soak up in years and
when<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.240> plant<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:19.720> used<00:01:19.870> up<00:01:20.080> all<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.350> water

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
when the plant is used up all the water

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.500 
when the plant is used up all the water
and<00:01:20.950> it's<00:01:21.220> then<00:01:21.610> got<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.030> bottom<00:01:22.300> of<00:01:22.420> the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
and it's then got to the bottom of the

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.070 
and it's then got to the bottom of the
pot<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:24.100> an<00:01:24.220> empty<00:01:24.400> saucer<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:25.570> available

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
pot like an empty saucer the available

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.560 
pot like an empty saucer the available
then<00:01:26.229> no<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.530> fill<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.040> up<00:01:27.100> again<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
then no to fill it up again the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.600 
then no to fill it up again the
advantage<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.229> this<00:01:29.380> is<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:30.040> plants<00:01:30.430> actually

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
advantage of this is the plants actually

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.030 
advantage of this is the plants actually
drive<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.180> system<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.259> plants<00:01:32.619> get<00:01:32.770> all

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
drive the system and the plants get all

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.180 
drive the system and the plants get all
the<00:01:33.100> food<00:01:33.280> they<00:01:33.490> want<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.930> they<00:01:34.960> want<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:35.500> not

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
the food they want when they want it not

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.850 
the food they want when they want it not
when<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.640> when<00:01:37.330> I<00:01:37.360> grow<00:01:38.080> a<00:01:38.110> decides<00:01:38.590> they're

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
when the when I grow a decides they're

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.139 
when the when I grow a decides they're
going<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.100> feed<00:01:39.250> it

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.959 

from<00:01:45.719> here<00:01:45.960> I'll<00:01:46.560> take<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.219> show<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.549> how

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
from here I'll take you and show you how

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.649 
from here I'll take you and show you how
the<00:01:48.840> system<00:01:49.289> is<00:01:49.500> put<00:01:49.890> together<00:01:50.390> there<00:01:51.390> at<00:01:51.509> all

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the system is put together there at all

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.440 
the system is put together there at all
your<00:01:52.200> balls<00:01:52.409> around<00:01:52.740> using<00:01:52.950> perlite<00:01:53.460> which<00:01:53.729> is

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
your balls around using perlite which is

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.550 
your balls around using perlite which is
a<00:01:54.979> growing<00:01:55.979> media<00:01:56.549> which<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.179> a<00:01:57.719> growing<00:01:58.200> me<00:01:58.380> of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
a growing media which is a growing me of

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.469 
a growing media which is a growing me of
choice<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.009> here<00:01:59.189> we<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.819> also<00:01:59.939> use<00:02:00.210> coconut

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
choice and here we can also use coconut

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
choice and here we can also use coconut
coir<00:02:00.929> if<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.289> want<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:01.770> we'd<00:02:01.950> still<00:02:01.979> need<00:02:02.189> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
coir if we want to but we'd still need a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.590 
coir if we want to but we'd still need a
better<00:02:02.520> pull<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.149> bottom<00:02:03.299> their

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
better pull out on the bottom their

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.779 
better pull out on the bottom their
stockings<00:02:04.259> away<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.979> there<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.429> there<00:02:05.759> are

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
stockings away so there is there are

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.240 
stockings away so there is there are
some<00:02:06.030> ways<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.420> customizing<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.160> come

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
some ways of customizing it if you come

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.880 
some ways of customizing it if you come
with<00:02:08.399> me<00:02:08.519> I'll<00:02:08.819> show<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.140> how<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.379> put<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.739> all

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
with me I'll show you how we put it all

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.490 
with me I'll show you how we put it all
together<00:02:13.790> we<00:02:14.790> do<00:02:15.269> make<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.599> system<00:02:15.989> in<00:02:16.170> a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
together we do make this system in a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.449 
together we do make this system in a
square<00:02:17.220> had<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.849> 93<00:02:18.420> millimeter<00:02:18.780> pop<00:02:19.459> BSA

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
square had a 93 millimeter pop BSA

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.740 
square had a 93 millimeter pop BSA
supply<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.750> 300<00:02:22.200> milk<00:02:22.349> pot<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:23.299> 430<00:02:24.299> milk<00:02:24.540> pot

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
supply in a 300 milk pot a 430 milk pot

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.870 
supply in a 300 milk pot a 430 milk pot
and<00:02:24.959> 500<00:02:25.739> mil<00:02:25.829> pot<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.190> you're<00:02:26.340> growing<00:02:26.519> fruit

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
and 500 mil pot if you're growing fruit

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.229 
and 500 mil pot if you're growing fruit
trees<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.329> so<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:28.010> okay<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:29.340> we<00:02:29.459> have<00:02:29.489> a

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
trees and so on okay here we have a

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.240 
trees and so on okay here we have a
couple<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.720> pods<00:02:30.900> which<00:02:31.140> we're<00:02:31.379> going<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.680> show

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
couple of pods which we're going to show

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.509 
couple of pods which we're going to show
how<00:02:32.400> they<00:02:32.549> work<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.269> network<00:02:33.720> system

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
how they work in the network system

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.979 
how they work in the network system
basically<00:02:35.519> there<00:02:36.000> are<00:02:36.030> two<00:02:36.450> types<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.780> pots

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
basically there are two types of pots

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.039 
basically there are two types of pots
there's<00:02:37.590> one<00:02:37.799> which<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> growing<00:02:38.459> pot<00:02:38.700> a

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
there's one which is a growing pot a

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.720 
there's one which is a growing pot a
moment<00:02:40.049> she's<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.440> brain<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.069> has<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.519> valve

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
moment she's a brain and has the valve

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.330 
moment she's a brain and has the valve
in<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:43.110> I'll<00:02:43.230> just<00:02:43.260> take<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:43.769> out<00:02:44.040> again

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
in it and I'll just take this out again

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.030 
in it and I'll just take this out again
you<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.120> see

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.230 

and<00:02:52.519> why

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
and why

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.470 
and why
we're<00:02:55.200> too<00:02:55.470> much<00:02:55.620> about<00:02:55.920> how<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:57.270> valve

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
we're too much about how the valve

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.060 
we're too much about how the valve
itself<00:02:57.810> works<00:02:58.080> all<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.410> does<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.710> it<00:02:58.740> knows

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
itself works all it does is it knows

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.270 
itself works all it does is it knows
when<00:02:59.400> it's<00:03:00.210> a<00:03:00.300> high-level<00:03:01.010> source<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.130> depth

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
when it's a high-level source of depth

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.170 
when it's a high-level source of depth
and<00:03:02.610> when<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:02.910> 20<00:03:03.920> but<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.130> two<00:03:05.730> bitch<00:03:05.940> comes

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
and when it's 20 but the two bitch comes

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.210 
and when it's 20 but the two bitch comes
out<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.600> valve<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:07.290> SiC<00:03:07.530> next<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.980> tank

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
out of the valve of SiC next to a tank

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.460 
out of the valve of SiC next to a tank
at<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.400> higher<00:03:08.580> level<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:09.570> rabbiting<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.230> feed

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
at a higher level so rabbiting the feed

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.940 
at a higher level so rabbiting the feed
the<00:03:10.590> water<00:03:10.770> down<00:03:11.040> it's<00:03:11.820> for<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.210> tap<00:03:12.950> it's

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
the water down it's for this tap it's

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.160 
the water down it's for this tap it's
through<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.190> filter<00:03:14.660> hamster<00:03:15.660> valve<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
through this filter hamster valve the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.600 
through this filter hamster valve the
field<00:03:16.410> is<00:03:16.530> important<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.040> doesn't<00:03:17.280> block<00:03:17.430> on

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
field is important so doesn't block on

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.990 
field is important so doesn't block on
the<00:03:17.730> valve<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:19.530> tap<00:03:19.770> is<00:03:19.980> one<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.640> those<00:03:20.730> things

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
the valve the tap is one of those things

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.240 
the valve the tap is one of those things
which<00:03:21.180> makes<00:03:21.390> life<00:03:21.600> easy<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.590> turn<00:03:23.100> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
which makes life easy you can turn the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.430 
which makes life easy you can turn the
tap<00:03:23.460> off<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.270> disconnect<00:03:24.990> that<00:03:27.320> take<00:03:28.320> the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
tap off and disconnect that take the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.000 
tap off and disconnect that take the
tank<00:03:28.650> away<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:28.980> fill<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.860> cleaners<00:03:31.860> or

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
tank away to fill it to the cleaners or

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.770 
tank away to fill it to the cleaners or
whatever<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.880> when<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.120> bring<00:03:33.240> it<00:03:33.330> back<00:03:33.390> here

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
whatever and when you bring it back here

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.300 
whatever and when you bring it back here
you<00:03:34.020> can<00:03:34.140> reconnect<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.710> without<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.100> leaking

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
you can reconnect it without it leaking

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.580 
you can reconnect it without it leaking
all<00:03:35.520> over<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.700> place<00:03:35.940> there's<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.660> tap<00:03:36.840> just<00:03:37.380> in

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
all over the place there's a tap just in

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.180 
all over the place there's a tap just in
its<00:03:38.010> turn<00:03:38.370> back<00:03:38.580> on<00:03:38.760> again<00:03:39.260> ready<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.530> turn<00:03:41.070> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
its turn back on again ready to turn the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.460 
its turn back on again ready to turn the
system<00:03:41.310> on<00:03:42.350> so<00:03:43.350> that<00:03:43.500> one<00:03:43.650> about<00:03:44.010> into<00:03:44.550> the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.900 
solid bottom and this one's don't now
you<00:04:02.640> see<00:04:02.880> these<00:04:03.150> two<00:04:03.390> holes<00:04:05.870> drilled<00:04:06.870> in<00:04:06.990> them

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
you see these two holes drilled in them

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.160 
you see these two holes drilled in them
and<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:09.060> haven't<00:04:09.300> put<00:04:09.450> our<00:04:09.570> fittings<00:04:09.870> in<00:04:10.020> there

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
and we haven't put our fittings in there

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.990 
and we haven't put our fittings in there
because<00:04:10.290> they<00:04:10.500> don't<00:04:10.620> stack<00:04:10.920> very<00:04:11.160> well<00:04:11.370> in

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
because they don't stack very well in

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.890 
because they don't stack very well in
transit

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.060 

just<00:04:18.900> run<00:04:19.080> fresh<00:04:19.290> water<00:04:19.560> through<00:04:19.830> it<00:04:19.920> to<00:04:20.040> make

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
just run fresh water through it to make

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.850 
just run fresh water through it to make
sure<00:04:20.220> it's<00:04:20.489> wiped<00:04:20.670> down<00:04:20.730> and<00:04:20.910> rinsed<00:04:21.860> we're

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
sure it's wiped down and rinsed we're

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.940 
sure it's wiped down and rinsed we're
putting<00:04:23.100> it<00:04:23.190> in<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.310> system<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:25.380> then<00:04:25.650> to

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
putting it in the system and then to

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.290 
putting it in the system and then to
connect<00:04:26.220> all<00:04:26.340> this<00:04:26.460> together<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:26.970> set<00:04:27.180> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
connect all this together you set the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.240 
connect all this together you set the
pots<00:04:27.480> up<00:04:27.660> where<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:27.930> want<00:04:28.110> them<00:04:28.320> to<00:04:28.440> be<00:04:28.590> and

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
pots up where you want them to be and

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.120 
pots up where you want them to be and
then<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.760> put<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.540> little<00:04:30.720> rubber<00:04:31.710> grommet

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
then you put the little rubber grommet

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.940 
then you put the little rubber grommet
into<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.730> huh<00:04:34.490> nice<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.760> easily<00:04:36.890> if<00:04:37.890> you

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
into the huh nice and easily if you

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.900 
into the huh nice and easily if you
weren't<00:04:38.190> watching<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.640> would<00:04:38.730> have<00:04:38.820> gone

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
weren't watching that would have gone

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.680 
weren't watching that would have gone
amazing<00:04:39.300> there<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.320> go<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:41.010> see<00:04:41.850> peace<00:04:42.090> what

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
amazing there you go and see peace what

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.810 
amazing there you go and see peace what
we<00:04:42.780> do<00:04:42.930> is<00:04:43.020> we<00:04:43.110> push<00:04:43.320> that<00:04:43.470> into<00:04:43.650> place<00:04:43.920> and<00:04:44.670> if

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
we do is we push that into place and if

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.670 
we do is we push that into place and if
as<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.300> push<00:04:45.480> that<00:04:45.630> in<00:04:45.810> it<00:04:46.200> will<00:04:46.350> swell<00:04:46.650> up

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
as I push that in it will swell up

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.760 
as I push that in it will swell up
inside<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.790> seal<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:48.810> I'm<00:04:48.930> coming<00:04:49.200> flush<00:04:49.470> I

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
inside and seal and I'm coming flush I

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.080 
inside and seal and I'm coming flush I
won't<00:04:50.130> push<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.400> all<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.520> way<00:04:50.580> so<00:04:50.940> I'll<00:04:51.000> never

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
won't push it all the way so I'll never

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.920 
won't push it all the way so I'll never
get<00:04:51.240> it<00:04:51.360> out<00:04:51.450> again

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.020 

so<00:04:54.930> once<00:04:55.139> we've<00:04:55.320> got<00:04:55.530> two<00:04:56.280> pieces<00:04:56.699> and<00:04:56.820> all<00:04:56.940> the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
so once we've got two pieces and all the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.600 
so once we've got two pieces and all the
plots<00:04:57.300> we<00:04:58.259> have<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.470> do<00:04:58.620> is<00:04:58.740> get<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.070> hose

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
plots we have to do is get the hose

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.020 
plots we have to do is get the hose
then<00:05:00.180> measure<00:05:00.419> out<00:05:00.570> what<00:05:01.350> length<00:05:01.789> between<00:05:02.789> the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
then measure out what length between the

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.999 
then measure out what length between the
cross<00:05:03.570> link<00:05:04.560> you<00:05:04.949> need<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.220> parts<00:05:05.430> together

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
cross link you need the parts together

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.189 
cross link you need the parts together
and<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.639> system<00:05:08.970> will<00:05:09.180> then<00:05:09.449> commence

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
and the system will then commence

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.150 
and the system will then commence
running<00:05:10.560> when<00:05:11.100> you<00:05:11.210> fill<00:05:12.210> up<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.419> tank<00:05:13.160> that's

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
running when you fill up the tank that's

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.860 
running when you fill up the tank that's
a<00:05:14.280> fairly<00:05:14.580> simple<00:05:14.940> idea<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:17.509> if<00:05:18.509> you<00:05:18.600> have<00:05:18.720> any

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
a fairly simple idea and if you have any

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.420 
a fairly simple idea and if you have any
problems<00:05:19.199> just<00:05:19.560> let<00:05:19.919> us<00:05:20.039> know<00:05:22.160> so<00:05:23.160> there<00:05:23.370> you

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
problems just let us know so there you

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.180 
problems just let us know so there you
have<00:05:23.460> it<00:05:23.610> simple<00:05:24.030> system<00:05:24.530> nobody<00:05:25.530> feeds<00:05:26.039> it

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
have it simple system nobody feeds it

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.450 
have it simple system nobody feeds it
down<00:05:26.220> into<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.669> valve<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.830> all<00:05:28.949> the<00:05:29.070> pots<00:05:29.280> are

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
down into a valve and all the pots are

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.120 
down into a valve and all the pots are
connected<00:05:29.820> together<00:05:29.910> by<00:05:30.840> this<00:05:30.900> tube<00:05:31.320> in<00:05:31.919> a

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
connected together by this tube in a

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.670 
connected together by this tube in a
loop<00:05:32.479> so<00:05:33.479> that<00:05:33.510> all<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:33.840> pots<00:05:34.050> share<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.500> same

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
loop so that all the pots share the same

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.770 
loop so that all the pots share the same
amount<00:05:34.889> of<00:05:34.919> nutrient<00:05:35.460> per<00:05:36.360> lights<00:05:36.570> in<00:05:36.690> the

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
amount of nutrient per lights in the

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.180 
amount of nutrient per lights in the
pots<00:05:36.990> and<00:05:38.539> so<00:05:39.539> all<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.620> have<00:05:40.710> to<00:05:40.800> do<00:05:40.919> is<00:05:41.039> put

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
pots and so all you have to do is put

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.210 
pots and so all you have to do is put
your<00:05:41.280> seeds<00:05:41.520> in<00:05:41.840> wet<00:05:42.840> them<00:05:43.020> down<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:44.039> they'll

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
your seeds in wet them down and they'll

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.189 
your seeds in wet them down and they'll
come<00:05:44.400> up<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.760> system<00:05:45.570> will<00:05:45.660> take<00:05:45.780> care<00:05:45.990> of<00:05:46.050> it

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
come up and system will take care of it

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.470 
come up and system will take care of it
for<00:05:46.349> you

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
for you

00:05:47.480 --> 00:06:03.100 
for you
have<00:05:48.080> you<00:05:48.170> got<00:05:48.320> me
