00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Draw a pattern on paper (you can use a ready-made fox 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 you can find on the blog) 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Cut all paper parts 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 and then from the material. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
 First, bring the handles and feet to the front of the torso 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.500
 Put your head to the torso 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.000
 Finally, sew both parts of the torso so that you can fill the finger 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.000
 They look cunning? :) 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 And then carefully embrace the rest of the elements (eg the back, the part of the mouth) 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 and embroider the eyes and face of the fox
