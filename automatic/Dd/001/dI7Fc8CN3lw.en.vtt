00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
just really quick here you can see that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.990 
just really quick here you can see that
we<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.720> some<00:01:12.930> metal<00:01:13.260> present<00:01:13.740> here

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
we do have some metal present here

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.070 
we do have some metal present here
whereas<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.420> feels<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
whereas this is feels like a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560 
whereas this is feels like a
polyurethane<00:01:16.619> material<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:18.000> quite<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
polyurethane material it's not quite the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.270 
polyurethane material it's not quite the
same<00:01:18.900> material<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.770> at<00:01:19.950> least<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.220> don't

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
same material as this at least I don't

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.310 
same material as this at least I don't
think<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.570> anyway<00:01:21.840> let's<00:01:21.990> go<00:01:22.110> ahead<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
think it is so anyway let's go ahead and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.270 
think it is so anyway let's go ahead and
open<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.070> case<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.920> get<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.040> out<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
open this case up and get this out of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
open this case up and get this out of
here<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.270> nice<00:01:27.509> sort<00:01:28.259> of

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
here and we do have that nice sort of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.859 
here and we do have that nice sort of
cloth<00:01:28.770> material<00:01:29.119> over<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> inside

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
cloth material over here on the inside

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.679 
cloth material over here on the inside
very<00:01:31.409> much<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.189> maybe<00:01:33.119> not<00:01:33.270> quite<00:01:33.630> as

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
very much like this maybe not quite as

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.609 
very much like this maybe not quite as
soft<00:01:34.229> though<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.000> here<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.600> ipad<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.470> one
