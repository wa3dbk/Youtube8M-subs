more<00:02:09.890> cops<00:02:10.550> than<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.820> deal<00:02:10.970> with<00:02:11.000> normal<00:02:11.450> talks

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
more cops than I deal with normal talks

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.170 
more cops than I deal with normal talks
I<00:02:11.930> think<00:02:12.380> my<00:02:12.500> go-to<00:02:12.830> what<00:02:13.250> if<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.640> had<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.030> narrow

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
I think my go-to what if I had to narrow

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.210 
I think my go-to what if I had to narrow
down<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:15.050> would<00:02:15.140> probably<00:02:15.410> be<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:15.830> on<00:02:16.070> here

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
down it would probably be this on here

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.420 
down it would probably be this on here
and<00:02:16.430> it's<00:02:16.580> just<00:02:16.820> gray<00:02:17.390> honest<00:02:17.900> long<00:02:18.230> sleep<00:02:18.709> and

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
and it's just gray honest long sleep and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.980 
and it's just gray honest long sleep and
there's<00:02:19.610> long<00:02:19.820> scene<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.330> probably<00:02:20.690> why<00:02:20.930> i

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
there's long scene is probably why i

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.900 
there's long scene is probably why i
choose<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.680> because<00:02:21.709> it's<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.400> really

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
choose it because it's just so really

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.270 
choose it because it's just so really
easy<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.480> work<00:02:23.510> because<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.410> do<00:02:24.470> love<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.980> tops

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
easy to work because I do love the tops

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.250 
easy to work because I do love the tops
like<00:02:25.550> this<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.820> think<00:02:26.030> ones<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.930> are<00:02:27.050> long

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
like this I think ones that are long

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.020 
like this I think ones that are long
stays<00:02:27.560> are<00:02:27.770> just<00:02:28.040> more<00:02:28.160> easy<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.700> wear<00:02:28.880> this

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
stays are just more easy to wear this

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.820 
stays are just more easy to wear this
time<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.420> year<00:02:29.450> I'm<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:30.170> way<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.380> can<00:02:30.590> so

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
time of year I'm that way you can so

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.229 
time of year I'm that way you can so
where<00:02:31.070> I<00:02:31.100> popped<00:02:31.459> up<00:02:31.640> but<00:02:31.790> you're<00:02:31.940> still<00:02:32.090> not

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
where I popped up but you're still not

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.940 
where I popped up but you're still not
going<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:32.570> freezing<00:02:32.840> cold<00:02:33.230> good<00:02:33.530> question

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
going to be freezing cold good question

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.250 
going to be freezing cold good question
is<00:02:34.130> why<00:02:34.370> exactly<00:02:34.640> do<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.030> typically<00:02:35.510> wear<00:02:35.750> and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
is why exactly do you typically wear and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.960 
is why exactly do you typically wear and
I<00:02:36.590> would<00:02:36.950> love<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.190> say<00:02:37.489> something<00:02:37.820> like

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
I would love to say something like

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.430 
I would love to say something like
hearts<00:02:38.420> or<00:02:38.510> something<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.810> do<00:02:38.959> actually<00:02:39.140> like

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
hearts or something I do actually like

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.350 
hearts or something I do actually like
wearing<00:02:39.739> hats<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.100> just<00:02:40.280> don't<00:02:40.550> typically<00:02:41.120> wear

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
wearing hats I just don't typically wear

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.530 
wearing hats I just don't typically wear
them<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:42.080> i<00:02:42.110> think<00:02:42.380> i<00:02:42.709> would<00:02:42.890> have<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.160> say

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320

style<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:08.980> also<00:05:09.160> think<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.550> could<00:05:09.730> do<00:05:09.820> this
