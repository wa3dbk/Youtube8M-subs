important when you're dealing with these
valve<00:00:30.869> bodies<00:00:31.200> that<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.920> get<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> right

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
valve bodies that you get the right

valve bodies that you get the right
combination<00:00:32.970> you<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.660> right<00:00:33.809> solenoids

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
combination you get the right solenoids

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.640 
combination you get the right solenoids
mounted<00:00:35.850> right<00:00:36.030> because<00:00:36.360> our<00:00:36.660> Val<00:00:37.199> buys<00:00:37.410> when

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
mounted right because our Val buys when

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.500 
mounted right because our Val buys when
we<00:00:37.769> rebuild<00:00:38.220> them<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.460> send<00:00:38.640> them<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.850> we

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
we rebuild them and send them out we

typically put the solenoids the linear
sellings<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.019> little<00:00:43.199> plastic<00:00:43.500> bag<00:00:43.710> because

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
sellings in a little plastic bag because

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.670 
sellings in a little plastic bag because
they're<00:00:44.100> oily<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:45.480> shipping<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.530> don't

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
they're oily and in shipping if we don't

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.930 
they're oily and in shipping if we don't
if<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:46.830> put<00:00:47.100> them<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.339> Val<00:00:47.460> bite<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:47.790> get

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
if we put them on the Val bite they get

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
if we put them on the Val bite they get
broken<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.510> they're<00:00:48.900> pretty<00:00:49.049> you<00:00:49.409> know<00:00:49.610> since

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
broken so they're pretty you know since

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.390 
broken so they're pretty you know since
they're<00:00:50.760> pretty<00:00:51.030> sensitive<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.140> way<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:53.280> if

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
they're pretty sensitive that way so if

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.710 
they're pretty sensitive that way so if
you<00:00:53.460> want<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> look<00:00:53.760> down<00:00:53.909> at<00:00:54.089> the<00:00:54.269> at<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
you want to look down at the at the

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.000 
you want to look down at the at the
table<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.110> I've<00:00:55.170> got<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.409> three<00:00:55.620> main

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
table here I've got the three main

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.729 
table here I've got the three main
versions<00:00:56.460> here<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:57.870> couple<00:00:58.350> things<00:00:58.620> you'll

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
versions here a couple things you'll

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.770 
versions here a couple things you'll
notice<00:00:58.830> on<00:00:59.070> all<00:00:59.220> of<00:00:59.430> our<00:00:59.549> setups<00:01:00.299> we<00:01:00.510> have

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
notice on all of our setups we have

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.439 
notice on all of our setups we have
color<00:01:01.199> coded<00:01:01.619> the<00:01:02.489> color<00:01:02.729> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.970> connector

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
color coded the color of the connector

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.820 
color coded the color of the connector
the<00:01:03.629> cell<00:01:03.809> annoys<00:01:03.960> especially<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> blue<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the cell annoys especially the blue and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.830 
the cell annoys especially the blue and
the<00:01:04.920> green<00:01:05.070> one<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> bracket<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.720> we

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the green one with the bracket so we

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.780 
the green one with the bracket so we
kind<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> indicate<00:01:07.619> which<00:01:07.890> position<00:01:08.520> they<00:01:08.549> go

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
kind of indicate which position they go

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.630 
kind of indicate which position they go
in<00:01:08.970> because<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.140> turned<00:01:10.380> around

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
in because they can get turned around

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.940 
in because they can get turned around
and<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.820> they<00:01:11.940> turned<00:01:12.360> around<00:01:12.479> or<00:01:12.950> installed

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and if they turned around or installed

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.330 
and if they turned around or installed
upside<00:01:14.189> down<00:01:14.549> or<00:01:14.790> backwards<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:16.860> won't<00:01:17.130> shift

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
upside down or backwards it won't shift

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580 
upside down or backwards it won't shift
right<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.270> let's<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.260> show<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
right so let's just show you the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.010 
right so let's just show you the
earliest<00:01:20.250> version<00:01:20.610> which<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> typically

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
earliest version which if you typically

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
earliest version which if you typically
look<00:01:22.170> at<00:01:22.290> has<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> kind<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> narrow<00:01:23.070> thin

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
look at has a kind of a narrow thin

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.960 
look at has a kind of a narrow thin
bracket<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:25.070> another<00:01:26.070> characteristic

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
bracket and another characteristic

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.370 
bracket and another characteristic
feature<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.270> these<00:01:27.450> solenoids<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.050> that<00:01:28.230> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
feature of these solenoids is that the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.700 
feature of these solenoids is that the
two<00:01:28.980> blue<00:01:29.760> and<00:01:29.790> green<00:01:30.500> connectors<00:01:31.500> are

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
two blue and green connectors are

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
two blue and green connectors are
oriented<00:01:32.220> toward<00:01:32.430> up<00:01:32.610> toward<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> top<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
oriented toward up toward the top of the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.850 
oriented toward up toward the top of the
valve<00:01:33.720> body<00:01:33.870> where<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.110> harness<00:01:34.290> comes<00:01:34.650> down

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
valve body where the harness comes down

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.230 
valve body where the harness comes down
through<00:01:35.610> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
through it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.820 
through it
this<00:01:36.570> black<00:01:36.810> Solomon<00:01:37.200> which<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.410> it<00:01:37.620> really

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
this black Solomon which is it really

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.560 
this black Solomon which is it really
isn't<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.100> problem<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.550> all<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.970> same<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.360> all

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
isn't a problem it's all the same on all

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.440 
isn't a problem it's all the same on all
versions<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.160> wouldn't<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:42.000> too<00:01:42.180> much<00:01:42.330> to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
versions so I wouldn't not too much to

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.540 
versions so I wouldn't not too much to
worry<00:01:42.480> about<00:01:42.660> that<00:01:43.070> another<00:01:44.070> thing<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.370> note

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
worry about that another thing to note

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.450 
worry about that another thing to note
on<00:01:44.730> all<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:45.780> arrangements<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.440> that<00:01:46.620> if<00:01:47.010> you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
on all the arrangements is that if you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.200 
on all the arrangements is that if you
look<00:01:47.670> through<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.350> exhaust<00:01:49.350> ports<00:01:49.909> of<00:01:50.909> either

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
look through the exhaust ports of either

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.840 
look through the exhaust ports of either
the<00:01:51.300> valve<00:01:51.450> body<00:01:51.659> or<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.050> VAT<00:01:52.230> the<00:01:52.409> very<00:01:52.620> last

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
of the larger bracket is it has a little

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.640 
of the larger bracket is it has a little
notch<00:02:41.310> or<00:02:41.610> finger<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.420> basically<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.500> one

notch or finger that basically the one
finger<00:02:44.010> points<00:02:44.370> toward<00:02:44.580> one<00:02:44.760> cell<00:02:44.970> now<00:02:45.150> you

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
finger points toward one cell now you

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.310 
finger points toward one cell now you
can<00:02:45.330> kind<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.570> remind<00:02:45.870> yourself<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.260> that

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
can kind of remind yourself of that

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.470 
can kind of remind yourself of that
that's<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.160> case<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.490> colors<00:02:47.790> are<00:02:47.970> mixed<00:02:48.240> up

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
that's in case the colors are mixed up

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.880 
that's in case the colors are mixed up
or<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.750> use<00:02:48.870> some<00:02:49.080> other<00:02:49.200> valve<00:02:49.470> body<00:02:49.710> and

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
or you use some other valve body and

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.940 
or you use some other valve body and
doesn't<00:02:50.100> have<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:51.770> indications<00:02:52.770> on<00:02:52.920> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
doesn't have the indications on the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.180 
doesn't have the indications on the
colors<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.370> which<00:02:53.700> how<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.450> line<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.720> up<00:02:55.190> so

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
colors of which how to line it up so

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.390 
colors of which how to line it up so
that's<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> second<00:02:56.730> version<00:02:56.850> third<00:02:57.510> version

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
that's the second version third version

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.370 
that's the second version third version

this<00:03:04.050> design<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:05.010> orientation<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
this design the orientation of the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.510 
this design the orientation of the
connectors<00:03:06.600> went<00:03:06.900> from<00:03:07.110> facing<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.800> upper

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.580 
connectors went from facing the upper
part<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.880> Val<00:03:09.000> by<00:03:09.210> now<00:03:09.780> they<00:03:09.990> rotated<00:03:10.440> them

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
part of the Val by now they rotated them

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.460 
part of the Val by now they rotated them
toward<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.100> lower<00:03:11.280> part<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:11.700> on<00:03:12.240> this

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
toward the lower part so on this

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.690 
toward the lower part so on this
configuration<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.830> use<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:13.980> longer<00:03:14.220> harness

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
