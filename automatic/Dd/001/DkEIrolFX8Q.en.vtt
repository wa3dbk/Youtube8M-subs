can't see this and you kind of have to
look<00:02:11.400> over<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.850> that's<00:02:11.970> kind<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.360> little<00:02:12.570> bit

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
look over so that's kind of a little bit

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.120 
look over so that's kind of a little bit
of<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.840> flaw<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.350> noticed<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:14.010> they

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
of a flaw that I noticed that they

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.390 
of a flaw that I noticed that they
didn't<00:02:14.340> bother<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:16.250> there<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.370> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
didn't bother to think of there is a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.980 
didn't bother to think of there is a
little<00:02:17.640> bit<00:02:17.760> more<00:02:18.060> road<00:02:18.360> noise<00:02:18.540> than<00:02:18.900> I

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
little bit more road noise than I

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.600 
little bit more road noise than I
anticipated<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:19.980> car<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.550> not

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
anticipated in this car but it's not

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.730 
anticipated in this car but it's not
deafening<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.750> can<00:02:21.900> see<00:02:22.050> when<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> read<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
deafening but I can see when I read the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.380 
deafening but I can see when I read the
the<00:02:23.280> Motor<00:02:23.520> Trend<00:02:23.760> review<00:02:24.090> when<00:02:24.270> they

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
the Motor Trend review when they

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.630 
the Motor Trend review when they
compared<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.290> BMW<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.830> Audi<00:02:26.040> and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
compared this to the BMW the Audi and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.100 
compared this to the BMW the Audi and
compared<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.060> those<00:02:27.210> cars<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:27.750> car<00:02:28.020> is

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
compared to those cars that this car is

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.660 
compared to those cars that this car is
probably<00:02:28.230> louder<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:28.950> not<00:02:29.130> deafening

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
probably louder but it's not deafening

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.430

to me it's just because I'm used to a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.230 
to me it's just because I'm used to a
much<00:02:31.560> louder<00:02:31.740> car

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
but I mean I'm trying to think of

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.670 
but I mean I'm trying to think of
anything<00:03:50.540> else<00:03:50.780> I'm<00:03:51.020> noticing<00:03:51.290> about<00:03:51.560> this

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
anything else I'm noticing about this

anything else I'm noticing about this
car<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.160> far<00:03:52.370> I<00:03:52.400> mean<00:03:52.520> I'm<00:03:52.730> really<00:03:52.970> impressed

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
car so far I mean I'm really impressed

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.060 
car so far I mean I'm really impressed
with<00:03:53.390> that<00:03:53.450> gas<00:03:53.690> mileage<00:03:54.170> because<00:03:54.290> my<00:03:54.890> fit

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
with that gas mileage because my fit

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.850 
with that gas mileage because my fit
does<00:03:55.250> about<00:03:55.460> that<00:03:55.670> in<00:03:55.850> combined<00:03:56.510> city<00:03:56.960> on<00:03:57.230> the

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
does about that in combined city on the

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.080 
does about that in combined city on the
highway<00:03:58.160> I've<00:03:58.250> seen<00:03:58.400> my<00:03:58.490> kid<00:03:58.670> do<00:03:58.790> as<00:03:58.880> high<00:03:59.030> as

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
highway I've seen my kid do as high as

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.330 
highway I've seen my kid do as high as
about<00:03:59.150> 39<00:03:59.750> but<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:00.560> fact<00:04:00.709> that<00:04:00.770> this<00:04:00.950> car<00:04:01.160> has

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
about 39 but the fact that this car has

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.160 
about 39 but the fact that this car has
a<00:04:01.370> 2.4<00:04:01.940> liter<00:04:01.970> engine<00:04:02.209> only<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.630> 5-speed<00:04:03.020> auto

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
a 2.4 liter engine only a 5-speed auto

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.590 
a 2.4 liter engine only a 5-speed auto
it<00:04:03.320> can<00:04:03.440> do<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:04.150> from<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.240> highway<00:04:05.510> is

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
it can do that from the highway is

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.730 
it can do that from the highway is
really<00:04:05.840> impressive

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.920 

but<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.520> think<00:04:09.940> that's<00:04:10.240> pretty<00:04:10.420> much<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.780> the

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
but I think that's pretty much it the

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.190 
but I think that's pretty much it the
seats<00:04:11.290> are<00:04:11.890> really<00:04:12.250> comfortable<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:13.690> terms<00:04:13.990> of

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
seats are really comfortable in terms of

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.780 
seats are really comfortable in terms of
like<00:04:14.410> just<00:04:14.770> like<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:15.070> mean<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.220> two-hour<00:04:15.580> drive

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.230 
technology package I think this car does
need<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:36.190> backup<00:04:36.550> camera<00:04:36.760> just<00:04:37.120> because

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
need the the backup camera just because

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.360 
need the the backup camera just because
it's<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.840> it's<00:04:38.380> got<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.530> pretty<00:04:38.770> high<00:04:38.920> deck<00:04:39.220> in

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
it's the it's got a pretty high deck in

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.280 
it's the it's got a pretty high deck in
the<00:04:39.460> back<00:04:39.640> are<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.510> windows<00:04:40.780> kind<00:04:40.960> of<00:04:41.080> small

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
the back are the windows kind of small

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.510 
the back are the windows kind of small
and<00:04:41.530> it's<00:04:41.890> a<00:04:41.950> little<00:04:42.130> bit<00:04:42.220> hard<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.400> see

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
and it's a little bit hard to see

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.800 
and it's a little bit hard to see
especially<00:04:42.760> when<00:04:43.060> you're<00:04:43.180> parallel<00:04:43.450> parking

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
especially when you're parallel parking

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.560 
especially when you're parallel parking
but<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:45.160> guess<00:04:45.760> my<00:04:45.880> parents<00:04:46.120> are<00:04:46.180> only<00:04:46.330> notice<00:04:46.510> I

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
but I guess my parents are only notice I

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.060 
but I guess my parents are only notice I
guess<00:04:46.780> just<00:04:46.960> I<00:04:47.110> notice<00:04:47.440> that<00:04:47.560> because<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.860> think

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
guess just I notice that because I think

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.650 
guess just I notice that because I think
I<00:04:48.130> should<00:04:48.490> include<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.880> backup<00:04:49.150> camera<00:04:49.360> in<00:04:49.570> the

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
I should include a backup camera in the

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.600 
I should include a backup camera in the
rear<00:04:49.840> view<00:04:49.870> mirror<00:04:50.020> if<00:04:50.920> anything<00:04:50.980> there's<00:04:51.490> the
