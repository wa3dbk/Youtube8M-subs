00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
the braid to begin the wave all you have

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.289 
the braid to begin the wave all you have
to<00:03:36.540> do<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.720> section<00:03:37.079> off<00:03:37.349> your<00:03:37.379> hair<00:03:38.000> I'm<00:03:39.000> doing

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
essentially you're going to just pinch

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.890 
essentially you're going to just pinch
the<00:03:43.170> waver<00:03:43.410> from<00:03:44.370> each<00:03:44.670> strand<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.450> order<00:03:45.780> to

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
the waver from each strand in order to

00:03:45.900 --> 00:04:28.840

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.189 

now<00:04:29.850> if<00:04:29.910> you've<00:04:30.090> got<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.360> basic<00:04:30.690> gist<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:31.080> this

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
now if you've got the basic gist of this

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.020 
now if you've got the basic gist of this
little<00:04:31.470> thing<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:32.100> top<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.669> head<00:04:32.820> is

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
little thing the top of the head is

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.760 
little thing the top of the head is
supposed<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.389> be<00:04:33.539> sectioned<00:04:33.960> off<00:04:34.050> towards<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
supposed to be sectioned off towards the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.590 
supposed to be sectioned off towards the
back<00:04:35.039> so<00:04:35.729> essentially<00:04:36.150> what<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:36.360> get<00:04:36.479> that

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
back so essentially what you get that

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.100 
back so essentially what you get that
volume

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
volume

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.360 
volume
you're<00:04:37.350> supposed<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.710> section<00:04:38.100> off<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.250> hair

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
you're supposed to section off the hair

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.330 
you're supposed to section off the hair
in<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.729> middle<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:40.010> basically<00:04:41.010> what<00:04:41.220> I'm

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
in the middle and basically what I'm

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.990 
in the middle and basically what I'm
doing<00:04:41.370> right<00:04:41.789> now

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
doing right now

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.469 
doing right now
is<00:04:42.240> kind<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.229> pinching<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.770> waver<00:04:43.949> upwards<00:04:44.639> so

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
is kind of pinching the waver upwards so

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:51.020 
is kind of pinching the waver upwards so
I<00:04:45.510> can<00:04:45.750> get<00:04:45.900> that<00:04:46.020> volume<00:04:46.199> at<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.560> top<00:04:49.970> this<00:04:50.970> is

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
I can get that volume at the top this is

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.629 
I can get that volume at the top this is
