minifigs<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.530> now<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.130> here's<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> closer

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670

look<00:01:14.970> our<00:01:15.180> two<00:01:15.390> minifigs<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.369> think<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.580> one

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
look our two minifigs I think this one

here<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.060> pretty<00:01:18.570> basic<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:19.560> we've<00:01:19.710> had

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
here is pretty basic I think we've had

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
here is pretty basic I think we've had
that<00:01:19.979> torso<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.729> legs<00:01:20.880> before<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.420> could<00:01:21.720> be

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810

wrong<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.920> I'm<00:01:23.369> pretty<00:01:23.939> sure<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.420> not<00:01:24.630> new

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
wrong but I'm pretty sure that's not new

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.260 
wrong but I'm pretty sure that's not new
but<00:01:24.869> maybe<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.650> now<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.090> i'm

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.800 
but maybe it is now this one here i'm
pretty<00:01:27.570> sure<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.900> one<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.170> new<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:30.090> like

the<00:01:59.450> headphones<00:02:00.450> built<00:02:00.780> into<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.380> think

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the headphones built into it I think

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.139 
the headphones built into it I think
that<00:02:01.619> looks<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.040> lot<00:02:02.189> better<00:02:02.430> than<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> ones

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
that looks a lot better than the ones

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.830 
that looks a lot better than the ones
where<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.930> take<00:02:04.560> them<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.159> off<00:02:05.250> but

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
where you can take them on and off but

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.719 
where you can take them on and off but
that's<00:02:06.840> my<00:02:07.079> opinion<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.250> hat<00:02:08.520> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that's my opinion I do like that hat and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.969 
that's my opinion I do like that hat and
both<00:02:09.420> them<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.959> single<00:02:10.259> sided<00:02:10.440> faces

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
both them just have single sided faces

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.830 
both them just have single sided faces
so<00:02:11.879> taking<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.300> closer<00:02:12.540> look<00:02:12.720> at<00:02:13.110> our<00:02:13.260> little

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
so taking a closer look at our little

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.220 
so taking a closer look at our little
conveyor<00:02:14.170> belt<00:02:14.530> here<00:02:14.970> after<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.269> escalator

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
conveyor belt here after the escalator

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.559 
conveyor belt here after the escalator
excavator<00:02:17.980> drops<00:02:18.400> off<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.940> rock<00:02:19.180> and

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
excavator drops off the rock and

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.259 
excavator drops off the rock and
whatever<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.260> debris<00:02:20.769> in<00:02:20.830> here<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.910> can<00:02:22.060> turn

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
whatever the debris in here you can turn

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.540 
whatever the debris in here you can turn
this<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.870> can<00:02:23.319> get<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.590> without<00:02:23.680> my<00:02:23.980> hand<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.370> way

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
this I can get it without my hand in way

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.410 
this I can get it without my hand in way
there<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:25.930> turn<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:28.180> just

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
there you just turn this and it just

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.780 
there you just turn this and it just
turns<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.959> belt<00:02:29.230> which<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.400> cranks

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
turns the belt which in just cranks

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.270 
turns the belt which in just cranks
everything<00:02:31.319> right<00:02:32.319> up<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.010> back<00:02:33.250> of

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
everything right up and to the back of

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.360 
everything right up and to the back of
the<00:02:33.430> truck<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.780> got<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.110> say<00:02:35.140> my<00:02:35.650> son<00:02:36.069> who's

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
the truck and I got to say my son who's

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.900 
the truck and I got to say my son who's
three<00:02:36.790> really<00:02:37.420> loved<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:37.959> feature<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.910> he

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
three really loved this feature and he

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.479 
three really loved this feature and he
was<00:02:40.060> having<00:02:40.299> a<00:02:40.360> blast<00:02:40.569> with<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:42.099> know<00:02:42.250> I

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
was having a blast with it so you know I

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.119 
was having a blast with it so you know I
think<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:43.170> maybe<00:02:44.170> he's<00:02:44.500> may<00:02:44.799> be<00:02:44.860> too<00:02:45.099> young

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
think for maybe he's may be too young

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.150 
think for maybe he's may be too young
but<00:02:45.640> maybe<00:02:46.269> for<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.110> age<00:02:47.319> group<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:47.920> says

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
but maybe for the age group on it says

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.850 
but maybe for the age group on it says
five<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.670> 12<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:50.230> I'd<00:02:50.319> say<00:02:50.530> even<00:02:50.769> a

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
five to 12 but I'd say even a

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.319 
five to 12 but I'd say even a
four-year-old<00:02:51.310> if<00:02:51.549> you<00:02:51.670> build<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.030> for<00:02:52.269> them

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
four-year-old if you build it for them

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.240 
four-year-old if you build it for them
and<00:02:52.569> keep<00:02:53.230> an<00:02:53.380> eye<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:53.769> think<00:02:53.980> they<00:02:54.099> would

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
and keep an eye on I think they would

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.309 
and keep an eye on I think they would
really<00:02:54.549> enjoy<00:02:54.819> it<00:02:55.150> like<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.360> said<00:02:55.569> my<00:02:55.690> son<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:56.019> 3

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
really enjoy it like I said my son is 3

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.949 
really enjoy it like I said my son is 3
and<00:02:56.440> he<00:02:56.560> loved<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:58.060> piece<00:02:58.299> is<00:02:58.750> all

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
and he loved it and this piece is all

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.380 
and he loved it and this piece is all
one<00:02:59.290> piece<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.920> comes<00:03:00.160> out<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.730> box<00:03:01.000> just

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
one piece it comes out of the box just

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.600 
one piece it comes out of the box just
like<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.870> already<00:03:02.319> put<00:03:02.470> together<00:03:02.560> with<00:03:03.489> the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
like that already put together with the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.000 
like that already put together with the
conveyor<00:03:04.030> on<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:05.290> just<00:03:05.410> basically<00:03:05.620> put

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
conveyor on it you just basically put

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.150 
conveyor on it you just basically put
these<00:03:06.190> tiles<00:03:07.000> on<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.390> side<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.680> don't<00:03:09.099> know

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
these tiles on the side so I don't know

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.520 
these tiles on the side so I don't know
what<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.459> is<00:03:09.640> why<00:03:10.390> maybe<00:03:10.810> it's<00:03:11.019> so<00:03:11.200> expensive

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
what that is why maybe it's so expensive

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.740 
what that is why maybe it's so expensive
because<00:03:11.890> it's<00:03:12.160> got<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.549> piece<00:03:12.819> already<00:03:13.120> put

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
because it's got that piece already put

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.080 
because it's got that piece already put
together<00:03:14.049> in<00:03:14.290> there<00:03:14.470> but<00:03:14.890> i<00:03:15.129> don't<00:03:15.879> think<00:03:16.060> that

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
together in there but i don't think that

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.240 
together in there but i don't think that
truly<00:03:16.510> justifies<00:03:17.079> it<00:03:17.349> you<00:03:17.799> have<00:03:18.069> some

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
truly justifies it you have some

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.660 
truly justifies it you have some
stickers<00:03:18.670> here<00:03:18.880> on<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.120> side<00:03:19.359> and<00:03:20.519> let's<00:03:21.519> take

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
stickers here on the side and let's take

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.099 
stickers here on the side and let's take
a<00:03:21.700> closer<00:03:22.000> look<00:03:22.120> at<00:03:22.450> our<00:03:22.600> truck<00:03:22.989> itself<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:25.109> i

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
a closer look at our truck itself and i

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.660 
a closer look at our truck itself and i
like<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.470> way<00:03:26.560> they<00:03:26.739> built<00:03:26.950> up<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.370> truck

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
like the way they built up the truck

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.270 
like the way they built up the truck
using<00:03:28.180> these<00:03:28.480> kind<00:03:28.870> of<00:03:28.959> like<00:03:29.139> I<00:03:29.410> don't<00:03:30.190> you

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
using these kind of like I don't you

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.009 
using these kind of like I don't you
know<00:03:30.340> what<00:03:30.549> you<00:03:30.670> did<00:03:30.819> with<00:03:31.239> these<00:03:31.630> pieces<00:03:31.870> are

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
know what you did with these pieces are

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.000 
know what you did with these pieces are
called<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.530> like<00:03:32.799> inverted<00:03:33.900> panels<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.859> you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
called is like inverted panels and you

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.710 
called is like inverted panels and you
just<00:03:36.190> stack<00:03:36.639> them<00:03:36.670> up<00:03:37.000> there<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.510> then<00:03:37.630> you

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
just stack them up there and then you

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.379 
just stack them up there and then you
put<00:03:37.900> these<00:03:38.130> two<00:03:39.130> by<00:03:39.280> two<00:03:39.340> great<00:03:39.760> towels<00:03:40.000> over

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
put these two by two great towels over

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.569 
put these two by two great towels over
the<00:03:40.510> studs<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.230> right<00:03:41.829> down<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.130> middle<00:03:42.160> and

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
the studs and right down the middle and

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.729 
the studs and right down the middle and
this<00:03:43.239> really<00:03:43.599> does<00:03:43.810> come<00:03:44.019> out<00:03:44.200> looking<00:03:44.500> good

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
this really does come out looking good

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.940 
this really does come out looking good
now<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.489> does<00:03:45.669> dump<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:46.450> this<00:03:46.599> opens<00:03:47.139> up<00:03:47.260> some

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
now it does dump so this opens up some

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.159 
now it does dump so this opens up some
hinge<00:03:48.519> plates<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.299> then<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.660> can<00:03:49.780> just<00:03:49.900> dump

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300

oil sticker on the side and to get some

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.490 
oil sticker on the side and to get some
hazard<00:05:07.710> stickers<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.760> red<00:05:08.940> I<00:05:09.260> like<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.380> way

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
hazard stickers and red I like the way

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.010 
hazard stickers and red I like the way
they<00:05:10.650> did<00:05:10.890> this<00:05:11.040> with<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.460> slope<00:05:11.730> pieces<00:05:12.240> and

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
they did this with the slope pieces and

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.260 
they did this with the slope pieces and
it<00:05:13.110> looks<00:05:13.320> good<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:14.040> only<00:05:14.250> you<00:05:14.700> know<00:05:14.820> I<00:05:14.880> really

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
it looks good the only you know I really

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.450 
it looks good the only you know I really
think<00:05:15.600> this<00:05:15.780> would<00:05:15.990> look<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:16.620> much<00:05:16.680> better<00:05:17.040> as

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
think this would look so much better as

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.510 
think this would look so much better as
a<00:05:17.850> track<00:05:18.510> hoe<00:05:18.540> if<00:05:19.350> this<00:05:19.560> was<00:05:19.710> on<00:05:19.830> tracks<00:05:20.190> and

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
a track hoe if this was on tracks and

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.200 
a track hoe if this was on tracks and
not<00:05:20.960> tires<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.350> wheels<00:05:22.760> that<00:05:23.760> maybe<00:05:24.030> that's

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
not tires and wheels that maybe that's

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.970 
not tires and wheels that maybe that's
what's<00:05:24.510> my<00:05:24.660> opinion<00:05:25.140> but<00:05:25.260> I<00:05:25.350> think<00:05:25.380> for<00:05:25.650> fifty

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
what's my opinion but I think for fifty

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.330 
what's my opinion but I think for fifty
dollars<00:05:26.340> they<00:05:26.580> could<00:05:26.760> have<00:05:26.880> gave<00:05:27.030> us<00:05:27.240> tracks

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
dollars they could have gave us tracks

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.540 
dollars they could have gave us tracks
but<00:05:29.340> I<00:05:29.580> mean<00:05:29.910> I<00:05:29.940> do<00:05:30.090> think<00:05:30.420> it<00:05:30.660> does<00:05:31.550> convey

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
but I mean I do think it does convey

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.070 
but I mean I do think it does convey
what<00:05:32.850> it's<00:05:33.060> supposed<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.390> be<00:05:33.540> I<00:05:33.570> think<00:05:33.720> it<00:05:33.930> does

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
what it's supposed to be I think it does

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.290 
what it's supposed to be I think it does
look<00:05:34.320> good<00:05:34.530> well<00:05:35.280> my<00:05:35.490> final<00:05:35.700> thoughts<00:05:36.030> on<00:05:36.150> this

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
look good well my final thoughts on this

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.380 
look good well my final thoughts on this
