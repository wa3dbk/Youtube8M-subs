00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.160
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.900
 Another murder concept to report mods 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:19.789
 the contest reuters to the hammer slurry tanker 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:21.500
 to a 18,500 that holds 18,500 liters 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.420
 the most popular container size 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.830
 increase the corrosion resistance of the 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.320
 corrosion resistant gfk tanks and with 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.559
 low weight for optimal 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.109
 Utilization of tonnage with the big ones 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.890
 wheels is also the ground pressure 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.609
 for minimized and damage in the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.199
 plant stock avoided 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:47.569
 for maximum flexibility 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.769
 additional equipment as well as 4.3 excel 

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:56.269
 suspension phones on and isobus control 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:59.170
 from iphone price 92 1900 then she gives 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.170
 another start-up station 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.840
 a swivel distributor a hose 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.640
 front block and this nice tow 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.560
 hose as well as in vitro slurry pit i 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.700
 I bought everything that is now 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.579
 Everything here and I have to say the feeling 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.229
 area just fine 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:24.289
 okay, the clever kids in the empty 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.799
 Here we are on the ship on the 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.799
 tube 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.119
 we can dock that 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:42.090
 or not she is we see this 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.229
 nice to groups of symbols but watch 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.830
 will not be here again 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.290
 something disappears on the floor 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.460
 it probably comes to this now 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.610
 somehow everything disappears a bit 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.610
 ground 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.409
 Merck start his engine 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.960
 I think then we will be the same 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.979
 look at slurry tank and then we'll see 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.979
 how to assemble that 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.510
 oh so the cow button works 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.510
 not anymore 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.160
 OK 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.700
 Of course that is pleasingly good taste 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.700
 no longer works 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.010
 so 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.900
 is there now a mode or 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.900
 it is generally a key 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.170
 I wonder namely but now very 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.970
 mcdermott 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.760
 okay try again 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.800
 ok i can not watch 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.210
 lard first 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.660
 I take my other tractor 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.660
 maybe it's because of that 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.820
 book 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:48.540
 no German but here the 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.540
 lamborghini start the engine 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.980
 I am surprised that very much now 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.980
 I do not like good 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.530
 on me 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.300
 OK 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.449
 I need the download engine sound 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.449
 not again 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.060
 I know that every agricultural machinery dealer 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.310
 is well , I had more of that 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.389
 Mother hopes I do not know why 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.689
 that works and it works here 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.689
 look at 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.410
 how so 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.750
 5 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.750
 honestly, no idea 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:02.060
 I will win again now 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:05.000
 and that somehow you can it here 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.990
 can somehow watch but it seems 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.990
 me at the moment not so 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:20.350
 may have made his mistake 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.350
 now use a tractor here 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:33.660
 The surprise me but very well I'm 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.930
 We are a bit disappointed 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.220
 the moon even if it looks good now 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.780
 and theoretically well, well 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.730
 you can tell me in the comments 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.320
 Write what I did wrong 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:52.040
 I would really like it now 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.040
 I'm interested, I'm out
