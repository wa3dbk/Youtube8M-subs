00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 and without anyone 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.220
 this time I will show you how to create a 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.990
 revolt to distribute to devices 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.210
 well this file is left in the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.669
 description of the video we do not want what 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.710
 first thing we will do is execute moves 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.710
 with administrator privilege 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.830
 as we have already said this first 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.870
 command that we will copy to see if 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.020
 we can distribute the internet from our 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.020
 computer 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.370
 let's go up 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.990
 and as everyone says but really if you 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.230
 it means that if we can distribute 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.989
 then we can continue this second 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.030
 command which will create us the network here 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.830
 listed we will put a name that I like 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.320
 to be in anybody in my case 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.030
 I put more but and here once edited 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.030
 we copy this command 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.480
 we execute it the cmb says the network mode 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.360
 it is true now it has been established in 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.880
 allows you to write since it has been created 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.130
 this third command in which we 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.130
 will serve to activate the network 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.170
 let's see if we hit the protest began 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.590
 expected 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.590
 and we close this then how can we 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.759
 see here if you keep identifying 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.649
 We hope this is true but it says yes 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.380
 I presented the center open event 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.020
 is to change the configuration of the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.360
 adapter that here in network connection 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.369
 wireless properties and give you 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.140
 where are we grabbing the the internet 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.530
 shared use we must allow 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.760
 we have been reigning in picados that is 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.880
 long we have created 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.310
 well this time it has to work like 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.090
 we see too much internet without cables no 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.090
 we do the same 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.030
 shared 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.490
 If you do not want to be in the running 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.890
 networks that every time windows start 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.560
 well then the next video in the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.840
 which I will teach you how to make 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.720
 start automatically every time 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.360
 let's start the windows windows friend that 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.970
 everything has been liked them 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.550
