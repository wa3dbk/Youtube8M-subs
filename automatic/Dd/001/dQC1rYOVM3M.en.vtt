over<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.370> last<00:02:13.640> couple<00:02:14.360> months<00:02:14.690> here<00:02:15.049> and<00:02:15.200> a

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
over the last couple months here and a

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.559 
over the last couple months here and a

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
me personally I'm predicting it to be a

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.470 
me personally I'm predicting it to be a
TLC<00:02:24.349> Tables<00:02:24.980> Ladders<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.400> Chairs<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:26.329> got

against the prime time players and the

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.539 
against the prime time players and the
lucha<00:02:32.090> dragons<00:02:32.720> in<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.049> triple<00:02:33.440> threat<00:02:33.549> maybe

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
lucha dragons in a triple threat maybe

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.039 
lucha dragons in a triple threat maybe
you<00:02:34.700> cut<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.000> lucha<00:02:35.239> dragons<00:02:35.629> out<00:02:35.720> it's<00:02:35.989> just

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.430 
Rollins is gonna keep the title to

depending on what happens this weekend

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.790 
depending on what happens this weekend
with<00:05:37.800> ronda<00:05:38.280> rousey<00:05:38.760> um<00:05:39.000> whether<00:05:39.960> she<00:05:40.229> wins<00:05:40.470> or
