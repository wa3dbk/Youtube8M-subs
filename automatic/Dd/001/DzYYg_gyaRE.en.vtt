 hello everyone guys are here and today 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.210
 I'm here with a short video I wanted to do 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.869
 see a little thing I don't have 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.460
 understood of this black two game then 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.689
 first of all we use repellent 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:34.769
 because it is an indecent thing then 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.379
 that is, we use the pokÃ©mon that are here 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.720
 there because we have to help bari not 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.309
 I know I haven't figured out what I'm looking for yet 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.910
 understand it 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:52.070
 so here now I'll show you or 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.070
 ability the tricks a second here 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.059
 cit bot list 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.859
 passes through the walls to 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.770
 for bad that goes except then 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 l a and so we can go through i 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.439
 walls here that I had to go no here 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.860
 I can't get this cave in 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.960
 no way without tricks can not 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.509

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.740
 seats by guide tricks b 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.479
 so I can no longer through the walls 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.329
 see you don't let me in and the hole 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.920
 more useless than the story I don't have 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.110
 not even understood because you know slammed 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.739

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.560
 they can't add and even if you use 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:53.709

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.840

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:59.079
 made room to instigate and then look 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.250

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.599
