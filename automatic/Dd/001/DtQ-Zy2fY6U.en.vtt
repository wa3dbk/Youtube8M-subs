skilled okay so as you can see my

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.220 
skilled okay so as you can see my
circles<00:00:50.789> were<00:00:50.910> totally<00:00:51.539> two<00:00:51.690> different<00:00:51.719> sizes

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
just sewed it all together for what just
so<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:15.570> easier<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.900> do<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.860> is

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
so it was easier to do with but this is
