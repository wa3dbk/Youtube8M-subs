00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.550
 computer troubleshooting and so 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.260
 further here I note here 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.329

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.910

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.149
 computer troubleshooting i 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.879
 slightly wrong reviews wrote 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.270
 exactly the string is called elimination 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:57.210

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:10.799
 forgiveness for video quality 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:13.650
 but wrote on the phone on the camera of the phone 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.500
 so but the main thing will be seen here 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.970
 the main thing here is I think you can see 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.340
 after you click see 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.210
 appear you need to select a language and click 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.150
 further this overgrown clicked to you 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.400
 saw here all sorts of language which 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.500
 you are comfortable and click further now here 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.310
 I'm asking for an admin password from me 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.960
 it is worth it so i need to enter you 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.320
 maybe this window will not appear if 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.579
 you do not have a password for windows but I have it 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.090
 I'm worth taking him away 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.090
 and shake ok 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.570
 further look here comes the topmost 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.780
 we are now probably recovering 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.240
 systems here, too, about which we are already with you 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.330
 they could speak right from here 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.710
 try and stop push 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.740
 stop systems but recovery 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.350
 start automatic elimination here 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.210
 try this way if the topic is not 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.310
 It turned out that you press recovery 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.490
 systems 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:32.720
 automatically pressed a little wait 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.720
 windows itself is looking for problems 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.670
 see more he found no error but 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.300
 Basically , I have no mistakes, therefore, 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.010
 I have it loaded so difficult 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.840
 speak and here or completion worked 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.790
 reboot or here I am now 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.450
 show system recovery right 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.240
 from here as it happens also here 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.430
 down there below and pick here 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.430
 choose recovery point date 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.600
 that's all you can 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:18.470
 try to do so 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:21.890
 maybe so you will if and so 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.190
 It does not come out well, then most likely 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.830
 already contact a specialist so that he 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.420
 looked what's the problem there or even 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.180
 you may have to reinstall 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.180
 windows actually all bye
