like the way it turned out you can just

like the way it turned out you can just
use<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.229> color<00:01:55.409> herbs<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.130> back<00:01:56.340> to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
use the color herbs and it's back to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.420 
use the color herbs and it's back to
exactly<00:01:56.850> square<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.200> thanks<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.770> advances

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
exactly square one so thanks to advances

exactly square one so thanks to advances
