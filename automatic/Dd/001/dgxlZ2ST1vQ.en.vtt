00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 In the month of june I have a total of twelve 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.490
 seen new movies and therefore gives 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.410
 here are the top and floppy movies of the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.410
 month of july 2015 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.500
 in short, the two worst 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.660
 movie of the month both are horror movies 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.580
 And unfortunately that is no coincidence because that 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.009
 horror genre is the sucked and 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.570
 unoriginal sondre in the cinema was spicy 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.250
 apes and only three are the ones 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.900
 tip of fucking you film yourself 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.279
 Just imagine if I can 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.289
 watch something and then also cool 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.000
 definitely has no claims 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.290
 film if you belong to these people 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.510
 and you should urgently your film 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.309
 improve the chain and finally good ones 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.800
 films see because in scrap films 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.120
 the finest do not shit but also 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.650
 not very well with the 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.750
 Minions continue the film is for children 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.190
 Although entertaining but jokes 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.199
 the film does not really offer anything 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.610
 further and nothing where children 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.409
 actually something in the middle of future 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.729
 further life will become adults 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.680
 a bit bored here though 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.390
 hardcore fans of the minis arrive there 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.979
 your enjoyment with need comes one 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.449
 typical high school teenie comedy ins 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.070
 cinema you like to have a look 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.629
 can and paradise be lost in that way 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.970
 a drug boss pablo escobar is going 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.189
 could be interesting for some 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.990
 she was undoubtedly the most gorgeous 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.939
 been that has ever created 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.580
 markus life consisted of a series 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.740
 incredible adventure in space number 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.510
 7, we have markus traces the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.130
 Novel by John Green City 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.300
 again, of course, the teen audience to 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.980
 but could also be adult 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.420
 audience arrive well because the film 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.950
 However, there are some interesting ones 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.880
 ask about yourself too 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.140
 can think 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.580
 the film is solid by crafting 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.200
 I personally would have put me 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.430
 like better and more interesting 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.810
 the supporting actor wanted the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.620
 leading actors do their thing very much 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.720
 good and that 's why there are 65 points here 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.930
 from that moment on she never became 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.450
 parents do not have a single day on the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.740
 sixth place is forever adelaide 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.540
 Only a woman is the one away 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.680
 miracle can no longer age from 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.810
 The result is a story that is very 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.580
 unfortunately there was a lot of potential 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.320
 potential a bit wasted though 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.610
 You finally have a romance 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.320
 They also do something now and then 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.880
 The actor can get cheesy 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.650
 but here are all top and optical 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.120
 the movie also very nice to watch everything 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.740
 In all, that's a solid movie, too 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.740
 and that 's why there are 6,7 points here 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.760
 and i am a protector he can from 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.250
 good luck talking that will not murder you here 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.110
 rides the west it is really bad 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.780
 Place number five is the small one though 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.250
 fine west triggers a young man is 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.930
 looking for the girl which 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.070
 He loves that he crosses the whole 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.990
 land and meets a bounty hunter 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.550
 played by Michael Fassbender 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.950
 has been and it evolves from it 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.630
 an adventure movie in the wild west of the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.220
 can be very funny here and there 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.020
 optically, the film is beautiful 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.030
 He has good pictures and the story will be 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.590
 towards the end also very interesting the 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.630
 film is a goal is a bit different 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.090
 movie and westernfans combo on their 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:51.250
 taste seven points 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:53.049
 the only one had to put the pattern 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.880
 Victory has one to kill with ghosts 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.160
 you want spirits 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.710
 here are your spirits and let's go 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.840
 the fourth place goes to pixels 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.180
 video game characters attack the world 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.100
 sounds stupid it is also adam sandler 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.840
 Kevin Kevin and co need the earth then 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.910
 defend and come out is one 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.310
 really funny action comedy with 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.260
 usual good manager humor comes over 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.730
 But who is not an element when it comes to the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.530
 video game characters can not do anything 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.330
 Should not look at the movie 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.950
 look at all the other nerds and all 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.600
 but fans come here at their expense 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.980
 But you should not be too many 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.600
 by the way, olli do the thoughts 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.400
 story is stupid and has so many 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.480
 logical that there is not over it 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.160
 should think 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.600
 because then the fun in the cinema is synonymous 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.220
 already gone but especially on the 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.990
 big screen unfolds the film 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.700
 in visual terms, the whole thing is really cool 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.720
 made and looks damn horny 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.200
 pixels gets from me 71 points if 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.900
 the flight cheap not recover from it 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.520
 just as little as me and you too now 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.180
 could finally be believe me 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.150
 It's all good 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.140
 in the third place is entourage here 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.240
 In Germany , the film is rather 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.280
 been unknown that the film with the 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.630
 eponymous series entourage in the 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.280
 movie is about a movie of the 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.360
 must be produced one gets her 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.160
 a really cool insight into the 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.840
 Hollywood world and how the production 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.180
 of such a film behind the scenes 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.020
 The movie is also funny 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.640
 definitely 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.320
 I never had the series before 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.030
 seen and thanks to the film I have with 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.080
 the series has started something like that now 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.299
 Never been a movie with me 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.590
 and that 's why there's 73 here 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.030
 points and if you are hollywood 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.200
 then you should be interested 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.200
 watch the movie in any case 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.430
 terminator I'm glad you 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.040
 get to know each other 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.480
 our number two is terminator 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.250
 Genesis has many bad reviews 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.600
 get a movie just because most of them 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.590
 critics do not really care about the story 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.240
 understood 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.830
 admittedly with this also for the 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.510
 duration of the film a bit too complex though 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.190
 everything in the alba is the movie yet 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.600
 Nevertheless, very good because you 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.030
 Here is a story with a lot of content 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.800
 good action and a mega cool arnold 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.720
 schwarzenegger just what a movie 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.670
 to make out 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.580
 74 points the times in which I am 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.729
 broke in and stole something 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.770
 with over 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.680
 what should I really great you should be 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.810
 break in and something clear for me 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.669
 Sounds logical and my number one is 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.130
 and men after all the huge ones 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.440
 action blockbuster superhero movies is 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.910
 Change rather a small and relative 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.190
 become quiet movie of course fits 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.600
 even the superhero himself the humor 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.460
 I have something a little sicker myself 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.440
 wished nevertheless is this 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.090
 the strength of the film and there is a lot 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.410
 funny place if you have one 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.360
 fat bombastic action-cracker 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.979
 marvel film is expected here 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.630
 probably disappointed if you look up 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.060
 a slave movie in the marvel universe 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.250
 then it is just the right one 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.199
 movie and you have fun reading it but the 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.910
 Stay away from the 3d because 3d is at marvel 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.139
 film mostly always spit on my 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.639
 second time I have exactly 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.160
 set on that and therefore there is 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.320
 me here 75 points which are yours 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.970
 top movies have been in july so writes in 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.349
 the comments and here you still click 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.820
 in the middle there you get to all 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.500
 other top lists of me also from the 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.639
 last few months and we will see each other 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.639
 again until next time
