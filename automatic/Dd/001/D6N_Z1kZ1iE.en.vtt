00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello to all and lo'jo and do for a 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.629
 small review of the living colors of 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.330
 philips 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.550
 so it's the living colors generation 2 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.230
 as there is no review in French 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.240
 and that I found that very boring I 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.840
 decided to do the same for me 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.109
 people wanting to buy it 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.630
 what is the first aspect? 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.680
 very beautiful good I will perhaps enlighten 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.960
 a little room because we can nothing 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:39.510
 do it like that ok so I find 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.860
 that it is very beautiful good a thing that has me 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.510
 pretty disappointed me it's me I thought that 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.230
 it was actually a glass 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.879
 plastic 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.170
 it's hard but it's nice enough 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.410
 still so that's the design it 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.390
 is very nice it lights up well 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.920
 frankly in the dark as I already 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:03.000
 had shutters that shutters shutters 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.650
 like that what in the dark is a black 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.409
 all of a sudden it's pretty damn good 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.400
 it's really nice 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.400
 so it's really an element of 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.200
 decoration even more I would say that 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.240
 it's even a relaxing element beyond 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.049
 beyond what it brings in 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.150
 decoration so we will proceed to the test 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.150
 so to provide a little colors what 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.890
 I show you is quickly made 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.049
 front remote control so the remote 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.290
 it's very simple it's the one of the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.750
 generation of what was waiting autofocus 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.750
 so here we have here 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.780
 the color palette or have chosen the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.330
 colors so with in the center the two 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.390
 buttons there it is for the amount of 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.670
 two colors that has in the light 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.500
 so that's more it's less so 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:11.420
 if we do anything less we come to 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:14.200
 then white the seo nov to the fon and there 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.700
 so it's the intensity of the light 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.730
 so you will see that we arrive 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.980
 still at a fairly high light 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:30.760
 so we're less autofocus here and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.760
 it's gone so hop 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.250
 we get something nice enough so the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.810
 session at 1 blue I do not know if the rendering 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:52.600
 is healthy and is good or not on a 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:53.070
 iphone that we really beautiful 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.810
 colors 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:02.620
 as you see there I will go by 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.310
 example on an opposite verve and there I 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.110
 go for example 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:12.360
 on the other hand we do not see the colors well 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.360
 it's pretty annoying it's the amalgam 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.500
 will come to make really pronounced 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.860
 but hey it is not terrible on 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.260
 the iphone all that to say that we can 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.340
 change the amount of light finally 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.810
 amount of color 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.570
 so here we come to a white color 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.489
 as you can see the increase 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:47.070
 so 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:51.209
 and here we come out green colors 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.320
 the rendering is not terrible even sorry 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.209
 I changed color power if there is 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.550
 not better for example go with a 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.670
 red so there I'll change to blows 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.260
 how much color you can have 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.540
 colors nice enough even in 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.709
 reducing the amount so no I did 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:14.230
 not a pale red that would rather give 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:17.260
 my rose then up to a very red 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.720
 pronounced what it really is really 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.830
 I really like this device is 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.629
 really 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:31.500
 well I find 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:35.229
 I find it very beautiful and more 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.780
 therefore need to place brake point use 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:41.620
 optimal to put that about 50 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.949
 centimeters of a wall for that but 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.449
 well well the thing what's the good 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:53.800
 light all that if not others 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:57.550
 cool colors so here I should have 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.180
 quantity him but of color pardon I 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.180
 will add some 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.060
 there we have colors really 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.319
 a fantastic gendarme side that illuminates 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.090
 to a good part of the room when 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:17.520
 not even a bad past the night is 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.509
 really good so if we can reduce 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:27.610
 the intensity of the light as I you 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:28.810
 had said it here i 'm going to reduce them and 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.569
 there too we can have enough stuff 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.779
 nice 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:39.819
 up to that color that illuminates common 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:43.199
 you can rain reflections or there it is 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:43.199
 very very nice I think 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.140
 so here after we have orders 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.950
 so I showed you I'm going to throw a 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.760
 little light we have orders like 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.990
 to change color 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.370
 automatically so in fact it takes 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.720
 take a walk with his finger on the 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.390
 palette is then pressed on own and there 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.930
 it will change automatically 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:09.620
 so I do not touch anything we can 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:15.090
 always change the amount of light 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.700
 amount of color all that and that 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:26.760
 continues changed it's really 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:32.610
 really good so here I go 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:37.440
 let's do so it's a very very 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:40.170
 beautiful very beautiful lamp you for the 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.500
 a modest sum of 120 euros postage 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.950
 included on the site materiel.net where I 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.950
 recommended 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.720
 that was the other one was doing for 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:55.550
 this little review I hope that you 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.550
 will be pleased soon
