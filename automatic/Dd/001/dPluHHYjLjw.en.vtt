these<00:03:12.100> roads<00:03:12.310> are<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:13.390> it's<00:03:14.140> not<00:03:14.850> there's<00:03:15.850> not

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
these roads are and it's not there's not

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.760 
these roads are and it's not there's not
going<00:03:16.240> to<00:03:16.300> be<00:03:16.360> high<00:03:16.600> speeds<00:03:17.020> to<00:03:17.890> let<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.160> know

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
so I mean it will be exciting i'm

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.650 
so I mean it will be exciting i'm
assuming

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.760 

so<00:03:27.260> this<00:03:27.470> says<00:03:27.680> 30<00:03:28.010> mile<00:03:28.310> per<00:03:28.340> hour<00:03:28.610> left<00:03:29.150> hand

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
so this says 30 mile per hour left hand

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.950 
so this says 30 mile per hour left hand
90-degree<00:03:30.770> turn<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:32.390> we're<00:03:32.570> putting<00:03:32.720> on<00:03:32.840> the

90-degree turn so we're putting on the

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.630 
90-degree turn so we're putting on the
brakes<00:03:33.170> we're<00:03:33.590> getting<00:03:33.680> some<00:03:33.980> Blake<00:03:34.190> bricks
