00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
down then on this one and also we're

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.600 
down then on this one and also we're
going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.680> doing<00:00:37.920> use<00:00:38.220> two<00:00:38.400> other

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
going to be doing use two other

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.520 
going to be doing use two other
movements<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.510> let's<00:00:39.809> go<00:00:39.960> ahead<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.320> start

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
movements so let's go ahead and start

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.500 
movements so let's go ahead and start
with<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.830> Egyptian<00:00:41.250> down<00:00:41.400> walk<00:00:41.670> portion<00:00:42.180> here

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
with the Egyptian down walk portion here

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.799 
with the Egyptian down walk portion here
so<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.350> down<00:00:43.530> walk<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:45.330> him

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
so the down walk is going to be with him

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.579 
so the down walk is going to be with him
going<00:00:46.199> down<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.430> step<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.690> floor<00:00:49.050> so

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
going down with the step on the floor so

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.560 
going down with the step on the floor so
as<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.800> step<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.610> comes<00:00:50.940> down<00:00:51.320> down<00:00:52.460> down<00:00:53.570> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
as I step it comes down down down and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.090 
as I step it comes down down down and
down<00:00:54.989> back<00:00:55.940> back<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> that's<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.470> basis<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.040> it

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
down back back so that's the basis of it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.189 
down back back so that's the basis of it
now<00:01:02.640> what's<00:01:02.850> happening<00:01:03.299> in<00:01:03.479> between<00:01:03.930> those

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
now what's happening in between those

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.370 
now what's happening in between those
weighted<00:01:04.559> steps<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.370> this<00:01:06.240> opposite<00:01:07.020> hip<00:01:07.080> your

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
weighted steps is this opposite hip your

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.680 
weighted steps is this opposite hip your
unweighted<00:01:07.920> hip<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.250> going<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.640> go<00:01:08.760> drop<00:01:09.030> down

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
unweighted hip is going to go drop down

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.219 
unweighted hip is going to go drop down
and<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:10.740> come<00:01:10.979> back<00:01:11.190> up<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.840> same<00:01:12.840> thing<00:01:12.870> for

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and then come back up so same thing for

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:13.950 
and then come back up so same thing for
the<00:01:13.290> others

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
the others

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.200 
the others
when<00:01:14.290> you're<00:01:14.439> stepping<00:01:14.770> on<00:01:15.009> this<00:01:15.130> foot<00:01:15.430> then

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
when you're stepping on this foot then

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.359 
when you're stepping on this foot then
in<00:01:16.329> between<00:01:16.450> is<00:01:17.439> when<00:01:17.710> we<00:01:17.799> go<00:01:17.950> down<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.280> way

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
in between is when we go down so the way

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.350 
in between is when we go down so the way
we<00:01:21.520> put<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:21.820> together<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.860> down<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.360> down

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
we put that together is down and down

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.230

and<00:01:54.880> drop<00:01:55.090> back<00:01:55.299> and<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.020> emphasis<00:01:56.500> on<00:01:56.679> this

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
and drop back and the emphasis on this

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.919 
and drop back and the emphasis on this
is<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.220> dropping<00:01:57.759> back<00:01:57.970> but<00:01:58.630> just<00:01:58.810> because

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
is the dropping back but just because

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.419 
is the dropping back but just because
this<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.289> emphasis<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.799> the<00:02:00.039> movement

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
this is the emphasis of the movement

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.130 
this is the emphasis of the movement
doesn't<00:02:01.119> mean<00:02:01.209> it's<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.420> emphasis<00:02:01.899> of<00:02:01.929> the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
doesn't mean it's the emphasis of the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.609 
doesn't mean it's the emphasis of the
muscular<00:02:02.679> work<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:04.240> muscular<00:02:04.990> work<00:02:05.200> comes

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
muscular work so the muscular work comes

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.029 
muscular work so the muscular work comes
in<00:02:05.920> then<00:02:06.130> pulling<00:02:06.729> up<00:02:06.909> to<00:02:07.270> prepare<00:02:07.720> but<00:02:08.619> this

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
in then pulling up to prepare but this

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.479 
in then pulling up to prepare but this
actual<00:02:09.610> dropping<00:02:10.450> right<00:02:10.869> here<00:02:11.319> is<00:02:11.590> just<00:02:11.920> a

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
actual dropping right here is just a

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.610 
actual dropping right here is just a
relaxation<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.299> all<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.599> that<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.349> we<00:02:14.470> should

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
relaxation of all of that so we should

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.610 
relaxation of all of that so we should
never<00:02:14.829> be<00:02:15.390> forcefully<00:02:16.390> drawing<00:02:16.840> back<00:02:17.049> with

never be forcefully drawing back with

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.170 
never be forcefully drawing back with
these<00:02:17.769> little<00:02:17.950> about<00:02:18.190> muscles<00:02:18.700> that's<00:02:18.880> just

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
these little about muscles that's just

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.670 
these little about muscles that's just
not<00:02:19.390> something<00:02:19.959> that's<00:02:20.230> going<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.380> be<00:02:20.500> good

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
not something that's going to be good

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.289 
not something that's going to be good
for<00:02:20.829> your<00:02:20.980> low<00:02:21.130> back<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.670> won't<00:02:21.850> he

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
bunch of them like that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.229 
bunch of them like that
so<00:02:25.480> just<00:02:25.989> because<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.709> movement<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.340> visually

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
so just because the movement is visually

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.770 
so just because the movement is visually
emphasized<00:02:28.810> here<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:30.340> down<00:02:30.579> the<00:02:31.299> muscular

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
emphasized here on the down the muscular

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.780 
emphasized here on the down the muscular
emphasis<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.470> on<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.680> preparation<00:02:33.400> for<00:02:33.639> it

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
emphasis is on the preparation for it

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.599 
emphasis is on the preparation for it
here<00:02:34.450> pulling<00:02:34.840> out<00:02:35.079> it's<00:02:35.560> as<00:02:35.650> low<00:02:35.829> as<00:02:36.010> part<00:02:36.400> of

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
here pulling out it's as low as part of

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.509 
here pulling out it's as low as part of
the<00:02:36.850> rectus<00:02:37.329> abdominus<00:02:37.480> muscles<00:02:38.260> down<00:02:38.410> here

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.069 

okay<00:02:42.519> so<00:02:42.579> we're<00:02:43.180> gonna<00:02:43.299> put<00:02:43.540> these<00:02:43.660> two<00:02:43.840> things

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
okay so we're gonna put these two things

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.150 
okay so we're gonna put these two things
down<00:02:44.260> there<00:02:44.470> there's<00:02:44.650> an<00:02:44.739> important

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
down there there's an important

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.120 
down there there's an important
connection<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.760> goes

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
connection that goes

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.150 
connection that goes
between<00:02:46.520> these<00:02:46.790> two<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.300> me<00:02:47.450> one<00:02:48.170> flow<00:02:48.620> into

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
between these two to me one flow into

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.790 
between these two to me one flow into
the<00:02:49.280> other<00:02:49.460> so<00:02:50.240> here<00:02:51.050> I'm<00:02:51.410> going<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.590> do<00:02:51.680> this

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
the other so here I'm going to do this

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.980 
the other so here I'm going to do this
sideways<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.280> think<00:02:52.550> you'll<00:02:52.670> see<00:02:52.820> it<00:02:52.910> best<00:02:53.120> so

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
sideways I think you'll see it best so

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.040 
sideways I think you'll see it best so
as<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.230> go<00:02:54.380> into<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:54.860> Egyptian<00:02:55.580> down<00:02:55.760> walk

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
as I go into this Egyptian down walk

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.520 
as I go into this Egyptian down walk
down<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:58.600> down<00:02:59.600> and<00:03:01.810> it's<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.020> kind<00:03:03.290> of

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
down and down and it's this kind of

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.130 
down and down and it's this kind of
portion<00:03:04.250> this<00:03:04.510> unweighted<00:03:05.510> portion<00:03:05.960> that<00:03:06.080> has

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
portion this unweighted portion that has

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.330 
portion this unweighted portion that has
to<00:03:06.440> connect<00:03:06.860> onto<00:03:07.550> your<00:03:08.240> pelvic<00:03:08.870> drop<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:10.070> in

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
to connect onto your pelvic drop so in

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.160 
to connect onto your pelvic drop so in
order<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.700> prepare<00:03:11.150> for<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.510> instead<00:03:12.020> of

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
order to prepare for that instead of

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.520 
order to prepare for that instead of
when<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:12.410> last<00:03:12.680> one<00:03:13.010> going<00:03:13.490> down<00:03:13.910> up<00:03:14.690> we're

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
when that last one going down up we're

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.010 
when that last one going down up we're
going<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.770> go<00:03:16.000> down<00:03:17.560> tuck<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:19.340> from<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.670> side

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
going to go down tuck so from the side

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.710 
going to go down tuck so from the side
down<00:03:21.020> and<00:03:21.910> down<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.770> tuck<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:25.420> that<00:03:26.420> puts<00:03:26.630> us

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
down and down and tuck and that puts us

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.290 
down and down and tuck and that puts us
in<00:03:26.870> position<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.830> drop<00:03:28.630> two<00:03:29.710> three<00:03:30.710> four<00:03:31.610> like

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
in position to drop two three four like

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.920 
in position to drop two three four like
that<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:34.250> that's<00:03:34.700> what<00:03:34.940> makes<00:03:35.120> us<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.630> be<00:03:35.750> able

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
that so that's what makes us to be able

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.270 
that so that's what makes us to be able
to<00:03:36.020> connect<00:03:36.350> these<00:03:36.500> things<00:03:36.740> and<00:03:37.100> they're<00:03:37.250> very

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
to connect these things and they're very

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.580 
to connect these things and they're very
nice<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:37.810> control<00:03:38.810> kind<00:03:39.110> of<00:03:39.200> fashion<00:03:39.560> that

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
nice and control kind of fashion that

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.410 
nice and control kind of fashion that
gives<00:03:39.890> it<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.010> next<00:03:40.430> cool<00:03:40.670> continuous<00:03:41.210> kind

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
gives it that next cool continuous kind

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.690 
gives it that next cool continuous kind
of<00:03:41.570> a<00:03:41.630> look<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.470> we're<00:03:43.100> going<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.280> do<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.580> that

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
of a look so we're going to do to that

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.250 
of a look so we're going to do to that
and<00:03:44.030> then<00:03:44.180> I'm<00:03:44.270> going<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.480> throw<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.750> little

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
and then I'm going to throw a little

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.930 
and then I'm going to throw a little
extra<00:03:45.410> variation<00:03:46.130> as<00:03:46.280> we<00:03:46.400> draw<00:03:46.580> this<00:03:46.730> with

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
extra variation as we draw this with

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.280 
extra variation as we draw this with
some<00:03:47.150> music<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:47.570> I<00:03:47.600> think<00:03:47.810> you'll<00:03:47.930> catch<00:03:48.110> that

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
some music and I think you'll catch that

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.320 
some music and I think you'll catch that
right<00:03:48.500> away<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:49.280> let's<00:03:49.790> go<00:03:49.940> ahead<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.150> get
