them<00:00:30.059> I<00:00:30.329> mean<00:00:30.689> sometimes<00:00:30.899> it's<00:00:31.169> good<00:00:31.259> when

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
them I mean sometimes it's good when

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.400 
them I mean sometimes it's good when
it's<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.880> crisis<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.630> really<00:00:34.079> cuts<00:00:34.290> down

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
it's the crisis and it really cuts down

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.349 
it's the crisis and it really cuts down
and<00:00:34.769> it<00:00:34.890> leaves<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.730> needs<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.269> the

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
and it leaves it needs it up to the

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:37.880 
and it leaves it needs it up to the
people<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.629> are<00:00:36.719> really<00:00:37.230> digging<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
people that are really digging it and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.729 
people that are really digging it and
it's<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.120> so<00:00:39.120> i<00:00:39.149> think<00:00:39.269> it's<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.199> I<00:00:40.530> I
