 there is a time zone on the other hand 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.369
 the l equipped with a repetitive timer that will 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.930
 to be very useful if you want to know 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.300
 where you are in your fishing if you have to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.180
 meter of the cup or not you defined 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.320
 a time that you select and there by 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.600
 example I'm going to put it all 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.710
 4 seconds and beautiful at all 4 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.039
 seconds will begin to sound good 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.449
 month during fishing I do it all 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.850
 the 15 minutes you see like that I 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.269
 make the decision to hand over or not to 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.940
 the cut it or not is against me 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:01.260
 not just keep your wrist on your wrist 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.090
 because I adapted it here as wise 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.939
 and their souls to impermanence under the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.619
 eyes and like that his cut runs to 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.200
 discussions of whether the fish 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.030
 account or not latta their share state of 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.890
 start your stopwatch at the beginning 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.110
 fishing party when the organizer has 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.640
 sounded like that you're not bothered you see 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.680
 right now you know when 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.110
 it's going to end the contest that allows you to 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.360
 shoot or not according to his needs for 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.009
 put the fish dry 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.079
 it's great by the second so that's 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.399
 gave himself a manual so late to 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.970
 manual explains eddy well that's 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.490
 very simple features there is everything 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.740
 what is needed is very accessible there 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.990
 no problem and it is equipped 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.479
 of a light function in the dark and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.750
 there are three colors you will see there is 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.159
 yellow of the blue of red and green it is 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.270
 excellent but I see a lot of new 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.250
 accessories 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.790
 I was watching it's the same, so why do not you 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.229
 so have an abbas to that I do not know of 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.960
 all but that's a fish storyteller 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.369
 you see that's it 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.610
 the feature you have a pusher 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.630
 you support and it scrolls then that he 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.520
 turns out that in a lot of 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.799
 competitions including competitions 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.369
 card now there are weight limits 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.810
 by tree 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.450
 we are not allowed to put more than 25 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.709
 kilos then guys 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.450
 as they do not always know where they in 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.069
 are bell be they count themselves the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.470
 carp they know that in this pond the 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.910
 2 kg average over 5 there should not that 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.550
 three kilos where you must not travel 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.250
 they put more than 2 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.930
 09/08 carp here are eight nine because they flat 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.580
 know that with that they are just so the 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.170
 giss the account when it gets to 7 or 8 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.550
 cra that change of bourriche and but that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.230
 move on the armed side the other and so 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.310
 then it continues or so there is 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.050
 others who are destined their fish 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.460
 you see for example said bah like I 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.560
 will take me a 6 kg crac crac 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.750
 he presses six times he has six kilos he 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.830
 add up and when they arrive at 25.4 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.900
 he changes stuffers that's it 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.500
 excellent and so then there I saw 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.900
 also his rules 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.520
 yeah then you feature it as 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.680
 that you can tilt it because that's it 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.300
 it can be used for both 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.550
 of bleak fishermen for fishermen 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.630
 small fish that want to count 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.980
 their fish during the game of 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.510
 fishing to know no combination to the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.320
 hungry like that you can put it in 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.360
 all positions 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.980
 to have it you can do it at the foot 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.980
 knee according to how you got it all 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.010
 position and more stupid to the 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.720
 feature is right handed left handed 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.010
 that is to say that ben like everyone 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.660
 does not install the same way you can 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:22.260
 also change the side attachment and the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.360
 see on the other side all these if the 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.340
 tricks and symmetrical gold that's all 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.720
 just not the famous button 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.250
 reset and then go back to a 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.720
 turn 3,999 0 and then by cons just 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.800
 a little thing but I still saw 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.450
 that you were well installed there are plenty 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.580
 of things I do not know there you have 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.910
 a new bar yeah support of 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.340
 cannes 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.160
 so that's the double luxury bar 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.690
 competition the beautiful team and a 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.030
 level that will allow good the 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.410
 already position people perfectly 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.550
 right always perfectly right 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.459
 then there is a second small bar 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.750
 on which you see I have but I have a 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.300
 simple bar and then I also have a 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:02.010
 little arm bent so why am I 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.110
 but you want with my basket match 650 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.060
 there I have the functionality behind 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.900
 able to fix my cane on the tip he 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.750
 is located e bay 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.130
 I can use my boot bar 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.989
 to settle once I've settled that 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.190
 so I always adjust my cane 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.009
 front position like that 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.440
 there I am good you see and actually 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.600
 after ben as I have the levels 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.250
 integrated on the basket after one time 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.990
 that I settled that I got myself I'm getting 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.400
 a little trait of markers here like 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.199
 that no matter where I am 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.580
 find at the water's edge hop I'm coming I 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.050
 put that I put my boat like that and 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.370
 I still have the can settle near to 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.350
 priming I no longer need to look at it 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.910
 then especially the prices and then the 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.000
 in high wind if I 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.620
 look at the tuture but it can happen 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.539
 want to kill you not a little more 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.270
 to leave a little more to go, that's where it is 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.860
 not can not fly and 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.150
 so suddenly plus the big advantage 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.130
 is that you may need to have the 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.680
 hook there on this foot there what does 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.479
 that the door in that on which you 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.750
 crying positions you canes is more 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.360
 long 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.900
 it relieves the can it is there points 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.780
 positive 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.099
 then traveled I handed my son a 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.080
 dislocated because often I put it 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.639
 here says even jaynet when I wanted 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.039
 get out of the basket 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.900
 it was always a pretty annoying 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:19.460
 Well, there, if you want, I'm here 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.349
 in addition I earn almost 60 cm as 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.090
 that behind when there are walkers and 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.190
 bikes and all that but you have me 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.990
 gained that space there again a risk in 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.190
 less to make me break the can because 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.889
 that unfortunately but it happens 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.260
 finally good that's what you want and then 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.729
 and then and then and especially if you 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.260
 do we want to look at the end of the game 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:42.849
 fishing bah you take you take a tool 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.849
 tulle facts of october 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.240
 orange late and then I put that in the 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.190
 car crac 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.290
