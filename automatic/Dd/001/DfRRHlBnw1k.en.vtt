00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
quite small and it's pretty boring to

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.980 
quite small and it's pretty boring to
build<00:02:00.530> as<00:02:00.709> well<00:02:00.889> because<00:02:01.219> it's<00:02:01.880> just<00:02:02.090> like<00:02:02.299> and

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
build as well because it's just like and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.309

build<00:02:03.859> this<00:02:04.069> time<00:02:04.520> far<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.179> build<00:02:05.359> this<00:02:05.539> x<00:02:05.929> far

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
build this time far and build this x far

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:12.100 
build this time far and build this x far
and<00:02:06.590> stuff<00:02:07.310> our<00:02:10.300> barn<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.480> build<00:02:11.690> but<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:11.959> looks

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
and stuff our barn to build but it looks

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and stuff our barn to build but it looks
good<00:02:12.670> cuz

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.090 

quite<00:02:22.130> realistic<00:02:22.569> stick<00:02:23.569> with<00:02:23.720> outside<00:02:24.110> by

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
quite realistic stick with outside by

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.460 
quite realistic stick with outside by
the<00:02:25.160> way<00:02:25.370> if<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.880> don't<00:02:26.090> like<00:02:26.209> stickers<00:02:26.540> I'd

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
the way if you don't like stickers I'd

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.740 
the way if you don't like stickers I'd
stop<00:02:27.920> watching<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.400> review<00:02:29.000> now<00:02:29.360> because

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
stop watching this review now because

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.930 
stop watching this review now because
this<00:02:30.650> helicopter<00:02:31.070> is<00:02:31.340> quite<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.640> lot<00:02:31.880> of

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
this helicopter is quite a lot of

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.770 
this helicopter is quite a lot of
stickers<00:02:35.380> I'm<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.740> helicopter<00:02:37.780> different

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
stickers I'm to the helicopter different

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.430 
stickers I'm to the helicopter different
it<00:02:39.470> looks<00:02:39.820> slightly<00:02:40.820> like<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.180> seeking<00:02:44.440> from

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
it looks slightly like a seeking from

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.410 
it looks slightly like a seeking from
the<00:02:45.590> side<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:46.130> just<00:02:46.880> looks<00:02:47.060> like<00:02:47.120> good

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
the side it just looks like good

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.199 
the side it just looks like good
thinking<00:02:48.140> as<00:02:48.470> well<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:49.580> i<00:02:49.640> guess<00:02:49.820> it's<00:02:49.970> based

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
thinking as well so i guess it's based

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:58.420 
thinking as well so i guess it's based
off<00:02:50.330> of<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.540> seeking<00:02:51.020> i'm<00:02:51.650> not<00:02:51.860> sure<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:57.430> this

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
off of the seeking i'm not sure and this

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.140 
off of the seeking i'm not sure and this

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
star here which opens up with that and

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.240 
star here which opens up with that and
there's<00:03:02.300> like<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.800> bed<00:03:03.800> inside<00:03:04.400> very<00:03:04.760> much<00:03:04.940> just

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
there's like a bed inside very much just

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.420

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
knock this fire which is pretty cool and

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.120 
knock this fire which is pretty cool and
then<00:03:45.850> it's<00:03:46.850> just<00:03:47.150> got<00:03:47.480> it<00:03:47.750> it's<00:03:48.380> just<00:03:48.709> got<00:03:48.890> in

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
then it's just got it it's just got in

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.830 
then it's just got it it's just got in
big<00:03:49.430> piece<00:03:49.700> of<00:03:49.730> plastic<00:03:50.269> for<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.510> fact<00:03:50.750> that

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
big piece of plastic for the fact that

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.680 
big piece of plastic for the fact that
you<00:03:51.110> just<00:03:51.760> bit<00:03:53.410> like<00:03:54.410> what<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.739> find<00:03:54.769> on<00:03:55.160> plane

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
you just bit like what you find on plane

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.380 
you just bit like what you find on plane
will<00:03:56.690> go<00:03:56.810> through<00:03:57.100> which<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:59.000> all<00:03:59.209> right

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
will go through which is all right

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.990 
will go through which is all right
suppose<00:03:59.600> it<00:04:00.019> makes<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.440> look<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.680> bit<00:04:00.709> bare<00:04:01.070> but

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
suppose it makes it look a bit bare but

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.600 
suppose it makes it look a bit bare but
means<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.260> it's<00:04:03.560> more<00:04:03.739> expensive<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.400> less

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
means that it's more expensive and less

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.140 
means that it's more expensive and less
pieces<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:07.750> disease<00:04:08.750> bit<00:04:09.019> see<00:04:09.200> what<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.560> burn

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
pieces and disease bit see what you burn

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.590 
pieces and disease bit see what you burn
it<00:04:11.320> and<00:04:12.320> then<00:04:12.470> on<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.890> bus<00:04:13.100> there's<00:04:13.880> a<00:04:13.970> pretty

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
jealous and here's small wing at the

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.760 
jealous and here's small wing at the
back<00:04:50.340> we<00:04:51.120> like<00:04:51.270> a<00:04:51.300> light<00:04:51.630> on<00:04:51.660> top<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:54.500> some<00:04:55.500> big

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
back we like a light on top and some big

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.620 
back we like a light on top and some big
bulky<00:04:56.400> propellers<00:04:56.910> up<00:04:57.030> at<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.270> top<00:04:59.270> well<00:05:00.270> the

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
bulky propellers up at the top well the

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.210 
bulky propellers up at the top well the
quite<00:05:00.870> fragile<00:05:01.140> would<00:05:01.590> break<00:05:01.800> off<00:05:01.980> really

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
quite fragile would break off really

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.720 
quite fragile would break off really
easy<00:05:04.040> but<00:05:05.450> they're<00:05:06.450> a<00:05:06.480> bit<00:05:06.720> stronger<00:05:07.020> than

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
easy but they're a bit stronger than

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.000 
easy but they're a bit stronger than
past<00:05:08.730> helicopters<00:05:09.480> because<00:05:09.950> instead<00:05:10.950> of

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
past helicopters because instead of

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.750 
past helicopters because instead of
being<00:05:11.280> like<00:05:11.900> two<00:05:12.900> pieces<00:05:13.230> together<00:05:13.620> on<00:05:14.520> this

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
being like two pieces together on this

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.200 
being like two pieces together on this
one<00:05:15.030> it's<00:05:15.870> like<00:05:16.020> just<00:05:16.260> one<00:05:16.590> big<00:05:16.950> thing<00:05:17.220> so<00:05:18.120> it

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
one it's like just one big thing so it

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.360 
one it's like just one big thing so it
makes<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.510> slightly<00:05:18.720> stronger<00:05:19.160> but<00:05:20.160> it's

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
makes it slightly stronger but it's

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:30.230 
makes it slightly stronger but it's
still<00:05:20.760> a<00:05:21.140> bit<00:05:22.610> flimsy<00:05:23.610> at<00:05:24.180> times<00:05:24.919> in<00:05:28.940> this<00:05:29.940> pic

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
still a bit flimsy at times in this pic

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.700 
still a bit flimsy at times in this pic
that<00:05:30.419> round<00:05:30.630> bar<00:05:30.840> mat<00:05:30.990> propellers<00:05:31.440> which<00:05:31.560> is
