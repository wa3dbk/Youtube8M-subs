00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
record may know each other we have what

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.219 
record may know each other we have what
we<00:01:32.100> call<00:01:32.430> pudding<00:01:33.119> which<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.630> multiple<00:01:34.020> track

we call pudding which is multiple track
recording<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.920> which<00:01:35.310> means<00:01:35.550> on<00:01:35.729> each<00:01:35.880> track

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
recording and which means on each track

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.990 
recording and which means on each track
you<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.170> individual<00:01:37.890> control<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.700> every

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.609 
you have individual control for every
instrument<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.539> instrument<00:01:39.899> goes<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.350> one

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
instrument one instrument goes on one

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
so when we do that it gives us complete

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.130 
so when we do that it gives us complete
control<00:01:47.280> over<00:01:47.400> every<00:01:47.909> instrument<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.840> later
