have very full and dark lashes and this

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.530 
have very full and dark lashes and this
kind<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:36.830> does<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.370> good<00:02:37.610> job<00:02:37.670> at<00:02:38.120> doing

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.660 
kind of just does a good job at doing
both<00:02:38.930> another<00:02:39.590> thing<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:39.980> really<00:02:40.460> like

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
both another thing that I really like

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.940 
both another thing that I really like
about<00:02:40.820> this<00:02:41.060> mascara<00:02:41.630> is<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.020> fact<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.770> it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
about this mascara is the fact that it

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.880 
about this mascara is the fact that it
starts<00:02:43.460> off<00:02:43.580> wide<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:44.660> then<00:02:45.140> just<00:02:45.350> kind<00:02:45.680> of

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
starts off wide and then just kind of

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.550 
starts off wide and then just kind of
goes<00:02:46.340> into<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> cone<00:02:47.540> shape<00:02:47.570> towards<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.380> end

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
goes into a cone shape towards the end

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.140 
goes into a cone shape towards the end
and<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.250> think<00:02:49.280> that's<00:02:49.610> really<00:02:49.940> handy

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
and I think that's really handy

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.670 
and I think that's really handy
especially<00:02:50.420> when<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.200> want<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.380> get<00:02:51.530> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
especially when you want to get the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.070
