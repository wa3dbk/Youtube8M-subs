00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.710
 so in tucumán the smallest province 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.730
 of argentina and that is northwest a 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.730
 beautiful province 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.090
 the childhood dish par excellence 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.520
 with which I have better memories is the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.850
 soufflé of potatoes and cheese made by me 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.850
 mother 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.130
 I started in the kitchen next to my mother 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.440
 watching how he cooked and next to maría 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.059
 that she was a lady who took care of us and that 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.059
 it was like a second mother to me 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.829
 the kitchen that I like is the kitchen 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.949
 simple home cooking and cooking 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.059
 that brings back memories of life 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.059
 family and country 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.219
 my specialty is without doubt the roast 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.710
 Argentinian made grilled and with a lot 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.710
 time and secondly the paella 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.590
 as a cook that I admire for Maria Neus 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.410
 an 86-year-old woman who taught me the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.050
 secrets of cooking and that was for me 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.250
 as a mother and a reference is the 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.250
 best cook I've ever met 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.240
 the favorite ingredient and that I do not 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.930
 never miss me because it is the vegetable of 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.930
 season 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.880
 I like the taste of strawberry I like it 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.390
 the taste of 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.780
 of the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.360
 I like the smell of the countryside and I like the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.170
 smell of burnt wood and especially 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.170
 when I'm contemplating 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.400
 the Argentine barbecue with some good 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.550
 empanadas and a Catalan dessert cream 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.840
 It has been a challenge for me to overcome the 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.460
 shame of a nun 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.630
 closure that does not know how to speak before 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.789
 cameras and having to cook and talk 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.280
 convinced that food unites 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.429
 people that food makes family that 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.110
 the food makes community and that the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.130
 after a meal 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.870
 quiet helps to share what 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.500
 we carry in the heart and transform 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.500
 our world
