00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
stage I would be happy when we get in

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.779 
stage I would be happy when we get in
Paris<00:01:09.700> when<00:01:10.259> yeah<00:01:11.259> when<00:01:11.890> we<00:01:12.009> can<00:01:12.190> succeed<00:01:12.550> once

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
Paris when yeah when we can succeed once

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.090 
Paris when yeah when we can succeed once
in<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.060> sprint<00:01:13.270> stage<00:01:13.509> yeah<00:01:14.380> when<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.649> trainer

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
in a sprint stage yeah when the trainer

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.460 
in a sprint stage yeah when the trainer
function<00:01:15.610> it's<00:01:15.759> like<00:01:16.330> like<00:01:16.720> we<00:01:16.899> did<00:01:17.050> already<00:01:17.320> a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
function it's like like we did already a

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.279 
function it's like like we did already a
dozen<00:01:18.130> times<00:01:18.160> then<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.330> then<00:01:19.750> it's<00:01:19.899> all<00:01:20.080> good

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
dozen times then and then it's all good

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.680 
dozen times then and then it's all good
and<00:01:20.470> then<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.250> think<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.119> successful

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
and then I think the the the successful

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.100 
and then I think the the the successful
payoff<00:01:25.229> would<00:01:26.229> be<00:01:26.440> really<00:01:26.649> awesome<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:28.110> to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
payoff would be really awesome to to

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.219 
payoff would be really awesome to to
winnow<00:01:29.320> as<00:01:29.560> well<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:29.920> stage<00:01:30.280> in<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.580> tour<00:01:30.820> then

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
winnow as well a stage in the tour then

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.430 
winnow as well a stage in the tour then
I'm<00:01:32.229> 24<00:01:32.950> years<00:01:32.979> old<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.580> already<00:01:34.179> like<00:01:34.440> in

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
I'm 24 years old and already like in

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.830 
I'm 24 years old and already like in
every<00:01:35.759> three<00:01:36.759> prong<00:01:37.090> who<00:01:37.329> is<00:01:37.450> just<00:01:37.630> a

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
every three prong who is just a

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.580 
every three prong who is just a
statement<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.890> that<00:01:39.159> would<00:01:39.310> be<00:01:39.340> yeah

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
statement that that would be yeah

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.100 
statement that that would be yeah
actually<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:42.119> shouldn't<00:01:43.119> think<00:01:43.420> about<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.930> and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
actually I shouldn't think about it and

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.100 
actually I shouldn't think about it and
just<00:01:44.530> do<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.189> and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
just do it and

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.440 
just do it and
I<00:01:46.230> think<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.310> better<00:01:47.790> kind<00:01:48.120> of<00:01:48.240> way<00:01:48.420> of

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
I think that's the better kind of way of

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.670 
I think that's the better kind of way of
looking

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.210 

the<00:01:53.310> main<00:01:53.520> goal<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.090> win<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.330> stage<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
the main goal is to win a stage to

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.680 
the main goal is to win a stage to
finish<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.340> stage<00:01:56.580> at<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.330> front<00:01:57.540> as

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
finish the stage at the to the front as
