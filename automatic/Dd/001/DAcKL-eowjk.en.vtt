00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone today we are on unpacking 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.930
 there will be a smartphone and again p 70 t 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.540
 smartphone attached to review 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.700
 store movil groups dot com. wei 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.860
 and accordingly as if a reference where you 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.650
 can purchase in Ukraine will 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.359
 be under this time video on 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.430
 I am a little familiar with the review 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.080
 wrapping the package will not be so now 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.730
 how to eat and now let's 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.740
 let's see what we have inside 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.769
 inside is our smartphone lenovo p 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.480
 70 n that is this version that is still 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.770
 version but we have our smartphone that we have 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.370
 have bundled we have 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.260
 paper instruction warranty card 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.260
 additional protective film 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.120
 charger as far as 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.079
 on one and a half thousand milliamps 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.469
 Strange could already on 2 do the same 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.629
 we have return turk headsets to in 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.210
 principle, just at least with the inscription lenovo 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.879
 but I think it's quite simple as well 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.920
 we have all day none of the decade all 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.270
 more we have nothing 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.439
 smartphone we already put in the bumper 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.439
 it's good 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.369
 sho bumper bumper bumper bumper 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.409
 silicone has such a mesh very 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.390
 I don’t even know the summer of the seller 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.369
 It goes well and Lego specifically from the store 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.289
 that is most likely from the store and this 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:32.479
 such a present is not such a camera 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:34.130
 it seems and so on on on on our screen 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.759
 there is such a shipping 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.110
 little film that we take times and 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.539
 then, respectively, the opposite is true 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.569
 because with such a film a reviewer 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.289
 do not very cool so what if 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.539
 by myself 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.759
 the device has something that looks very much 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.740
 it was interesting to me personally it was interesting 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.500
 version she had the opportunity 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.130
 to operate the version I think that too 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.229
 you need to make the body material plastic 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.209
 This plastic is made under the skin 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.159
 Plastic, in principle, nicely has 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.080
 texture under the skin 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.489
 it's clear the glass case is from that thunder 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.920
 as it seems to me the metal at the bottom 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.120
 us hole for 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.519
 dynamically speakers this we will check 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.730
 micro usb connector microphone 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.530
 on top of 35 millimeter more and more like 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.900
 would we have nothing smartphone chip 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.880
 what it is that we have it 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.850
 the continuation of the famous line line n 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.150
 that is, and lenovo p780 if you remember was 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.420
 such a smartphone and he, too , as 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.940
 882 of this device the battery on the whole 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.810
 4000 milliamps ie rarely visit 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.489
 3,900 of this bake from 4,000 milliamps 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.709
 we also try on for testing and 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.799
 accordingly, how would we draw conclusions so 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.859
 like really this this or not no 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.420
 I know if I can make everything completely 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.100
 battery tests but the maximum is that 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.109
 I will succeed because time 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.930
 I'm limited so we will try 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.959
 fit and do everything to the maximum 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.530
 let's see what we have 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.530
 inside on software 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:17.319
 and so we have a smartphone here with us 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:21.030
 mediatek 67th yes installed 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.430
 correctly 67 32 that is here 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.769
 quad version processor in 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.650
 smartphone lenovo p 70 austin 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.660
 eight-core 52 process here we have 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.330
 1 gigabyte of RAM 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.599
 the version we have is two gigabytes of operational 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:42.160
 memory and drive in the version you have 8 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.319
 gigabyte version and a version of our 16 well 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.510
 this is the european version then this 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.400
 the Chinese place to the fact that I have hands 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.250
 is the chinese version as far as i am 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.040
 I see the translation is very good 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.700
 there is at least 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.410
 English there or some 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.260
 Chinese stuff for me is absolutely not 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.910
 rush so it can be said that 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.790
 Russification basically pretty 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.650
 good only course that I have 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.739
 I will look during testing that there 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.510
 how why and why check everything 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.670
 what is possible and impossible for this 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.950
 smartphone and then we will do 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.049
 full review on this unit and i will say 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.459
 his opinion is a worthy successor to you 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.010
 p780 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.039
 or not or somehow action 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.979
 all the same nuances lay out lenovo s800 60 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.560
 which was like 808 patrick 4000 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.960
 milliampere but the exterior was completely different 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.090
 But this pyshechka she more strict 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.940
 more let's say corporate 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.650
 and more responsible business or such 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.940
 business style in which it was done but 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.639
 p780 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.870
 and I look forward to the fact that all the same 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:49.440
 we will have this device similar 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.940
 characteristics and absolutely not 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.150
 will hit in the face dirt compared to 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.550
 my elder brother as well as elder posture 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.289
 pose last year's brother that's okay 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.970
 all then on this i'm unpacking video 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.190
 I’ll finish because for the time being 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.260
 nothing more all detailed 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.440
 characteristics tests you will see in full 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.500

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.539
 learn all that i know all that i learned in 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.020
 this smartphone and it was worth it 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.729
