00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.600
 then we will go to the cosmetics industry this industry should 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.830
 work with an optimum quality level 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.830
 but first, everything that goes up must come down 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.769
 the landing gear of an aircraft must be capable of transporting large 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.609
 tensions 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:15.419
 this piece 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.330
 key to the equipment of an air transport is the work of mechanical experts and 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.329
 product of a sophisticated technology 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.000
 this heavy piece of steel is the landing gear of a tanker 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.189
 cÃ¡ceres 135 r 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.730
 the landing mechanism includes a central axis to which the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.030
 tests not a success 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.290
 begins the turning of the central axis 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.680
 these digital environments such form the outer surface of the stiff 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.430
 the piece that is heated by fiction is cooled with churros de agua with 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.020
 oil 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.820
 then the central axis is perforated 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 the drill bit drills the inside of the shaft 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.230
 the head alignment must be perfect 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.090
 turning cuts are preserved and sold to foundries that recycle them 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.980
 The cutting tool used to drill the landing gear must be 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.980
 very sharp 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.480
 the perforation enlarges the sides as required by this machine 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.480
 tool 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.620
 again the pieces are cooled with a mixture of oil and water 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.860
 finished the cut the perforation is cleaned with compressed air to proceed 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.860
 to your visual inspection 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.840
 then with the same machine three pieces are simultaneously 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.270
 because they will be used in aviation 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.270
 these holidays should take turns perfectly 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.290
 at this moment the turning of milk is almost finished 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.889
 This unit that removes burrs cleans the surface with a tool 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.109
 of compressed air and paper discs said 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.369
 now the dimensions of the pieces must be verified 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:27.019
 This digitally controlled machine has three axes and verifies with great 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.019
 precision 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.449
 another unit allows the turning of larger parks 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.949
 this workshop also repairs used landing gear 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:51.079
 like this one of a 27 0 7 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.700
 They remove the paint with a sander to verify the conditions of the 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.699
 parts with greater precision 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.229
 but a visual inspection is not enough 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.489
 It is possible to detect cracks by a concentration of particles 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.629
 magnetic 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.260
 finally I did the i's here any crack becomes visible under a light 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
 ultraviolet 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.900
 it is time to apply a procedure and that balines are applied 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.659
 steel on the metal surface to increase its resistance to fatigue 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:25.759
 before painting the pieces swell fao after submerging it for 10 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.189
 minutes instead 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.189
 a corrosion-resistant protective layer was formed 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.029
 then the piece is quickly soaked in low concentration chromic acid 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.909
 the water stirred with jets of air eliminates the chromic acid if the piece 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.909
 Rinse again with water 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:54.809
 now the piece is subjected to 190 degrees to the heat for 23 hours to eliminate the 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.809
 hydrogen introduced during the disability process 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:03.539
 immediately before inserting it it is immersed in liquid nitrogen at least 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.539
 129 degrees Celsius to reduce its size 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.439
 you have to support is introduced with a hydraulic jack 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.849
 when heating the collar if it returns to its normal size 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.250
 now the different components of the units are inserted into the piston 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:23.699
 filtration test 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.870
 in its infarction resolution enters the piston 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.200
 this actress absorbs stress by impact when an airplane lands 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.169
 now the piston is introduced into cylinders and it is verified that the piece of 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.270
 Absorption of impacts has no leaks 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.450
 the operation ends with fixing the paint in an oven 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.959
 it takes between six and eight months to build a new train of 

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:50.749
 landing and between six and eight weeks to recondition one used
