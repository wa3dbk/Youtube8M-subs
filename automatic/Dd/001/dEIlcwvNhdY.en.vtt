00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.359
 hello everyone I am an angel today 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:06.939
 I'm going to teach a trick that is going to 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.770
 love and it's like covering a tattoo 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.050
 let's assume that currently no longer 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.870
 There is a problem if you show up to work 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.270
 with tattoos and stuff but good 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.580
 all ways it is not too much to know and 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.890
 I'm going to show you how and well 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.869
 I wanted to teach that what you do not know 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.730
 I have shown them who follow me in 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.679
 instagram must have seen it 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.949
 I made a tattoo exclusively for 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.410
 teach them how to cover tattoos good ok 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.890
 I did not do it with that intention 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.960
 yes this when I did it evidently 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.860
 I thought of you and how could I 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.470
 teach them how to cover one 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.010
 the tattoo that I made is this one 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.710
 good as you can see I'm a little freak 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.110
 and nerd then I have tattooed a 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.260
 molecule first and very important 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.520
 they need a corrector that is 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.770
 practically red if they do not have a 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.010
 red corrector as they can use a 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.380
 labial and the concealer is already designed 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.410
 in such a way that it will help us 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.140
 fixes well on the skin and good to last 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.870
 much more time but if not a lip 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.490
 that is more or less of this tone we 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.380
 get out of trouble 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.619
 I have already shown this corrector 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.869
 before the brand mod and is the brawn 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.170
 right this is found in the 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.580
 dermatological pharmacies 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.580
 by taking a little 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.799
 distributed more or less 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:42.719
 in some fault or a recipient I'm going to 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.719
 put and I'm going to start working 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.550
 in this way to do it as very 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.979
 aguadito since I have it like that I'm going to take 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.600
 a sponge for makeup or a 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.470
 brush when I better stand up 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.390
 because that's going to be easier to show them 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.390
 then I will take the red concealer 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.560
 or the labial as the case may be 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.290
 I'm going to apply it right on the tattoo 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.640
 if I need to give it as much coverage 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.209
 I mean it is practically 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.209
 disappeared with this 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.510
 if you realize what I'm applying as 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.120
 I'm just not like 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.040
 sliding so much 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.709
 the next thing I'm going to do is apply 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.470
 a translucent powder try that the 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.599
 dust not from anything colored 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.550
 I'm going to use the brand right now 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.860
 mode 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.810
 what is zero I need to seal super 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.920
 well with the powder then you can take 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.920
 with the sponge 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.379
 I need a good amount and I'm going to 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.379
 apply as a touch 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.190
 with a brush here all the excess 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.460
 and the next thing is to apply more concealer 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.460
 Red 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.740
 applied more powder 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.040
 just a little more 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.790
 As you can realize it already 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.400
 totally covered , you can not see 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.670
 the tattoo that that's the first thing that 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.570
 it mattered but obviously it does not see us with 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:54.500
 a red spot not a great corruption 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:57.140
 I need to try to match the color of the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.500
 rest of my skin because I emphasize 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.260
 this of trying obviously I had a 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.480
 tattoo here and I put a red color 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.760
 neutralize dark tones 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.040
 So obviously that area, I do not know 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.110
 will see totally color here yes it is 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.480
 very important that they look for a base that 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.970
 have a very broad coverage but 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.840
 especially that it is very similar to the tone 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.820
 of your skin 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:28.270
 I'm going to combine the correctors 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.330
 my palette of the correctors and I'm going to 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.920
 use first or I'm going to mix this 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.760
 green because it helps neutralize the 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.790
 red mixed with some the former party 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.310
 about 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.600
 I'm going to take understand take part 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.600
 you smell more or less 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.330
 a little bit of this 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.070
 two 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.770
 I'm going to start mixing them 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.410
 and the calendars 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.440
 when we did it a while ago with the red 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.789
 that we apply a layer for upside down 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.789
 well the same 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.960
 but creating the quartz 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.150
 then someone corrector then and 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.600
 more totally green corrector but 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.460
 it has a totally greenish sub tone 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.530
 yellow then it will help you 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.330
 globalize quite a bit now for 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.450
 apply them I recommend you to be with 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.880
 a sponge to make it 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.169
 well with a brush like this a brush 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.930
 how will this help you a lot? 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.569
 to take a little bit of the base and I'm going to 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.259
 apply an easy 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.259
 to all 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.910
 and I put a lot of producer work 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.910
 and dust 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.110
 and if you are 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.660
 it was totally covered now the only thing 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.390
 What I'm going to do is try to match a 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.150
 little more the color because you see a 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.910
 little bit more white than for example if 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.130
 they prioritize a basic shirt no longer 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.530
 however if I'm going to need it it's a 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.870
 little bit darker so it can be 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.530
 a little more unnoticed I have this 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:35.040
 Italian brand powder is the number 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.040
 4 and it's like slightly pronounced 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:41.590
 then if they go to the family reunion 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.930
 where your grandma or aunt will be and 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.370
 they hate tattoos and they know that 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.439
 implies that I'm not going to give anything away from 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.360
 Christmas is a good option for 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:51.939
 cover it I hope you liked it 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.129

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:56.560

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:58.090
