defensively<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.429> very<00:00:08.700> useful<00:00:08.820> tool

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
defensively this is a very useful tool

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.940 
defensively this is a very useful tool
when<00:00:09.269> playing<00:00:09.719> since<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.230> allows<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.740> to

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
when playing since it allows you to

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.070 
when playing since it allows you to
dedicate<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.940> kill<00:00:12.300> when<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.780> normally

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
dedicate and kill when you normally

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.470 
dedicate and kill when you normally
would<00:00:13.469> die<00:00:13.650> from<00:00:13.860> just<00:00:14.219> one<00:00:14.610> turret<00:00:14.880> shot<00:00:15.210> or

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
would die from just one turret shot or

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.099 
would die from just one turret shot or
attack<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:17.160> can<00:00:17.310> also<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.699> used<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.359> Juke<00:00:18.900> or

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
attack it can also be used to Juke or

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.060 
attack it can also be used to Juke or
escape<00:00:20.090> without<00:00:21.090> further<00:00:21.630> ado<00:00:21.990> let's<00:00:22.560> get<00:00:22.890> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
escape without further ado let's get to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.769 
escape without further ado let's get to
it

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.999 

essentially<00:00:26.779> what<00:00:26.929> this<00:00:27.050> technique<00:00:27.439> is<00:00:27.650> is

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
essentially what this technique is is

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.099 
essentially what this technique is is
using<00:00:28.669> your<00:00:28.789> ultimate<00:00:29.119> right<00:00:29.449> after<00:00:29.840> you<00:00:29.929> use

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
using your ultimate right after you use

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.720 
using your ultimate right after you use
your<00:00:30.289> ultimate<00:00:30.500> so<00:00:30.980> that<00:00:31.099> you'll<00:00:31.220> jump<00:00:31.550> back

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
your ultimate so that you'll jump back

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.400 
your ultimate so that you'll jump back
to<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:31.970> shadow<00:00:32.210> that<00:00:32.449> spawn<00:00:32.809> from<00:00:33.050> your<00:00:33.230> first

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
to the shadow that spawn from your first

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.770 
to the shadow that spawn from your first
ultimate<00:00:33.920> what<00:00:34.670> will<00:00:34.820> happen<00:00:35.210> is<00:00:35.390> that<00:00:35.420> you'll

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
ultimate what will happen is that you'll

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.380 
ultimate what will happen is that you'll
trigger<00:00:36.110> potentially<00:00:36.890> spells<00:00:37.399> and<00:00:37.760> disorient

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
trigger potentially spells and disorient

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.509 
trigger potentially spells and disorient
the<00:00:38.480> enemy<00:00:38.750> as<00:00:38.870> well<00:00:39.530> as<00:00:39.710> getting<00:00:39.920> a<00:00:40.100> shadow<00:00:40.340> in

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
the enemy as well as getting a shadow in

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.670 
the enemy as well as getting a shadow in
a<00:00:40.670> strategic<00:00:41.269> location<00:00:41.449> without<00:00:42.079> having<00:00:42.559> to

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
a strategic location without having to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.050 
a strategic location without having to
waste<00:00:42.890> your<00:00:43.040> W

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
waste your W

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.700 
waste your W
to<00:00:46.060> show<00:00:46.240> what<00:00:46.420> I<00:00:46.450> mean<00:00:46.660> by<00:00:46.840> that<00:00:47.020> let's<00:00:47.470> take<00:00:47.650> a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
to show what I mean by that let's take a

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.210 
to show what I mean by that let's take a
look<00:00:47.920> at<00:00:48.010> this<00:00:48.160> skill<00:00:48.400> here<00:00:50.040> after<00:00:51.040> using

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
look at this skill here after using

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.160 
look at this skill here after using
death<00:00:51.550> mark<00:00:51.820> you'll<00:00:52.060> land<00:00:52.300> straight<00:00:52.750> on<00:00:52.960> top

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
death mark you'll land straight on top

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.110 
death mark you'll land straight on top
of<00:00:53.320> your<00:00:53.440> target<00:00:53.860> this<00:00:54.370> means<00:00:54.670> that<00:00:54.940> the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
of your target this means that the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.180 
of your target this means that the
swapped<00:00:55.420> shadow<00:00:55.750> will<00:00:56.170> be<00:00:56.350> straight<00:00:56.770> on<00:00:56.980> top

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
swapped shadow will be straight on top

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.880 
swapped shadow will be straight on top
of<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.430> target<00:00:57.640> as<00:00:57.850> well<00:00:58.260> therefore<00:00:59.260> as<00:00:59.680> you

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
of the target as well therefore as you

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.350 
of the target as well therefore as you
can<00:01:00.070> see<00:01:00.250> it's<00:01:00.550> easy<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.300> still<00:01:01.600> hit<00:01:01.930> E<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.559> Q

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
can see it's easy to still hit E and Q

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.969 
can see it's easy to still hit E and Q
another<00:01:04.360> useful<00:01:04.720> aspect<00:01:05.229> of<00:01:05.320> this<00:01:05.470> trick<00:01:05.770> is

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
another useful aspect of this trick is

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.190 
another useful aspect of this trick is
the<00:01:06.220> disorientation<00:01:06.910> and<00:01:07.330> escape<00:01:07.690> potential

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
the disorientation and escape potential

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.020 
the disorientation and escape potential
at<00:01:08.260> house<00:01:08.440> as<00:01:08.860> you<00:01:09.130> can<00:01:09.160> see<00:01:09.370> in<00:01:09.460> this<00:01:09.550> clip<00:01:09.820> the

at house as you can see in this clip the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.660 
at house as you can see in this clip the
core<00:01:10.660> philosophy<00:01:11.290> behind<00:01:11.470> instantly<00:01:12.310> jumping

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670
