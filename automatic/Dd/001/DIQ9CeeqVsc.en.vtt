00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
groove right here on the cargo carrier
itself<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:33.420> did<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.840> adjust<00:01:34.049> our<00:01:34.259> cargo

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
itself we did have to adjust our cargo

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.929 
itself we did have to adjust our cargo
bars<00:01:34.770> alright<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> get<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.729> measurement

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
bars alright and to get that measurement

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.910 
bars alright and to get that measurement
basically<00:01:36.570> what<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.750> did<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.650> measure

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
basically what we did is that we measure

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
basically what we did is that we measure
from<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> center<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.880> two<00:01:39.060> bolt<00:01:39.329> holes

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
from the center of the two bolt holes

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.870 
from the center of the two bolt holes
for<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.960> bolts<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.770> each<00:01:41.040> side<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.610> center

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
for you bolts on each side so the center

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.270 
for you bolts on each side so the center
of<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> center<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:44.100> came

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
of this to the center here and we came

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.460 
of this to the center here and we came
out<00:01:44.399> about<00:01:44.490> 21<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.119> half<00:01:45.270> inches<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.350> make

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
out about 21 and a half inches to make

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.770 
out about 21 and a half inches to make
it<00:01:46.590> easier<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.070> put<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> cargo<00:01:48.149> box<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it easier to put the cargo box on the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.450 
it easier to put the cargo box on the
roof<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.229> had<00:01:49.320> everything<00:01:49.500> locked<00:01:49.979> down<00:01:50.070> so

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
roof we had everything locked down so

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.700 
roof we had everything locked down so
let's<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:50.909> ahead<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.119> undo<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.450> latches<00:01:51.710> by

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
let's go ahead and undo the latches by

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.980 
let's go ahead and undo the latches by
one<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.040> front<00:01:53.220> one<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> rear<00:01:53.990> and

one in the front one in the rear and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.429 
one in the front one in the rear and
we'll<00:01:55.140> unlock<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.680> twos<00:01:55.860> latches<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.490> too
