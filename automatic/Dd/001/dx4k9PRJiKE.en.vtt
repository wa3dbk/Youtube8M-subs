00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
best implementation of smart class when

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.119 
best implementation of smart class when
it<00:03:37.050> takes<00:03:37.230> something<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.860> can<00:03:37.980> do<00:03:38.069> it

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
it takes something that you can do it

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.710 
it takes something that you can do it
again<00:03:38.220> anyway<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.760> says<00:03:38.910> hello<00:03:39.180> he<00:03:39.420> wasn't

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
again anyway and it says hello he wasn't

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.809 
again anyway and it says hello he wasn't
really<00:03:39.810> useless<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:41.010> really<00:03:41.280> think<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:41.670> because

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
really useless I really think so because

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.550 
really useless I really think so because
otherwise<00:03:42.060> you're<00:03:42.360> tied<00:03:42.629> into<00:03:42.810> using<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.290> yeah

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
otherwise you're tied into using it yeah

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.559 
otherwise you're tied into using it yeah
and<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:43.830> may<00:03:43.950> not<00:03:44.069> blocks<00:03:44.910> apart<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.390> game

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
and you may not blocks apart of the game

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.390 
and you may not blocks apart of the game
right<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:45.959> not<00:03:46.050> everyone<00:03:46.319> has<00:03:46.530> one<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:47.040> said
