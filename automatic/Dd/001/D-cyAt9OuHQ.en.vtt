00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.120
 every year people die at the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.690
 following accidents in spaces 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.280
 confined 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.440
 because it was not enough 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.250
 aware of the risks and therefore have no 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.190
 took the preventive measures 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.290
 appropriate if you become aware 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.940
 risks related to confined spaces 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.210
 you will be able to avoid many 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.210
 accidents 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.509
 this program will address the points 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.390
 following confined space allowed to 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.430
 work risks related to spaces 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.360
 confined among which atmosphere 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.640
 oxygen- poor explosive atmosphere 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.390
 toxic atmosphere and risks associated with 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.490
 the environment 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.689
 afterwards we will review the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.890
 procedures to work safely 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.610
 the counters of atmosphere the ventilation 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.460
 protective equipment 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.789
 individual and finally the protection of 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.789
 respiratory tracts
