my<00:00:02.399> spring<00:00:02.700> fashion<00:00:03.210> lookbook<00:00:03.419> video<00:00:03.720> I

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
my spring fashion lookbook video I

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.960 
my spring fashion lookbook video I
actually<00:00:04.350> filmed<00:00:04.950> this<00:00:05.130> video<00:00:05.279> like<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.790> rest

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
actually filmed this video like the rest

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.160 
actually filmed this video like the rest
of<00:00:06.150> it<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.420> different<00:00:06.720> day<00:00:06.839> so<00:00:06.899> that's

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
of it and a different day so that's

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.169 
of it and a different day so that's
probably<00:00:07.379> why<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.589> look<00:00:07.890> different<00:00:08.309> there<00:00:09.090> was

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
probably why I look different there was

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.610 
probably why I look different there was
just<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.360> few<00:00:09.510> things<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.110> didn't<00:00:10.410> address

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
just a few things that I didn't address

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.470 
just a few things that I didn't address
in<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> video<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.730> kind<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.059> want<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.269> tell

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.270 
bunch of tank tops which I don't like
that<00:00:49.140> look<00:00:49.320> especially<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> shirt<00:00:50.160> is

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.860 
that look especially if the shirt is
like<00:00:50.430> crap<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.090> see<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> tank<00:00:51.539> top<00:00:51.719> and
