00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
and all I could think was my son's doing

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.559 
and all I could think was my son's doing
these<00:02:58.560> moves<00:02:58.889> in<00:02:59.099> their<00:02:59.250> gym<00:02:59.459> class<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.480> I

the<00:03:02.489> back<00:03:02.669> of<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.909> room<00:03:03.060> because<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.389> didn't

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
the back of the room because I didn't

want people think I was laughing at them
but<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.370> was<00:03:05.639> just<00:03:05.819> napping<00:03:05.970> as<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.659> vision<00:03:07.049> of<00:03:07.169> my

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
but I was just napping as a vision of my

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.449 
but I was just napping as a vision of my
son's<00:03:07.560> doing<00:03:07.769> those<00:03:07.950> moves<00:03:10.430> Groundhog<00:03:11.430> Day

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.259 
son's doing those moves Groundhog Day
tomorrow

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
tomorrow

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.089 
tomorrow
I<00:03:12.540> need<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.169> prediction<00:03:13.530> for<00:03:13.680> Groundhog<00:03:14.069> Day

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
I need a prediction for Groundhog Day

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.119 
I need a prediction for Groundhog Day
and<00:03:14.340> for<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:14.939> Super<00:03:15.209> Bowl<00:03:15.500> well<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.709> don't<00:03:17.010> want

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
and for the Super Bowl well I don't want

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.069 
and for the Super Bowl well I don't want
to<00:03:17.189> make<00:03:17.280> predictions<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.629> think<00:03:18.870> if<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
to make predictions but I think if the

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.979 
to make predictions but I think if the
Sun<00:03:19.349> shines<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:21.150> means<00:03:21.389> that<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.720> Seahawks

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
Sun shines that means that the Seahawks

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.289 
Sun shines that means that the Seahawks
did<00:03:22.379> not<00:03:22.560> surround<00:03:22.950> Peyton<00:03:23.729> Manning<00:03:24.030> enough

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
did not surround Peyton Manning enough

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.449 
did not surround Peyton Manning enough
and<00:03:24.629> that<00:03:25.319> means<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.709> he'll<00:03:25.829> probably<00:03:26.069> win

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
and that means that he'll probably win

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.670 
and that means that he'll probably win
but<00:03:27.389> if<00:03:27.629> the<00:03:27.750> Sun<00:03:27.959> doesn't<00:03:28.109> shine<00:03:28.349> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
but if the Sun doesn't shine the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.379 
but if the Sun doesn't shine the
Seahawks<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:29.669> well<00:03:29.849> you<00:03:30.030> know<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.150> think

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
Seahawks I think well you know I think

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.399 
Seahawks I think well you know I think
it's<00:03:30.629> going<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.840> be<00:03:30.959> we're<00:03:31.139> gonna<00:03:31.199> have<00:03:31.379> a
