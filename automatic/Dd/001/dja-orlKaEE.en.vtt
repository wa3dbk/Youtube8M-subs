00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.320
 Time is beginning to run out especially timer owners Nys is working on a new one 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.519
 almera and when talking with the cio of cito and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.469
 bye everyone and welcome to this kouter weekly journal 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.840
 the end of the cleaners seems to be coming and that is coming 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.449
 probably not a happy ending for owners of cars and younger than 40 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.079
 year 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.810
 the second chamber refuses to adjust the tax plan for 2014 in this way 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:31.289
 turned out last week and that kia means it means sad faces 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.080
 ameland 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.320
 then let me start that it would also be possible that the first one 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.500
 room still put a stop to order that is a very small spark that hope 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.440
 is still there 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.290
 but it just looks like it's going ahead and that means especially for 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.220
 People who can give up the car who want a big piece of tops 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.550
 deliver 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.280
 about 1,000 2,000 euros in grants to each other yes 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.379
 and the 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.309
 then you are talking about the owners but the entire industry that has been living in it for a long time 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.509
 uncertainty now actually a small month before the scheme starts 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.399
 and I think there are many traders with a stock of 7 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.900
 big problems with that well they will have to have a different market 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.590
 I think searching will still be interested in nine people 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.690
 in a touch of turkey also given example yes 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.110
 however, you have to 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.380
 not to mention chevrolet malibu on lpg, which happens to be itself 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.840
 to have 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.700
 Miffy 89 seats now five years before it becomes tax-free 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.130
 I can of course now try to sell at nothing in return 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.400
 put in an old barn for five years or can transfer to gasoline 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.719
 how exactly would that work? 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.099
 well then you also have to have no relief and that they encountered there 

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:39.369
 every year there are no jokes about disconnecting some things for the council chamber 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.690
 mp has to get out when the pole has to go 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.740
 or are already being debited 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.810
 just to book a few things like something like that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.810
 Well I was already on the internet in Hoogvliet offered for 120 euros 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.230
 I can not say how it happens there but also try to get lost 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.120
 but after that you have to get rid of him again, of course, and I am still 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120
 parked the papers we know know 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.750
 yes and then there were yes also a bite I just don't know what I am now 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.680
 must do 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.909
 advise that 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.459
 After that a scheme has changed so many times that Monuc will surprise us 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.499
 the new plans will arrive in half a year 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:18.139
 but well yes she likes chep pallets and at some point the spark 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.310
 so the first thing that comes to my mind 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.989
 maybe the program has passed away good runners for that person 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.809
 thank you 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.989
 the vocals surprised friend and foe in 2007 by his traditional c 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.009
 segmenter to get more out of the cash 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.449
 has that she has done absolutely no harm but apparently would last for a long time 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:41.109
 nevertheless back to the google this of the bacon testify these spy images 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.029
 who drives a brother-in-law commercial version of the new Nissan Almera thereby 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.079
 for the sake of convenience just assume that the old name will not be used again 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.199
 use 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.149
 under the black plastic we recognize the contours of the tea days 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.979
 so if he speaks who is not for sale in Europe 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.729
 so the chances are that new almere is very similar to the car whose in 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:01.379
 2011 the second generation was presented 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.290
 In order to be able to get involved in the current C people this would probably be 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.769
 Utilizing the engines that recently debuted in the new Qasqai 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.090
 including a single 2 liter three-cylinder engine that broke through with 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.949
 a few 5 liters 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:16.249
 of the entertainment there was also an electric version so who knows 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.689
 usually also planning with almere 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.709
 the new almere will probably come onto the market at the end of 2014 and then it must 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.180
 make visible between the parade of violence of the visit and the chance 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.839
 recently we received a call from the cito and importer that in the see too 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:34.379
 Mr. Fredrica Banzet would come to the Netherlands for a lightning visit 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:38.009
 and whether we might have the time or the urge to interview him 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.019
 but of course 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.409
 love a stranger 2 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.279
 brands took fire this is transforming the field but goalkeeper 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:48.229
 increase the field next to the crown 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.229
 the channel for the rest of the traffic 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:55.620
 the timing about the meet and also destroy 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.579
 he wins the last 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.730
 you walk color easy way to storm that lasted time ran 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.979
 send that may be difficult if you have modules per york number 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.089
 Piet Kuys The Brand Raged Marketing came selling the product 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:12.369

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.250
 but for the paint that match is thin 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.300

 they are fighting for the victory of the sent kind that has been in the past 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.150
 help and then what the sex before and by ing I promise not to see some 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.279

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.360

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.569
