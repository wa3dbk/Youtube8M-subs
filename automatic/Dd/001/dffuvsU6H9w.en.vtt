that<00:02:48.940> section<00:02:49.269> of<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.629> game<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.350> one<00:02:50.650> part

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
that section of the game that one part

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.050 
that section of the game that one part
that's<00:02:52.180> it

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
that's it

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.839 
that's it
it's<00:02:55.060> funny<00:02:55.360> because<00:02:55.599> if<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:57.250> guys<00:02:57.459> even<00:02:57.670> look

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
it's funny because if you guys even look

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.619 
it's funny because if you guys even look
at<00:02:58.420> what<00:02:58.870> they<00:02:59.019> said<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.290> digital<00:02:59.830> foundry

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
at what they said on digital foundry

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.690 
at what they said on digital foundry
this<00:03:01.629> game<00:03:01.930> actually<00:03:02.200> runs<00:03:02.650> higher<00:03:03.190> at<00:03:03.640> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
this game actually runs higher at a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.180 
this game actually runs higher at a
higher<00:03:04.180> frame<00:03:04.780> rate<00:03:05.080> than<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.980> other

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
higher frame rate than the other

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.110 
higher frame rate than the other
versions<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.970> console<00:03:07.420> versions<00:03:07.840> it's<00:03:08.440> just

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
versions the console versions it's just

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.330 
versions the console versions it's just
unstable<00:03:10.120> like<00:03:10.900> those<00:03:11.470> versions<00:03:11.769> are<00:03:12.099> both

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
unstable like those versions are both

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.150 
unstable like those versions are both
locked<00:03:12.700> at<00:03:12.940> 30<00:03:13.209> frames<00:03:13.450> per<00:03:13.660> second<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.379> for

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
whatever reason warner brothers when

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.740 
whatever reason warner brothers when
they<00:03:17.590> did<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.980> wii<00:03:18.129> u<00:03:18.310> port<00:03:18.640> they<00:03:19.360> didn't<00:03:19.629> lock

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
they did the wii u port they didn't lock

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.259 
they did the wii u port they didn't lock
the<00:03:19.810> framerate<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.579> version<00:03:22.000> runs

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
the framerate so this version runs

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.750 
the framerate so this version runs
anywhere<00:03:22.599> from<00:03:22.930> up<00:03:23.200> as<00:03:23.470> high<00:03:23.680> as<00:03:23.709> 45<00:03:24.280> frames

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
anywhere from up as high as 45 frames

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.410 
anywhere from up as high as 45 frames
per<00:03:25.030> second<00:03:25.450> all<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:26.049> way<00:03:26.170> down<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.739> 20s

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
per second all the way down to the 20s

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.699 
per second all the way down to the 20s
so<00:03:28.680> why<00:03:29.680> didn't<00:03:30.010> they<00:03:30.099> like<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.489> frame<00:03:30.730> rate<00:03:30.970> I

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
so why didn't they like the frame rate I

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.920 
so why didn't they like the frame rate I
don't<00:03:32.709> know<00:03:32.920> but<00:03:33.579> there's<00:03:33.849> also<00:03:34.150> parts<00:03:34.750> of

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
don't know but there's also parts of

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.270 
don't know but there's also parts of
this<00:03:35.079> game<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.440> look<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.220> lot<00:03:37.060> better<00:03:38.280> than

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
this game that look a lot better than

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.539 
this game that look a lot better than
the<00:03:39.879> other<00:03:40.090> console<00:03:40.629> versions<00:03:41.340> one<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.459> those

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
the other console versions one of those

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.520 
the other console versions one of those
being<00:03:42.790> there's<00:03:43.000> absolutely<00:03:43.599> no<00:03:43.959> screen

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
being there's absolutely no screen

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.920 
being there's absolutely no screen
tearing<00:03:44.859> in<00:03:45.099> the<00:03:45.129> wii<00:03:45.340> u<00:03:45.519> version<00:03:45.790> because<00:03:46.750> of

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
tearing in the wii u version because of

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.030 
tearing in the wii u version because of
vsync<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:48.640> is<00:03:48.849> a<00:03:49.030> feature<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:50.829> other

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
vsync this is a feature that the other

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.460 
vsync this is a feature that the other
console<00:03:51.430> versions<00:03:51.790> lack<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:53.049> at<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.230> same

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
console versions lack but at the same

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.170 
console versions lack but at the same
time<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:53.980> double-edged<00:03:54.459> sword<00:03:54.879> because

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
time it's a double-edged sword because

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.690 
time it's a double-edged sword because
while<00:03:56.079> there's<00:03:56.290> no<00:03:56.349> screen<00:03:56.890> tearing<00:03:57.190> adding

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
while there's no screen tearing adding

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.640 
while there's no screen tearing adding
vsync<00:03:58.269> actually<00:03:59.049> takes<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.410> hit<00:03:59.620> on

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
vsync actually takes a hit on

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.039 
vsync actually takes a hit on
performance<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:01.000> got<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.269> add<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.630> fact<00:04:01.870> that

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
performance you got to add the fact that

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.659 
performance you got to add the fact that
you're<00:04:02.560> streaming<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.130> game<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.549> the

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
you're streaming the game to the

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.610 
you're streaming the game to the
controller<00:04:04.060> then<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.720> got<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:04.989> add<00:04:05.109> the<00:04:05.349> fact

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
controller then you got to add the fact

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.129 
controller then you got to add the fact
that<00:04:05.769> there's<00:04:06.489> higher<00:04:06.790> resolution<00:04:07.599> textures

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
that there's higher resolution textures

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.690 
that there's higher resolution textures
then<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.590> got<00:04:08.739> to<00:04:08.769> add<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.340> fact<00:04:09.519> that

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
then you got to add to the fact that

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.500 
then you got to add to the fact that
there's<00:04:09.970> fullscreen<00:04:11.489> anti-aliasing<00:04:12.489> on<00:04:12.760> the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
there's fullscreen anti-aliasing on the

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.289 
there's fullscreen anti-aliasing on the
Wii<00:04:13.690> U<00:04:13.870> version<00:04:14.370> that's<00:04:15.370> not<00:04:15.549> on<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.730> 360

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
Wii U version that's not on the 360

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.979 
Wii U version that's not on the 360
version<00:04:16.389> or<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:16.959> ps3<00:04:17.680> version<00:04:18.630> then<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:19.810> got

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
version or the ps3 version then you got

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.379 
version or the ps3 version then you got
to<00:04:20.109> add<00:04:20.260> in<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.680> fact<00:04:20.889> that<00:04:21.039> there's<00:04:21.430> bloom

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
to add in the fact that there's bloom

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.570 
to add in the fact that there's bloom
lighting<00:04:22.960> applied<00:04:23.320> due<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.160> armored

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
lighting applied due to the armored

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.029 
lighting applied due to the armored
suits<00:04:24.880> so<00:04:25.660> actually<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.139> wii<00:04:26.320> u<00:04:26.470> version<00:04:26.710> is

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
suits so actually the wii u version is

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.210 
suits so actually the wii u version is
pushing<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.729> lot<00:04:28.660> more<00:04:29.260> than<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.010> other

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
pushing a lot more than the other

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.240 
pushing a lot more than the other
console<00:04:30.760> versions<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.860> for<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:32.950> most<00:04:33.130> part

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
console versions and for the most part

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.540 
console versions and for the most part
looking<00:04:34.060> a<00:04:34.210> lot<00:04:34.479> better<00:04:35.010> most<00:04:36.010> of<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.370> time

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
looking a lot better most of the time

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.460 
looking a lot better most of the time
now<00:04:37.240> one<00:04:37.599> other<00:04:37.630> thing<00:04:37.990> i've<00:04:38.110> seen<00:04:38.320> people

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
now one other thing i've seen people

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.760 
now one other thing i've seen people
complaining<00:04:39.039> about<00:04:39.250> this<00:04:39.610> is<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:41.020> controls

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
complaining about this is the controls

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.159 
complaining about this is the controls
on<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.340> wii<00:04:42.460> u<00:04:42.610> pad<00:04:42.849> saying<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:43.990> they're

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
on the wii u pad saying that they're
