00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 per glass how it came about that they are as a 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.910
 dedicated to this topic 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.780
 per time yes I have just at a 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.070
 broadcast report belongs to the trade fair city 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.070
 and I can not let go 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.130
 left there in the building of fate 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.570
 minutes I have listened I have 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.109
 thought that can not be true there is 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.310
 it does not and that in Munich 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.019
 between three and five thousand 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.740
 primary school children so the little ones 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.080
 suffering from massive hunger 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.580
 I could not get that out of mine anymore 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.530
 head out and I went home 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.550
 Mannes tells me I'm so shaken 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.230
 I can not believe it 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.610
 either it is an exaggerated one 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.350
 history or what should that be and 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.150
 we researched and then have 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.950
 actually noticed that it at all 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.920
 was not exaggerated but that it was in 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.050
 focus school very solid in need 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.080
 and then we just have it 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.000
 that we do something and so is time 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.250
 percent got stood right there 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.620
 want to train then so wanted 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.960
 We have the elementary schools Munich 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.019
 get written on the answer of 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.820
 out of 22 schools 17 have the answer to it 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.190
 there is that with the questionnaire 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.510
 problem and have at 17 schools 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.240
 answered said yes we have that 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.190
 problem quite massive we have exhausted 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.930
 the kids are crazy and have us 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.460
 first four schools picked so 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.840
 School leaders and have us 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.090
 put together and what can we do 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.740
 Do and there have the four headmistress 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.790
 said like a mouth we'll be fine 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.540
 to hand over 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.950
 if you bring the work like blessed what 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.299
 I am very interested in this project 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.780
 it is fascinating that you are too 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.490
 very many unqualified ones 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.560
 senior has included one 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.850
 good luck then because then as us 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.380
 then continued stepping when said then 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.109
 you can login to the rusk their 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.759
 School arriving is terrible 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.859
 We would like to have breakfast as well 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.140
 one breakfast they would get really great super 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:50.689
 great thank you and then suddenly he 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.039
 power is there we already were there I am 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.450
 points further doubt one has yes 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.249
 of course, must indeed a mania can 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.100
 do not wash off teachers community cellar 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:00.289
 and then the idea came to us ideal idea 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.240
 why do not people take so early 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.259
 those who are retired are not aware anymore 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.659
 what you should do 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.880
 who do not feel needed and 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.069
 said other two generations 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.069
 together the first and the third and it 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.740
 has turned out so great because the children 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.640
 hang on these seniors in wiso 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.920
 grandma thinks you are sitting down a bit 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.360
 that makes that is just ideal and 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.190
 not only the children some of it so 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.090
 when we do so in seniors meetings 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.069
 that just we do it again 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.750
 Thank you too, they are all 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.430
 so excited human child now have 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.220
 i have a job i am looking forward to anybody 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.390
 day to go there and just for 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.040
 to be the children there and it is 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.830
 really it just a stroke of luck 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.680
 The project has already been targeted at two 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.480
 Years that means you can the shock 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.590
 regulate how the behavior of the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.260
 children or for the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.209
 changed next year so that would be too 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.739
 early to say here you can do it all 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.849
 be clear but what we really see 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.410
 is that the kids happy enduring 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.090
 also to follow the teaching so to say 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.680
 the teachers are clearly the teaching 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.230
 Happy as a line the headmaster yourself 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.209
 they are funny rows have come 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.459
 fed up and happy and take care and 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.590
 are not there I have who and what 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.519
 I'm all that focused like that 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.519
 can say clearly
