I<00:01:35.369> think<00:01:36.369> I<00:01:36.520> think<00:01:36.729> for<00:01:36.970> me<00:01:37.119> it's<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.500> best

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
I think I think for me it's the the best

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.640 
I think I think for me it's the the best
the<00:01:39.189> best<00:01:39.310> time<00:01:39.549> my<00:01:39.790> football<00:01:40.150> career<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.470> I'm

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
the best time my football career but I'm

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.899 
the best time my football career but I'm
with<00:01:41.799> full<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.100> playing<00:01:42.369> with<00:01:42.520> these<00:01:42.670> these

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
with full and playing with these these

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.499 
with full and playing with these these
players<00:01:43.240> I<00:01:43.420> think<00:01:43.830> we<00:01:44.830> as<00:01:45.159> a<00:01:45.220> group<00:01:46.060> we

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
players I think we as a group we

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.929 
players I think we as a group we
probably<00:01:47.170> had<00:01:47.350> 18<00:01:47.649> players<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.280> were<00:01:48.430> all<00:01:48.670> in

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
probably had 18 players that were all in

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.510 
probably had 18 players that were all in
it<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.240> all<00:01:49.330> in<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.570> together<00:01:49.689> and<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:51.399> know

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
it and all in it together and you know

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.920 
it and all in it together and you know
it<00:01:51.580> was<00:01:51.670> fantastic<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.390> changing<00:01:52.750> room
