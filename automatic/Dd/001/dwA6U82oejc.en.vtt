00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 nice guys and how much polish 2 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.910
 channel we are back with a new series 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.730
 of videos from today will not always come out but 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.309
 practically the top 5 of each role today 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.820
 we have goalkeepers and we are going to find out 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.020
 who will be immediately and fifth that casillas 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.830
 casillas boys is really a good one 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.670
 one-meter high door and 85 84 kg 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.619
 acrobatic the study of farah version 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.140
 weak two its features are 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.510
 the long referral and flag of the club e 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.289
 boys home cases itself is very good 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.110
 elevation 77 reflections 80 however to his 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.899
 time is a goalkeeper who is very agile 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.239
 we say perhaps to the most agile of all though 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.910
 a small flaw that he lobs 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.129
 because it is not very high it suffers them 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.420
 virtually all of the facts is a sin and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.149
 that's why I put it in fifth 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.590
 position even if it could also be 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.300
 further back in my opinion 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.610
 because there are other very good strings 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.610
 as mt handanovic idea 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.510
 and then let's find out the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.370
 fourth position the fourth position of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.799
 an Italian goalkeeper who is a savior 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.270
 sirigu ragazzi salvatore sirigu is a 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.340
 mixed we say besides casillas ei 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.960
 goalkeepers who come after is a style 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.260
 of acrobatic parade and one meter high and 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.140
 92 therefore higher than of casillas ha 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.390
 like features long reference and like 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.780
 elevation and reflexes are not yet so 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.180
 put well because at 68 78 however it has one 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.820
 good long throw with both feet and 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.920
 with your hands so it's pretty good 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.630
 however it must be said that also the same 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.189
 casillas to a really very remittance 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.220
 long with hands in third position 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.630
 we also have for chester that in reality 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.240
 in the photo he asks to stay in second 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.460
 position but no it goes very well in third 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.049
 and a meter high and 96 is a style of 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.119
 traditional word with the weak point 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.590
 three stars skill moves one like 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.119
 features is referral along the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.979
 club flag and team man 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.810
 even check ups and reflexes 86 ed 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.960
 evasion 38 but you don't need it since it is 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.240
 very high then 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.560
 the throw-in is really a good goalkeeper 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.020
 with the arm is not like that of 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.270
 casillas but it's very reactive 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.250
 on the balls when I'm so little 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.750
 also dirty and covers it very well 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.459
 door mirror as it is a lot 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.149
 big and there is just space then for 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.149
 get over it 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.709
 in the second position we have culture 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.319
 boys then chelsea wins two 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.670
 of the first three places very cultural 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.900
 young and tall a mother 99 bharata style 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.269
 traditional and three-star weak bans 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.160
 boys is very strong features 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.360
 long delay of goalkeeper and his own 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.519
 now manuel delivery is enough 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.320
 high compared to what has 81 gods 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.830
 reflexes is a goalkeeper is always a lot 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.630
 well placed is always perfectly in 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.180
 position to a good request both with 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.040
 the feet that is then with the hands and I have to 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.930
 say kids that i think is really 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.090
 the second strongest goalkeeper because he is 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.709
 a little stronger this research already 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.180
 which is really very strong too he is 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.550
 large and therefore takes up schoolchildren 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.250
 leads in first position but we have the 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.489
 in fact, the world's best goalkeeper 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.739
 he says it with the brown finger manuel noi 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.590
 and boys but it is not boredom is a meter and 93 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.630
 92 kg will be the traditional foot 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.030
 weak even 4- star boys at 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.579
 Beyond the fact that at 1 Veraldi 90 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.350
 public referral features along the 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.560
 Manuel orazi and even goalkeeper 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.709
 78 to be high reflexes 88 and has a 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.299
 value of 83 even of strength 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.090
 guys is the strongest goalkeeper because he is 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.850
 it really is always in an agile position 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.340
 on high balls also very strong not 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.260
 does an awesome thing put back with 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.820
 the long ankle style arm let's say 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.680
 I saw between casillas and short ha 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.709
 I think he is the perfect goalkeeper e 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.049
 therefore it deserves to be in first place 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.489
 really then we can see that me 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.920
 however, they give rigors against even because 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.400
 too much place look at that rigor that me 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.070
 was caused against practically 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.400
 then I let you taste from his 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.400
 parade 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.840
 I fleet guys centrally and 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.850
 It was easy enough has been done 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.610
 so pray these guys anyway 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.500
 I think the top 5 goalkeepers are there 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.240
 are the 15 pifs you write below 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.890
 yours between 5 and see you soon 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.910
 put so many like see you soon 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.910
 even with new roles
