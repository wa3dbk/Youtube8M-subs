with<00:00:36.850> our<00:00:37.000> pattern<00:00:37.300> let's<00:00:37.810> see<00:00:38.020> all<00:00:38.170> of<00:00:38.230> our

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
with our pattern let's see all of our

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.770 
with our pattern let's see all of our
options<00:00:39.370> for<00:00:39.430> our<00:00:39.579> pattern<00:00:40.030> I<00:00:40.120> like<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:40.510> I

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
options for our pattern I like that I

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.020 
options for our pattern I like that I
like<00:00:41.770> that<00:00:41.800> one<00:00:42.190> right<00:00:42.220> there<00:00:42.550> that<00:00:42.760> that

black and white one right there
something<00:00:44.890> simple<00:00:45.190> is<00:00:45.489> probably<00:00:45.820> good<00:00:46.030> as

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
something simple is probably good as

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.510 
something simple is probably good as
well<00:00:46.510> let's<00:00:47.200> take<00:00:47.380> a<00:00:47.410> look<00:00:47.620> let's<00:00:47.890> keep<00:00:48.040> going

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
well let's take a look let's keep going

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.810 
well let's take a look let's keep going
with<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:48.850> we<00:00:49.630> got<00:00:49.780> one<00:00:49.899> looks<00:00:50.079> cool

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
with it we got one looks cool

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.520 
with it we got one looks cool
there's<00:00:51.820> so<00:00:52.000> many<00:00:52.090> customization<00:00:52.960> options<00:00:53.350> I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
there's so many customization options I

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.369 
there's so many customization options I
haven't<00:00:53.920> been<00:00:54.160> in<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.370> clan<00:00:54.610> for<00:00:55.090> ever<00:00:55.329> guys<00:00:55.750> so

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
haven't been in a clan for ever guys so

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.010 
haven't been in a clan for ever guys so
I<00:00:56.410> figured<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.879> know<00:00:57.910> I'm<00:00:58.539> at<00:00:58.690> that<00:00:58.809> point

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
I figured you know I'm at that point

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.959 
I figured you know I'm at that point
where<00:00:59.140> I'm<00:00:59.320> playing<00:00:59.559> Crossy<00:00:59.829> clans<00:01:00.250> again<00:01:00.789> a

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.450 
where I'm playing Crossy clans again a
lot<00:01:01.300> so<00:01:01.870> I<00:01:02.170> figured<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:02.980> might<00:01:03.010> as<00:01:03.160> well<00:01:03.280> make<00:01:03.399> a

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
lot so I figured I might as well make a

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.130 
lot so I figured I might as well make a
clan<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:03.789> have<00:01:04.149> you<00:01:04.269> guys<00:01:04.420> joined<00:01:04.750> I'll<00:01:04.960> tell

along<00:01:06.520> let's<00:01:07.240> go<00:01:07.690> with<00:01:07.840> our<00:01:07.990> initial<00:01:08.530> our

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
along let's go with our initial our

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.260 
along let's go with our initial our
initial<00:01:09.549> one<00:01:09.700> we<00:01:09.850> wanted<00:01:10.210> I<00:01:10.530> believe<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.830> be

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
initial one we wanted I believe it to be

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.950 
initial one we wanted I believe it to be
let's<00:01:13.270> just<00:01:13.390> go

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
let's just go

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.760 
let's just go
something<00:01:14.799> let's<00:01:15.610> go<00:01:15.760> simplistic<00:01:16.540> I'd<00:01:17.409> say

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
something let's go simplistic I'd say

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.649 
something let's go simplistic I'd say
that's<00:01:18.400> probably<00:01:18.729> good<00:01:19.060> one<00:01:19.210> we'll<00:01:19.360> say<00:01:19.510> that

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
that's probably good one we'll say that

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.890 
that's probably good one we'll say that
one<00:01:19.810> is<00:01:19.930> good<00:01:20.140> one<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.770> make<00:01:20.799> it<00:01:21.010> black<00:01:21.900> maybe

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
one is good one to make it black maybe

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.859 
one is good one to make it black maybe
white<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:23.740> we<00:01:23.890> could<00:01:24.040> do<00:01:24.189> like<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.430> oh<00:01:24.820> but<00:01:25.720> I

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
white so we could do like a oh but I

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.200 
white so we could do like a oh but I
like<00:01:26.049> that<00:01:26.229> gray<00:01:26.560> color<00:01:26.770> but<00:01:27.070> it's<00:01:27.189> not<00:01:27.310> on<00:01:27.790> for

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
like that gray color but it's not on for

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.450 
like that gray color but it's not on for
the<00:01:28.330> options<00:01:28.869> so<00:01:29.229> I<00:01:29.500> believe<00:01:30.100> we're<00:01:30.280> just

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
the options so I believe we're just

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.190 
the options so I believe we're just
gonna<00:01:30.549> go<00:01:30.759> with<00:01:30.909> black<00:01:31.150> keep<00:01:31.659> it<00:01:31.810> black<00:01:32.020> and

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
gonna go with black keep it black and

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.200 
gonna go with black keep it black and
white<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:32.860> we<00:01:33.250> don't<00:01:33.430> have<00:01:33.520> anything<00:01:33.790> here

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
white and we don't have anything here

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.999 
white and we don't have anything here
yet<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:34.780> we<00:01:34.960> don't<00:01:34.990> have<00:01:35.229> anything<00:01:35.500> for<00:01:35.890> our

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
yet so we don't have anything for our

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.130 
yet so we don't have anything for our
clients<00:01:36.460> let's<00:01:37.030> go<00:01:37.180> ahead<00:01:37.299> and<00:01:37.600> get<00:01:37.689> on<00:01:37.810> into
