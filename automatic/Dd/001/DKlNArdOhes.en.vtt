the<00:01:46.890> 14-inch<00:01:47.700> was<00:01:47.970> 14<00:01:48.479> 99<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.439> that's<00:01:49.680> what

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the 14-inch was 14 99 and that's what

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.260 
the 14-inch was 14 99 and that's what
color<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.610> color<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.030> more

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
