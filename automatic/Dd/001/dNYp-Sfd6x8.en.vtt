00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
just a really lonely man and he was just

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.479

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
but the only way people party with him

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.709 
but the only way people party with him
is<00:00:47.829> if<00:00:47.949> he<00:00:47.980> holds<00:00:48.250> some<00:00:48.489> hostage<00:00:49.090> it<00:00:49.600> was
