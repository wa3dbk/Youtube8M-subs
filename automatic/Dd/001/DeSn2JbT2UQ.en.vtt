00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hey gang spin to the ball matrix here

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.139 
hey gang spin to the ball matrix here
and<00:00:01.890> today<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.250> are<00:00:02.399> taking<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.850> look<00:00:02.970> at

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
and today we are taking a look at

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.840 
and today we are taking a look at
Transformers<00:00:03.899> Prime<00:00:04.110> deluxe<00:00:04.740> Cliffjumper

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
Transformers Prime deluxe Cliffjumper

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.579 
Transformers Prime deluxe Cliffjumper
now<00:00:06.299> cliffjumper's<00:00:06.810> alt<00:00:07.049> mode<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.560> very

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
now cliffjumper's alt mode is very

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.570 
now cliffjumper's alt mode is very
similar<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> 2012<00:00:09.570> Dodge<00:00:09.660> Challenger<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.950> I

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
similar to a 2012 Dodge Challenger and I

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.220 
similar to a 2012 Dodge Challenger and I
think<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.330> looks<00:00:12.660> fantastic<00:00:13.250> the<00:00:14.509> alt<00:00:15.509> mode<00:00:15.809> is

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
think it looks fantastic the alt mode is

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.760 
think it looks fantastic the alt mode is
obviously<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.920> car<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:17.699> oozes

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
obviously a car and it just oozes

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.140 
obviously a car and it just oozes
personality<00:00:19.770> if<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.580> any<00:00:20.880> complaints

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
personality if I have any complaints

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.179 
personality if I have any complaints
about<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.869> mode<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.350> would<00:00:22.470> have<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.800> say<00:00:22.980> that

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
about this mode I would have to say that

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.939 
about this mode I would have to say that
this<00:00:23.279> mode<00:00:23.519> feels<00:00:23.850> very<00:00:24.330> small<00:00:24.900> compared<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
this mode feels very small compared to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.220 
this mode feels very small compared to
the<00:00:26.130> others<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.670> know<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.210> sounds<00:00:27.570> weird<00:00:27.599> but

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the others I know that sounds weird but

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.080 
the others I know that sounds weird but
for<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.859> deluxe<00:00:29.220> class<00:00:29.460> figure<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.029> thing

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
for a deluxe class figure this thing

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.979 
for a deluxe class figure this thing
does<00:00:30.480> not<00:00:30.510> feel<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.590> big<00:00:31.920> at<00:00:32.189> all<00:00:32.719> also<00:00:33.719> I

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
does not feel that big at all also I

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.750 
does not feel that big at all also I
don't<00:00:34.440> know<00:00:34.620> if<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.860> how<00:00:35.100> well<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.489> see

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
don't know if you how well you can see

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.119 
don't know if you how well you can see
this<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.210> there's<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.780> lot<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.110> paneling<00:00:37.800> going

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
this but there's a lot of paneling going

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.920 
this but there's a lot of paneling going
on<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:39.239> has<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.660> do<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
on and this has to do with the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.510 
on and this has to do with the
transformation<00:00:40.649> which<00:00:40.800> we'll<00:00:40.950> get<00:00:41.040> into<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.460> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
transformation which we'll get into in a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.630 
transformation which we'll get into in a
moment<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:43.110> section<00:00:43.620> back<00:00:43.950> here<00:00:44.010> has<00:00:44.610> a

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
moment but this section back here has a

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.090 
moment but this section back here has a
tendency<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.660> unpack<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.590> come<00:00:46.770> apart

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
tendency to just unpack and come apart

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.250 
tendency to just unpack and come apart
rather<00:00:47.309> easily<00:00:47.730> along<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> doors<00:00:48.960> they

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
rather easily along with the doors they

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.520 
rather easily along with the doors they
have<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> tendency<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.129> fall<00:00:50.340> off<00:00:50.550> there<00:00:51.530> their

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
have a tendency to fall off there their

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.889 
have a tendency to fall off there their
holsters<00:00:53.100> pretty<00:00:53.370> quickly<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:53.940> well<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.690> it's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
holsters pretty quickly as well but it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.279 
holsters pretty quickly as well but it's
not<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.289> bad<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:55.739> all<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.870> now<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.140> take

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
not that bad at all so now that we take

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.959 
not that bad at all so now that we take
a<00:00:58.320> look<00:00:58.530> at<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> alt<00:00:59.190> mode<00:00:59.399> let's<00:00:59.670> go<00:00:59.850> ahead

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
a look at the alt mode let's go ahead

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.590 
a look at the alt mode let's go ahead
and<00:01:00.090> take<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> look<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.480> transformation

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
and take a look at the transformation

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
and take a look at the transformation
the<00:01:03.600> transformation<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:04.470> me<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.769> absolutely

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the transformation for me is absolutely

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.300 
the transformation for me is absolutely
fascinating<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.229> no<00:01:07.590> idea<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.159> this

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
fascinating as I have no idea that this

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
fascinating as I have no idea that this
faker<00:01:08.549> transformed<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:10.320> start

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
faker transformed like this to start

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.980 
faker transformed like this to start
we're<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.040> reach<00:01:11.189> underneath<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
we're going to reach underneath and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.420 
we're going to reach underneath and
unpaid<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.229> doors<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> front<00:01:14.189> wheel

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
unpaid the doors and the front wheel

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.640 
unpaid the doors and the front wheel
wells<00:01:14.900> like<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> total<00:01:17.220> body<00:01:17.610> then

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
wells like that from the total body then

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.070 
wells like that from the total body then
we'll<00:01:19.650> take<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.070> doors<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.970> front<00:01:21.630> panels

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
we'll take the doors and front panels

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.800 
we'll take the doors and front panels
and<00:01:22.350> actually<00:01:23.180> rotate<00:01:24.180> them<00:01:24.500> forward<00:01:26.780> when<00:01:27.780> we

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and actually rotate them forward when we

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.140 
and actually rotate them forward when we
do<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.710> should<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.520> enough<00:01:29.759> clearance

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
do that we should have enough clearance

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.740 
do that we should have enough clearance
to<00:01:30.570> reach<00:01:31.290> underneath<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.060> flip<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.299> red

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
to reach underneath and flip this red

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.539 
to reach underneath and flip this red
piece<00:01:34.110> down<00:01:34.409> from<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> middle<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> figure

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
piece down from the middle of the figure

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.140 
piece down from the middle of the figure
and<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:36.329> flip<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.049> entire<00:01:37.829> section<00:01:38.460> around

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and then flip the entire section around

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.980 
and then flip the entire section around
like<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:41.509> there<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:42.810> go<00:01:44.360> now<00:01:45.360> concentrating

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
like this there we go now concentrating

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.649 
like this there we go now concentrating
on<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> front<00:01:46.950> end<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> car<00:01:47.430> mode<00:01:47.909> we'll

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
on the front end of the car mode we'll

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.480 
on the front end of the car mode we'll
come<00:01:48.840> back<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> back<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.130> will<00:01:50.340> be

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
come back to the back of what will be

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.819 
come back to the back of what will be
the<00:01:50.579> robot<00:01:50.939> mode<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.390> take<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.840> underside<00:01:52.560> of

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the robot mode and take the underside of

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.510 
the robot mode and take the underside of
the<00:01:53.329> front<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.600> flip<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.590> right

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the front and flip that in right

back out like that there's a reason
we'll<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.630> which<00:02:03.810> we'll<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.110> into<00:02:04.490> then

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
we'll do that which we'll get into then

we'll do that which we'll get into then
come<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.299> sides<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.810> flip<00:02:07.049> forward<00:02:07.380> and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
come to the sides you flip forward and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.010 
come to the sides you flip forward and
straighten<00:02:08.610> out<00:02:08.849> what<00:02:09.149> will<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.899> upper

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020

legs<00:02:11.060> now<00:02:12.060> when<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.239> first<00:02:12.480> got<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:12.780> figure

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
legs now when I first got this figure

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.790 
legs now when I first got this figure
these<00:02:13.230> join

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
these join

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.920 
these join
that<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.250> straighten<00:02:14.580> out<00:02:14.700> or

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
that I just straighten out or

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.640 
that I just straighten out or
exceptionally<00:02:15.930> tight<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.950> just<00:02:17.700> be<00:02:17.850> wary<00:02:18.650> next

them at way and then fold the arms down
now<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.970> this<00:03:15.450> part<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:15.960> a<00:03:16.380> little<00:03:16.710> weird<00:03:16.920> and

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
now this this part is a little weird and

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.010 
now this this part is a little weird and
I've<00:03:17.670> had<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.970> play<00:03:18.270> with<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.630> little<00:03:18.750> while

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
I've had to play with it a little while

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.940 
I've had to play with it a little while
so<00:03:19.680> we'll<00:03:19.980> we'll<00:03:20.820> flip<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.420> head<00:03:21.690> up<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.140> then

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
so we'll we'll flip the head up and then

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.660 
so we'll we'll flip the head up and then
we'll<00:03:23.130> separate<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.900> roof<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.410> car<00:03:25.709> but

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
we'll separate the roof of the car but

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.970 
we'll separate the roof of the car but
then<00:03:26.940> they<00:03:27.270> only<00:03:27.480> separate<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.320> far<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:28.860> what

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
then they only separate so far so what

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.430 
then they only separate so far so what
we<00:03:29.130> have<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.459> do<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.880> actually<00:03:30.120> reach<00:03:30.600> in<00:03:30.870> here

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
we have to do is actually reach in here

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.060 
we have to do is actually reach in here
and<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:32.550> kind<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.820> play<00:03:33.300> with<00:03:33.630> this<00:03:33.950> until<00:03:34.950> we

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
and just kind of play with this until we

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.210 
and just kind of play with this until we
can<00:03:35.250> get<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.430> lined<00:03:35.760> up<00:03:35.970> such<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:37.530> piece

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
can get it lined up such that this piece

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.010 
can get it lined up such that this piece
that<00:03:38.489> we<00:03:38.580> folded<00:03:38.970> down<00:03:39.060> earlier<00:03:39.480> can<00:03:39.720> fold

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
that we folded down earlier can fold

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.699 
that we folded down earlier can fold
back<00:03:40.350> up<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.860> fit<00:03:41.610> comfortably<00:03:42.330> between<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
back up and fit comfortably between the

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.949 
back up and fit comfortably between the
two<00:03:43.890> pieces<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.480> roof<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
two pieces of the of the roof and the

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.920 
two pieces of the of the roof and the
windshield<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.680> form<00:03:47.459> his<00:03:47.610> chest<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.390> by

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
windshield to form his chest and by

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.920 
windshield to form his chest and by
comfortably<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.590> mean<00:03:49.860> it's<00:03:50.180> there's<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.360> little

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
bit of wiggle room and this is actually

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.699 
bit of wiggle room and this is actually
fitting<00:03:55.050> smoothly
