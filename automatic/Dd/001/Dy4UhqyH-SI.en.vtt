00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Sacred – the hill of grave

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.620
Angels – despairing face

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.490
Heartless – the evil eyes

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.050
Presenta - el sacrificio

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.630
Sacred – the hill of grave

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.490
Angels – despairing face

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.230
Heartless – the evil eyes

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.860
Present – the sacrifice

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.430
FEAR!

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.710
DICE!

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.030
HEAR! 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.350
DIE!

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:38.030
Ah, See those shadows of fools embraced by the warped moon

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:48.920
Ah, On this battlefield that knows no more mercy than purgatory

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.280
For my rising, with the power of death

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.960
Let us have a magnificent apocalypse!

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.020
Sacred – the hill of grave

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.780
Angels – despairing face

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.430
Heartless – the evil eyes

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.980
Present – the sacrifice

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.560
Ah, In the blink of an eye come an inhuman cries

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.080
Swords and halberds, a wasted effort!

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.510
Their ruthlessness does not even sate half of me!

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.850
They collide, baptism beneath a raging glare

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.500
This, the bloody battle bespoke in revelation!

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.930
Come, take up arms oh immaterial life!

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.410
If you would play a faceless die, then pray to your god!

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.970
Arms throbbing off to Ashura or wherever you go!

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.560
An alluring form deep in hellish realm doth speak her burning tongue

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.990
FEAR!

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.380
DICE!

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.590
HEAR! 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.990
DIE!

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.420
FEAR!

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.670
DICE!

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.230
HEAR! 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.510
DIE!

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.500
Your ruthless emotion it not nearly half enough!

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.750
I’ve already long before burned away the name you’ve praised!

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.030
If my sin cannot be atoned then this hour

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.910
Impregnate me with slavering religious ecstasy

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.200
Come, all those with reason kneel!

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.770
The emptiness you’ve carried and lost is but nothing!

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.160
Deserting the grand beauty of the heavens far above

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:35.730
From here we may never look up nor ever return!

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.030
Now spread my name, in beautiful heresy

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.010
Embrace my wings until the time to overthrow all may come!

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.360
Sacred – the hill of grave

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.180
Angels – despairing face

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.140
Heartless – the evil eyes

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.680
Present – the sacrifice
