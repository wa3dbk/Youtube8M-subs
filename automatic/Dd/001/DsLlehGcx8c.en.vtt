00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
we were so stupid why I'm like we knew

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.090 
we were so stupid why I'm like we knew
we<00:05:45.990> were<00:05:46.080> there<00:05:46.140> we<00:05:46.320> were<00:05:46.410> aid<00:05:46.590> their<00:05:46.770> why<00:05:46.980> did

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
we were there we were aid their why did

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.230 
we were there we were aid their why did
we<00:05:47.190> just<00:05:47.340> decide<00:05:47.460> like<00:05:47.760> yeah<00:05:47.940> which<00:05:48.120> is

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
we just decide like yeah which is

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.210 
we just decide like yeah which is
because<00:05:49.230> they<00:05:49.410> ran<00:05:49.620> in<00:05:49.770> the<00:05:49.860> other<00:05:49.980> direction

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
because they ran in the other direction

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.920 
because they ran in the other direction
and<00:05:50.610> we're<00:05:50.850> assuming<00:05:51.120> that<00:05:51.420> they<00:05:51.540> would<00:05:51.720> run

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
and we're assuming that they would run

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.200 
and we're assuming that they would run
maybe<00:05:52.440> in<00:05:52.590> a<00:05:52.680> direction<00:05:53.070> and<00:05:53.280> also<00:05:53.760> runs<00:05:53.940> some

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
maybe in a direction and also runs some

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.750 
maybe in a direction and also runs some
different<00:05:54.540> people<00:05:54.890> how<00:05:55.890> much<00:05:56.070> hope<00:05:56.220> you<00:05:56.610> have
