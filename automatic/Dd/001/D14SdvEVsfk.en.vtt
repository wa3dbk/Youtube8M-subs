00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
go down you're going to continuously get

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.240 
go down you're going to continuously get
that<00:02:29.540> 0.1<00:02:30.409> multiply<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:30.980> but<00:02:31.099> if<00:02:31.159> you're

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
that 0.1 multiply it but if you're

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.250 
that 0.1 multiply it but if you're
playing<00:02:31.400> co-op<00:02:31.760> if<00:02:32.180> anyone<00:02:33.019> on<00:02:33.110> your<00:02:33.140> team

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
playing co-op if anyone on your team

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.250 
playing co-op if anyone on your team
goes<00:02:33.680> down<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.329> multiplier<00:02:35.329> disappears

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
goes down that multiplier disappears

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.289 
goes down that multiplier disappears
because<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.860> co-op<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.430> have<00:02:37.549> more<00:02:37.700> zombies

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
because it co-op you have more zombies

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.679 
because it co-op you have more zombies
so<00:02:38.959> that<00:02:39.470> means<00:02:39.680> more<00:02:39.920> XP<00:02:40.400> alright<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.090> those

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
so that means more XP alright so those

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.640 
so that means more XP alright so those
are<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.109> perks<00:02:42.950> we've<00:02:43.280> chosen<00:02:44.030> also<00:02:44.900> for<00:02:45.470> the
