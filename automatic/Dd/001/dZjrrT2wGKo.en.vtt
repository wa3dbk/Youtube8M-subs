00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
line the ITX for that we did a nice

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.890 
line the ITX for that we did a nice
pretty<00:02:14.340> colorful<00:02:14.910> one<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.930> oh<00:02:16.170> well<00:02:17.810> what<00:02:18.810> do

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900

pretty colorful one but oh well what do
you<00:02:18.989> do<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.670> here<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.209> have<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.720> board<00:02:25.020> itself

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
you do so here we have the board itself

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.180 
you do so here we have the board itself
just<00:02:27.270> like<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:27.750> mini<00:02:28.110> ITX<00:02:28.350> design<00:02:29.069> I<00:02:29.100> think

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
just like this mini ITX design I think

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.090 
just like this mini ITX design I think
they're<00:02:29.520> pretty<00:02:29.760> cool-looking<00:02:30.709> all<00:02:31.709> right<00:02:31.950> so

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
they're pretty cool-looking all right so

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.940 
they're pretty cool-looking all right so
we've<00:02:32.190> got<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.310> 24-pin<00:02:33.090> power<00:02:33.150> up<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.410> and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
we've got a 24-pin power up here and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.240 
we've got a 24-pin power up here and
we've<00:02:35.069> got<00:02:35.310> two<00:02:35.870> ddr3<00:02:36.870> slot<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.040> actually

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
we've got two ddr3 slot so it actually

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.630 
we've got two ddr3 slot so it actually
will<00:02:38.790> support<00:02:39.440> 16<00:02:40.440> gigs<00:02:40.800> each<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.489> could

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
will support 16 gigs each so you could

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.920 
will support 16 gigs each so you could
get<00:02:41.760> 32<00:02:42.480> gigs<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.610> should<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:45.000> desire<00:02:45.540> on

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
get 32 gigs if you should so desire on

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.960 
get 32 gigs if you should so desire on
this<00:02:46.200> motherboard<00:02:46.560> which<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.250> pretty

this motherboard which is pretty

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.390 
this motherboard which is pretty
overkill<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:48.569> an<00:02:48.840> ITX<00:02:49.319> but<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:49.800> cool

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
overkill for an ITX but it's cool

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.840 
overkill for an ITX but it's cool
nonetheless<00:02:51.380> okay<00:02:52.380> we've<00:02:52.530> got<00:02:52.709> some<00:02:52.850> let's

that<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.510> our<00:02:58.319> speaker<00:02:58.890> connector<00:02:59.610> there<00:03:00.150> then

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
that is our speaker connector there then

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.880 
that is our speaker connector there then
we<00:03:01.200> have<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:02.180> chassis<00:03:03.180> fan<00:03:03.690> right<00:03:04.260> here<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.769> is

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
we have a chassis fan right here that is

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.770 
we have a chassis fan right here that is
a<00:03:05.040> four<00:03:05.370> pin<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:06.150> our<00:03:06.299> front<00:03:06.569> panel

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
a four pin that our front panel

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.979 
a four pin that our front panel
connectors<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.739> then<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.670> end<00:03:08.910> up<00:03:09.090> with<00:03:09.360> seven

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
connectors and then we end up with seven

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.890 
connectors and then we end up with seven
SATA<00:03:10.920> 3<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.760> just<00:03:12.299> awesome<00:03:12.480> this

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
SATA 3 so that is just awesome this

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.990 
SATA 3 so that is just awesome this
thing<00:03:13.110> would<00:03:13.290> work<00:03:13.320> great<00:03:13.769> even<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.820> like<00:03:14.970> a

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
thing would work great even in like a

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.180 
thing would work great even in like a
