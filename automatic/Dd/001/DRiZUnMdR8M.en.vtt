Q<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.349> feel<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> episodes<00:02:18.730> are<00:02:18.879> a

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
Q I feel like that the episodes are a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.610 
Q I feel like that the episodes are a
little<00:02:19.060> bit<00:02:19.239> longer<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.870> as<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.019> result<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
little bit longer and as a result the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.470 
little bit longer and as a result the
development<00:02:21.220> doesn't<00:02:21.519> feel<00:02:21.730> ready<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.360> know

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
development doesn't feel ready to know

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.960 
development doesn't feel ready to know
you<00:02:22.629> and<00:02:22.959> all<00:02:23.200> are<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:23.500> Josie<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.579> is<00:02:24.790> like

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.360 
perfect for you for you and your dhoti
Peas<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:28.060> can<00:02:28.239> decide<00:02:28.629> who's<00:02:29.049> gay<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.250> your

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
Peas you can decide who's gay so your

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.000 
Peas you can decide who's gay so your
Japanese<00:02:33.790> words<00:02:34.060> today<00:02:34.389> are<00:02:34.720> October<00:02:35.680> but

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
Japanese words today are October but

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.879 
Japanese words today are October but
that<00:02:36.160> means<00:02:36.430> high<00:02:37.000> or<00:02:37.510> tall<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:38.650> since

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
that means high or tall and so since

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.500 
that means high or tall and so since
it's<00:02:39.069> a<00:02:39.130> negative<00:02:39.639> when<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.880> conjugate<00:02:40.150> it

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
it's a negative when you conjugate it

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.960 
it's a negative when you conjugate it
with<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.750> verb<00:02:41.079> it<00:02:41.410> would<00:02:41.560> change<00:02:41.829> to<00:02:41.920> good<00:02:42.519> so

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
with a verb it would change to good so

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.390 
with a verb it would change to good so
it's<00:02:43.150> doable<00:02:44.049> anyway<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.620> think<00:02:44.739> that's<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.250> for

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
it's doable anyway I think that's it for

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.139 
it's doable anyway I think that's it for
me<00:02:45.519> I'll<00:02:45.730> talk<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.239> later<00:02:46.269> bye<00:02:46.750> bye
