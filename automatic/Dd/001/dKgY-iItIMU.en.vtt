Sony<00:00:19.340> II<00:00:20.260> I'm<00:00:21.260> sorry<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.650> Sony<00:00:21.860> a7<00:00:23.380> mark<00:00:24.380> two

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
Sony II I'm sorry the Sony a7 mark two

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.560 
Sony II I'm sorry the Sony a7 mark two
so<00:00:25.789> you<00:00:25.850> can<00:00:26.000> see<00:00:26.390> it<00:00:27.320> racks<00:00:27.680> back<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:28.279> forth

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
so you can see it racks back and forth

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.529 
so you can see it racks back and forth
slowly<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:30.230> incrementally<00:00:31.210> kind<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:32.300> creeps

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
slowly and incrementally kind of creeps

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:40.540 
slowly and incrementally kind of creeps
its<00:00:32.750> way<00:00:35.769> it's<00:00:36.769> not<00:00:37.579> fast<00:00:39.280> when<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:40.339> stretch

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
its way it's not fast when you stretch

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.329 
its way it's not fast when you stretch
the<00:00:40.729> imagination<00:00:42.100> but<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:43.579> gets<00:00:43.819> there

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.410 

sometimes<00:00:49.339> I'm<00:00:49.489> finding<00:00:49.879> that<00:00:49.909> it<00:00:50.239> actually

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
sometimes I'm finding that it actually

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.079 
sometimes I'm finding that it actually
will<00:00:50.929> completely<00:00:51.589> miss<00:00:52.629> autofocus<00:00:53.629> and<00:00:55.089> won't

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
will completely miss autofocus and won't

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.000 
will completely miss autofocus and won't
confirm<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:57.019> just<00:00:57.260> kind<00:00:57.379> of<00:00:57.440> sits<00:00:57.679> there<00:00:57.769> out

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
confirm and just kind of sits there out

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.410 
confirm and just kind of sits there out
of<00:00:58.039> focus<00:00:58.309> will<00:00:58.639> still<00:00:58.879> let<00:00:58.999> you<00:00:59.120> take<00:00:59.299> the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
of focus will still let you take the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.660 
of focus will still let you take the
shot<00:01:02.829> but<00:01:03.829> as<00:01:03.979> you<00:01:04.070> can<00:01:04.159> see<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:04.519> takes

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
shot but as you can see it takes

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.960 
shot but as you can see it takes
probably<00:01:04.940> a<00:01:05.239> good<00:01:05.479> 5<00:01:06.020> seconds<00:01:06.619> per<00:01:06.830> round<00:01:07.250> or

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
probably a good 5 seconds per round or

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:16.830 
probably a good 5 seconds per round or
so<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:09.380> actually<00:01:09.770> achieve<00:01:10.070> focus<00:01:10.660> so<00:01:11.660> I

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.230 

wouldn't<00:01:17.840> be<00:01:17.960> expecting<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.560> have<00:01:19.240> high-end

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
wouldn't be expecting to have high-end

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.680 
wouldn't be expecting to have high-end
super<00:01:21.230> fast<00:01:21.680> autofocus<00:01:22.220> performance<00:01:23.120> when

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
super fast autofocus performance when

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.780 
super fast autofocus performance when
using<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.290> meta<00:01:24.560> bones<00:01:24.770> adapter<00:01:25.190> but<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:25.670> be

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
using the meta bones adapter but to be

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.810 
using the meta bones adapter but to be
fair<00:01:25.970> they<00:01:26.870> actually<00:01:27.350> mentioned<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:28.130> on

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
fair they actually mentioned that on

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.490 
fair they actually mentioned that on
their<00:01:29.180> website<00:01:29.890> so<00:01:31.450> not<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.480> perfect<00:01:32.990> solution

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
their website so not a perfect solution

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.820 
their website so not a perfect solution
but<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:34.610> workable<00:01:35.030> solution<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.140> honestly<00:01:36.710> as

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
but a workable solution and honestly as

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.950 
but a workable solution and honestly as
you<00:01:36.860> can<00:01:37.130> see<00:01:37.370> if<00:01:37.520> we're<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.760> switch<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.270> manual

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
you can see if we're to switch to manual

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.160 
you can see if we're to switch to manual
focus<00:01:39.200> here<00:01:39.740> real<00:01:39.920> quick<00:01:40.720> focus<00:01:41.720> peaking<00:01:41.900> is

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
focus here real quick focus peaking is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.400 
focus here real quick focus peaking is
pretty<00:01:42.500> awesome<00:01:42.980> and<00:01:43.730> actually<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.480> lot
