00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.430
 new technology you want video 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.550
 today it's all about the new one 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.469
 amazon kindle paper white I have one 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.900
 came out me excited as the part 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.280
 is not because I think this could be 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 it may be a bad one 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.390
 device act no quite the contrary 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.310
 I 'm assuming that the part 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.600
 reasonable and of course I will 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.000
 that too in the next few days and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.279
 weeks on heart and kidney test 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.380
 but just before the new PV far 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.840
 I had come out for me 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.719
 my vacation a wickedly expensive 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.239
 kindle voyage bought and why i have 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.040
 bought me because of the 300 ppi 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.750
 of course, even against two 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.290
 other features but primarily 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.610
 because I test the 300 ppi display 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.100
 wanted and especially with mine 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.100
 wanted to compare old paperport im 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.930
 holiday so and what is now amazon 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.050
 the new paper mate you came out 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.289
 can you think exactly with a 300? 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.120
 ppi display 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.340
 well ok now I have here too 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.719
 slammed because I have something 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.210
 one does not say happiness in misfortune like that 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.520
 really the videos has my base 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.150
 unfortunately a pixel error goes back 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.610
 at amazon but I already had or 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.799
 Amazon already gave me a new ride 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.390
 Called caught boiled 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.530
 someone strongly believe that I have the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.650
 will sell 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.720
 and for the coal well then jump 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.729
 now the paperboy out with me and me 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.350
 of course I'm very eager in the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.390
 next day also with my 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.579
 compare old castle and still 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.110
 with the old paperworld generation 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.920
 There you can get a grip on a lot 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.770
 do 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.600
 But now we look purely like that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.729
 Packaging as normal 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.759
 amazon starts again when paid 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.189
 have a blue lettering on the sides 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.840
 we nothing and on the back there are 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.210
 then the information English German German 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.070
 German display with 300 ppi with 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.560
 integrated self-regulating front 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.939
 light in sunlight readable huge 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.890
 Pick space for 1000 books long 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.710
 battery life blablabla it concerns 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.259
 with her around those like the wifi 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.630
 version so the wlan version with 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.300
 advertising for 119 euros, I now have the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.000
 cheapest variant taken and whole 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.010
 Honestly 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.630
 3g is not needed everywhere 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.950
 Wlan in the world for emergency in Germany 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.540
 you also have your smartphone for hot 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.520
 spot so 3g at kindle I see 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.900
 no longer what I am 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.540
 it's a pity that is 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.360
 amazon well here 20 euro difference 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.190
 makes so now do they make it 20 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.590
 cheaper for you advertising 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.690
 of course this is cheese entirely 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.830
 honest with youtube or other 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.390
 Serving over advertising 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.080
 I do not have any problem financing that 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.970
 but at Amazon their coal over it 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.050
 make you books about amazon 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.880
 Selling 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.050
 I think that such an advertising rail 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.510
 Honestly, in my opinion 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.890
 inappropriate so and therefore what 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.209
 shall I see it not a 20 euro 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.700
 to spend more on that 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.560
 So for 119 euro the cheapest 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.930
 variant 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.360
 and now we'll open it 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.140
 Open open and I expect yes here 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.300
 no surprise but good Amazon 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.250
 standard food stainless packaging 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.280
 if you know how it turns out that way 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.680
 rum and ta ta ta ta ta ta again in 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.489
 kept blue with the tree and the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.370
 child underneath 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.650
 we bring the kids out yes here is 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.450
 You definitely will see that again 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.890
 if you read all the time now 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.380
 has one right here 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.209
 reminds very strongly of the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.830
 Predecessor very very clear 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.690
 and the interesting thing is through that 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.489
 bigger display or the display with the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.230
 higher resolution is the thing yes me 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.880
 think 20 grams heavier 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.950
 At least that's a good thing 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.470
 chocolate bar at the first moment I would 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.660
 say we give them a short break 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.239
 page and see what else we have 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.970
 we have a thick black 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.500
 handbook german english how to judge 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.549
 we use it or usb cable 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.320
 turn it on and that's it and then 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.320
 here's the guarantee again 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.480
 Guide in a thousand languages and us 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.299
 Just have our charger back 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.040
 typical usb on micro usb is there 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.820
 nothing no big surprise no 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.890
 charger 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.660
 but honestly the kindles one 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.100
 few hours to the normal usb port 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.450
 and that's enough to get back so that the 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.310
 throughout the month 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.900
 so that 's it with the packaging 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.500
 otherwise there is nothing in it 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.859
 and now I'm looking forward to that 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.500
 feeling of the 93 100 ppb parts in the 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.240
 because honestly I said it 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.710
 I do not want to like the corners 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.759
 reminds me too much of the fire tablet 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.979
 from Amazon 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:37.900
 and now I am really happy 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.650
 a biscuit because this back here so 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.930
 easy a gentle no a gentle one 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.340
 velvety back is the feeling 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.340
 very nice and especially everywhere 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.669
 These round pages are about all that pleases 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.669
 me 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.039
 That's a strong reminder, though 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.629
 it was not quite the case with Grohe and here 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.680
 here always directly see the comparison there 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.349
 her here it is only 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.900
 it is still black here 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.789
 painted so to speak and of course 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.139
 be that my old paper far now 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.150
 a bit worn is here 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.949
 did not feel so smooth anymore 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.199
 and not so gentle me too 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.599
 a bit more rubbery while it is 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.800
 in which at the new then I want 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.060
 do not say everything will be future 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.550
 but probably also be rubber 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.779
 new children yes that's a nice one 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.919
 I like that feeling 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:25.900
 by lengths better than this angular one 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.940
 back this angular then rather 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.500
 a plastic reminiscent back of the 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.969
 bridge completely honest and above all 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.250
 without these shiny antennas 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.719
 recesses on the back on the 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.069
 front page will of course now again 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.509
 clearly we have now will the 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.310
 notch or the 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.520
 Admission of the display to me again 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.039
 edge as well as the old child was the 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.139
 yes, the advantage of board the iss give 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.839
 the front of the glass plate once 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.520
 Everything goes and you notice nothing 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:53.259
 so now you could of course 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.969
 but think well if both now 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:58.360
 the beuth and the new pepper 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:01.110
 White both have this 300 ppi display 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.060
 why should one then for the btc 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.979
 Pay 190 euros and 120 just for the 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:10.270
 paper far because the ball is still two 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:12.039
 Additional features, and that is me 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.620
 have extra buttons on each side to 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.240
 scroll back and forth 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.409
 Pepper White does not have to go here 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.699
 I still press the display 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:20.710
 as we are used to 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.770
 and while both hold such a 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.210
 integrated brightness resp 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.650
 have a backlight that 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.500
 you can read in the dark without 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.959
 additional light source I have to at 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.860
 always set the page by hand and 

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:35.530
 adjust 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.330
 while the world is here on the top left 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.770
 brightness sensor has and that 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.539
 to regulate automatically 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.430
 But I have to say that honestly 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.080
 have described it in detail in the video 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.240
 that has more bad for me right 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.469
 So that worked that was nothing that was 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.210
 I must have always from the hand 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:51.009
 readjusted so I see that at all 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.379
 So there I do not see the advantage 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.210
 that's why I'm really happy now 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:57.430
 very much on the volt and yes quite 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.719
 honest again on the paper yet 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.430
 this light one 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:01.960
 weight difference you can tell 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.650
 me now but I'm just now 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.270
 really one 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.529
 the thing with it hard and before 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.020
 Everything the food is also heavier food 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:10.439
 but wanted so I have to say 200 grams 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.210
 Two thumbs of chocolate 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:14.500
 Of course I will test and each one 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.120
 read a lot with the part 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.680
 that should now but with the first 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.539
 Thank you very much for being the first video 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.139
 It looks good and to see 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.139
 next video
