00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
think outside the box like what is it

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.460 
think outside the box like what is it
something<00:04:17.209> that<00:04:17.239> we<00:04:17.390> can<00:04:17.419> that<00:04:17.930> we<00:04:18.109> want<00:04:18.380> to

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
something that we can that we want to

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.589 
something that we can that we want to
predict<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:19.519> opposite<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:20.090> like<00:04:20.329> cuz<00:04:20.510> it

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
predict the opposite of that like cuz it

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:21.729 
predict the opposite of that like cuz it
with<00:04:20.720> Toriyama<00:04:21.109> has<00:04:21.260> just<00:04:21.440> been<00:04:21.530> so

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
with Toriyama has just been so

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.529 
with Toriyama has just been so
unpredictable<00:04:21.890> but<00:04:22.729> everything<00:04:23.090> is<00:04:23.210> done<00:04:23.419> and

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
unpredictable but everything is done and

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.000 
unpredictable but everything is done and
I<00:04:23.630> feel<00:04:23.660> like<00:04:23.990> anything<00:04:24.380> that<00:04:24.530> we<00:04:24.620> think<00:04:24.919> is
