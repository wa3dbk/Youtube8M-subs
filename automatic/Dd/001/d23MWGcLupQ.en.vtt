 surely hello I'm german in minecraft 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.219
 because that name I do not want to invite to 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.920
 nobody I do not want to invite hello I'm 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.870
 german nor on any other channel 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.350
 simply 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.029

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.119

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.460

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.649

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.789

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.440

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.239
 I intend to get any subscriber neither 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.679
 nothing with this video I just do it 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.649
 because I like it and it seemed like a 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.449
 good idea to start such a good series 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.220
 first of all let's reproduce what 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.980
 that would be a normal life in minecraft 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.360
 the first time you enter the game you 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.640
 realize that it appears is a village 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.250
 What is it that you are rich? 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.750
 robbing the villagers enter the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.580
 village and you find goals that you 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.690
 they would come to you perfectly for 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.390
 resist the hard night 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.300
 from minecraft you start to remove them all 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.210
 perfect you are rich you start to search 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.650
 through the village you see a well you do not throw away 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.930
 afraid after giving a few laps 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.030
 you enter this house that has the bean 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.630
 you think you can never take it from 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.950
 welcome as and enter you are rich you have a 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.840
 bunch of objects you see that 10 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.180
 minecraft is very short and you start 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.550
 run to chop the stone and make yourself 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.200
 a house under a mountain follows 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.420
 explaining in your dark and damp cave 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.010
 until you find your first mineral 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.860
 if your first mineral and the most important 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.290
 the coal because this will allow you 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.710
 light up your house after finishing your 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.850
 house well hidden under earth you go 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.850
 direct to a tree 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.870
 you're running to your house before 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.670
 It runs the day to make your table 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.610
 estero your first crafter table or your 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.500
 first house you look through 20 websites until 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.300
 You find the way to make the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.430
 refined they put it as well as the 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.860
 constant and the work table comes out 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.170
 you put your table of character or in the area 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.300
 darkest of your cave and you make your first 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.360
 stone oven that you on the stone 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.810
 everywhere but you do not make yourself one 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.520
 you make yourself two makes you smil because you think 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.350
 that by having more ovens you're going to do the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.510
 things a lot faster when an oven 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.700
 just all things make their first 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.020
 chest and you do not have like space for 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.050
 your cold cv that you have filled all of 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.480
 oven so you're going to remove 12 and you're going to 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.670
 put your damn chest there you will save 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.400
 absolutely everything you have except 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.010
 a peak and you're going to start applying in 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.870
 vertically completely as you see it does not 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.790
 they have light you go back up with the same 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.280
 stone that you have chosen and you are going to do 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.440
 some torches beginner error 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.420

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.590
 create torches but it does not leave you follow 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.540
 internet browsing until 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.370
 You find this search that makes you stick 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.310
 to 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.530

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.519
 you are making holes to illuminate 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.549
 the area you find more minerals like 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.260
 coal and iron which you can sin 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.629
 with the iron peak begins at 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.310
 listen to a sound like water you think 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.890

 the surface and you find more lava than 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.260
 you do not know how to cover because you can not find the 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.209

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.579
 cave in which he can not continue 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.209
 you try to go through the lava to get there 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.209
 on the other side 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.269
