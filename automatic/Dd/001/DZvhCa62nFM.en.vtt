00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.680 
and I think if you can paint the pretty
stuff<00:04:12.410> but<00:04:12.590> also<00:04:12.830> paint<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.760> scary<00:04:14.120> stuff<00:04:14.420> too

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
stuff but also paint the scary stuff too

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.449 
stuff but also paint the scary stuff too

the<00:04:16.549> middle<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.239> can<00:04:17.390> say<00:04:17.570> yes<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.200> more

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
the middle and you can say yes to more

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.890 
the middle and you can say yes to more
jobs<00:04:18.770> and

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900
