00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.130
 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection Mobile Suit Gundam f 91 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:13.670
 Gun tank r 44 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.840
 The gun tank r 44 is the latest type of gun in the anime Mobile Suit Gundam f 91 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.270
 It's a tank 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:24.230
 Director of the War Museum of Frontier 4 which is virtually the last gun of the Universe century 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.120
 It ended up as it is hidden successfully'll get Jung is in or what kettle 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.930
 At that time I was 44 so r 44 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:34.620
 When it's transparent, I don't read the gun tank in a play. 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:39.490
 It's a variable mobile suit developed by a considerable formula project 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:44.200
 It is expected to be only 10 meters tall and only half of Jegan . 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:48.490
 The unique tank form of sticking out while standing with both legs extended is 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:53.200
 It is a good technique of the rider g 7's and rider Beagle since Kunio Okawara teacher 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:56.230
 It takes the same kind of tanks form also at one's side of ZAFT to appear in Gundam seed in Chinami 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.480
 I think- on the classification in the formula project 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:04.580
 Gun tank seems to be f 5 series Gundam is f 9 c 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:08.960
 In the play that is Leeds , the main character Seabook Annord has used it instead 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:14.570
 Coloring which may be said to be a protagonist in the first half is a mobile that appears in f 91 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:19.100
 That's the proof of being the most Gundam-like in the suit, but when it appears in the movie hey 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.500
 Bukkake the older, dilapidated that I tea drink how'm was the aircraft without let go if it is to rupture 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.340
 Craft 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.480
 If you receive a quick enema is dead I'm dead in a roll to Seabook friend Arthur 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.640
 Well then 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.640
 At this time, Sea book murmured Tada' Teyoa Zaa Nandaze 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.050
 One word is one of Gundam's sayings 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.040
 On the way to Spaceport , it is likely to be verticalized by the federal army . 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.130
 Tane In the comic bonbon version of the cartoon or hit the g Cannon with a punch 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.280
 In the end I try to rescue Cecily 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.659
 It was completely broken in the shot lanser of Berga Dallas 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.719
 Sea book also was shot with a gun to the Tsang inferior ass 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.079
 Nde was I was not to escape to drop-off the Guntank 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.060
 ｰｰｰｰ that with a blood Sea book at the end died in cockpit 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.330
 Another Is the Cecily has had misunderstood the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.330
 You fool's 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.800
 By the way, it was a kit, but the price at that time was 600 yen 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:10.700
 It is a surprisingly popular aircraft in the f91 plastic model series. 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.380
 The main part of the first half is thin and cute coloring like Gundam 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:19.319
 In those days'm what has been variously called at that time Toka play cheap and best series 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:23.430
 There was an allergic reaction to the setting of the small mobile suit. 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:27.629
 I felt everyone fairly physical disorder feeling I'm buy everyone expected of cross bones 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.920
 It seems that coloring was not sober, but it was natural that it was sober 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.409
 It's kinda 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.920
 Remodeling point is healed somehow just by assembling normally in a spare gunpla this time 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.150
 Say 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.340
 There are occasional gunpla like surme like this kit is definitely that 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.340
 Day 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.110
 Maybe I think one 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:50.140
 If you think it's a lie, try and buy as many as you make 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.140
 I so as not to Mitsukan to say you of not a family if decorate
