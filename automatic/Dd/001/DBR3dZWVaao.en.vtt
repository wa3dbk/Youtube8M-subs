00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.740 
bit early I had this on Monday a day
before<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.639> game<00:00:14.790> came<00:00:15.030> out<00:00:15.179> gotta<00:00:15.420> put<00:00:15.630> some

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
good amount of time into it but for a

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.460 
good amount of time into it but for a
game<00:00:18.150> that's<00:00:18.330> been<00:00:18.570> told<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.170> know<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
game that's been told that you know the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.140 
game that's been told that you know the
the<00:00:19.740> main<00:00:19.920> story<00:00:20.250> along<00:00:20.520> with<00:00:20.550> everything<00:00:20.939> in

figured that I'd hold my opinion off a
little<00:00:25.590> bit<00:00:25.890> until<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.029> got<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.449> hang<00:00:27.720> of

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
little bit until I got the hang of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.589 
little bit until I got the hang of
everything<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.269> really<00:00:30.269> started<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
everything and really started to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.120 
everything and really started to
understand<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> game<00:00:31.349> kind<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:31.920> where<00:00:32.040> it

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
understand the game kind of see where it

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.700 
understand the game kind of see where it
was<00:00:32.189> getting<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.020> what<00:00:34.020> my<00:00:34.170> overall

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
was getting at and what my overall

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.040 
was getting at and what my overall
