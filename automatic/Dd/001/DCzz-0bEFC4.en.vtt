00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 only limbo I looked at what 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.760
 youtube and uses in Google 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.469
 popular video how to cause nights and 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.929
 there is basically a scam that is it 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.250
 cause they say no you spent there 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.640
 time but do all the bullshit 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.439
 but still I will tell you what to call because 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.390
 that it can be called let's start but 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.580
 so that we just call it to us 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:33.590
 will need an egg an egg called 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.590
 urge creature night we just 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.880
 part of it we poke and we appear 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.790
 night yes true he makes sounds like zombies 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.920
 but you think nothing i textures 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:57.860
 cheated because you see even him 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:57.860
 hands hang and if you kill him 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.490
 so they suggest that I eat him falls 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.479
 diamond well and as many may have noticed 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:14.380
 that I caused the night using a mod mod under 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.810
 name and the night of version 162 link to 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.360
 The mod will be in the description and this mod includes 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.300
 also many different ones for example 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.780
 ghost night i wave honestly ender 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.450
 a lot of creeper if there is a night creeper 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:34.149
 nights even weather night there is also this 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:37.390
 mod includes many new ingots here 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.100
 also some staffs this causes 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:46.030
 fire or I don't know what this one does 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:48.700
 probably the devil world and paradise 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.649
 that is, it looks like this triple in 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.580
 he will not go and that's it 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.899
 devil world teleport devil world from hell 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:05.289
 it differs only in the fact that there are places 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:07.470
 Hell's stone is such a hellish 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.470
 brick 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.000
 and also many weapons added here 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.210
 I like this here more 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.870
 just another damage that's what it gives us 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:24.680
 night view at minute 40 and here it is 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.190
 slender platoon whose 54 damage and pineapple 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.370
 I teleport that is to throw there these 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.820
 I also like to add here 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.840
 a new sandwich and more and more 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:43.610
 nothing added but so so very 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:48.800
