00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
in the distance building something cows

but this is the best thing that guy in
my<00:00:34.500> world<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.890> far<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.309> because<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
my world so far just because of the

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
my world so far just because of the
circuitry<00:00:37.140> I'm<00:00:37.290> not<00:00:37.440> very<00:00:37.620> good<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:38.210> circuits

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
circuitry I'm not very good at circuits

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.990 
circuitry I'm not very good at circuits
on<00:00:39.329> stuff<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.809> was<00:00:39.870> pretty<00:00:40.079> proud<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.590> so

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
on stuff so I was pretty proud of it so

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.459 
on stuff so I was pretty proud of it so
then<00:00:42.000> let's<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.480> take<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> look<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.170> truck

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
then let's go take a look this truck

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.430 
then let's go take a look this truck
just<00:00:43.500> goes<00:00:43.829> back<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.190> my<00:00:44.280> spawn<00:00:44.610> base<00:00:45.289> which<00:00:46.289> is

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
just goes back to my spawn base which is

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.979 
just goes back to my spawn base which is
um<00:00:46.620> over<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:47.280> somewhere<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.840> is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
um over there somewhere and then this is

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.139 
um over there somewhere and then this is
just<00:00:49.170> my<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.680> my<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:50.399> base<00:00:50.730> that's<00:00:51.000> got

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
just my little my little base that's got

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.360 
just my little my little base that's got
um<00:00:52.309> underground<00:00:53.309> stuff<00:00:53.579> oh<00:00:54.949> yes<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> what

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
um underground stuff oh yes this is what

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.090 
um underground stuff oh yes this is what
we<00:00:56.489> looking<00:00:56.940> guys<00:00:57.180> today<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.289> D<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.739> would

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
we looking guys today it is D I would

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.470 
we looking guys today it is D I would
have<00:00:59.190> called<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> Sam<00:00:59.760> base<00:00:59.969> station

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
have called it a Sam base station

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.110 
have called it a Sam base station
because<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.079> called<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.440> son<00:01:01.710> base<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.219> this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
because I called that son base and this

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.840 
because I called that son base and this
is<00:01:03.180> obviously<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> station<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.729> let's<00:01:05.729> go

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
is obviously the station so let's go

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.460 
is obviously the station so let's go
inside<00:01:10.130> this<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.490> slightly<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:13.229> neat

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
inside this is just slightly in the neat

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.039 
inside this is just slightly in the neat
part<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.030> way<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> works<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.630> these

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
part of it so the way it works is these

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.679 
part of it so the way it works is these
here<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.590> lot<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.580> destination<00:01:18.210> choices<00:01:18.600> are

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
here a lot of destination choices are

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.999 
here a lot of destination choices are
still<00:01:18.869> need<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> put<00:01:19.170> signs<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:19.950> is

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
still need to put signs on but this is

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.080 
still need to put signs on but this is
the<00:01:20.130> only<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> works<00:01:20.700> at<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:20.970> moment

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the only one the works at the moment

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.010 
the only one the works at the moment
because<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:23.450> it's<00:01:24.450> all<00:01:24.630> wired<00:01:24.840> up

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
because it's that one it's all wired up

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.880 
because it's that one it's all wired up
under<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.409> floor<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.810> then<00:01:27.810> them<00:01:28.439> switches

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
under the floor and then them switches

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
under the floor and then them switches
activate<00:01:29.310> these<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.970> these<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.150> switch<00:01:30.479> sides

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
activate these so these are switch sides

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.120 
activate these so these are switch sides
a<00:01:31.700> sense<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.119> switches<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.130> won't

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
a sense I for switches that one I won't

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.499 
a sense I for switches that one I won't
turn<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:35.970> facing<00:01:36.240> that

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
turn there because that's facing that

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.670 
turn there because that's facing that
way<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.689> I'll<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:36.930> keep<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.200> over<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
way so I'll just keep going over and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.640 
way so I'll just keep going over and
then<00:01:37.860> I'll<00:01:37.979> turn<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.170> how<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.409> part

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
then I'll turn so that's how that part

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.480 
then I'll turn so that's how that part
works<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:42.659> bit<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.619> second<00:01:44.100> bits<00:01:44.280> this

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
works and this bit the second bits this

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.219 
works and this bit the second bits this
is<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.850> when<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.000> track<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.600> car<00:01:45.810> comes<00:01:46.049> back

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
is for when the track the car comes back

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.120 
is for when the track the car comes back
in<00:01:46.439> it'll<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.770> go<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.070> way<00:01:47.780> over<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:49.130> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
in it'll just go that way over here to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.969 
in it'll just go that way over here to
this<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:51.320> then<00:01:52.320> once<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.560> get<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> car

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
this and then once you get out the car

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.760 
this and then once you get out the car
you'll<00:01:53.729> activate<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.270> Reds<00:01:54.450> TM<00:01:54.840> booster

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
you'll activate the Reds TM booster

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.139 
you'll activate the Reds TM booster
track<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.509> then<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.659> will<00:01:57.780> also<00:01:57.960> activate

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
track and then that will also activate

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.819 
track and then that will also activate
that's<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.299> turn<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> split<00:02:01.380> second<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
that's a turn so for a split second the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.590 
that's a turn so for a split second the
car<00:02:02.009> has<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> chance<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.640> go<00:02:02.759> up<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.240> which

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
car has a chance to go up to here which

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.590 
car has a chance to go up to here which
is<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.869> PEZ<00:02:04.049> dispenser<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:06.149> I'll<00:02:06.299> show<00:02:06.509> you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
on that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.450 
on that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
it and so this is the Pez dispensers

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.680 
it and so this is the Pez dispensers
using<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.620> new<00:02:19.710> trapdoors<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.910> it's

using the new trapdoors and it's

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.020 
using the new trapdoors and it's
basically<00:02:22.020> working<00:02:22.320> boy<00:02:22.680> if<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.640> would<00:02:23.760> get<00:02:23.940> in

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
basically working boy if I would get in

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.020 
basically working boy if I would get in
that<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.600> press<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.230> button<00:02:25.500> there<00:02:26.030> there

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
that and press that button there there

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.880 
that and press that button there there
that<00:02:27.720> cart<00:02:27.990> will<00:02:28.080> shoot<00:02:28.320> off<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.740> go<00:02:28.830> to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
that cart will shoot off and go to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.530 
that cart will shoot off and go to
wherever<00:02:29.130> people<00:02:29.490> on<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.060> way<00:02:30.180> around<00:02:30.390> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
wherever people on the way around it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.410 
wherever people on the way around it
will<00:02:30.630> hit<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:30.990> earth<00:02:31.170> detector<00:02:31.680> rail<00:02:32.420> which

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
will hit this earth detector rail which

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.450 
will hit this earth detector rail which
activate<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.020> redstone<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.740> then<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.340> way

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
activate this redstone and then the way

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.070 
activate this redstone and then the way
these<00:02:35.610> towards<00:02:36.000> itself<00:02:36.330> there's<00:02:36.630> one<00:02:36.810> just

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
these towards itself there's one just

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.500 
these towards itself there's one just
there<00:02:37.820> way<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:38.850> think<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.270> see<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.450> this

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
there way I think you can see it this

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.600 
there way I think you can see it this
sword<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:39.930> there<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.980> can<00:02:41.130> probably<00:02:41.400> see

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
sword just there you can probably see

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.970 
sword just there you can probably see
underneath<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.150> car<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:43.050> then<00:02:43.560> over<00:02:43.800> there

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
underneath that car and then over there

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.949 
underneath that car and then over there
and<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.370> creates<00:02:44.850> like<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> short<00:02:45.300> pulse<00:02:45.540> that

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
and it creates like a short pulse that

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.320 
and it creates like a short pulse that
opens<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.530> closes<00:02:46.740> out<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.190> fast<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
opens and closes out really fast and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.160 
opens and closes out really fast and
dropping<00:02:48.750> one<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.020> these<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.650> they'll<00:02:50.040> go

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
dropping one of these and they'll go

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.520 
dropping one of these and they'll go
actually<00:02:52.170> let<00:02:52.290> me<00:02:52.350> press<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.680> board<00:02:54.530> there

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
actually let me press the board there

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.380 
actually let me press the board there
you<00:02:55.590> go

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
you go

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.680 
you go
and<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:58.560> one<00:02:58.680> will<00:02:58.830> go<00:02:58.950> wherever<00:03:02.540> they<00:03:03.540> let

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
and that one will go wherever they let

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.620 
and that one will go wherever they let
me<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:03.900> put<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.140> back<00:03:04.350> here<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:09.120> an<00:03:09.480> outer

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
me just put this back here and an outer

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.699 
me just put this back here and an outer
reload<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.170> then<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.280> reason<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.530> like

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
reload and then the reason this is like

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.560 
reload and then the reason this is like
that<00:03:14.010> annex<00:03:14.190> which<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.580> real<00:03:14.790> quick<00:03:14.940> is

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
that annex which is real quick is

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.449 
that annex which is real quick is
because<00:03:15.959> safe<00:03:16.230> there's<00:03:16.830> another<00:03:17.070> car<00:03:17.340> on

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
because safe there's another car on

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.100 
because safe there's another car on
there<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.790> then<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.030> odd<00:03:18.269> for<00:03:18.720> some<00:03:18.840> reason

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
there and then that odd for some reason

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.900 
there and then that odd for some reason
put<00:03:19.260> another<00:03:19.470> one<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:20.580> would<00:03:20.760> come

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
put another one on it would come

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.610 
put another one on it would come
straight<00:03:21.030> back<00:03:21.239> down<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.989> then<00:03:22.290> over<00:03:22.410> here

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
straight back down and then over here

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.009 
straight back down and then over here
into<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.160> room<00:03:23.430> which<00:03:23.549> is<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.760> air<00:03:24.060> is

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
into this room which is the air is

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.229 
into this room which is the air is
basically<00:03:25.350> an<00:03:25.500> overflow<00:03:25.980> room<00:03:26.160> which<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.549> I'll

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
basically an overflow room which is I'll

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.470 
basically an overflow room which is I'll
show<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.780> real<00:03:27.959> quickly

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
show you real quickly

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:38.120 
show you real quickly
that's<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.660> maintenance<00:03:31.110> hatch

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.260 

so<00:03:39.130> that<00:03:39.340> valorem<00:03:39.970> thing<00:03:40.540> goes<00:03:40.750> into<00:03:41.080> here<00:03:41.320> and

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
so that valorem thing goes into here and

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.080 
so that valorem thing goes into here and
the<00:03:43.270> car<00:03:43.510> will<00:03:43.780> stay<00:03:44.560> on<00:03:44.710> there<00:03:45.090> activating

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
the car will stay on there activating

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.540 
the car will stay on there activating
the<00:03:46.180> redstone<00:03:46.540> torch<00:03:46.770> which<00:03:47.770> I<00:03:47.980> would<00:03:48.400> just

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
the redstone torch which I would just

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.340 
the redstone torch which I would just
basically<00:03:48.700> let<00:03:49.060> me<00:03:49.150> know<00:03:49.270> that<00:03:49.350> it's

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
basically let me know that it's

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.440 
basically let me know that it's
overflowed<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.070> there's<00:03:51.250> an<00:03:51.370> extra<00:03:52.210> cart

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
overflowed and there's an extra cart

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.420 
overflowed and there's an extra cart
waiting<00:03:52.750> for<00:03:52.930> me

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
waiting for me

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.510 
waiting for me
that's<00:03:54.430> basically<00:03:54.730> my<00:03:54.820> station<00:03:55.390> um<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:57.340> main

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
that's basically my station um the main

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.880 
that's basically my station um the main
reason<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:57.790> showed<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.180> grease<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:58.420> you
