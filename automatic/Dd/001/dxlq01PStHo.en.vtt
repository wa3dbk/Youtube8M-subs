00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.360
 by televen 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:26.250
 a small a soft a very thin layer 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.950
 of custard here in the eye like this 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.480
 as a contact lens 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.480
 as a butter color 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.550
 to receive a man who is a writer 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.320
 and poet whose loves at the end of the century 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.030
 they turned the perfect woman into a 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.420
 rich little thing today comes to this city 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420
 blessed 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.190
 s 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.900
 and a drone clothes 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.120
 Thank you 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:14.540
 and between so much so much novel that has 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.680
 written included this type of actions 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.270
 that look like actions on the three 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.460
 Crazy Bastian in the face has more 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.240
 the face I did not try to keep the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.240
 dignity of the spectator 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.180
 very intelligently what it means 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.180
 this program the good format in order 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.560
 we are currently in a new novel 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.649
 I am if it turns out that I'm already starting 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.330
 to write a novel that will come out for the 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.460
 next year but since the novel is 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.869
 to start them well in advance what 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.640
 is the first step that a writer give 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.990
 for to follow wherever it goes 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.970
 a good novel first is counted makes 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.880
 a year such a story two years ago the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.110
 another how do I not repeat myself because 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.640
 also the idea is not to repeat you 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.090
 bore others do not bore you 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.860
 same then define the story is 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.410
 definitely the most complicated 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.000
 because for example one that worked in 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.260
 luck is in doctor mehdi where one 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.580
 is going to tell stories that have to 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.590
 see with humor but they are short stories 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.650
 and one more less can know when 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.780
 begins and ends about 67 minutes is 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.520
 developing is history thinking about a 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.230
 idea of ​​a story that goes on 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.510
 how many months six eight months ten months 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.430
 for eight or ten months a year but 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.050
 I want to make a story that is 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.580
 so rich that have a potential as 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.680
 great that the time duration itself 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.880
 in fact one usually says you have to design 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.400
 a story that has enough 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.870
 gasoline to be a bit the image for 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.040
 all the way because the project is 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.080
 as until the great savannah equal and some 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.150
 time in some case some soap opera that 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.830
 have passed of course it says yes 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.239
 gas is out at some point 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.950
 particular because today everything 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.150
 we work with creativity what 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.100
 We write the musavi takes a ride to 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.220
 work with a work gun 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.320
 we go 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.850
 sometimes when you feel it's a 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.470
 novel is stagnant is that you feel that 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.060
 there is a mind pushing amount it 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.070
 it was without gas and there it knows how 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.990
 pushing the car to move forward if 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.690
 a lot happens you have to start to take out 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.030
 all the traps of the trade as the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.290
 flight hours you have for 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.910
 incorporate new characters for example 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.190
 those typical when suddenly enters 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.240
 someone new 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:32.310
 this is not raised is what they call 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.310
 at the time 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:53.780
 at 32 years old with strong white hair 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.280
 or are in villages rating al or leonardo 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.480
 here are the numbers of the novel 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.680
 exact night 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.010
 look you are sitting you can go for 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.010
 the channel 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.360
 that kind of thing torments you the 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.090
 harlot writer who says what 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.640
 otherwise it is a terrible lie 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.640
 alienating subject writing television is 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.920
 that you are up to now to that executioner who 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.139
 the rating and sometimes blew in favor and 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.999
 Sometimes I do not eat like all my life 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.800
 thank you I have very good people 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:27.210
 but but there is always an Augustine 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.550
 the days are waiting for it to reach 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.740
 10 o'clock in the morning the right one with the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.469
 rating has not had to go against you 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.779
 own will in some story with 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.229
 to raise the rating of a 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.939
 soap opera 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.229
 well this scene and I do not like it 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:41.669
 that character goes around but 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.620
 inevitably that is what we know 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.810
 that people wake up the morbid 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.439
 that you hear disorder betray me but 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.900
 I look for the time everyone in the 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.550
 channel believes in the other channel talking about 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.729
 any channel only of venevision 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.590
 radio caracas lyrics that are experts in 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.779
 telenovela begin I advise to give these 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.490
 these these one can not lose the 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:05.279
 control of your story because finally 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.229
 officer that you taught him and sometimes 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:10.770
 you have to line up poison her 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.300
 etcetera etcetera and know that this is how 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.919
 television like this the four-handed kids 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.909
 with the public at the bottom of the audience 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.169
 the one who decides 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.900
 I like the character I like the 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.300
 story I do not like because Carlos and 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.370
 strawberries are very clear and maybe not so much 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.370
 between writing a hypothesis 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.960
 how do I compete with this 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.960
 yes 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.360
 hoping they came out all over here 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:50.810
 no but not compete with a book that 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.970
 has such wonderful interviews 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.050
 like this did not ask you when it 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.030
 write a one-piece work for 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.580
 theater when you write a one 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.380
 movie for the cinema or a telenovela or 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.370
 up to a unit in quality television 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.680
 our gender are completely 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.150
 different to the city because why go 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.360
 more towards the theme of the telenovela in your 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.360
 case 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:14.080
 that leads to the next question 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.080
 how much money do you have? 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:36.009
 Yes sir 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:48.139
 the theme of describing and even the arena 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.149
 public of a good moment in your career 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.439
 where today she was already a character no longer 

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:53.449
 only the writer is responsible 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:54.740
 of successful soap operas but whose 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.639
 characters that people recognize nothing in 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.610
 the street when when that happened 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.680
 look at me he recognized me first a 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.860
 electrolux collector that had a 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.860
 account 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:19.150
 they began to do more interview and 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.240
 interview good people started to 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.400
 recognize makes me more visible 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.189
 you know I like it very much when the 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.159
 good people indeed people the one 

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:31.599
 he writes the novels to him with what 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:33.580
 the Venezuelan calls the foot that you 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:36.249
 recognizes on the street that seems to me 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.199
 extraordinary super rewarding 

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:40.149
 I already have enough time in that 

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:42.749
 interaction with people and good now 

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:47.309
 with the impossible has been more remarkable 

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:47.309
 because the radio the people of many 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.360
 let's talk about the book of course and 

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.800
