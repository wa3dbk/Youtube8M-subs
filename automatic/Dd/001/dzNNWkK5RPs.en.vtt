00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.280
 so today little video with a 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.080
 new fuel 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.020
 so that's a ski pole late May 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.640
 on the edges of the tracks including three for 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.580
 Corsican but it's exactly like 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.460
 bamboo can so if they had us 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.380
 bamboo does the same thing but in 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.930
 the occurrence I have no bamboo so I 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.790
 will do when I'm too fan of bamboo 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.140
 but if there is no doubt 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.480
 French speaks a lot of good scorers 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.540
 wild 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.970
 so 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.480
 where 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.400
 to own a pole 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.410
 and we scratch 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.410
 we talk about football 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.360
 here we are scratching 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.360
 the body on the appliance 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.610
 on earth 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.810
 little chips like that 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.810
 and so we do not harvest 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.650
 so the fine agent and we will take over the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.189
 video so here I picked up a little to 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.189
 pretty much like that 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.940
 I prepare my cuttlefish mayor 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.880
 normally heard a pile of wood like 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.570
 that with stuffed animals or three points of 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.570
 astros 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.190
 this time 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.190
 I believe 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.370
 the fire 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.110
 I use another 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.700
 that there only one on 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.320
 bilingualism to go a little fast 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.500
 in any case it is wooden 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.500
 the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.540
 then I use 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.899
 the knife 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.360
 here is a little more gained at 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.360
 outdoors 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.269
 There you go 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.830
 so no I did not win I thought 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.840
 that I was going to win and other heavens 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.410
 well we put the little round case there I 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.000
 not the father c 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.100
 rails 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.470
 I'm happy there I've done pretty well 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.500
 and so there is green paint 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.850
 on it but I'm just taking 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.450
 below the bar search we take a little 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.160
 we see I scratch strident what there is 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.740
 not everything to do that is not because 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.040
 that she's painting it's really the 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.770
 Well-filmed strings do not need the little ones 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.840
 chips and then it works very hard 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.959
 tabbou only once 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.260
 so here is thanks to more and I forgot 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.879
 to specify the bamboo understands not to 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.790
 they are green that is like 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.550
 brown Belgian baron interior too 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.610
 Severe it is full of water it takes 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.610
 bambouck and who is dead 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.270
 yeah 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.770
 our look on the other hand what that 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.819
 gave 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.959
 and here we are going to relax 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.959
 thank you so much this time and
