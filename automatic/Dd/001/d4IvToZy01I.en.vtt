00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.210
 hello hello all welcome one more day 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:11.390
 to the channel today I bring you a how I do 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.980
 to hide my bags that you already know 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.290
 that tells you a video of how I do 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.130
 to treat them well in this video os 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.720
 I teach how to camouflage the vouchers 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.280
 so nothing I hope you care about 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.800
 I leave with readers you will beat the 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.770
 tutorial what I'm going to use this 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.379
 correctors the monster cover of marc en 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:35.239
 the tone of w 15 because I have folds 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.980
 it makes me fold then this is the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.530
 most moisturizing concealer we have of 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.320
 moment is worth then what I do is 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.620
 always put it on the line of the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.480
 It's worth it if you see me here 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.690
 it looks with light so better mark here 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.899
 Well, if we put points of light for that 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.899
 zone 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.010
 if we leave it in that place what is going to 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.420
 achieve is the feeling that you are from 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.710
 that is more for outside 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:10.030
 It's worth the same then here 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.380
 and leave it on the site so that when 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.560
 everything is blurred it seems that the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.130
 there is no groove but what there is 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:24.100
 it's smooth skin what are you going to see I'll go 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:28.990
 blurring it with precision round 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.950
 but 82 sigma look what I'm going 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.420
 doing 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.369
 patting little by little 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.810
 little and carrying it towards the nose 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.810
 making a little triangular here 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.320
 we are going up a little bit and what I'm going 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.860
 doing is without reaching what is the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.350
 nose making a small triangle and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.259
 we are giving the area when it is already 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.150
 has extended the surplus in this area 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.340
 I put it by the ojera 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.700
 and so and 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.429
 I finish applying 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.429
 to make up my bags 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.070
 I end up hitting little touches 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.730
 to warm up and leave 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.519
 integrating everything 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.560
 and then if we want we can notify 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.690
 with some loose powder 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.020
 or let it continue to depend on how it 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.200
 want but you see when you give the light of 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.120
 front as the grooves disappear 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.690
 yes obviously if we put ourselves back 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.879
 and move from the shadows as 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.950
 they will surely appear but with the light 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.489
 in photography for example it would not be noticed 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.849
 both another option also valid would be 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:01.430
 use illuminating powders that do not 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.340
 they are too glitter solÃ­s some 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.620
 that has more that is called in fast ice or 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.160
 something like that 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.050
 A) Yes 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.240
 I do not know anything about purines, I already have it 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.430
 here put and with the same brush 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.230
 we can put a little 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.349
 in the area where the corrector was still 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.989
 bullet to light up slightly and what 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.840
 I say create the illusion that the groove 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.969
 it is outward and there is no such 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.189
 groove is worth then if we put it by 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.189
 this area will give the impression of that 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.400
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.590
 up if it's like that and nothing the same in a 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.590
 next video visited until later
