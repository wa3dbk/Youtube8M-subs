00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
like this I'm hidden as I aim down sight

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.210 
like this I'm hidden as I aim down sight
I'm<00:01:36.180> gonna<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.840> spotted<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.710> isn't<00:01:38.040> fast

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
I'm gonna be spotted so this isn't fast

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.219 
I'm gonna be spotted so this isn't fast
enough<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.000> hidden<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.450> can't<00:01:39.720> walk<00:01:39.900> like

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
enough to be hidden you can't walk like

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.929 
enough to be hidden you can't walk like
this<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.710> still<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:40.979> hidden<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.640> need<00:01:41.820> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
this and still be hidden you need to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.300 
this and still be hidden you need to
walk<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.240> slightly<00:01:42.479> faster<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.159> can

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
walk in slightly faster you can you can

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.800 
walk in slightly faster you can you can
Crouch<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.329> you'll<00:01:45.420> still<00:01:45.689> be

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
Crouch like this and you'll still be

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.899 
Crouch like this and you'll still be
hidden<00:01:45.930> by<00:01:46.590> today<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.920> can't<00:01:47.310> crawl<00:01:47.700> you're

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
hidden by today you can't crawl you're

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.399 
hidden by today you can't crawl you're
going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> show<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.780> stick<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.259> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
going to show up and stick out like a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.230 
going to show up and stick out like a
sore<00:01:49.470> thumb<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.130> you're<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
sore thumb and you're going to be on the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.510 
sore thumb and you're going to be on the
radar<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.530> kind<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.890> figure<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.280> from

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
radar and so you kind of figure out from

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.190 
radar and so you kind of figure out from
this<00:01:53.670> how<00:01:54.000> fast<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.689> moving<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
this how fast you have to be moving and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.370 
this how fast you have to be moving and
how<00:01:55.290> how<00:01:55.979> far<00:01:56.340> how<00:01:56.759> M<00:01:57.000> how<00:01:57.780> much<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
how how far how M how much you have to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.230 
how how far how M how much you have to
walk<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.829> how<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.610> rate<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.000> actually

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
walk and how what rate you actually

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.209 
walk and how what rate you actually
moving<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.380> remain<00:02:01.619> hidden<00:02:01.890> like

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
moving to have to remain hidden like

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.560 
moving to have to remain hidden like
this<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.759> see<00:02:02.880> I'm<00:02:03.000> pretty<00:02:03.210> much<00:02:03.360> hidden

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
this you can see I'm pretty much hidden

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.300 
this you can see I'm pretty much hidden
you<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.619> constantly<00:02:04.950> spinning

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you have to be constantly spinning

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280 
you have to be constantly spinning
around<00:02:05.549> at<00:02:05.850> really<00:02:06.090> high<00:02:06.119> speed<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
around at really high speed but if you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.930 
around at really high speed but if you
if<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.979> want<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.160> go<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.369> sit<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.729> corner

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
if you want to go and sit in a corner

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.490 
if you want to go and sit in a corner
like<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.149> then<00:02:09.720> you're<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.170> show<00:02:10.349> up

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
