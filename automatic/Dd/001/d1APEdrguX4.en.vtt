00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello and now welcome here 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.040
 christmas i am the hear and i am 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.649
 next victim in the last part of our 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.840
 pc self assemble series 2013 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.030
 show you how you all end up 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.099
 so crypt in all the computer cables 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.820
 Power supply front panel connector and everything 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:24.630
 here and there 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:26.609
 have fun in the sixth part of our 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.230
 pc itself production run together transactions 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.420
 we use all the components 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.070
 do begin to wire together 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.290
 we are with the installation of the power supply 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.760
 This fast spent does not need any 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.530
 and time and is under 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.030
 Consideration of some points also for 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.950
 easy to handle 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.570
 First and foremost in our case that should be 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.940
 net has once without the back 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.500
 Modular cables require a tree that 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.120
 means we put the power supply with the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 fan directed to the housing floor 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.930
 in the space provided in the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.850
 housing under screws the power supply of 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.100
 outside with the supplied screws 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.899
 why the fan is pointing down 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.090
 It's just not like dogs 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.550
 fresh air in the net is then blow 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.100
 we put the 20 4 pin atx plug and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:14.130
 in 4 + 4 pc connection in the for it 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:15.720
 provided the connection both plugs 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.460
 fit in only one direction in each case 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.080
 the connection here we should the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.549
 possibility of housing in claim 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.030
 take and the cables behind the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.049
 usually stow mainboard 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.659
 Now we are looking for the right one 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.850
 modular ribbon cable out you 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.159
 need for the graphics card 1 80 and 1 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.200
 6 pin pci express plug for the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.570
 drives and the hdd each have a sata 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.890
 plug 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.659
 after we picked these cables 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.770
 we stuck the one side of the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.770
 cable in the power supply 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.890
 the other side of the pci express plug 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.780
 in the graphics card and the sata 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.860
 connections in the hdd and in the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.390
 Drive here again we should 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.009
 use of it take the cables behind 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.080
 to hide the mainboard carrier 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.549
 Next we wire the housing 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.440
 with the mainboard to it we take first 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.730
 the front panel connectors and stuck 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.690
 this in the lower part of the mainboard 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.730
 usually you can connect to the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.440
 typical markings like reset or 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.230
 power led recognize the under the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.280
 are placed 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.870
 after these markings resp 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.310
 Labels must also be the small ones 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.319
 cable of the housing as mainboard 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.840
 to be stuck to note is the plus 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.760
 - comes the plus is mostly for 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.349
 the respective pin marked on the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.150
 Connection itself is a small 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.530
 he filaments afterwards with the plus of the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.840
 connection consistency 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.290
 Often not all pins are occupied as in 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.290
 our case 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.930
 to the front panel also belongs the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.040
 audio connection also in the 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.319
 mainboard must be plugged 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.269
 this is the connection hd audio 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.260
 provided as the connection is only in 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.060
 a direction rhine 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.430
 also the usb-haven must with the 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.560
 Mainboard can be connected for the usb 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.780
 3.0 ports is the bigger blue plug 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.730
 and for the usb 2.0 ports something 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.459
 smaller plug responsible this is 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.660
 one then to the connections usb 1 and f 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.489
 usb 3 0 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.959
 Now the drives with the 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.180
 mainboard can contact us 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.130
 sata cables are responsible for this 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.110
 usually in the scope of delivery of the mainboard 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.940
 The connecting is easy 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.010
 that has come to me every time to the drive 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.959
 or the hdd and the other end to that 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.519
 mainboard both ends are the same 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.019
 embrace each other by the form of 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.120
 Connection new facility at 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.120
 Mainboard is to be noted that one the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.890
 hard drives in the sata 00 and 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.750
 the drives or similar in the 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.790
 following sata-ports is in fact 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.790
 satan 0 1 fata 0 2 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.100
 Last but not least, take the one 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.540
 lime devices plug to hand and put 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.540
 Put it in the power supply and in the socket 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.640
 oh well do not forget the switch 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.680
 the back of the power supply to enter 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.220
 Now the pc is ready for use 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.220
 be taken
