00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.210
 Hello dear viewers in touch and 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.330
 hydrazine and today starts a new project 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.100
 on channel levolution burns we are watching 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.980
 We will discuss the various manifestations 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.750
 levolution on battlefield 4 like 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.570
 activate it when it should 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.330
 use and other nuances and the first 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.980
 the card we discuss is called 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.980
 dam by us combi 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.510
 a and air on land and in water 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.240
 turn around in a proximity to the mighty 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.370
 flesh on vans indian china on map 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.690
 placed a scientific complex several 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.480
 roads power station 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.880
 residential building and a small island on 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.040
 the coastal strip is huge 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.900
 the dam so what are the manifestations 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.870
 levolution we can find on this map 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.360
 most importantly this dam which can 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.670
 destroy with any explosives 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.110
 also on point d you have a road 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.320
 barricade she. 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.570
 a b s e, we can contemplate the building after 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.500
 destroying which gameplay on point 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.070
 becomes different 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.660
 that and maxim of order let's go from the very 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.479
 small levolution application a 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.280
 building on the points she was also was 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.950
 said about the destruction of these buildings 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.710
 points will be more difficult to capture or 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.540
 on the contrary, hold down why two pie 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.340
 height will be lost when you 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.119
 are above over the enemy is 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.300
 very good 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.670
 secondly the buildings are shelters in 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.070
 which you can run behind the wall and be 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.619
 practically safe what 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.179
 for destroyed buildings then walls and 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.050
 The place where you can turn around will be 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:49.210
 much smaller than the whole building conclusion 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.929
 destroyed building is worse in defense i am but i 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.060
 when attacking 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.610
 for all the minuses turn into plus and 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.100
 but do the following conclusion sometime 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.890
 such a thing without destroying a building just 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.350
 so they will help you in the defense next 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.270
 what would you like to talk about 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.610
 road bar at point d 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.709
 they will help in the defense of the point at 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.290
 activation as the technique will not 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.600
 drive through this obstacle but all 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.560
 not so easy to lead to a point not only 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.140
 race data 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.140
 but also the staircase and what's preventing off-road 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.030
 technology for him project therefore 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.190
 competently and defense namely laying 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.040
 explosives on possible places of arrival 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.780
 barrage techniques can help but not 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.060
 it's worth forgetting that the barrage 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.550
 stand not everywhere 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.260
 on the country which is closest 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.020
 to the dam is not like 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.450
 Obstacles but there which is 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.880
 goes straight to the race when should 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.190
 defense should take them exactly to 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.950
 control the movement from this side. 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.930
 summarize the above use 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.269
 roadblock when defending points 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.069
 but do not forget the other ways of arrival 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.310
 roadblock not fully 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.290
 protects the point from ground equipment 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.160
 move on to the most massive destruction 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.010
 on this card 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.730
 latina i can kill you with 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.010
 explosives 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.870
 whether rocket sir pg well tear 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.600
 of this helicopter or cruise missile 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.280
 the tomahawk is important to make it something for 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.799
 those dam was exploding 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.190
 and immediately the question arises as her 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.849
 destroy but you need to aim at this 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.860
 region 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.870
 after several shots dam 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.090
 will begin to crack the science center squeals 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.549
 siren in the end dam 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.470
 get divorced immediately warn you about 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.930
 that is not worth the beginning of the round 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.780
 destroy the dam for the destruction 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.549
 one of the roads collapses and dynamics 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.799
 the battle on it just disappears 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.769
 for and also you can use 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.350
 dam as a weapon of mass destruction 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.569
 of skins and her on enemy troops yes and to 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.489
 the same will be much more interesting than 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.489
 destroy the whole map at once 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.829
 and in a gradual step , we smoothly approached 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.670
 when to use 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.620
 destruction 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.290
 this dam should be used 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.510
 only when on the road 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.340
 which goes near the dam moves 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.489
 enemy troops and you need 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.260
 to block their movement on this we 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.660
 finish the first release of the program for 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.060
 Will chance Gaets subscribe and put 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.739
 Like or having filled up dam wait 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.450
 new issues write in the comments 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.329
 which card would you like to see in 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.130
 the next video with you was some diesem 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.130
 see you on the battlefield fighter
