00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.590
 julian only a few days here at the bvb and 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.300
 then directly such an exciting asia tour 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.650
 how have you experienced the last days here ? 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.929
 especially with the enthusiasm of 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.699
 so fans it was definitely one 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.230
 very nice feeling to arrive here 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.720
 see what an enthusiasm from the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.020
 people there is something big 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.130
 Potential here is also the cities 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.290
 little to see 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.039
 in the short time was a great 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.260
 Experience was definitely one was 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.260
 good thing for you to date was that 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.690
 highlight the highlight 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.940
 I think every game is both games 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.620
 were important for us step forward 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.149
 close 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.680
 we were both successful 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.090
 he say the games are for 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.000
 Of course, most importantly, each of us 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.010
 workout but it was cool too 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.379
 the event where we ate on the roof 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.100
 I found I found it really cool 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.870
 I liked it a lot 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.070
 Of course we are also appropriate 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.350
 on the way is the crew bus of 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.640
 mrm at new entrances of course always the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.520
 important question do you already have a place 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.590
 got hold-up you've got yes 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 I did not get my place like that 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.970
 far behind 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.320
 therefore we also have something new along with romane burki 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.410
 We have taken a free bank 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.570
 was and that fits very well 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.490
 All in all, but apart from yours 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.780
 first weeks here at the bvb are you 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.030
 The colleagues did not record 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.080
 so I like it here 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.160
 really really good 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.680
 the guys have me very well 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.780

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.970

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.480
 they facilitate some me me 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.430

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.070
