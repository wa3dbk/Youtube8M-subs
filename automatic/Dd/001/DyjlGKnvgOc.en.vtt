leave<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.040> close<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.430> them<00:02:48.580> this<00:02:49.030> makes<00:02:49.240> some

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
leave you close to them this makes some

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.270 
leave you close to them this makes some
existing<00:02:49.690> combos<00:02:50.140> easier<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.590> some<00:02:50.770> new<00:02:50.980> combo

as<00:02:51.370> possible<00:02:59.850> this<00:03:00.850> is<00:03:01.030> kind<00:03:01.240> of<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.390> short<00:03:01.630> one

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
as possible this is kind of a short one

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.600 
as possible this is kind of a short one
but<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:01.990> expect<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.440> revisit<00:03:02.890> combos<00:03:03.190> much<00:03:03.400> more

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
but I expect to revisit combos much more

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.070 
but I expect to revisit combos much more
