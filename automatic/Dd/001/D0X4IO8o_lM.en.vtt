 next year 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.860
 2.7 growth is not enough to 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.710
 achieve what we have proposed as 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.720
 country however is a relative basis 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.010
 to what is happening in the world a lot 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.630
 more solid than I had experienced 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.000
 the year 2003 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.590

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.630
 the legislators in the approval of the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.340
 structural reforms and stressed the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.710
 benefits of some of them for the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.979
 micro small and medium enterprises 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.299
 you reformed through the 13 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.220
 laws in the financial sector and with that 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.409
 will allow greater greater inclusion 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.960
 competition and better rates in a country 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.340
 where 85% of companies do not have 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.020
 access to financing 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.619
 you transformed the law of 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.619
 economic competition 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.950
 in the positions the deputy 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.600

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.820
 sanctions of a mine in Mexico group 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.170
 for the pollution of the sound river and 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.360
 stressed the importance that the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.250
 secretary of economy report in detail 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.470
 about the trust for 2 billion 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.910
 of pesos to cover the damages for the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.170
 leak 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.180
 we understand that the social demands of 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.550
 cancellation of the concession of the mine 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.520
 goodview of copper can have a 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.200
 legitimate interest however we should not 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.050
 to lose sight of two aspects 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.730
 important on the one hand 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.350
 economic repercussions that could 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.820
 have an action of this nature in 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.820
 the local and national economies 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.480
 but for his part the deputy of the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.370
 national action party carlos fernando 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.800
 in a loop to question secretary in 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.120
 around adopted policies that do not 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.239
 have allowed employment growth 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.810
 I know that you know of encouragement 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.940
 economic then because it does not exercise its 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.730
 extensive knowledge to drive a 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.909
 effective economic policy and not 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.480
 continue obeying instructions from 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.640
 up that they have taken us to a resounding 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.600
 economic failure that affects all 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.730
 Mexicans 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.470
 the next position was for the party 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.880
 of the democratic revolution which in 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.490
 voice of deputy carlos moral 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.470
 questioned that spending is not being used 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.660
 public as a trigger to grow and 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.470
 put special emphasis on the issue of 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.270
 corruption 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.520
 that the salary of the president of the 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.580
 republic and the high bureaucracy are 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.850
 cut in half what do you think of 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.070
 this popular query mister secretary 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.780
 in the coming days this proposal 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.340
 will have to be approved or rejected by 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.470
 the full senate of the republic 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.360
 in the turn of the deputy ana lilia 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.620
 Heron of the ecologist green party will 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.900
 refers to the productivity of the 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.730
 secretariat highlighting efforts to 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.190
 encourage small and medium micro 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.920
 company 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.060
 Mexico continues to represent 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.240
 commercial balance 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.240
 Unfortunately, there is a deficit and a market 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.640
 flooded by products from the 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.970
 contraband at prices well below 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.450
 what the formal sectors can 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.239
 offer 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.580
 so that we believe is important 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.849
 establish more continue to establish 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.329
 measures that contribute to support in 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.329
 border areas
