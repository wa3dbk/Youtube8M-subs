00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.189 
can kind of like embrace the more
vampiric<00:04:30.560> vibe<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:31.759> what<00:04:32.120> we<00:04:32.240> do<00:04:32.389> I'm<00:04:32.870> loving

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
that right to the third studio album

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.100 
that right to the third studio album
like<00:04:34.970> traditionally<00:04:35.509> it's<00:04:35.660> one<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:35.960> more

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
like traditionally it's one of the more

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.050 
like traditionally it's one of the more
experimental<00:04:36.979> record<00:04:37.310> just<00:04:37.430> when<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.610> bank<00:04:37.850> and

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
new album is that more experimental is

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.480 
new album is that more experimental is
more<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.669> CM<00:04:44.000> what<00:04:44.300> we<00:04:44.389> say<00:04:44.600> well<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:46.370> know

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
more of the CM what we say well you know

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.279 
more of the CM what we say well you know
it's<00:04:46.729> kind<00:04:47.000> of<00:04:47.060> both<00:04:47.270> in<00:04:47.570> some<00:04:47.810> ways<00:04:48.020> it's

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
it's kind of both in some ways it's

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.409 
it's kind of both in some ways it's
their<00:04:48.440> most<00:04:48.560> experimental<00:04:49.220> album<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:49.940> in

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
their most experimental album and in

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.180 
their most experimental album and in
some<00:04:50.630> ways<00:04:50.750> it's<00:04:50.930> also<00:04:51.080> our<00:04:51.259> most<00:04:51.500> traditional

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
some ways it's also our most traditional

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.370 
some ways it's also our most traditional
so<00:04:52.460> i'm<00:04:52.820> addicted<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.600> see<00:04:53.810> what<00:04:53.960> other<00:04:54.080> people

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
so i'm addicted to see what other people

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.749 
so i'm addicted to see what other people
make<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:54.830> when<00:04:54.949> they<00:04:55.070> hear<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.310> i<00:04:55.430> really

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
make is it when they hear it i really

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.610 
make is it when they hear it i really
think<00:04:55.970> i<00:04:56.270> what<00:04:56.630> i<00:04:56.660> mean<00:04:56.870> by<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.020> is<00:04:57.199> just<00:04:57.440> that

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
think i what i mean by that is just that

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.490 
think i what i mean by that is just that
we<00:04:58.280> feel<00:04:58.699> very<00:04:58.729> free<00:04:59.479> now<00:04:59.690> I<00:04:59.960> mean<00:05:00.110> with<00:05:00.229> every

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
we feel very free now I mean with every

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.200 
we feel very free now I mean with every
album<00:05:00.680> we<00:05:01.039> felt<00:05:01.250> even<00:05:01.430> more<00:05:01.520> frigid<00:05:01.970> to<00:05:02.090> do

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
album we felt even more frigid to do

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.700 
album we felt even more frigid to do
exactly<00:05:02.479> what<00:05:02.690> we<00:05:02.840> want<00:05:03.110> to<00:05:03.199> do<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.470> if<00:05:03.530> that

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
exactly what we want to do and if that

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.710 
exactly what we want to do and if that
means<00:05:03.860> doing<00:05:04.220> something<00:05:04.370> that<00:05:04.729> you<00:05:05.599> know

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
means doing something that you know

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.779 
means doing something that you know
hasn't<00:05:06.169> been<00:05:06.320> done<00:05:06.530> before<00:05:06.590> strike<00:05:07.580> some

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
hasn't been done before strike some

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.339 
hasn't been done before strike some
people's<00:05:08.120> strange<00:05:08.419> like<00:05:08.720> we<00:05:09.020> really<00:05:09.169> don't

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
people's strange like we really don't

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:10.839 
people's strange like we really don't
care<00:05:09.590> we'll<00:05:09.800> just<00:05:09.949> go<00:05:10.070> for<00:05:10.310> whatever<00:05:10.550> we<00:05:10.699> think

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
care we'll just go for whatever we think

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.600 
care we'll just go for whatever we think
sounds<00:05:11.090> cool<00:05:11.449> but<00:05:11.690> then<00:05:12.259> on<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.919> flip<00:05:13.280> side<00:05:13.400> of

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
sounds cool but then on the flip side of

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.400 
sounds cool but then on the flip side of
that<00:05:13.729> is<00:05:13.849> that<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.360> think<00:05:14.720> we've<00:05:15.050> just<00:05:15.080> gotten
