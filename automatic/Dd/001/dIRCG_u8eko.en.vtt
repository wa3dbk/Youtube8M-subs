00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.130 
for a day not even a day the bananas
started<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.300> turn<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.750> when<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.869> thought<00:00:31.080> about

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
started to turn and when I thought about

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.430 
started to turn and when I thought about
turn<00:00:32.480> you<00:00:33.480> know<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> early<00:00:34.020> stages<00:00:34.290> of

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
turn you know the early stages of

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.100 
turn you know the early stages of
rotting<00:00:35.160> basically<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.540> they<00:00:36.750> started

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
rotting basically so they started

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.130 
rotting basically so they started
turning<00:00:37.260> colors<00:00:38.030> they<00:00:39.030> picked<00:00:39.270> up<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.540> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
turning colors they picked up this you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.030 
turning colors they picked up this you
know<00:00:40.260> very<00:00:40.649> unpleasant<00:00:41.520> dark<00:00:42.329> brown<00:00:42.710> hue<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
know very unpleasant dark brown hue the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.779 
know very unpleasant dark brown hue the
course<00:00:44.280> started<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.789> round<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.210> bit<00:00:45.510> so

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
course started to round a little bit so

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.580 
course started to round a little bit so
basically<00:00:47.789> my<00:00:48.300> suggestion<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.170> would<00:00:49.289> be

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
basically my suggestion to you would be

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.590 
basically my suggestion to you would be
if<00:00:50.129> we're<00:00:50.280> using<00:00:50.399> fresh<00:00:50.760> banana<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> cocktails

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
if we're using fresh banana in cocktails

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.330 
if we're using fresh banana in cocktails
I<00:00:51.840> would<00:00:52.079> actually<00:00:52.530> go<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> fresh<00:00:53.160> banana

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
I would actually go with a fresh banana

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.819 
I would actually go with a fresh banana
puree<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> juicer<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.530> home<00:00:55.680> or

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
puree if you have a juicer at home or

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.240 
puree if you have a juicer at home or
access<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> introduce<00:00:56.670> or<00:00:56.820> maybe<00:00:56.969> juice<00:00:57.329> them

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
access to introduce or maybe juice them

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
access to introduce or maybe juice them
really<00:00:59.250> extract<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.910> flavor<00:01:00.120> forbidden<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
really extract that flavor forbidden the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.750 
really extract that flavor forbidden the
banana<00:01:01.199> without<00:01:01.469> actually<00:01:01.770> using<00:01:01.859> aged

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
banana without actually using aged

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.630 
banana without actually using aged
bananas<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.930> could<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.640> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
bananas because as we could see it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120 
bananas because as we could see it
doesn't<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.090> well<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.299> time<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.979> can

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
doesn't do well with time but you can

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.679 
doesn't do well with time but you can
either<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.430> some<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.030> mush<00:01:09.299> them<00:01:09.450> into<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
either do some you can mush them into a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.950 
either do some you can mush them into a
pulp<00:01:10.310> yeah<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.549> recommendation<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.810> or

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.660 
pulp yeah my recommendation for you or
my<00:01:13.110> best<00:01:13.680> recommendation<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.490> would<00:01:14.640> be

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
my best recommendation for you would be

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.149 
my best recommendation for you would be
to<00:01:14.790> use<00:01:15.150> some<00:01:15.540> crushed<00:01:15.780> ice<00:01:15.990> maybe<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> blender

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
to use some crushed ice maybe a blender

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.580 
to use some crushed ice maybe a blender
and<00:01:17.250> actually<00:01:17.610> blend<00:01:18.030> fresh<00:01:18.810> bananas<00:01:19.259> with

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and actually blend fresh bananas with

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.160 
and actually blend fresh bananas with
your<00:01:19.740> cocktail<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:21.150> crushed<00:01:21.420> ice<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.810> help

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
your cocktail the crushed ice will help

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230 
your cocktail the crushed ice will help
you<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> thickness<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> drink

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
you with the thickness of the drink

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.760 
you with the thickness of the drink
because<00:01:24.630> it'll<00:01:24.869> water<00:01:25.080> down<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> little<00:01:25.590> more

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
because it'll water down a little more

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530 
because it'll water down a little more
yet<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.220> know<00:01:26.369> still<00:01:26.729> hold<00:01:26.939> up<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> flavor

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
yet you know still hold up to the flavor

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.940 
yet you know still hold up to the flavor
because<00:01:27.720> banana<00:01:28.229> does<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> pretty

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
because banana does have a pretty

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
because banana does have a pretty
offensive<00:01:29.310> influence<00:01:30.060> especially<00:01:30.150> when

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
offensive influence especially when

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
offensive influence especially when
you're<00:01:30.780> using<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.170> other<00:01:31.229> liquors<00:01:31.680> such<00:01:32.430> as

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
you're using with other liquors such as

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.420 
you're using with other liquors such as
rum<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.810> had<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> little<00:01:34.439> simple<00:01:34.799> syrup<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.189> sugar

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
rum I had a little simple syrup of sugar

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.069 
rum I had a little simple syrup of sugar
to<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.670> that'll<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.329> make<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.659> flavor<00:01:36.840> pop

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
to it that'll really make the flavor pop

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.490 
to it that'll really make the flavor pop
but<00:01:38.270> don't<00:01:39.270> confuse<00:01:39.630> bananas<00:01:40.170> don't<00:01:40.320> waste

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
but don't confuse bananas don't waste

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.499 
but don't confuse bananas don't waste
your<00:01:40.650> time<00:01:40.710> don't<00:01:41.130> waste<00:01:41.340> your<00:01:41.520> spirit<00:01:42.030> or
