00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.240 
folder right here your this will
actually<00:01:30.960> down<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> description<00:01:32.159> below

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
actually down in the description below

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
actually down in the description below
so<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.790> copy<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.210> paste<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.350> you

so you just copy and paste it but you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.740 
so you just copy and paste it but you

A's<00:01:36.900> -<00:01:37.530> V<00:01:38.390> 1.3<00:01:39.390> patch<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.380> then<00:01:40.619> there's<00:01:41.070> no

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
A's - V 1.3 patch and then there's no

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.830 
A's - V 1.3 patch and then there's no
spaces<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.420> want<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.689> ahead<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
spaces so you want to go ahead and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.289 
spaces so you want to go ahead and
create<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.140> folder<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:45.149> we're

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
create that folder and then what we're

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.520 
create that folder and then what we're
actually<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.869> using<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.259> for<00:01:46.500> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
actually going to be using this for is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
actually going to be using this for is
for<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> installation<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.329> ahead

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
for the installation so we can go ahead

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480 
for the installation so we can go ahead
and<00:01:48.570> minimize<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.500> minimize<00:01:50.310> our

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
and minimize that and minimize our

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.730 
and minimize that and minimize our
browser<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:51.810> now<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.530> this

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
browser and then now that we have this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.249 
browser and then now that we have this
here<00:01:53.189> we<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.579> go<00:01:53.670> ahead<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.970> launch<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.630> by

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
here we can go ahead and launch this by

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.899 
here we can go ahead and launch this by
just<00:01:55.320> double-clicking<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.430> already<00:01:56.610> set

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
just double-clicking it it's already set

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.179 
just double-clicking it it's already set
to<00:01:57.060> launch<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.770> administrator<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.950> we<00:01:59.040> don't

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
to launch as administrator so we don't

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.649 
to launch as administrator so we don't
have<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.399> worry<00:01:59.549> about<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.360> ahead

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
have to worry about that we can go ahead

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.840 
have to worry about that we can go ahead
and<00:02:00.869> hit<00:02:01.079> yes<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.469> then<00:02:02.460> what<00:02:02.579> we're<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and hit yes and then what we're going to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.240 
and hit yes and then what we're going to
do<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.329> actually<00:02:03.659> choose<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.530> folder<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
do is actually choose that folder that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.069 
do is actually choose that folder that
we<00:02:05.759> actually<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.149> created<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.840> we're<00:02:06.990> going

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
we actually just created so we're going

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.479 
we actually just created so we're going
to<00:02:07.140> go<00:02:07.259> into<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.560> directory<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.310> just

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
to go into that directory that we just

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.740 
to go into that directory that we just
created<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.270> we're<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.569> want<00:02:09.720> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
created so what we're going to want to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.300 
created so what we're going to want to
do<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.989> actually<00:02:10.289> hit<00:02:10.410> these<00:02:10.530> three<00:02:10.920> Browse

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
do is actually hit these three Browse

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.710 
do is actually hit these three Browse
dots<00:02:11.640> right<00:02:11.849> here<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.360> then<00:02:12.450> we're<00:02:12.569> going<00:02:12.690> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
dots right here and then we're going to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.120 
dots right here and then we're going to
go<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.900> computer

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
go to computer

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
alright so the file is actually done

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.380 
alright so the file is actually done
extracting<00:02:56.580> now<00:02:56.880> we're<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.210> go<00:02:57.300> ahead

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
extracting now we're going to go ahead

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.720 
extracting now we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:57.570> open<00:02:57.660> up<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.140> folder<00:02:58.380> just<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:59.070> ensure

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
and open up that folder just to ensure

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.370 
and open up that folder just to ensure
that<00:02:59.760> everything<00:03:00.270> did<00:03:00.630> indeed<00:03:00.930> install

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
that everything did indeed install

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.990 
that everything did indeed install
correctly<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.130> then<00:03:02.310> we<00:03:02.490> actually<00:03:02.700> have

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
correctly and then we actually have

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.060 
correctly and then we actually have
another<00:03:03.270> step<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:04.080> have<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.410> do<00:03:04.590> before

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070
