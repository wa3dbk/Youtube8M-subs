so<00:02:33.270> for<00:02:33.540> us<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.930> our<00:02:33.990> format<00:02:34.410> we're<00:02:34.560> going<00:02:34.680> to

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
so for us and our format we're going to

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.550 
so for us and our format we're going to
do<00:02:34.860> eight<00:02:35.460> cows<00:02:35.820> in<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.180> front<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.690> then<00:02:37.110> we

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.510 
must turn with it and we be turning in
thirds<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.590> order<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.920> find<00:02:41.130> your<00:02:41.220> thirds

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
thirds so order to find your thirds

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.280 
thirds so order to find your thirds
think<00:02:41.940> about<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.330> during<00:02:42.480> your<00:02:42.570> call<00:02:42.870> face

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
order to figure out where your body

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.460 
order to figure out where your body
orientation<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:53.370> going<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.640> be<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.270> think<00:02:54.960> about

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
orientation is going to be I think about

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.430 
orientation is going to be I think about
that<00:02:56.040> my<00:02:56.190> hip<00:02:56.460> is<00:02:57.120> right<00:02:57.510> wherever<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.200> third

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
that my hip is right wherever the third

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.910 
that my hip is right wherever the third
needs<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.860> be<00:02:59.990> so<00:03:00.990> think<00:03:01.200> about<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.590> your

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
needs to be so think about that your

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.470 
needs to be so think about that your
kippas<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.370> an<00:03:02.460> angle<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:03.120> where<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.330> need

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
kippas have an angle to where you need

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.970 
kippas have an angle to where you need
to<00:03:03.570> be<00:03:03.600> because<00:03:03.900> your<00:03:04.020> upper<00:03:04.320> body<00:03:04.500> for<00:03:04.770> trying

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
to be because your upper body for trying

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.470 
to be because your upper body for trying
to<00:03:05.010> judge<00:03:05.220> by<00:03:05.370> where<00:03:05.550> your<00:03:05.670> upper<00:03:05.790> body<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.330> you

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
to judge by where your upper body is you

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.260 
to judge by where your upper body is you
might<00:03:06.630> get<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> little<00:03:06.840> confused<00:03:07.520> so<00:03:08.520> after

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
might get a little confused so after

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.570 
might get a little confused so after
eight<00:03:09.480> cows<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.020> front<00:03:10.260> mandatory<00:03:11.160> turning
