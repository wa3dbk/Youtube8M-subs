00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.750
 hours 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.230
 hello everyone again today I have a 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.240
 hangover hangover because yesterday 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.370
 we were celebrating because he does 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.990
 a few days to meet a few 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.090
 how many more than I need to be 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.730
 happy and enough to make the 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.730
 peter pan syndrome that I suffer from either 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.660
 but the good thing is that with this roll 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.610
 of birthday at least I get to 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.800
 think and look to the past and 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.809
 better or worse but different times 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.790
 after all and this year has given me 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.500
 for thinking about childhood and drawings 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.120
 that we saw or at least the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.010
 cartoons that we saw in 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.809
 our time compared to the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.610
 children - in day and it is true that 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.290
 cartoons have changed a lot 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.720
 it is true that those of today are 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.070
 better facts but those of our time and 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.920
 this is a phrase that is going to feel 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.790
 incredibly old because when the 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.409
 war 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.610
 good as I said today's drawings in 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.290
 day it is true that we are by facts 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.390
 but those who had when we 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.190
 we were little they taught us many more 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.180
 values ​​were educational and like me 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.979
 I always like to support my 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.159
 argumentations with examples of a 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.079
 supreme intelligentsia let's see 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.929
 the first is gentlemen of the zodiac who 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.670
 is one of the most lame series in some of 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.990
 the history of television those 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.670
 who want true values ​​that up 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.740
 the bad bad of the series in a 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.200
 special moment I think it would be 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.759
 boletus cojones now I'm going to take off 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.439
 the way for you to fight 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.209
 against the next gentleman of the 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.500
 gold armor and I'm going to take it for 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:34.119
 ass volcanoes I know to see if I die 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.319
 because the knights of the zodiac 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.170
 they taught the true value of the 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.840
 friendship value fighting another example 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.479
 perfect of this is dragon ball 10 go 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.340
 history go honor of the warrior with 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.229
 reason I passed a measure of 10 minutes 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.599
 a day doing strength to see if I was 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.849
 He put yellow hair and half burst 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:53.349
 school that were characters to whom from 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:54.520
 We really wanted to look like them and not the 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:56.560
 shit they put on television today 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.270
 On the other hand, we must also say that 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.829
 many of the drawings that we saw are the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.509
 why we are today very 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.219
 fucked in the head some examples 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.409
 that comes to my mind could be 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.140
 for example the trotamúsicos that if you 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.090
 to think about it were four animals 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.670
 that they went with instruments for 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.290
 You go to know where I go 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.239
 without remembering what the fuck is called 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.170
 cat but the cock the cob or there was a 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.430
 time it was a series with which 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.439
 we learned a lot 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.909
 despite being cartoon not 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.769
 I had a budget to hire 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.150
 more than five actors did not matter what 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.400
 I'm talking were the same 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.840
 characters all the time or series like 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.280
 transformers and garfiel who came to 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.530
 Spain when the dubbing was done in 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.280
 neutral and they caused us a problem of 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.280
 National identity 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.620
 apart from all these bullshit 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.659
 I must say that we were very lucky 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.639
 because we saw cartoons that from 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.189
 they were truly memorable so now 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.930
 please go to the comments and tell me 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.400
 what will be the cartoons that 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.989
 you would see and if you are not
