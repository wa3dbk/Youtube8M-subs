00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
what what I think you've been doing and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.639 
what what I think you've been doing and
especially<00:00:51.690> given<00:00:51.989> all<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.110> exercise<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
especially given all your exercise you

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.290 
especially given all your exercise you

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
should be hungry you slowed your

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.540 
should be hungry you slowed your
metabolism<00:00:54.870> down<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> point<00:00:56.039> where<00:00:56.250> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
metabolism down so the point where you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.549 
metabolism down so the point where you
don't<00:00:56.579> want<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.360> burn<00:00:57.750> calories<00:00:58.050> everybody
