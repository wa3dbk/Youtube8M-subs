00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
files and what this can do this can

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.300 
files and what this can do this can
actually<00:00:22.690> increase<00:00:23.380> performance<00:00:23.980> as<00:00:24.070> well<00:00:24.220> as

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
actually increase performance as well as

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.359 
actually increase performance as well as
increased<00:00:24.670> battery<00:00:24.880> life<00:00:25.270> so<00:00:26.199> if<00:00:26.949> you<00:00:27.070> are

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369
