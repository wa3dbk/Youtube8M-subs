00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.539
 less 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:24.810
 I've already tried mode of course 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.210
 gaming with 7 keys we see the box there 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.670
 I'm soccer is the double button 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.300
 click and other keys then I'll explain everything 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.300
 forward 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.090
 let's proceed with the opening ok i did 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.760
 this is the excellent mouse mouse 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.559
 a really good gluing for 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.840
 to play 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.469
 very comfortable, it really wears a lot 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.469
 very well 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:01:06.180
 as I told you at 7 keys 12 with the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:09.060
 rotellina 345 otherwise 1234567 we choose a 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.430
 what a rubber band these need 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.170
 text of the left and the wheel not 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.700
 they need explanations 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.220
 however they are the ones found in 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.220
 any mouse this here this 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.740
 feel here that you can see this well here 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.390
 from 20 to focus 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.630
 this taxi is used here for double 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.990
 click looking for we will reward you one of yours 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.549
 i take window in the desktop when we 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.829
 we press it we can open any 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.110
 program 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.790
 anyway when we offer once 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.470
 the mouse from the pardon to the computer that 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.620
 we pressed it we biased 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.110
 this key twice 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.730
 now I get calls on Skype 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.000
 however this one is two here 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:59.270
 keys that I take when we are in a 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.270
 browsers send us back and forth in the 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.130
 blues in the page in short the use of 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.350
 darts instead even games that 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.030
 for example java blind side and I used 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.060
 this one for the fact of the outfit 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:18.450
 because i am a use this here for 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:22.320
 talk about booking that say this mouse 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.340
 beautiful is this beautiful here is 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:30.900
 made in hard rubber but very moved 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.940
 say do not slip from your hands peace a 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.830
 I think this little button here is more 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.150
 this is important here 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.590
 this here regulates the dpa, the dpi and the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.110
 mouse sensitivity 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.330
 the higher and more by doing a little 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.330
 moving the project will go faster 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.880
 this mouse with 4 settings and goes from 800 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.130
 in 2000 I don't remember now I should 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:03.570
 be 800 1200 of the seventeenth and 2000 however 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:09.270
 honestly I don't remember seconds that 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.880
 let's take the instructions ok is 800 that 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.940
 it is the lowest that does the same 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.790
 mouse movement then the arrow 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.780
 pressing it passes 1200 dpi to and so 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.320
 away from 1600 and 2000 is not a mouse of 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.269
 those pro gamers so on because they are there 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.970
 it did not come in eight thousand dpa but at least 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.430
 a service bought this I have it 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.800
 bought at mediaworld in my city ​​and 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.540
 I paid 19 euros 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.209
 now I don't know how much it costs like up 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.890
 amazon but I believe the same price 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.840
 I stay because if I find it on amazon 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.840
 at least I leave the link in the description 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:54.040
 however this is the box if it is 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:56.190
 we want to see more in particular at 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.790
 what they forgot to me about the twisted pair 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.709
 gold-plated orba that facilitates the 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.870
 final transmission because they like it 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.150
 sa is here metal conductive 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.959
 this is an out the box the box 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.570
 I must say it looks very well 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:19.299
 below, boxwood is a three-year guarantee 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:26.680
 from 800 2000 dpi 7 d'asti and the gold e 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:28.030
 gold things b1 bla bla for no in here 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.590
 use the mouse over 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.140
 so it is also compatible with windows 8 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.580
