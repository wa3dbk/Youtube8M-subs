00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.570
 hello to you klips before 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.580
 I want to start the story about fv304 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.949
 thank all the fans and the rest 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.519
 those who supported us for na'vi on 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.970
 Grand Final Warsaw March 27 to 1 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.249
 April 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.329
 so let's get down to tell you 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:29.849
 a fairy tale about this miracle yuda called 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:32.250
 fv304 I do not know whether to talk about 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.290
 common characteristics of art and you are all 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.380
 you can see them yourself 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.940
 development and I donâ€™t know everything in my 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.890
 guides other blades deal of them 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.890
 tells and here I decided not to do 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.340
 This is now your guides because you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.590
 again be able to view them all in 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.560
 development tree and so now 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.750
 go out seed guides and replays quality 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.980
 example sometimes with analysis I was sometimes 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.870
 no so here are the forest what i want to point out 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.120
 the characteristics of this caliber mouths and and damage 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.219
 and try to tell you how I do it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.869
 I see at the moment not at all 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.460
 imagine how you can be fun in it 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.770
 random with such a negligible break through 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.799
 damage as in this art but for your goals 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.179
 Alan generally she is acceptable of course if 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.409
 you threw where the opposing team 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.259
 a bunch of armor 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.149
 I mean there are tips and other 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.159
 foreign analogues take what you do not 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.140
 lucky because like 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.649
 caliber this art form of average damage in 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.889
 450 units and a medium blowout 57 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.200
 units you are unlikely to represent 

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:37.409
 a serious threat to them except a hard hat 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.439
 scratch approximately see 50 to 100 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.340
 damage only inflicting them sometimes 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.189
 may be 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.039
 If you successfully fly into the lid you on 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.859
 full damage to the same as und class or 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.049
 watch him however lightly armored 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.450
 enemy machines such as any 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.000
 france paddling up to 8 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.890
 spat where there are guns these are 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.600
 amerikashki showered with embedded plan 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.869
 simmer waffles German 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.360
 rd h &amp; m olya borsch there other waffentragers 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.369
 and other similar cardboard ones 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.790
 say fighting vehicles of other nations to the top 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.519
 forest just be will suffer in traffic accidents 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.200
 and getting almost the most always on 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.430
 She is full of a different way to you 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.590
 say what else am i probably 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.690
 would recommend developers to add 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.240
 at least cumulative equivalent projectiles to 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.880
 bushes panda bison and foot for 3 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.370
 then this art would be right now 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.710
 much more popular it could even be her 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.960
 already spoil I'll start format 742 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.050
 golden league it is not clear why they 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.990
 wrote that in general it and 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.780
 what else can you add abed rtr 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.380
 positive points 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:56.030
 currently considered mobility 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.020
 I would point out that they burn at all cool fast 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.120
 can relocate anywhere 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.820
 important time and escape with can 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.640
 chase not because of the light small 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.500
 the profile that makes it quite less 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.480
 will take especially if you have supplements 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.400
 a pack to if you like not to play 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.790
 I personally have 3 modules at all and 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:19.110
 fan are you apart from standard modules 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.570
 there tass or bulletins how do you see that 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.940
 you can still note what the chip at all 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.370
 terter yah gun marker that 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.740
 let you just strain 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.290
 opponents are rather difficult to reach 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.710
 for non-marker art places where usually 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.470
 nasty nykaetsya minuses briefly about them 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.810
 again due to the fact that we have mortar 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.610
 trunk means there it promises debts flight 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.890
 projectiles that they gave very nicely 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.800
 shooting up to 500 meters which is generally very 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.810
 I will live a little German assault on Panther 3 and 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.060
 bison range more pro just 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.190
 on 100 meters but this is very much as decides 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.110
 sometimes the average here is very 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.480
 move often sue perry 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.960
 come down here again the moment uses 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.790
 could have her again wondered 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.340
 in 3d format sims is equal exclusively to 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.790
 small maps as mines possible 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.400
 same 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.350
 Ens which we will remember very long 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.900
 fighting since the first season of vgl in Kiev 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.310
 since there are no cumulative projectiles 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.250
 inertia is likely the main reason 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.560
 which we do not use its format 742 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.190
 at the moment everyone is waiting for 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.180
 developers promise Well 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.730
 positive negatives we 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.030
 considered it's time to finish our tale 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.980
 mini guide as an example you can 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.380
 just watch the replays say it on 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.720
 All games on this little beauty on 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.610
 ward I think there is no special meaning tell 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.050
 They are standard for art masking 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.990
 martial brotherhood for all 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.639
 Of course, without exception, of course 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.879
 the lamp commander must be a gunner 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.740
 the main smooth turn of the tower and if 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.830
 would be cumulative at all could still 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.750
 There is 1 driver but he probably besides 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.699
 standard mandatory grabs can be 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.530
 add virtuosos and stuff if you have 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.949
 there is enough experience for extra 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.020
 perks 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.210
 In general, the whole art classroom fast 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.900
 little noticeable but not from where it is not 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.650
 shooting not giving enough forgive 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.780
 firepower 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.449
 until the sixth left only weak 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.729
 breakdown land mines that are most 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.650
 cases here are useless against good 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.919
 their armor is so effective against weak 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.069
 armored cartons dragged by tanks 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:33.629
 also a conclusion what else can I say 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:36.199
 about the mouth probably everything is probably now I 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.639
 I want to thank you for watching 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.340

 my other teammates our streams and 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.960
 maybe I will resume the stream itself soon 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:53.520
 your on arte well and stay tuned
