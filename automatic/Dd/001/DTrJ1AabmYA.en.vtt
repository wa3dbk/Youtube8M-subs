00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello nice that she looks in today 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.740
 I show you a really delicious 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.470
 fitness ice cream and a raspberry quark 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 ice and the whole I will be without 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.480
 ice cream machine without cream without 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.789
 eggs and of course in the low carb 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.980
 Variant also without household sugar 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.140
 yes and what is now ever more pure 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.699
 I'll show you that now and me 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.150
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.150
 watch 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.829
 we need a bit of quark I 've got 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.500
 your teeth full of fat level you can 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.430
 Of course, also take the excavator stage 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.829
 then I would be in parÃ¡ tk then 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.620
 a bit like kicking in the baby 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.390
 Form you can also use solid only 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.860
 I would not be the crystalline form 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.789
 recommend because the cold bad 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.109
 then I have a lime there 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.699
 we need the juice a bit 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.979
 to bring in fresher 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.860
 if you want a little more vanilla 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.689
 powder for the taste 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.189
 fine-tuning the sweet'm still here 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.710
 a bit steger could as well 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.310
 Take liquid sweetener and finish 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.250
 I still have a little sweet lupine her 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.060
 Surely now you wonder what that is 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.549
 has to look for sea ice and that is it 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.259
 you really from an extremely reduced 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.299
 whether it is fat that we 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.979
 leave out because we do not use a page 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.439
 if it is the sugar we omit 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.780
 and replace with edith or the 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.720
 omit things and there would be us 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.460
 some of the creamy consistency 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.100
 get lost and you can do it 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.259
 sweet lupine mail to replace the whole 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.930
 For example, vegan people know that 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.450
 Also can use as a substitute in cake 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.410
 and you can do that just as well in the ice 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.510
 use 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.250
 So do not be scared that tastes 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:03.990
 you not only do more but do it 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.640
 really nice creamy fast first 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.100
 we have to use all the dry ingredients 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:15.800
 with the quark we give the retreat 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:18.959
 to that sweet lupine a bit vanilla 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.090
 I take now on the lonely tablespoon 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.420
 of which stand will be loud 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:32.760
 pack 15 grams of sugar and give her 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:34.709
 still with it and the juice of aliments 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.010
 against us also with one of them 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:43.310
 half and now has the whole thing 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.310
 ever 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.820
 and the cheap was if you are in such a way now 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.470
 a normal shaker mug 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:05.230
 fill and mix with raspberries 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.060
 By the way, you can also do the quark now 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.340
 Eating is really delicious 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.930
 vanilla quark maybe now 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.220
 a little sweet so that would have you then 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.080
 necessarily reduce 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.510
 but in that we have the sweet lupine 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.490
 We have added the mail to the mail 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.800
 quark automatically quite a bit 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.459
 namely upgraded these ten alone 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.240
 gram 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.570
 which we have just admitted 39 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.810
 grams of protein by 32 grams of fiber 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.640
 only very little carbohydrates can 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.950
 your yogurt or quark of course 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.900
 only a little more substantial do it 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.820
 By the way, but now we go back 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.150
 to ice and handle those easy 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.150
 continue 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:13.640
 there we go now the nerves and 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:15.760
 we have to mess up the whole thing 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.760
 his 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.030
 so fundamentally our ice already 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.610
 you can see that well so you can 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.919
 Keeps reasonably consistent 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.629
 not now that we have ice balls with it 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.110
 but can stake is definitely 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:43.810
 already pretty creamy and still around 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.580
 stabs off balls or even if you have it 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.590
 now not quite in the state is 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.509
 I will show you now like that 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:59.199
 If you still look in the 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:05:01.719
 Froster has deleted the whole 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:05.159
 still a bit smooth with it 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:05.159
 evenly through freezes 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:16.039
 and on top and off in the 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.960
 Froster is the perfect 1 consistency 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.259
 by the way, after four to five hours 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.650
 reaches depending on how much cooling power 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.690
 new frosta has and in case that 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.710
 I have yours as a freeze volt 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.860
 here yesterday already 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.770
 I have prepared now without too 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.789
 Stirring in it shows left that shows 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.740
 It's really hard and that too 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.720
 right now enjoy it 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.319
 I put that in the refrigerator a bit 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.319
 put 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.780
 and after all this is now an hour 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.430
 Thawed in the refrigerator I show 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.879
 Just like inside 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.879
 looks 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.520
 a container with warm water and if 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.689
 you still work so now 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.289
 I'll try a nice one 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:09.580
 stabs off the ball 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.580
 of course a bit soft on the edge 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.340
 Look at that, it's really one 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.310
 really hot ice and now 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.850
 I'll show you again 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.850
 looks exactly 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.550
 so you do not see any big ice crystals 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.620
 the whole is stable but it is 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.150
 not so that breaks apart 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.860
 that may also be the case now 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.540
 bit crumbly out but that's wrong 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.920
 that really has a really good one 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.920
 melt the ice 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:04.360
 this is really a really cool ice 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.100
 wonderful creamy beautiful fruity one 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.140
 Nice fresh from the lime we 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.480
 still have added and still 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.670
 a bit and creamier by the 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.380
 vanilla have added this to her 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.420
 do not need to worry about that 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.450
 You do not taste sweet lupine milk 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.940
 but that has really incredibly good 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.400
 melt though it is now this now 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.320
 really 24 hours without listening to it 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.640
 that's really froster 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.640
 a really delicious ice cream 

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.890
 I hope you liked my video 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.130
 you really did get this 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.660
 really delicious in the circle at home 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.610
 give it a try 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.680
 by the way, that really does not matter 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.090
 really good food and you can feel good 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.050
 that really with good conscience 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.870
 relish 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.310
 So, I'll let you taste good 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.390
 I wish you a good succeed 

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.260
 to cook 

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:57.630
 there and would behave on my 

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.760
 june again but now 

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:03.260
 First of all, I thank you for looking 

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.260
 hopefully see you soon and
