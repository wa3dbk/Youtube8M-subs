 and to the area comment here next another video 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.490
 here is the video of the game called 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.869
 federal guilt 'black ops' 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.829
 that same I understood today at Christmas, the new goal 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.509
 but did not do the two days the project tomorrow 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.939
 the game was very much in a tone very accustomed to 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.250
 in the first person network shooter game 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 like pants we will be here in a very closed game and enough of the game of 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.160
 interests 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
 how traffic came to earth 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.659
 in islet and depended I never saw much crack 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.410
 trier tips that these shoots play more 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.030
 but I decided to buy or pop a chance still today 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.470
 It is expected that in my life in Europe 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.740
 we will see 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.270
 If I get along with this game, it's a game I played. 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.560
 it's the 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.520
 It's a little bit early this morning. 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.470
 There I was attesting the camera to you. 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.880
 to see if I could see 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.790
 the limit of oysters 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.990
 I did not see it's really the problem seemed to be 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.080
 I took what would happen, there was a guy gone but I think I 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.220
 I'll come back there to see you 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.350
 erika breno thinking that it was a bad time to go out of the way 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.530
 technician 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.320
 so the problem 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.490
 but I'm a guy ahead the benfica game I did not like it I'm remembering one 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.770
 little of the campaign too 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.930
 I just do not like every year you have to leave the last game 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930
 in a system that links the Fluminense 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.160
 I agree things in fact if you click past topped the favorite in the game in 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.920
 that game 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.410
 have to stay 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.410
 seeing direct and I was killed a guy who came behind 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.550
 I all night 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.550
 luis fina meaning mofado port using 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.380
 then or also using 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.600
 in indaial grenade crash grenade normal island in the day 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.220
 cesc intendant 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.270
 that it melts 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.270
 they must know what I'm still talking about in their weapons name 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.349
 How did you play at the end? 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.799
 had the 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:17.780
 learn 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.469
 eulalia granada there 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.729
 liverpool has the guy face with douglas and running 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.490
 From there I put my face to see if I could take 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.079
 Shoot him I played 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.249
 but lime says miss missal had no one 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:35.370
 in that strengthens with the election of others have that well told nothing has changed 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.969
 now i learned to play cech right 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.220
 pretended to be giving the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.229
 The tips I've seen I've got this player 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:49.109
 are very important John has ended in the minimum so that a minor was detained by 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.519
 steal it because 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.700
 in short with the calls father was the plan 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.269
 it's the planes that go over 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.489
 d us when we have Christ and what explain is is kind every time if killed 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.480
 three without dying 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.839
 know what this means 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.179
 I was the spy plane. 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.449
 and he shows in the senate in the sea for him there is no date 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:12.399
 the last red cesp are the enemies league our all boys in 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:13.109
 Bush 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.019
 And they ask for chile canopy. 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.019
 You can go home and try to kill them. 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.619
 Then I saw the guy take it from there I said I'm going to pay from behind 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.009
 P 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:32.879
 this is important now is to walk entire position 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.930
 resources with the secretaries like that of a wall 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.349
 and in a place where your 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.349
 I'm quite pleased 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.670
 because the more you let yourself die, the more his music in the team 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.779
 I hope to make a good history. 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:51.599
 It was what I tried to do here but this game I did not kill very much. 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.849
 but 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.849
 but gave warns a little bit 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.909
 there are a lot of people that compare also is not very good championship that I can 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.889
 sign as one of the people knew said 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.889
 if you have based on the report you see 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.870
 what feels a strong killing mec childhood determines where such position of him 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.989
 both operate on this game in a good and always good you 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.630
 it's just walking alone I can not obviously you look 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:28.009
 dishes crossing ceert there you give a stir 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.110
 because if you stay still if it's something easy 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.409
 and try not to 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.629
 do not stand 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.860
 an open place 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.819
 because otherwise you will end 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.469
 Being a target, I also do 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.539
 It's fucking good that I followed his partner and he engaged in a fight. 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:48.139
 free 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.889
 and I could kill his face without having to take the risk of dying 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.430
 If you are quite good at this game, I recommend that you be 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.460
 physicist 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.870
 stay together with your allies why 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.990
 because if it is good if she is well if she has a notion I have no notion of 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.400
 nothing in this game can play for the two days that I started 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.590
 but explained everything amusing has also in game says a ticket 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.029
 is from brass and technological 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.529
 we have to survive the year 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:25.539
 this year with no chance to climb 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.539
 decided it's cool too 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.460
 time cut with a double 6/1 rise from the embassy 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:41.749
 I know people who kill a lot 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:44.749
 I got to kill the guy come 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:47.249
 but not 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:48.370
 is the messi 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.590
 I think it appears on the screen that gives a 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.139
 with the hottest emotion killing someone right? 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.529
 I think I get nice too from the game. 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:03.619
 I know it happens right here in our little green girl in the mini mattel to give 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:06.619
 piece shows the red dots that the enemy 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.729
 It was a pretty much better game. 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.849
 and he well and thus incoherently feel kill quickly if I do not need to stay 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:25.470
 taking a million times that every woman who owns other games like 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.509
 out grown 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:29.810
 the fight against AIDS 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.539
 I look more charming 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.539
 well balanced too 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.930
 fortunately I was playing in that window there already 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.819
 let it boil 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.789
 in this game 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:51.150
 a mortgage here put in a tent bc important feature already life 

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:54.149
 easy 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.939
 here I was very happy that it was the end and that the developments that the 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:01.119
 with appeal in the house sink 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:04.210
 we are having many think she does a long time ahead 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.210
 I swear I have managed to kill nine direct yes 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.290
 the apple and dying messenberg he suffered 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.290
 Let's give it a shot. 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:20.939
 but the first type triki office you also have by helicopter 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.080
 this report on top and I was able to 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.080
 to people 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.979
 this game is this is the black ops 

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:35.630
 it is said in the comments if you liked it without even having more than ten months 

00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:38.300
 in my case 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.159
 and that's it I'll leave you there with 

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:43.729
 the last that the afghan and his baby 

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.020
 and that's the one monkey talking 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.450
 last week's arm
