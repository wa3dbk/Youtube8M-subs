00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
college and most of you probably know

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.000 
college and most of you probably know
this<00:01:02.460> college<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.879> my<00:01:03.059> best<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> rifle<00:01:04.229> now

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
this college is my best as a rifle now

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.580 
this college is my best as a rifle now
and<00:01:05.369> now<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:06.030> actually<00:01:06.210> my<00:01:06.540> favorite<00:01:06.869> gun<00:01:07.350> as

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and now it's actually my favorite gun as

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.190 
and now it's actually my favorite gun as
well<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.490> personally<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
well but I personally think that the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.170 
well but I personally think that the
an-94<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> best<00:01:11.490> gun<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.970> game

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
an-94 is the best gun in the game

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.530 
an-94 is the best gun in the game
because<00:01:12.840> other<00:01:13.350> rifles<00:01:14.010> suits<00:01:14.549> my<00:01:14.820> playstyle

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
because other rifles suits my playstyle

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.260 
because other rifles suits my playstyle
better<00:01:16.250> anyway<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> Scotch<00:01:17.700> has<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> high

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
better anyway the Scotch has a high

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.080 
better anyway the Scotch has a high
damage<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.990> low<00:01:19.380> fire<00:01:19.740> rate<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:20.549> makes<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
damage a low fire rate which makes it a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.330 
damage a low fire rate which makes it a
really<00:01:21.360> good<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.869> rifle<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.130> could
