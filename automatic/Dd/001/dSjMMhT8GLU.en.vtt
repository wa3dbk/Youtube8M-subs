00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.299
 hello to all today I want 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.950
 give a little during editing 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.540
 I want to show how to change the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.860
 eye color in less than a minute 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.690
 I was often asked 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.190
 question that only trial was done 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.540
 quickly 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.170
 so what I did I imported the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.900
 picture of my model I then had to 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.070
 stitch the layers I'm going to call 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.830
 sir know it's really five games 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.140
 selected my or brush I 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.850
 assures me after inverting the noise 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.230
 on top leblanc underneath to go 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.610
 make my selection at the level of the game I 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.950
 see it will appear in red 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.860
 So what I do I just painter 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.050
 the inside of the eye that is going to 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.940
 find to be my selection has changed 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.989
 of color 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.989
 so I can take as it's done 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.870
 sometimes you make mistakes or the 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.510
 coming back in arial can have control z 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.540
 I want to do the other eye so everything 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.630
 what I have in front and the outline 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.960
 I picked my selection everything 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.960
 pay close 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.920
 the goal also of dupes what is good at 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.470
 calq and not work directly 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.870
 its original so I make sure that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.800
 moment of nothing to destroy like that 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.420
 when I tell you this is a course of 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.730
 retouch editing very quick forgiveness 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.640
 I selected as if you are going 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.350
 see all that is surrounded voice changes 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.020
 of color then I managed hands 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.690
 sway from there we know it's just 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.390
 with the sliders I can change the 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.370
 color of the eyes without it appearing 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.800
 that its exaggerating too much it ends up the same 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.910
 I can go find our complement 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.400
 colors that I can give to my 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.600
 models I prayed for a time a little 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.650
 little more natural like this one I 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:06.380
 will show there to 20 after we go from 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.380
 green to blue so recommended 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.560
 then I merge shot a few but 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.790
 here I am going to touch in less than ten 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.150
 minutes the color of my eyes 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.790
 models 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.260
 so I also take you out of other courses 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.290
 of retouching like that he very fast 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.120
 like how to put fossils 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.769
 awarded all these things there at each 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.730
 week finally I invite you to follow me 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.730
 thank you very much, goodbye
