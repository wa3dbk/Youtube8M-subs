sense of late down and spray it and
that's<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:15.079> stencil<00:03:15.680> bit<00:03:15.769> are<00:03:15.920> adding<00:03:16.400> and

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
that's it stencil bit are adding and

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.910 
that's it stencil bit are adding and
customizable<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.140> you<00:03:18.260> can<00:03:18.410> use<00:03:18.560> them<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.829> any

way you want so for example see how this
one<00:03:20.660> is<00:03:20.780> all<00:03:20.989> as<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> squares<00:03:21.889> yes<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:23.389> can<00:03:23.420> make

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
one is all as a squares yes you can make

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.319 
one is all as a squares yes you can make
it<00:03:23.959> hexagons<00:03:24.530> simply<00:03:25.430> by<00:03:25.609> lifting<00:03:26.090> and

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
it hexagons simply by lifting and

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.000 
it hexagons simply by lifting and
turning<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:26.900> every<00:03:27.200> single<00:03:27.380> time<00:03:27.560> that

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
turning it every single time that

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.190 
turning it every single time that
exactly<00:03:28.549> ility<00:03:28.940> for<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.269> exactly<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:30.019> mean

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
exactly ility for it exactly and I mean

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.360 
exactly ility for it exactly and I mean
look<00:03:30.350> at<00:03:30.440> some<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.709> these<00:03:30.799> down<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.130> like

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
look at some of these down this like

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.910 
look at some of these down this like
beautiful<00:03:31.910> dilullo<00:03:32.389> time<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.380> think<00:03:33.859> about

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
beautiful dilullo time and think about

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.590 
beautiful dilullo time and think about
this<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.549> make<00:03:34.639> embellishments<00:03:35.359> for<00:03:35.510> your

there's<00:05:54.010> different<00:05:54.160> mediums<00:05:54.670> where<00:05:54.910> you

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
there's different mediums where you

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.150 
there's different mediums where you
could<00:05:55.330> fill<00:05:55.570> these<00:05:55.720> with<00:05:55.780> a<00:05:55.990> texture<00:05:56.560> at<00:05:57.040> the

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
could fill these with a texture at the

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.790 
could fill these with a texture at the
fiber<00:05:57.400> cast<00:05:57.850> and<00:05:58.270> have<00:05:58.900> it<00:05:59.050> dry<00:05:59.260> see<00:05:59.650> this

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
fiber cast and have it dry see this

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.830

these<00:06:00.070> are<00:06:00.100> journaling<00:06:00.790> spaces<00:06:01.270> right<00:06:01.450> but

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
these are journaling spaces right but

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.720 
these are journaling spaces right but
think<00:06:02.080> about<00:06:02.170> using<00:06:02.620> this<00:06:02.950> in<00:06:03.130> a<00:06:03.190> repeating

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
think about using this in a repeating

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.030 
think about using this in a repeating
way<00:06:03.940> as<00:06:04.300> a<00:06:04.360> pattern<00:06:04.810> on<00:06:05.140> the<00:06:05.410> back<00:06:05.440> of<00:06:05.620> a<00:06:05.830> page
