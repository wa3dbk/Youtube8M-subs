00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
was 5th after the short program it's a

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.960 
was 5th after the short program it's a
very<00:02:47.769> deep<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.250> strong<00:02:48.400> field<00:02:48.700> they're<00:02:48.819> just

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
very deep and strong field they're just

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.000 
very deep and strong field they're just
not<00:02:49.060> old<00:02:49.299> enough<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.569> compete<00:02:50.109> and<00:02:50.260> Ksenia

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
not old enough to compete and Ksenia

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.710 
not old enough to compete and Ksenia
definitely<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.549> at<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.760> top<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.329> group

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.539 
and I think something special about
Ksenia<00:02:55.269> is<00:02:55.329> that<00:02:55.510> she<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:56.040> Russian<00:02:57.040> but<00:02:57.370> she
