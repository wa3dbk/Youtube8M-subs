reclaiming<00:00:07.200> an<00:00:07.500> old<00:00:08.030> canvas<00:00:09.030> using<00:00:09.570> gesso

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
all right so I found an old canvas that

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.080 
all right so I found an old canvas that
I<00:00:19.330> want<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:19.930> be<00:00:20.110> able<00:00:20.260> to<00:00:20.380> reuse<00:00:20.590> I<00:00:21.430> don't<00:00:21.940> like

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
I want to be able to reuse I don't like

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.580 
I want to be able to reuse I don't like
the<00:00:22.210> picture<00:00:22.510> on<00:00:22.600> it<00:00:22.750> something<00:00:23.050> I<00:00:23.110> started

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
the picture on it something I started

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.790 
the picture on it something I started
years<00:00:23.770> ago<00:00:24.160> so<00:00:25.090> I'm<00:00:25.720> going<00:00:26.020> to<00:00:26.080> take<00:00:26.560> some

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
years ago so I'm going to take some

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.780 
years ago so I'm going to take some
gesso<00:00:27.310> and<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:29.320> cover<00:00:29.740> it<00:00:29.920> up<00:00:30.040> it's<00:00:30.279> actually

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
gesso and just cover it up it's actually

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.750 
gesso and just cover it up it's actually
really<00:00:30.939> simple<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:32.349> nice<00:00:32.980> to<00:00:33.220> use<00:00:33.340> gesso

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
really simple it's nice to use gesso

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.430 
really simple it's nice to use gesso
just<00:00:33.970> because<00:00:34.330> it<00:00:34.840> creates<00:00:35.170> a<00:00:35.230> barrier

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
just because it creates a barrier

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.670 
just because it creates a barrier
between<00:00:35.770> your<00:00:36.040> old<00:00:36.310> painting<00:00:37.180> and<00:00:37.450> the<00:00:38.260> new

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
between your old painting and the new

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.310 
between your old painting and the new
fresh<00:00:39.010> painting<00:00:39.400> you're<00:00:39.550> going<00:00:39.730> to<00:00:39.790> start<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
fresh painting you're going to start you

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.410 
fresh painting you're going to start you
won't<00:00:41.410> have<00:00:41.620> any<00:00:41.770> lines<00:00:42.100> coming<00:00:42.579> through<00:00:43.150> and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
won't have any lines coming through and

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.020 
won't have any lines coming through and
it<00:00:43.540> also<00:00:43.930> if<00:00:44.890> you're<00:00:45.070> unsure<00:00:45.250> of<00:00:45.520> whether<00:00:45.790> or

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
it also if you're unsure of whether or

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.790 
it also if you're unsure of whether or
not<00:00:46.150> what<00:00:46.989> you're<00:00:47.110> going<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.260> be<00:00:47.380> working<00:00:47.680> on

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
not what you're going to be working on

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.010 
not what you're going to be working on
is<00:00:47.980> acid-free<00:00:48.460> it<00:00:48.910> creates<00:00:49.210> an<00:00:49.600> acid-free

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
is acid-free it creates an acid-free

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.580 
is acid-free it creates an acid-free
buffer<00:00:50.559> so<00:00:51.340> that's<00:00:51.520> helpful<00:00:51.760> too<00:00:52.090> but<00:00:52.989> yeah

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
buffer so that's helpful too but yeah

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.500 
buffer so that's helpful too but yeah
you<00:00:53.649> can<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:54.039> can<00:00:54.160> buy<00:00:54.309> any<00:00:54.820> kind<00:00:55.000> of<00:00:55.120> gesso

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
make sure you're using gesso that's made

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.049 
make sure you're using gesso that's made
for<00:01:01.510> acrylics<00:01:02.019> like<00:01:02.590> what<00:01:02.829> I'm<00:01:02.949> using<00:01:03.190> this<00:01:04.000> is

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
for acrylics like what I'm using this is

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.700 
for acrylics like what I'm using this is
really<00:01:04.480> thick<00:01:04.780> so<00:01:05.050> I'm<00:01:05.170> actually<00:01:05.379> going<00:01:05.650> to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
really thick so I'm actually going to

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.290 
really thick so I'm actually going to
just<00:01:05.920> dip<00:01:06.160> it<00:01:06.310> in<00:01:06.430> a<00:01:06.580> little<00:01:06.940> bit<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.120> water

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
just dip it in a little bit of water

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.870 
just dip it in a little bit of water
here<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:12.040> just<00:01:12.100> going<00:01:12.370> to<00:01:12.400> go<00:01:12.550> ahead<00:01:12.640> and

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
here and I'm just going to go ahead and

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.540 
here and I'm just going to go ahead and
cover<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.240> whole<00:01:13.390> painting<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:15.070> better<00:01:15.370> to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
cover the whole painting it's better to

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.990 
cover the whole painting it's better to
do<00:01:15.730> a<00:01:16.060> couple<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.720> thin<00:01:17.080> coats<00:01:17.670> rather<00:01:18.670> than

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
do a couple of thin coats rather than

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.880 
do a couple of thin coats rather than
one<00:01:19.330> really<00:01:19.900> thick<00:01:20.200> coat<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.530> we'll<00:01:23.710> go<00:01:23.860> ahead

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
one really thick coat so we'll go ahead

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.910 
one really thick coat so we'll go ahead
and<00:01:24.159> cover<00:01:24.369> that<00:01:24.520> up<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.590> will<00:01:29.710> give<00:01:29.890> me

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
and cover that up and that will give me

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.350 
and cover that up and that will give me
that'll<00:01:30.850> give<00:01:30.970> me<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.119> fresh<00:01:31.390> start<00:01:31.810> here<00:01:33.360> I'm

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
two coats on this one to make sure it

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.069 
two coats on this one to make sure it
there<00:01:54.460> was<00:01:54.579> a<00:01:54.610> nice<00:01:54.850> barrier<00:01:55.180> between<00:01:55.689> the<00:01:55.960> old

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
there was a nice barrier between the old

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.389 
there was a nice barrier between the old
painting<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.680> what<00:01:56.860> I'm<00:01:56.950> going<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.130> be<00:01:57.219> doing
