00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.330
 Like guys, I always want to reach 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.840
 goal of a thousand to ex per video because 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.699
 When I ask the license galle I help 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.439
 I do not know why when you do not ask people 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.710
 can not reach you 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.750
 But it's okay if we can get one. 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.750
 wonder and netão here our player 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.750
 I'm still going very poorly not yet 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.820
 I bought the coins and probably 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.950
 Do not you see me buying there during 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.350
 some time that you still can not 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.239
 Release my case is not for some 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.239
 episodes I still can not do it right 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.149
 but I have 2000 with yet more to 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.969
 to be able to buy what I want 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.489
 and that's just great already helps me 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.809
 Too bad, do not worry about my game with 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.980
 increasing my view we already have 80 is 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.780
 6686 would be great, huh? 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.500
 but we're still not there yet so good 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.150
 so it is not that the 'galley buried 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.490
 nor do we have that the father buried is and 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.170
 to help us there at the time there 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.479

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.460

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.460

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.310

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.680
 people to win from the old mexico and the people 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.600
 loses to the doctor if I'm not mistaken it 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.150
 I was winning if this takes a look 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.830

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:30.350

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.769
 time for the prisoner to be detained for 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.200
 people needing more time for our 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.030
 was poor even helping us 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.160
 the team over I think the criterion of 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.540
 evaluation of it is a bit wrong I 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.849
 I think it's a little wrong. 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.750
 An assessment of how we play intimate 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.659
 face and our performance was said let's go 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.120
 It's the coach 's room after the game in 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.250
 The next day, you're doing well. 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.290
 lately I like what I'm seeing 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.930
 I think we should put you 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.989
 more times out there I 'll put 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.579
 play more time in the next game 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:14.480
 then the game after the game lobby right 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:16.310
 Come on, it 's not in good faith, I'm just 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.620
 looking to see the latest stats 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.169
 game that matters if I will join you 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.400
 Let's put it that we 're going to ask 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:32.060
 he had a touch but I do not have juninho 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:33.979
 a new cup but when calling absolutely 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.110
 two heads is better than one 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.520
 You know I'm a fan of whoever puts it on. 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.520
 work after time 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.210
 look at this 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.669
 Do you remember that play in the 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.169
 first room when the king played and 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.260
 you were blocked 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.510
 that's right he said is we still 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.849
 It's close to mussum it's coming a little 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:01.070
 But he up we have to be the 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:03.620

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.449

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.729

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.020
 A little while ago, we would not talk to anyone. 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.610
 Well good people are on our side there. 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.900

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.180

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:18.880
 I was not confident I'd come in 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:22.120

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.190

 I let the guy free, the guy marks me. 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:32.380
 Old man is slutty, this is all spinning. 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.120

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:40.900

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.590
 and I 'm told to me, I do not 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:00.970
 I believe in this brother 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:05.800
 the beauty is so there in the fourth period and 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:08.650
 eventually the game will be won and we 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.389
 did not lose face again, guys 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.770
 out can not do anything not 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:14.860
 Can not help the team, the team is not 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.800
 So we 're just that. 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.259
 another poor performance of the people a being 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.570
 but it's really bad when we're still 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:26.530
 do not have the skills to do this, leave the 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:31.860
 guy is too bad but okay right to 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:34.330
 people are near the end of the plot there 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.590
 complicated in the complicated but 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.720
 I hope you enjoyed the episode if 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.880
 I wish I did not forget your license and also 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.490
 the comment as I said episode 1 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.889
 By day I'm doing a fast one over there. 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.840
 do not have too much work to do then 

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:47.949
 stay the day they have to accept that the 

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.560
 episode has to be fast yet 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:52.539
 playing two games because I do not play 

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.820
 it's full I do not have much content 

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:56.289
 still because I'm not yet a sixth 

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.150
 man at the team, right? 

00:07:56.289 --> 00:08:02.760
 but that hug as you see yourself in 

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.760
 brief and even more delicate
