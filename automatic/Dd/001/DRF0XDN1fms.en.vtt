of<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:16.430> things<00:00:16.609> that<00:00:16.789> we<00:00:16.910> did<00:00:17.180> some<00:00:17.480> of<00:00:17.570> the

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
of the things that we did some of the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.840 
of the things that we did some of the
things<00:00:17.810> that<00:00:17.990> we<00:00:18.140> investigated<00:00:19.070> where<00:00:19.640> did<00:00:19.730> we

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
things that we investigated where did we

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.490 
things that we investigated where did we
really<00:00:19.880> start<00:00:20.360> the<00:00:20.480> engineering<00:00:21.050> work<00:00:21.289> in

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
really start the engineering work in

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.170 
really start the engineering work in
developing<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:22.160> enhanced<00:00:22.610> experience<00:00:22.880> for

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
developing the enhanced experience for

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.500 
developing the enhanced experience for
windows<00:00:23.450> 7<00:00:24.250> sure<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.520> first<00:00:25.760> thing<00:00:25.940> we<00:00:26.090> did<00:00:26.300> is

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
windows 7 sure the first thing we did is

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.480 
windows 7 sure the first thing we did is
we<00:00:26.539> started<00:00:27.080> about<00:00:27.230> three<00:00:27.500> years<00:00:27.529> ago<00:00:27.920> he<00:00:28.279> said

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
we started about three years ago he said

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.849 
we started about three years ago he said
how<00:00:28.699> can<00:00:29.029> we<00:00:29.240> improve<00:00:29.410> speed<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:30.710> performance

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
how can we improve speed and performance

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.940 
how can we improve speed and performance
in<00:00:31.520> windows<00:00:31.850> 7<00:00:32.029> and<00:00:32.419> we<00:00:33.079> work<00:00:33.230> with<00:00:33.260> Microsoft

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
in windows 7 and we work with Microsoft

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.710 
in windows 7 and we work with Microsoft
and<00:00:34.220> we<00:00:34.280> called<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.640> program<00:00:35.030> velocity

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
and we called the program velocity

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.420 
and we called the program velocity
because<00:00:36.350> velocity<00:00:36.530> is<00:00:36.860> what<00:00:36.980> we<00:00:37.100> were<00:00:37.220> trying

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
because velocity is what we were trying

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.150 
because velocity is what we were trying
to<00:00:37.640> do<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.210> it<00:00:38.630> was<00:00:38.750> really<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:39.350> lot<00:00:39.680> of<00:00:39.860> hard

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
to do and it was really a lot of hard

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.770 
to do and it was really a lot of hard
work<00:00:40.220> because<00:00:40.760> we<00:00:40.880> do<00:00:40.970> you<00:00:41.030> think<00:00:41.239> about<00:00:41.600> it

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
work because we do you think about it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.569 
work because we do you think about it
there<00:00:41.899> is<00:00:41.930> probably<00:00:42.350> a<00:00:42.440> thousand<00:00:43.010> things<00:00:43.220> that

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
there is probably a thousand things that

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.000 
there is probably a thousand things that
contributes<00:00:44.090> to<00:00:44.270> boot<00:00:44.510> time<00:00:44.809> shut<00:00:45.470> down<00:00:45.649> time

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
contributes to boot time shut down time

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.310 
contributes to boot time shut down time
and<00:00:46.190> resume<00:00:46.520> time<00:00:46.790> and<00:00:47.210> like<00:00:47.510> anything<00:00:47.899> it's

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
and resume time and like anything it's

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.560 
and resume time and like anything it's
kind<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.559> like<00:00:48.680> a<00:00:48.739> chain<00:00:49.130> it's<00:00:49.489> only<00:00:49.969> as<00:00:50.210> good

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
kind of like a chain it's only as good

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.590 
kind of like a chain it's only as good
as<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.530> weakest<00:00:51.950> link<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:52.910> we<00:00:53.090> measured

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
as the weakest link so we measured

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.389 
as the weakest link so we measured
everything<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.620> then<00:00:54.800> we<00:00:54.890> started<00:00:55.219> looking

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
everything and then we started looking

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.060 
everything and then we started looking
at<00:00:55.790> what<00:00:56.120> was<00:00:56.360> taking<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.870> longest<00:00:57.140> time<00:00:57.440> in

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
at what was taking the longest time in

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.190 
at what was taking the longest time in
the<00:00:58.520> different<00:00:58.850> operations<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.600> how<00:00:59.750> can<00:00:59.989> we

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
the different operations and how can we

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.959 
the different operations and how can we
fix<00:01:00.469> that<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:00.980> we<00:01:01.070> just<00:01:01.100> started<00:01:01.399> knocking

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
fix that and we just started knocking

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.850 
fix that and we just started knocking
them<00:01:02.270> off<00:01:02.390> one<00:01:02.750> by<00:01:02.780> one<00:01:03.050> they<00:01:03.469> were<00:01:03.530> course

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
them off one by one they were course

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.600 
them off one by one they were course

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.300 
drivers biles hardware startups savings
and<00:01:08.270> as<00:01:08.420> we<00:01:08.630> worked<00:01:08.900> it<00:01:09.110> down<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.950> next<00:01:10.220> thing

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
and as we worked it down the next thing

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.710 
and as we worked it down the next thing
became<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.790> highest<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:11.270> we<00:01:11.330> worked<00:01:11.510> back

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
became the highest and we worked back

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.300 
became the highest and we worked back
down<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.229> we<00:01:12.680> were<00:01:12.770> able<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:12.979> get<00:01:13.159> an

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
down and we were able to get an

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.700 
down and we were able to get an
unbelievable<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.270> proven<00:01:14.780> in<00:01:15.020> our<00:01:15.170> boot<00:01:15.409> time

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.170 
unbelievable and proven in our boot time
or<00:01:16.190> resume<00:01:16.670> time<00:01:16.939> or<00:01:17.299> suspend<00:01:17.750> time

across the board obviously a lot of

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.390 
across the board obviously a lot of
background<00:01:23.000> engineering<00:01:23.810> work<00:01:24.159> just<00:01:25.159> one

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
background engineering work just one

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.160 
background engineering work just one
specific<00:01:25.760> example<00:01:26.180> of<00:01:26.690> something<00:01:26.870> that<00:01:26.990> we

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
specific example of something that we

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.080 
specific example of something that we
did<00:01:27.409> something<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:27.800> we<00:01:27.979> tuned<00:01:28.310> something

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
did something that we tuned something

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.469 
did something that we tuned something
that<00:01:29.210> we<00:01:29.330> fixed<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:30.200> make<00:01:30.409> this<00:01:30.619> work<00:01:31.450> so<00:01:32.450> a

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
that we fixed to make this work so a

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.660 
that we fixed to make this work so a
great<00:01:32.750> example<00:01:32.810> is<00:01:33.590> we<00:01:34.159> were<00:01:34.280> taking<00:01:34.580> about

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
great example is we were taking about

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.420 
great example is we were taking about
six<00:01:35.240> seconds<00:01:35.660> to<00:01:35.869> you<00:01:36.140> suspend<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:36.979> our

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
six seconds to you suspend and our

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.700 
six seconds to you suspend and our
target<00:01:37.970> where<00:01:38.210> we<00:01:38.300> are<00:01:38.420> today<00:01:38.600> is<00:01:39.110> less<00:01:39.440> than<00:01:39.650> a

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
target where we are today is less than a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.100 
target where we are today is less than a
second<00:01:40.160> and<00:01:40.190> we<00:01:40.310> found<00:01:40.490> one<00:01:40.790> driver<00:01:41.119> popular

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
second and we found one driver popular

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.810 
second and we found one driver popular
wireless<00:01:42.530> driver<00:01:42.830> and<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.400> was<00:01:43.520> taking<00:01:43.759> about

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
wireless driver and I was taking about

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.200 
wireless driver and I was taking about
five<00:01:44.180> seconds<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:45.259> suspect<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:47.030> we<00:01:47.119> were

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
five seconds to suspect and we were

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.700 
five seconds to suspect and we were
trying<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.540> figure<00:01:47.869> out<00:01:47.930> why<00:01:48.170> was<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.530> five

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
trying to figure out why was it five

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.550 
trying to figure out why was it five
seconds<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.550> what<00:01:49.640> we<00:01:49.729> found<00:01:49.970> was<00:01:50.410> when<00:01:51.410> you

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
seconds and what we found was when you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.160 
seconds and what we found was when you
do<00:01:51.710> driver<00:01:52.030> certification<00:01:53.030> it's<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.930> very

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
do driver certification it's a very

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.050 
do driver certification it's a very
robust<00:01:54.619> test<00:01:54.979> because<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.460> needs<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.759> work<00:01:55.910> on

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
robust test because it needs to work on

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.969 
robust test because it needs to work on
the<00:01:56.180> Royal<00:01:56.360> conditions<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.140> when<00:01:57.830> the

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
the Royal conditions and when the

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.010 
the Royal conditions and when the
examples<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:58.910> tribe<00:01:59.180> would<00:01:59.420> needed<00:01:59.750> for

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
examples is this tribe would needed for

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.279 
examples is this tribe would needed for
makes<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.590> continuous<00:02:01.100> memory<00:02:01.720> but<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:03.020> test

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
makes of continuous memory but the test

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.230 
makes of continuous memory but the test
case<00:02:03.560> was<00:02:03.800> setups<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.250> we<00:02:04.399> couldn't<00:02:04.610> get<00:02:04.910> for

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
case was setups and we couldn't get for

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.910 
case was setups and we couldn't get for
a<00:02:05.270> million<00:02:05.570> continuous<00:02:05.990> acted<00:02:06.410> so<00:02:06.619> what<00:02:06.800> it

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
a million continuous acted so what it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.609 
a million continuous acted so what it
did<00:02:07.160> it<00:02:07.340> did<00:02:07.369> 4k<00:02:08.239> at<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.479> time<00:02:08.840> times<00:02:09.350> like<00:02:09.530> a

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
did it did 4k at a time times like a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.949 
did it did 4k at a time times like a
thousand<00:02:10.039> times<00:02:10.160> that's<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.820> five<00:02:11.060> seconds<00:02:11.510> so

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
thousand times that's a five seconds so

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.229 
thousand times that's a five seconds so
we<00:02:12.110> made<00:02:12.320> a<00:02:12.350> change<00:02:12.709> where<00:02:13.100> we<00:02:13.340> said<00:02:13.580> try<00:02:13.940> for

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
we made a change where we said try for

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.660 
we made a change where we said try for
for<00:02:14.450> Meg<00:02:14.660> first<00:02:15.019> and<00:02:15.709> with<00:02:15.860> four<00:02:16.100> gigs<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.550> two

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
for Meg first and with four gigs and two

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.280 
for Meg first and with four gigs and two
gigs<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:17.030> memory<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.390> can<00:02:17.510> get<00:02:17.630> for<00:02:17.840> meg<00:02:18.019> and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
gigs of memory you can get for meg and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.670 
gigs of memory you can get for meg and
you<00:02:18.800> get<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.040> great<00:02:20.000> if<00:02:20.330> not<00:02:20.510> then<00:02:20.810> do<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.230> 4k

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
you get that great if not then do the 4k

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.440 
you get that great if not then do the 4k
at<00:02:21.769> a<00:02:21.830> time<00:02:22.010> we<00:02:22.310> cut<00:02:22.489> that<00:02:22.640> driver<00:02:22.940> from<00:02:23.209> five

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
at a time we cut that driver from five

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.710 
at a time we cut that driver from five
seconds<00:02:24.019> to<00:02:24.170> 200<00:02:24.890> milliseconds<00:02:25.579> which<00:02:25.820> allow

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
seconds to 200 milliseconds which allow

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.479 
seconds to 200 milliseconds which allow
is<00:02:26.930> no<00:02:27.110> longer<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.590> critical<00:02:28.010> path<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.430> we

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
is no longer the critical path and we

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.550 
is no longer the critical path and we
moved<00:02:28.670> on<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.090> next<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.570> by<00:02:29.959> just<00:02:30.170> keep<00:02:30.410> on

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
moved on to the next and by just keep on

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.170 
moved on to the next and by just keep on
working<00:02:30.920> these<00:02:31.010> things<00:02:31.280> down<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:31.760> gets<00:02:31.850> under

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
working these things down it gets under

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.310 
working these things down it gets under
a<00:02:32.209> second<00:02:33.670> alright<00:02:34.670> that's<00:02:34.790> terrific<00:02:35.660> example

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
a second alright that's terrific example

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.819 
a second alright that's terrific example
out<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:37.430> know<00:02:38.060> we<00:02:38.239> also<00:02:38.390> look<00:02:38.720> at<00:02:38.870> our<00:02:38.959> BIOS<00:02:39.410> we

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
out I know we also look at our BIOS we

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.759 
out I know we also look at our BIOS we
look<00:02:40.010> dead<00:02:40.450> order<00:02:41.450> we<00:02:41.930> look<00:02:42.140> at<00:02:42.320> legacy

devices that we still support it in bios
made<00:02:45.350> some<00:02:45.560> changes<00:02:45.769> did<00:02:46.160> some<00:02:46.430> tuning<00:02:46.730> there

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
made some changes did some tuning there

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.940 
made some changes did some tuning there
can<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.150> tell<00:02:47.329> me<00:02:47.420> more<00:02:47.540> about<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:47.950> that's

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
can you tell me more about that that's

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.280 
can you tell me more about that that's
another<00:02:49.430> great<00:02:49.730> point<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.630> when<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.870> come<00:02:51.110> to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
another great point so when you come to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.080 
another great point so when you come to
the<00:02:51.410> desktop<00:02:51.769> what<00:02:52.160> do<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.310> want<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.670> do<00:02:52.820> you

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
the desktop what do you want to do you

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.280 
the desktop what do you want to do you
want<00:02:53.329> to<00:02:53.390> do<00:02:53.510> things<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:53.989> make<00:02:54.049> you

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
want to do things that make you

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.319 
want to do things that make you
productive<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:55.340> we<00:02:55.579> looked<00:02:55.820> at<00:02:55.940> everything

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
productive so we looked at everything

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.330 
productive so we looked at everything
that<00:02:56.570> comes<00:02:56.989> up<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.410> says<00:02:57.590> well<00:02:57.860> do<00:02:58.010> we<00:02:58.130> need

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
that comes up and says well do we need

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.450 
that comes up and says well do we need
to<00:02:58.400> do<00:02:58.730> this<00:02:58.910> right

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
to do this right

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.190 
to do this right
now<00:02:59.550> before<00:02:59.910> we<00:03:00.000> give<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.450> desktop<00:03:00.870> or<00:03:01.080> we

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
now before we give you the desktop or we

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.860 
now before we give you the desktop or we
can<00:03:01.470> we<00:03:01.650> delay<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:03.030> later<00:03:03.300> them<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.750> don't

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
can we delay it to later them you don't

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.960 
can we delay it to later them you don't
notice<00:03:04.080> as<00:03:04.620> small<00:03:04.980> example<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.490> USB

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
notice as small example is the USB

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.020 
notice as small example is the USB
camera<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:07.050> instead<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.670> enumerated<00:03:08.670> and

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
camera so instead of enumerated and

loading the driver at time 0 read the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.790 
loading the driver at time 0 read the
label<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.630> after<00:03:12.990> you<00:03:13.110> got<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.410> desktop

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
label so after you got to the desktop

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.680 
label so after you got to the desktop
and<00:03:14.100> we<00:03:14.190> did<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.400> while<00:03:14.520> you<00:03:14.610> were<00:03:14.760> item<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.600> we

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
and we did it while you were item so we

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.060 
and we did it while you were item so we
do<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.930> with<00:03:16.050> all<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.230> hardware<00:03:16.800> we<00:03:16.950> only

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
do that with all the hardware we only

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.550 
do that with all the hardware we only
broke<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.580> minimum<00:03:18.000> necessary<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:19.080> get<00:03:19.260> to

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
broke the minimum necessary to get to

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.620 
broke the minimum necessary to get to
the<00:03:19.710> desktop<00:03:20.010> American<00:03:20.460> operation<00:03:21.000> up<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.570> we

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
the desktop American operation up and we

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.220 
the desktop American operation up and we
cut<00:03:21.900> down<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.320> booth<00:03:22.500> time<00:03:22.800> to<00:03:23.750> less<00:03:24.750> than<00:03:24.960> 30

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
cut down the booth time to less than 30

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.660 
cut down the booth time to less than 30
seconds<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.040> some<00:03:26.250> systems<00:03:26.430> we're

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
seconds and on some systems we're

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.430 
seconds and on some systems we're
actually<00:03:26.790> getting<00:03:26.970> 10<00:03:27.300> second<00:03:27.750> scoop<00:03:27.990> typing

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
actually getting 10 second scoop typing

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.050 
actually getting 10 second scoop typing
time<00:03:28.650> you've<00:03:28.860> been<00:03:28.890> on<00:03:29.100> button<00:03:29.460> so<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:29.820> have<00:03:30.000> a

time you've been on button so you have a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.700 
time you've been on button so you have a
working<00:03:30.300> that<00:03:30.450> stuff<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:31.650> just

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
working that stuff so it's just

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.680 
working that stuff so it's just
rewarding<00:03:32.460> things<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.880> when<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.120> really<00:03:33.450> need

that obviously includes a lot of things

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.580 
that obviously includes a lot of things
that<00:03:39.150> we<00:03:39.300> personally<00:03:39.810> had<00:03:39.990> direct<00:03:40.350> control

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
that we personally had direct control

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.880 
that we personally had direct control
over<00:03:40.800> our<00:03:41.100> drivers<00:03:41.940> our<00:03:42.240> BIOS<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.710> there<00:03:43.830> are

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
over our drivers our BIOS but there are

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.920 
over our drivers our BIOS but there are
also<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.160> lot<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.460> things<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:44.970> we<00:03:45.330> worked<00:03:45.750> with

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
also a lot of things that we worked with

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.480 
also a lot of things that we worked with
that<00:03:46.200> were<00:03:46.350> actually<00:03:46.530> native<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:47.190> windows

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
that were actually native to windows

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.330 
that were actually native to windows
seven<00:03:48.530> right<00:03:49.530> we<00:03:49.650> work<00:03:49.830> directly<00:03:50.040> with

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
seven right we work directly with

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.100 
seven right we work directly with
Microsoft<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.210> very<00:03:51.420> involved<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:51.960> we

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
Microsoft is a very involved this we

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.990 
Microsoft is a very involved this we
used<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.350> lot<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.740> test<00:03:53.100> equipment<00:03:53.670> in<00:03:53.790> test

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
used a lot of a test equipment in test

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.570 
used a lot of a test equipment in test
cases<00:03:54.270> one<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.690> our<00:03:55.020> suppliers<00:03:55.320> so<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.310> across

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
cases one of our suppliers so is across

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.420 
cases one of our suppliers so is across
the<00:03:56.640> entire<00:03:57.290> ecosystem<00:03:58.290> here<00:03:58.800> on<00:03:58.980> those<00:03:59.100> small

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
the entire ecosystem here on those small

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.350 
the entire ecosystem here on those small
example<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.090> on<00:04:00.180> Windows<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.930> on<00:04:01.410> shutdown

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
example and on Windows is on shutdown

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.180 
example and on Windows is on shutdown
shutdown<00:04:03.360> uses<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.960> lot<00:04:04.140> of<00:04:04.200> services<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.920> make

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
shutdown uses a lot of services to make

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.060 
shutdown uses a lot of services to make
a<00:04:05.220> nice<00:04:05.550> thing<00:04:06.270> but<00:04:06.900> something<00:04:07.260> took<00:04:07.470> an<00:04:07.680> ad<00:04:07.890> is

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
a nice thing but something took an ad is

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.380 
a nice thing but something took an ad is
significant<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.730> leg<00:04:08.880> time<00:04:09.180> for<00:04:09.330> the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
significant the leg time for the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.820 
significant the leg time for the
shutdown<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.020> say<00:04:10.170> is<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.440> really

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
shutdown so you say is this really

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.160 
shutdown so you say is this really
needed<00:04:11.280> why<00:04:11.670> don't<00:04:11.850> we<00:04:11.910> just<00:04:12.060> disable<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.900> so

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
needed why don't we just disable this so

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.110 
needed why don't we just disable this so
we<00:04:13.290> don't<00:04:13.440> do<00:04:13.770> this<00:04:14.010> time<00:04:14.400> thing<00:04:14.730> we're<00:04:15.000> going

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
we don't do this time thing we're going

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.610 
we don't do this time thing we're going
to<00:04:15.240> take<00:04:15.330> seconds<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.020> seconds<00:04:16.380> off<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.530> shot

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
to take seconds and seconds off the shot

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.470 
to take seconds and seconds off the shot
down<00:04:16.950> five<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.370> now<00:04:17.790> we<00:04:17.850> shut<00:04:18.090> down<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.360> less

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
down five and now we shut down in less

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.729 
down five and now we shut down in less
than<00:04:18.570> 15<00:04:18.930> seconds

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
than 15 seconds

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.249 
than 15 seconds
30<00:04:20.190> 40<00:04:20.489> seconds<00:04:20.910> of<00:04:21.000> quarters<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.169> was

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
30 40 seconds of quarters so it was

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:23.809 
30 40 seconds of quarters so it was
really<00:04:22.380> across<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.800> entire<00:04:23.250> ecosystem

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:23.819 
really across the entire ecosystem

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.120 
really across the entire ecosystem
what's<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.419> was<00:04:24.539> just<00:04:24.720> hard<00:04:25.020> or<00:04:25.349> analyzing

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
what's it was just hard or analyzing

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.640 
what's it was just hard or analyzing
every<00:04:26.699> little<00:04:27.060> thing<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.229> was<00:04:28.349> kind<00:04:28.590> of

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
every little thing and it was kind of

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.650 
every little thing and it was kind of
like<00:04:28.830> rap<00:04:29.580> we<00:04:29.789> had<00:04:29.940> like<00:04:30.060> a<00:04:30.090> death<00:04:30.389> by<00:04:30.630> a

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
like rap we had like a death by a

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.170 
like rap we had like a death by a
thousand<00:04:31.169> razor<00:04:31.380> cuts<00:04:31.740> so<00:04:32.490> is<00:04:32.639> there<00:04:32.940> was<00:04:33.090> that

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
thousand razor cuts so is there was that

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.390 
thousand razor cuts so is there was that
one<00:04:33.240> thing<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:33.930> was<00:04:34.229> super<00:04:34.680> traumatic<00:04:35.250> for

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
one thing that was super traumatic for

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.159 
one thing that was super traumatic for
those<00:04:35.580> all<00:04:35.789> these<00:04:35.910> little<00:04:36.210> things<00:04:36.360> yes<00:04:37.050> we

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
those all these little things yes we

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.350 
those all these little things yes we
kept<00:04:37.410> on<00:04:37.530> looking<00:04:37.729> clearly<00:04:38.729> it<00:04:38.849> was<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:38.970> team

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
kept on looking clearly it was a team

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.559 
kept on looking clearly it was a team
like<00:04:39.660> many<00:04:39.900> people<00:04:40.169> two<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.889> three<00:04:41.039> years<00:04:41.569> and

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569 
like many people two to three years and

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.089 
like many people two to three years and
we're<00:04:42.780> not<00:04:42.900> stopping<00:04:43.440> now<00:04:43.470> because<00:04:43.919> if<00:04:44.039> you

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
we're not stopping now because if you

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.370 
we're not stopping now because if you
take<00:04:44.130> our<00:04:44.430> eye<00:04:44.490> off<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.940> prize<00:04:45.380> whistling

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
take our eye off the prize whistling

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.110 
take our eye off the prize whistling
we're<00:04:46.500> going<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.680> creep<00:04:46.889> up<00:04:47.039> again<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:47.970> we're

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
we're going to creep up again so we're

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.150 
we're going to creep up again so we're
keeping<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.569> team<00:04:48.840> in<00:04:49.020> place<00:04:49.050> we're<00:04:49.860> still

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
keeping a team in place we're still

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.189 
keeping a team in place we're still
analyzing<00:04:50.370> every<00:04:51.060> news<00:04:51.210> drop<00:04:51.509> everything<00:04:51.960> to

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
analyzing every news drop everything to

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.439 
analyzing every news drop everything to
make<00:04:52.530> sure<00:04:52.650> we<00:04:52.830> know<00:04:52.949> we<00:04:53.909> kill<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.180> at<00:04:54.360> the

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
make sure we know we kill it at the

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.149 
make sure we know we kill it at the
level<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.810> savvy<00:04:55.229> so<00:04:55.650> it's<00:04:55.800> going<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:56.009> be<00:04:56.099> an

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
level of savvy so it's going to be an

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.640 
level of savvy so it's going to be an
ongoing<00:04:56.449> continuous<00:04:57.449> thing<00:04:57.659> to<00:04:58.319> keep<00:04:58.470> these

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
ongoing continuous thing to keep these

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.670 
ongoing continuous thing to keep these
velocities<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.870> obviously<00:05:01.169> that<00:05:01.259> bodes<00:05:01.590> well

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
velocities and obviously that bodes well

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.230 
velocities and obviously that bodes well
for<00:05:01.800> future<00:05:02.099> development<00:05:02.490> for<00:05:02.970> us<00:05:03.060> we've

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
for future development for us we've

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.480 
for future development for us we've
