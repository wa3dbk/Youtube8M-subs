it's a limited edition and that's the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.200 
it's a limited edition and that's the
problem<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.629> EA<00:00:39.809> EA<00:00:40.469> games<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.129> they<00:00:41.820> can

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
problem with EA EA games if they can

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.569 
problem with EA EA games if they can
make<00:00:42.239> shitty<00:00:42.690> car<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.050> good<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.739> their<00:00:43.980> with

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
make shitty car is good with their with

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.970 
make shitty car is good with their with
a<00:00:44.610> few<00:00:45.059> got<00:00:45.239> Bay<00:00:45.450> in-game<00:00:45.870> cash<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.559> that's

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
a few got Bay in-game cash and that's

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.680 
a few got Bay in-game cash and that's
what<00:00:47.250> their<00:00:47.399> goal<00:00:47.579> ms<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.360> guy<00:00:48.510> has<00:00:48.660> a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
what their goal ms so this guy has a
Chevrolet<00:00:49.230> Corvette<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.129> think<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.670> one

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
Chevrolet Corvette and I think it's one
