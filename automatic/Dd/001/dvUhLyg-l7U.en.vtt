00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 the mobile in a horse and the theme that 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.830
 anticipate with me is to come back and with 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.380
 the guest that has to do with good 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.880
 one of the teaching guilds we are 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.559
 presenting guillermo parodi that 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.580
 Deputy General Secretary of the Union 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.170
 of education workers 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.970
 welcome as he rose thank you very much 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.369
 we are talking about closing one side 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.029
 of degrees and by the other diffusion is not 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.910
 true there are backgrounds and that this has 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.490
 happened sometime with some government 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 in the public system no no in these 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.120
 characteristics has sometimes happened in 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.250
 some middle school especially 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.250
 shifts nights that there was low tuition and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.379
 two divisions of the same merged 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.920
 of the environment the same year we are 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.680
 speaking that they are going to close 221 degrees 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.800
 to work when it says merge is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.980
 a euphemism that closes one 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.640
 and join with others there is a 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.010
 piling students 221 degrees 143 of 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.050
 elementary school 53 of schools 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.449
 25 medias of schools and with what 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.540
 arguments comes the ministry of 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.550
 education of the city they have a 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.500
 argument that is that schools have 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.480
 low enrollment then for 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.240
 according to the criterion that is in them for 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.710
 better pedagogical functioning 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.450
 join the two divisions so that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.990
 have an idea what would happen when 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.760
 together 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.190
 I have some data nothing more to mode 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.770
 illustrative there is a school school 4 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.560
 the fourth quarter in the mouth a quarter 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.080
 grade to pass to have 35 students is 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.729
 the pedagogical improvement that says 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.530
 Esteban Bullrich that will allow 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.380
 when to teach the guys that is 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.900
 accepted that a teacher can cover 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.899
 to provide that we are talking about that 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.970
 it also depends on them not clear 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.649
 the level depends on the modality 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.970
 characteristic of the population because if 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.000
 we do not just stay a number and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.130
 it seems that the number is 15 25 30 and it's 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.080
 exactly the same for everyone 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.310
 Of course there are schools with a population 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.640
 migrant 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.680
 with vulnerable sectors that need 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.530
 of course a greater dedication of his 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.850
 tables we even have data there 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.289
 schools that by size all the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.450
 classrooms are the same there are schools that 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.160
 we have school 22 of district 18 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.720
 of the neighborhood lines whose classrooms are very 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.310
 chiquitita all have low enrollment 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.100
 because more students do not enter than you are 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.660
 now 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.160
 if one starts doing an evaluation of 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.020
 this and I ask the two about everything 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.000
 what does it have to do with the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.400
 teaching 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.390
 what happens in a technical school for what 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.630
 It helps me close a division and join 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.040
 two divisions of the same year if I in 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.660
 a technical school I can not enable 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.450
 a garden room if that's the 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.030
 excuse for example they pose that 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.050
 with this they will open sections of the level 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.780
 initial missing in the city from now on 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.360
 that's nonsense for the teacher of 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.530
 grade has a training and the level 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.770
 initial has another but on top of that 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.660
 it's not about closing a degree for 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.000
 open to a middle school 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.100
 or technique is not that what 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.370
 It is about building institutions of 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.200
 initial level this government in five 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.239
 years of management just developed its 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.770
 first school on Monday that is 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.569
 inaugurated a middle school at home 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.130
 yellow has not built school to 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.980
 initial level has not built school to 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.300
 primary level almost all these schools 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.400
 what are we talking about that merge and 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.380
 close the courses are from the north 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.780
 from the city the southern part of the city 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.410
 we have active schools students 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.060
 35 38 42 students there is a school the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.250
 district 19 in the area of Lugano that the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.230
 last year so they have idea had 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.440
 to get the doors to the closet of the 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.080
 teacher to get more banks and not 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.930
 the doors do not get in the way then 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.690
 where there is overcrowding of students 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.519
 create schools transfer students from 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.970
 the southern part of the city to belgrano 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.680
 almagro palermo in groups so that 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.840
 because they do not have vacancies in the area they are 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.280
 what are called the exact derivatives 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.519
 those guys lose two hours of classes 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.519
 per day 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.460
 they are also not in your neighborhood and this is 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.040
 very serious because neither to school 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.690
 that will accommodate them is prepared for 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.870
 that there is a good reception of those 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.220
 students technologically part of what 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.700
 ideal is that the boy go to school 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.010
 of the neighborhood be with your friends with your 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.960
 schoolmates that is the sense 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.360
 of the public school and the truth that 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.260
 this is something like we said at the beginning 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.970
 no background to go rounding and 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.370
 which one do you want that would be the solution 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.470
 then I think it's something very 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.810
 simple that is the construction of this 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.730
 chances of getting the initials 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.470
 society of gardens not only initial 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.580
 in the area about the guys who want 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.080
 in high school they have to 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.640
 opt exclusively for the night shift 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.130
 there are no secondary schools in turn 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.170
 day morning and afternoon in the southern area of 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.670
 the city I imagine any father 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.410
 that your boy finishes seventh grade a 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.030
 13 year old boy wants his son 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.970
 still in high school not tomorrow 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.740
 late that is going to be one night and on the other 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.270
 side something that we have asked 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.070
 to the government that there are policies of 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.680
 registration retention and recovery 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.500
 these schools are an investment 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.600
 there was no active policy of 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.430
 license plate retention and recovery 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.259
 for the public schools of the city 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.270
 now what is the fight plan because 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.850
 yesterday there was a mobilization of the ute 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.330
 was also present the commission of 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.659
 party education 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.449
 of law is not true but from here on 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.400
 more because there are interesting 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.800
 holy mobilizations of families for the 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.099
 public school how it is articulated with 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.009
 this we are working together 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.240
 with different teachers and parents because 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.919
 we are also we are 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.770
 accompanying this mobilization that 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.230
 does in school 8 of the eighth district 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.060
 at noon today at noon at twelve o'clock and 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.040
 average in rivadavia of caracas in the 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.470
 school district number 22 flowers 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.150
 There will also be a mobilization to 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.540
 supervising the supervisor of that 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.160
 district even goes further and wants 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.950
 close more grades than those proposed 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.450
 Minister Bullrich on Monday goes to 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.390
 have in all schools in the city 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.730
 in between the two shifts at noon 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.230
 flying hugs broadcast campaign 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.870
 so that parents know this 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:19.380
 situation in park and also in parks 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.240
 in law streets and we plan to get to the 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.250
 next friday with a great 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.080
 mobilization to the head of government to 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.790
 at 6:00 p.m. well we thank you 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.510
 Assistant Secretary General of Ute 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.510
 etc 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.460
 yes, I think it is worrying 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.950
 this because it is a real scam 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.470
 when this happens in the private school 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.120
 a father goes to the address and says no 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:49.230
 When I wrote down I was told that I was going to 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.090
 have 20 like now and 35 well it's about 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.440
 really to summon parents already 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.560
 the teachers for what 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.670
 run over really can not follow 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.200
 going forward 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.200
 thank you very much while you also
