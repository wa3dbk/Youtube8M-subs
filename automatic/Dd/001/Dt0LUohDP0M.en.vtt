00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
doing on how to speedrun Bioshock I've

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.270 
doing on how to speedrun Bioshock I've
been<00:00:06.509> asked<00:00:06.750> many<00:00:06.810> times<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.350> go<00:00:07.770> over<00:00:08.040> certain

been asked many times to go over certain

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.220 
been asked many times to go over certain
tricks<00:00:08.700> here<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:08.970> there<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.929> thought<00:00:10.110> I'd

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
tricks here and there and I thought I'd

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.530 
tricks here and there and I thought I'd
go<00:00:10.500> ahead<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.769> put<00:00:11.070> out<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> full<00:00:11.580> guide<00:00:12.179> for

in order to speedrun this game there's
two<00:00:24.960> things<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.410> need<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.740> before

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
we actually get into the game itself any

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.439 
we actually get into the game itself any
version<00:00:28.560> will<00:00:28.710> work<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> speed<00:00:29.519> run<00:00:29.730> pc

version will work for the speed run pc
or<00:00:30.779> console<00:00:31.199> should<00:00:31.500> all<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> same

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160

tricks as far as I'm aware I'm doing

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.410 
tricks as far as I'm aware I'm doing
this<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:34.890> PC<00:00:35.340> with<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> current<00:00:36.149> Steam

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
this on PC with the current Steam

this on PC with the current Steam
version<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.930> version<00:00:37.110> 1.1<00:00:37.770> which<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
version of version 1.1 which is just the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
version of version 1.1 which is just the
least<00:00:39.300> likely<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> crash<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.860> any

least likely to crash so if you have any

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.250 
least likely to crash so if you have any
problems<00:00:41.460> feel<00:00:41.579> free<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.969> ask<00:00:42.390> me<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.899> I

problems feel free to ask me and I

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.590 
problems feel free to ask me and I
should<00:00:43.649> be<00:00:43.800> able<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.040> guide<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.489> into<00:00:44.640> getting

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
should be able to guide you into getting

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.389 
should be able to guide you into getting
this<00:00:45.809> working<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.829> second<00:00:47.160> thing<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.370> need

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
this working the second thing you need

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.060 
this working the second thing you need
to<00:00:47.610> know<00:00:47.780> is<00:00:48.780> we've<00:00:49.110> run<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.469> game<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.710> easy

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
to know is we've run this game on easy

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.600 
to know is we've run this game on easy
and<00:00:50.719> that's<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.989> two<00:00:52.140> reasons<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and that's for two reasons one the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.790 
and that's for two reasons one the
speedrun<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.300> about<00:00:54.600> fighting<00:00:55.110> at<00:00:55.739> all

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
speedrun is not about fighting at all

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.849 
speedrun is not about fighting at all
except<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.730> near<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> end<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:58.559> really

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
except for near the end and it really

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.529 
except for near the end and it really
doesn't<00:00:59.129> matter<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.270> out<00:01:00.449> of

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
doesn't matter so you just go out of

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.630 
doesn't matter so you just go out of
your<00:01:00.570> way<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> get<00:01:01.199> more<00:01:01.350> supplies<00:01:01.739> which<00:01:02.489> is

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
your way to get more supplies which is

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.880 
your way to get more supplies which is
slower<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.019> also<00:01:04.170> allows<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
slower and it also allows you to do a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.370 
slower and it also allows you to do a
trick<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.400> Apollo<00:01:05.700> Square<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.840> want<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.260> do

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
trick in Apollo Square so you want to do

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320 
trick in Apollo Square so you want to do
tricks<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.220> want<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.490> fast<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.030> that's

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
tricks and you want to go fast so that's

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:29.400 
tricks and you want to go fast so that's
why<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.630> use<00:01:09.689> easy

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.370 

they<00:01:30.410> told<00:01:30.680> me<00:01:31.480> son<00:01:33.010> you're<00:01:34.010> special<00:01:35.260> you<00:01:36.260> were

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
they told me son you're special you were

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
they told me son you're special you were
born<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.830> do<00:01:36.950> great<00:01:37.430> things

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:02:41.660 

you<00:01:40.940> know<00:01:41.120> what<00:01:42.760> they<00:01:43.760> were<00:01:43.820> right

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.039 

so<00:02:42.670> after<00:02:42.909> you<00:02:43.000> sat<00:02:43.239> through<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.510> intro<00:02:43.810> you

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
so after you sat through the intro you

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.500 
so after you sat through the intro you
end<00:02:44.500> up<00:02:44.590> at<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.859> crash<00:02:45.069> site<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.459> this<00:02:46.329> is<00:02:46.480> a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
end up at the crash site and this is a

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.020 
end up at the crash site and this is a
very<00:02:46.780> straightforward<00:02:47.109> route<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.670> we<00:02:48.790> just<00:02:48.909> go

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
very straightforward route so we just go

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.789 
very straightforward route so we just go
forward<00:02:49.420> through<00:02:49.659> the<00:02:49.900> fire<00:02:50.170> because<00:02:50.680> we

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
forward through the fire because we

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.819 
forward through the fire because we
cannot<00:02:51.010> actually<00:02:51.310> take<00:02:51.639> damage<00:02:51.879> and<00:02:55.709> then<00:02:56.709> we

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
cannot actually take damage and then we

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.140 
cannot actually take damage and then we
just<00:02:56.980> simply<00:02:57.310> make<00:02:57.489> our<00:02:57.639> way<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.790> the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
just simply make our way to the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:18.250 
just simply make our way to the
lighthouse<00:02:58.329> itself

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.780 

once<00:03:19.010> you're<00:03:19.160> at<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.310> lighthouse<00:03:19.640> you're

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
once you're at the lighthouse you're

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.729 
once you're at the lighthouse you're
just<00:03:20.000> gonna<00:03:20.090> make<00:03:20.270> your<00:03:20.420> way<00:03:20.599> inside<00:03:21.080> into<00:03:21.590> the

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
just gonna make your way inside into the

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:31.420 
just gonna make your way inside into the
bathysphere<00:03:29.800> now<00:03:30.800> when<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.010> get<00:03:31.129> to<00:03:31.190> these

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
bathysphere now when you get to these

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.160 
bathysphere now when you get to these
steps<00:03:31.700> going<00:03:32.030> down<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.330> right-hand<00:03:32.510> side<00:03:32.989> is

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
steps going down the right-hand side is

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.750 
steps going down the right-hand side is
actually<00:03:33.440> faster<00:03:36.190> this<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.250> because<00:03:37.640> you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
actually faster this is because you

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.220 
actually faster this is because you
don't<00:03:37.970> have<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.239> go<00:03:38.360> around<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.720> door<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.110> the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
don't have to go around the door to the

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.920 
don't have to go around the door to the
bathroom<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:43.239> so<00:03:44.239> once<00:03:44.420> you've<00:03:44.540> made<00:03:44.660> your<00:03:44.720> way

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
bathroom so so once you've made your way

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.150 
bathroom so so once you've made your way
down<00:03:45.080> to<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.349> bathysphere<00:03:45.680> you're<00:03:46.040> gonna

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
down to the bathysphere you're gonna

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.710 
down to the bathysphere you're gonna
either<00:03:46.370> want<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:46.880> have<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.060> key<00:03:47.299> bound<00:03:47.569> to

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
either want to have a key bound to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.479 
either want to have a key bound to
quicksave<00:03:48.080> in<00:03:48.230> quick<00:03:48.470> load<00:03:48.680> or<00:03:49.310> you're<00:03:49.459> just

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
quicksave in quick load or you're just

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.460 
quicksave in quick load or you're just
going<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:50.090> manual<00:03:50.420> see<00:03:50.630> if<00:03:50.780> both<00:03:51.110> can<00:03:51.349> be

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
going to a manual see if both can be

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.440 
going to a manual see if both can be
accessed<00:03:51.890> through<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.280> menu<00:03:55.209> so<00:03:56.209> once<00:03:56.360> you

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
accessed through the menu so once you

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.729 
accessed through the menu so once you
have<00:03:56.599> a<00:03:56.660> save<00:03:56.930> in<00:03:56.959> place<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:57.440> that<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.650> can

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
have a save in place so that you can

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.259 
have a save in place so that you can
practice<00:03:58.130> this<00:03:58.250> trick<00:03:58.519> you're<00:03:58.910> going<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.090> want

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
practice this trick you're going to want

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.670 
practice this trick you're going to want
to<00:03:59.329> step<00:03:59.540> inside<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.959> bathroom

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
to step inside the bathroom

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.500 
to step inside the bathroom
just<00:04:00.980> enough<00:04:01.250> so<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.459> can<00:04:01.700> see<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.030> lever<00:04:02.209> I

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
just enough so you can see the lever I

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.120 
just enough so you can see the lever I
can<00:04:03.260> be<00:04:03.380> used<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:06.470> once<00:04:06.620> you're<00:04:06.769> inside<00:04:06.860> the

can be used and once you're inside the
bathysphere<00:04:07.430> far<00:04:07.849> enough<00:04:08.030> you're<00:04:08.209> gonna<00:04:08.299> want

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
bathysphere far enough you're gonna want

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.990 
bathysphere far enough you're gonna want
to<00:04:08.540> back<00:04:08.780> up<00:04:08.920> jump<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:10.130> then<00:04:10.340> activate<00:04:10.880> the

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
to back up jump and then activate the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.319 
to back up jump and then activate the
lever<00:04:12.310> if<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:13.430> do<00:04:13.549> it<00:04:13.640> correctly<00:04:13.760> you'll<00:04:14.150> get

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
lever if you do it correctly you'll get

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.300 
lever if you do it correctly you'll get
something<00:04:14.569> that<00:04:14.810> looks<00:04:14.989> like<00:04:15.079> this<00:04:15.410> in<00:04:15.650> which

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
something that looks like this in which

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.009 
something that looks like this in which
you<00:04:16.430> get<00:04:16.519> placed<00:04:16.760> on<00:04:16.970> top<00:04:17.120> of<00:04:17.329> bathysphere<00:04:17.660> and

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
you get placed on top of bathysphere and

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.379 
you get placed on top of bathysphere and
you're<00:04:18.139> unable<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.620> move<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.970> can<00:04:20.120> freely
