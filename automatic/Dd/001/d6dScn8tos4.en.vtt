 and I especially welcome you meanwhile 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.200
 six pictures video for fifa 13 ultimate 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.110
 team and yes you see right we are 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.090
 This time on the console and not more 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.610
 as usual on the web app i have mine 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.680
 bought an alpha media game capture hd 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.580
 I'll give you one too 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.910
 bit back game can show and 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.170
 why play around you too 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.630
 impressions of the teams themselves 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.950
 showcase and similarly easy 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.680
 blindly trust that they are good 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.290
 or what you recommend this that 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.400
 And yes, this time it's a team 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.130
 Dutch or Dutch 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.390
 yes in the exhibition 52 21 find the 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.640
 I now the right tree because 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.489
 you can really counter so well with it 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.530
 if you are in defense otherwise always 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.720
 there are a lot of problems 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.899
 enough played with three defenders 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.040
 was always a real qual and yes 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.030
 Let's start now in the gate 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.850
 We have Steckelberg or Stecklenberg 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.940
 however yes that's right right 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.260
 solid in the gate it compares to 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.380
 I would applaud the Bundesliga 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.700
 claim or so on both fields 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.020
 level is not so much 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.920
 then we come to the interior defense there 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.040
 we have heitinga on the left side 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.890
 in the middle we have 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:43.770
 I had douglas and right 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:46.710
 we had bula hula hula hoop after yes 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.439
 All three are very good header 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.520
 was just my main focus and the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:57.470
 buy reason for these three defenders so 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:02.070
 on the far right we have van der wiel with us 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.850
 85 the fastest defender in mine 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.229
 company chain around 72 header is also 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.319
 I would be quite strong in the air 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.379
 claim 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.610
 73 defense is okay too 72 fits 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.220
 the pictures will be good after we stop 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.390
 forward further 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.810
 and yes then we come to the last one 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.510
 defender in our troop that is 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.920
 Williams is a silver player because 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.099
 There are no golden deer left 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.049
 Defenders exist and yes because of that 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.420
 I still just considered him 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.530
 selected with his 70 in 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.470
 header strength and his 80 in tempo 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.849
 Passing on 72 of the balls stops 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.220
 also very good forward again 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.519
 after the man has cleared the ball or 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.440
 situation has clarified so in the central 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:58.069
 Mittelfeld we are driving here on the 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.560
 on the left side of the header with 82 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.790
 I really like midfield 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.790
 then was also the graduation 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.650
 come from the goalkeeper and yes so here must 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.480
 I once short 1000 on ktm because I 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:15.889
 have not bought this card so how 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.139
 album with 86 tempo a little whiz 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.139
 I would say 72 Kopfball too 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.669
 Pretty header strong final day with 71 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:27.199
 I do not want to say that now 87 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:28.909
 dribble top dawning so in the right 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:34.069
 flank on the right flank we have 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:35.409
 sing to sing or 94 pace of 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.540
 goes right off 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:42.799
 yes last day with 63 actually not 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.530
 but so there are two others and 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.760
 tempo was in the case was with the fall 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.019
 stop important with the hold of mine 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.040
 if you break the front 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.479
 opportunity exists and you can do it 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.349
 so on the left side we have 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:59.220
 affeley from the fc schalke one right 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.210
 bomb type of man 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.370
 84 tempo is now 75 but the 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:11.300
 that's just amazing 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:15.720
 383 yes, a four-star house would have to be 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:18.510
 and yes only to be recommended or storm 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.970
 we also have klaas jan huntelaar from 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.340
 fc schalke 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.440
 he is not the fastest but with 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.020
 his 82 shot also a real one 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.150
 top man should not have a danish team 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.060
 are also missing in the bundesliga team for the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.530
 he should not be missing 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.180
 yes I too good as a headball in the 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.690
 gameplay will look like he does 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.450
 believe two gates with your head 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.540
 and yes, I would say a lot of fun 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.770
 at the gameplay video 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.290
 I'll stop that for a moment 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.790
 bit with comment 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.890
 So the highlights from it unfortunately 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.380
 my player picked up early 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.730
 canceled 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.270
 but well the game bob climb quite well 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.950
 and that 's why it' s going to show about the 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.350
 you can like picture quality 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.120
 Give feedback if I am so 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.310
 can continue or if I still have one 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.300
 wishes a better picture 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.580
 that would be the cattle time 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.190
 extend the term and extend 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.140
 so on and yes you are allowed 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.260
 Deciding where it is has that too 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.780
 gameplay have fun with it 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.550
 and there we are already on the gameplay 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.370
 arrived 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.490
 is played here against a barclays 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.070
 premier league team a pretty cheap 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.490
 I would say formal 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:39.690
 I think the most expensive one here above 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.870
 right the striker vagner love yes it 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.490
 now not from the league but 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.490
 otherwise a very weak team 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.040
 in my view 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.690
 and here in the first minute van der 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.720
 wiel the ball he makes a short 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:58.320
 roulette arrives in the penalty room 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.250
 and unfortunately kept trying then 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.970
 velvety should have a flank on vagner 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.820
 love but she does not arrive and that 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.800
 ball is cleared 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.460
 yes and a pass from huntelaar 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.800
 affeley 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.870
 affeley moves often vastly shoots 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.030
 hits the post with the subsequent payment 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.580
 was unfortunately not out of the gate, yes 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.630
 cleared to a corner corner 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:27.930
 execute a left foot 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.550
 and yes the ball will be right upside down 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.039
 Huntelaar does the thing 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:36.870
 purely that was his first header goal and 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.120
 Here is a very nice try of 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:42.810
 bahrain pass on santi cazorla santala 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:46.199
 shoot super parade here one must 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:49.440
 already say yes clarified to a corner and 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.340
 yes the corner is fended off and on 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.849
 go ahead 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:58.620
 yes and here fair has the ball fits 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:07:01.080
 on apple a third around a bit 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.210
 there is a flank in the penalty room 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.659
 huntelaar and huntelaar are doing 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.310
 second header goal 

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:13.349
 yes, there is again repulsion of the ball goes 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:15.389
 prepares forwards on ash leipzig 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.470
 before making for huntelaar and huntelaar 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:19.949
 the thing in full 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:22.070
 yes that was the 3 0 of huntelaar thus 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:26.090
 a hat trick 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:27.990
 and very nice goal 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.389
 and then the opponent was with one 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.550
 attack matching run and he breaks that 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:34.620
 play off 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.120
 so I won three to zero that 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.159
 Game is over here the gameplay is 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.120
 at the end and yes you liked it 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:40.409
