wash and go follow me you wash it you go
thread<00:01:59.179> it<00:01:59.410> let<00:02:00.410> it<00:02:00.440> sit<00:02:00.590> for<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:01.070> while<00:02:01.280> let<00:02:01.550> it

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
thread it let it sit for a while let it

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.600 
thread it let it sit for a while let it
dry<00:02:02.030> as<00:02:02.390> long<00:02:02.600> as<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.869> can<00:02:03.280> unthread<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.310> and

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
dry as long as you can unthread it and

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.520 
dry as long as you can unthread it and
spread<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.390> out<00:02:05.570> just<00:02:05.869> like<00:02:05.929> you<00:02:05.990> saw<00:02:06.229> me<00:02:06.380> doing
