00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.660 
those problems yes
also<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.110> another<00:01:49.229> solo<00:01:49.680> evade<00:01:49.920> video<00:01:50.549> as

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
also this is another solo evade video as

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.730 
also this is another solo evade video as
you<00:01:50.820> probably<00:01:51.060> noticed<00:01:51.540> already<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:52.560> yeah

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
you probably noticed already but yeah

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.770 
you probably noticed already but yeah
I'm<00:01:52.890> trying<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.490> record<00:01:54.090> more<00:01:54.240> solo<00:01:54.600> now

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
I'm trying to record more solo now

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.870 
I'm trying to record more solo now
because<00:01:55.140> after<00:01:55.590> all<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.950> seems<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.610> that's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
because after all it seems like that's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.160 
because after all it seems like that's
what<00:01:57.030> what<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.390> want<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.719> say

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.350 

yeah<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.100> even<00:02:01.640> though<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:01.760> find<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.240> lot

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
yeah so even though I find it a lot

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.870 
yeah so even though I find it a lot
easier<00:02:02.540> to<00:02:02.780> record<00:02:03.220> with<00:02:04.220> someone<00:02:04.729> because

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
easier to record with someone because

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.030 
easier to record with someone because
then<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.330> can<00:02:05.570> like<00:02:05.870> it's<00:02:06.650> easier<00:02:06.950> to

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
then you can like it's easier to

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.040 
then you can like it's easier to
commentate<00:02:07.490> when<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:07.790> play<00:02:08.660> with<00:02:08.840> someone

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
commentate when you play with someone

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.880 
commentate when you play with someone
else<00:02:10.120> but<00:02:11.120> then<00:02:11.270> again<00:02:11.390> if<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.500> want<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.709> see

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
else but then again if you want to see

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.520 
else but then again if you want to see
me<00:02:13.010> play<00:02:13.130> solo<00:02:13.459> them<00:02:13.780> sure<00:02:14.780> I'm<00:02:15.050> gonna<00:02:15.200> do<00:02:15.380> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
me play solo them sure I'm gonna do that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.100 
me play solo them sure I'm gonna do that
as<00:02:15.650> well<00:02:15.860> maybe<00:02:16.730> even<00:02:17.000> more<00:02:17.209> than<00:02:17.510> teaming

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
as well maybe even more than teaming

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.980 
as well maybe even more than teaming
videos<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:19.250> we'll<00:02:19.459> see<00:02:19.730> I'm<00:02:20.390> gonna<00:02:20.600> do<00:02:20.780> both

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
videos but we'll see I'm gonna do both

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.590 
videos but we'll see I'm gonna do both
so<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:23.350> hope<00:02:24.350> that's<00:02:24.530> all<00:02:24.740> fine

King<00:02:50.780> for<00:02:50.930> after<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.230> finish<00:02:51.530> gonna<00:02:52.370> do<00:02:52.519> that

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
King for after I finish gonna do that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.600 
King for after I finish gonna do that
real<00:02:52.850> quick<00:02:53.950> my<00:02:54.950> arm<00:02:55.160> isn't<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.610> best<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.090> so

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
real quick my arm isn't the best and so

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.720 
real quick my arm isn't the best and so
same<00:02:58.610> with<00:02:58.760> my<00:02:58.910> weapon<00:02:59.300> I<00:03:00.100> have<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.130> bow<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.519> 10

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
hours which is fine no Road I think it

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.720 
hours which is fine no Road I think it
should<00:03:06.530> look<00:03:06.709> more<00:03:06.769> tear<00:03:07.220> once<00:03:07.430> than<00:03:07.670> I

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
should look more tear once than I

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.229 
should look more tear once than I
usually<00:03:07.880> do<00:03:08.299> because<00:03:08.329> I<00:03:08.870> rarely<00:03:09.290> get<00:03:10.239> like

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
usually do because I rarely get like

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.289 
usually do because I rarely get like
those<00:03:11.450> now<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.380> finally<00:03:12.650> got<00:03:12.799> one<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.220> really<00:03:14.150> get

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
those now I finally got one I really get

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.090 
those now I finally got one I really get
those<00:03:14.480> essential<00:03:15.290> stuff<00:03:15.560> just<00:03:15.829> because<00:03:15.980> I

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
those essential stuff just because I

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.940 
those essential stuff just because I
think<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.400> looked<00:03:16.840> too<00:03:17.840> few<00:03:18.140> tier<00:03:18.410> ones<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.860> be

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
think I looked too few tier ones to be

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.819 
think I looked too few tier ones to be
honest<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:20.410> could<00:03:21.410> be<00:03:21.620> another<00:03:21.860> problem<00:03:23.799> so<00:03:24.799> I

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
honest I could be another problem so I

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.319 
honest I could be another problem so I
need<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.160> get<00:03:25.280> better<00:03:25.400> at<00:03:25.579> lifting<00:03:25.910> tier<00:03:26.120> ones

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.490 
escape it's you can still like land lots
of<00:05:47.680> hits<00:05:47.860> on<00:05:48.070> someone<00:05:48.550> trying<00:05:49.060> to<00:05:49.150> escape<00:05:49.500> same

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
of hits on someone trying to escape same

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.320 
of hits on someone trying to escape same
goes<00:05:51.040> for<00:05:51.070> you<00:05:51.340> if<00:05:51.460> you<00:05:51.580> try<00:05:51.850> to<00:05:51.910> escape<00:05:52.090> from

goes for you if you try to escape from

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.660 
goes for you if you try to escape from
someone<00:05:52.750> it's<00:05:53.440> gonna<00:05:53.620> be<00:05:53.830> able<00:05:54.040> to<00:05:54.310> learn<00:05:54.400> a

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
someone it's gonna be able to learn a

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.300 
someone it's gonna be able to learn a
lot<00:05:54.730> of<00:05:55.090> hits<00:05:55.240> on<00:05:55.360> you<00:05:55.830> just<00:05:56.830> because<00:05:56.920> of<00:05:57.130> the

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
lot of hits on you just because of the

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.660 
lot of hits on you just because of the
UNCP<00:05:57.700> and<00:05:57.990> well<00:05:59.220> when<00:06:00.220> you<00:06:00.310> are<00:06:00.370> killing

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
UNCP and well when you are killing

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.120 
UNCP and well when you are killing
someone<00:06:00.940> well<00:06:01.150> I<00:06:01.360> guess<00:06:01.900> that's<00:06:02.140> good<00:06:02.230> but<00:06:02.530> my

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
someone well I guess that's good but my

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.640 
someone well I guess that's good but my
playstyle<00:06:03.790> is<00:06:03.850> kind<00:06:04.150> of<00:06:04.210> defensive<00:06:04.900> a<00:06:04.930> nun<00:06:05.170> in

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
playstyle is kind of defensive a nun in

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.390 
playstyle is kind of defensive a nun in
most<00:06:05.920> scenarios<00:06:06.100> I<00:06:06.490> really<00:06:07.000> don't<00:06:07.210> like<00:06:07.420> it<00:06:07.630> so

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
most scenarios I really don't like it so

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.820 
most scenarios I really don't like it so
it<00:06:09.400> goes<00:06:09.610> both<00:06:09.820> ways

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
it goes both ways

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.620 
it goes both ways
oh<00:06:15.030> that's<00:06:16.030> not<00:06:16.270> an<00:06:16.360> Turner

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
oh that's not an Turner

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.800 
oh that's not an Turner
okay<00:06:16.930> I<00:06:17.940> think<00:06:18.940> we're<00:06:19.210> dealing<00:06:19.450> with<00:06:19.480> some

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
okay I think we're dealing with some

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.000 
okay I think we're dealing with some
something<00:06:20.440> here<00:06:22.380> that<00:06:23.380> was<00:06:23.500> a<00:06:23.560> sudden<00:06:23.890> turn

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
something here that was a sudden turn

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.610 
something here that was a sudden turn
around<00:06:24.390> really<00:06:25.390> sudden<00:06:25.780> okay<00:06:28.230> yeah<00:06:29.230> I<00:06:29.260> have<00:06:29.530> to
