00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
tangible goal in front of them they can

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.100 
tangible goal in front of them they can
see<00:01:18.220> our<00:01:18.399> students<00:01:19.030> they<00:01:19.509> can<00:01:19.720> think<00:01:19.930> to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
see our students they can think to

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.990
