already riding some little balls and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.860 
already riding some little balls and
stuff<00:00:21.280> in<00:00:22.280> the<00:00:22.730> middle<00:00:23.060> school<00:00:23.360> friend<00:00:23.690> made<00:00:23.840> a

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:23.870 
stuff in the middle school friend made a

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.480 
stuff in the middle school friend made a
longboard<00:00:24.410> skateboard<00:00:24.560> for<00:00:25.040> me<00:00:25.160> in<00:00:25.250> woodshop

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
longboard skateboard for me in woodshop

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.930 
longboard skateboard for me in woodshop
and<00:00:25.940> it<00:00:26.720> really<00:00:26.960> felt<00:00:27.200> like<00:00:27.350> surfing<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:28.610> I

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
and it really felt like surfing so I

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.530 
and it really felt like surfing so I
always<00:00:29.660> liked<00:00:29.990> my<00:00:30.230> longboard<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:31.540> just

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540
