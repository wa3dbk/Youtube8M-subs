nightmare<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.859> fair<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> got<00:00:33.059> myself<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
nightmare to be fair so I got myself a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.910 
nightmare to be fair so I got myself a
new<00:00:33.390> home<00:00:33.750> set<00:00:34.079> up<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.590> actually

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
than a Titan so that's quite exciting so

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
gigahertz I've got two lots of ddr3 RAM

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.210 
gigahertz I've got two lots of ddr3 RAM
and<00:02:57.510> they<00:02:57.600> light<00:02:57.870> up<00:02:57.900> which<00:02:58.470> kind<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.950> blew<00:02:59.100> my

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
and they light up which kind of blew my

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.830 
and they light up which kind of blew my
mind<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.520> little<00:02:59.640> bit<00:02:59.790> I've<00:03:00.209> never<00:03:00.450> really<00:03:00.660> seen

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
mind a little bit I've never really seen

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.580 
mind a little bit I've never really seen
that<00:03:00.900> before

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
that before

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.320 
that before
which<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.160> good<00:03:02.489> I've<00:03:02.910> got<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.060> really<00:03:03.239> cool

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
which is good I've got a really cool

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.360 
which is good I've got a really cool
power<00:03:03.630> supply<00:03:04.020> I've<00:03:04.320> got<00:03:04.650> some<00:03:05.190> liquid

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
power supply I've got some liquid

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.490 
power supply I've got some liquid
cooling<00:03:05.850> as<00:03:06.000> well<00:03:06.030> or<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.110> apparently<00:03:07.470> a

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
cooling as well or is it apparently a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.080 
cooling as well or is it apparently a
different<00:03:07.770> kind<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.040> liquid<00:03:08.370> Colin<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:08.940> that's

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
different kind of liquid Colin so that's

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.000 
different kind of liquid Colin so that's
that<00:03:09.330> I've<00:03:09.840> got<00:03:09.989> headphone<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.709> also

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
that I've got headphone and also

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.410 
that I've got headphone and also
microphone<00:03:11.400> ports<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.850> front<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:12.180> there

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
microphone ports on the front of there

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.810 
microphone ports on the front of there
and<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.380> essentially<00:03:14.010> like<00:03:14.459> brand-new

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
and that is essentially like brand-new

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.300 
and that is essentially like brand-new
