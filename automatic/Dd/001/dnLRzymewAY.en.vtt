00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680

only one that I regularly touch is
clarity<00:01:47.159> clarity<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.479> think<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.869> as

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
clarity clarity you can think of as

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.530 
clarity clarity you can think of as
being<00:01:49.189> sharpness<00:01:50.189> which<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.610> 920<00:01:51.149> some

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
being sharpness which the 920 some

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.260 
being sharpness which the 920 some
people<00:01:51.780> say<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.290> little<00:01:52.740> bit<00:01:52.860> too<00:01:53.009> soft<00:01:53.340> my

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
people say is a little bit too soft my

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.109 
people say is a little bit too soft my
experience<00:01:54.899> once<00:01:55.560> again<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.250> tap<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.670> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
experience once again just tap it to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.389 
experience once again just tap it to
there<00:01:57.450> about<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> quarter<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.530> movement<00:01:58.770> you

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
there about a quarter of a movement you

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.280 
there about a quarter of a movement you
don't<00:01:59.579> want<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.790> over<00:02:00.090> sharpen<00:02:00.600> an<00:02:00.719> image<00:02:01.049> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
don't want to over sharpen an image it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.100 
don't want to over sharpen an image it
on<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:02.250> makes<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> image<00:02:02.759> look<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.570> real<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
on it makes the image look not real it

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.889 
on it makes the image look not real it
can<00:02:04.229> cause<00:02:04.439> artifacts<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.610> some<00:02:06.270> distortions

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
can cause artifacts and some distortions

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.190 
can cause artifacts and some distortions
so<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.190> my<00:02:08.310> experience<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.819> default<00:02:09.509> 920

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
so but for my experience on default 920

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.710 
so but for my experience on default 920
doing<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.830> there<00:02:11.459> gives<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.420> enough

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
doing it there gives you enough

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.490 
doing it there gives you enough
sharpness

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
sharpness

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.560 
sharpness
keeping<00:02:14.100> natural<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.030> tell<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.300> this<00:02:15.390> will

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
keeping natural and I tell you this will

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.750 
keeping natural and I tell you this will
fix<00:02:15.810> most<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.230> your<00:02:16.350> photos<00:02:16.740> almost<00:02:17.490> all<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
fix most of your photos almost all the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.160 
fix most of your photos almost all the
time<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:18.420> pretty<00:02:18.480> much<00:02:18.870> for<00:02:19.020> all<00:02:19.140> of

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
time I do this pretty much for all of

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.410 
time I do this pretty much for all of
them<00:02:19.610> once<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.670> donate<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.240> hit<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
them once you donate you just hit the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.000 
them once you donate you just hit the
check<00:02:21.600> mark<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.020> now<00:02:22.320> your<00:02:22.470> sharpness<00:02:22.770> is

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
check mark and now your sharpness is

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.680 
check mark and now your sharpness is
applied<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.670> want<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.940> do<00:02:24.030> more<00:02:24.300> though<00:02:24.570> of

applied if you want to do more though of
course<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.080> just<00:02:25.230> go<00:02:25.320> back<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:25.950> don't<00:02:26.580> ever

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
course you just go back in I don't ever

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.090 
course you just go back in I don't ever
really<00:02:27.150> just<00:02:27.480> color<00:02:27.720> brightness<00:02:28.380> balance

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
really just color brightness balance

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.650 
really just color brightness balance
brightness<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.700> vibrance<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:30.540> you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
brightness and vibrance but you

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.570 
brightness and vibrance but you
certainly<00:02:30.930> can<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.800> course<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.220> go<00:02:32.340> into

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
certainly can of course you go into

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.699 
certainly can of course you go into
vibrance<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.150> now<00:02:33.690> we<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.200> make<00:02:34.680> it

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
vibrance and now we can really make it

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.980 
vibrance and now we can really make it
punchy<00:02:35.040> looking<00:02:35.520> or<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.330> tone<00:02:36.540> down<00:02:36.570> those

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
punchy looking or we can tone down those

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.290 
punchy looking or we can tone down those
colors<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.500> make<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.770> more<00:02:37.950> neutral<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:39.150> do

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
colors and make it more neutral you do

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.940 
colors and make it more neutral you do
what<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.720> know<00:02:39.840> you're<00:02:40.290> looking<00:02:40.470> for<00:02:40.860> of

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
what you know you're looking for of

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.150 
what you know you're looking for of
course<00:02:41.330> save<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.720> that's<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.170> now<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.709> lot<00:02:44.130> of

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
course save and that's that now a lot of

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.880 
course save and that's that now a lot of
people<00:02:44.280> miss<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.360> think<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.810> have<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> just

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
people miss this I think you have a just

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.770 
people miss this I think you have a just
but<00:02:47.160> if<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.280> slide<00:02:47.580> over<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:48.390> also<00:02:48.510> have

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
but if you slide over you also have

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.570 
but if you slide over you also have
fixed<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:49.860> definitely<00:02:50.160> want<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.489> take

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
fixed so you definitely want to take

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.370 
fixed so you definitely want to take
advantage<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:51.180> these<00:02:51.330> things<00:02:51.630> built-in

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
advantage of these things built-in

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.800 
advantage of these things built-in
red-eye<00:02:52.680> correction<00:02:53.239> once<00:02:54.239> again<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.510> don't

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
red-eye correction once again I don't

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.540 
red-eye correction once again I don't
really<00:02:54.930> shoot<00:02:55.200> flash<00:02:55.530> at<00:02:55.770> nighttime<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.400> I'm

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
really shoot flash at nighttime so I'm

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.250 
really shoot flash at nighttime so I'm
no<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.880> don't<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.209> this<00:02:57.360> problem<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:57.959> if<00:02:58.110> you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
no I don't have this problem but if you

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.500 
no I don't have this problem but if you
do<00:02:58.410> get<00:02:58.560> red<00:02:58.770> eye<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:59.580> should<00:02:59.910> fix<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.300> for

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
do get red eye that should fix it for

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.960 
do get red eye that should fix it for
you<00:03:00.630> but<00:03:01.170> crop<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.590> rotate<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.950> do<00:03:02.100> use<00:03:02.580> off<00:03:02.790> it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
you but crop and rotate I do use off it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.520 
you but crop and rotate I do use off it
and<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.390> actually<00:03:03.540> really<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.470> to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
and this is actually really not so to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.920 
and this is actually really not so to
crop<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.310> course<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.120> move<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
crop of course you can just move the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.449 
crop of course you can just move the
little<00:03:07.080> squares<00:03:07.470> around<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.130> then<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.250> can

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
little squares around and then you can

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.000 
little squares around and then you can
move<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.760> pic<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.510> Center<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.590> go<00:03:10.830> what

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
move the pic to Center it so you go what

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.710 
move the pic to Center it so you go what
you're<00:03:11.130> looking<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.910> then<00:03:12.209> if<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.540> want

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
you're looking for and then if you want

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.270 
you're looking for and then if you want
to<00:03:12.810> rotate<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.410> just<00:03:13.590> hit<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.830> little<00:03:13.920> button

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
to rotate you just hit the little button

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.360 
to rotate you just hit the little button
and<00:03:14.459> it'll<00:03:15.030> spin<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.420> around<00:03:15.650> now<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.980> went<00:03:17.250> hit

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
and it'll spin you around now I went hit

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.680 
and it'll spin you around now I went hit
check<00:03:17.610> mark<00:03:17.880> here<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.209> you're<00:03:18.299> going<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.480> see
