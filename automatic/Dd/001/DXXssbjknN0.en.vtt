00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:03.191
 I'm Johnny from ExpertBoxing 

00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:06.179
 And now I will show you how to beat the right cross 

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:09.989
 For most newbies, this will be the first powerful punch you learn to beat. 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:11.890
 That's how you do it 

00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:16.305
 Start at your regular stand, feet shoulder width apart 

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:18.052
 Hands on face, elbows down 

00:00:18.052 --> 00:00:21.336
 You can beat the right cross from a regular stand or after a jab ... 

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:23.347
 For example, a deuce 

00:00:23.347 --> 00:00:27.278
 What are you doing, your front leg is tight on the ground 

00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:29.206
 And the back leg rotates 

00:00:29.206 --> 00:00:31.215
 Rear leg will rotate 

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:34.736
 B you will rotate the whole body, hips and especially the spine 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.826
 Right side of the body, rotate the right foot, right knee 

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:44.109
 Right thigh, all right leg when you hit that punch 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:50.303
 Upper torso: the right side of the torso will come forward, the right shoulder will rise for greater strength, greater range 

00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:58.547
 The right elbow will lift for greater speed, greater strength, and the right glove will look down in the final phase of the stroke. 

00:00:58.547 --> 00:01:00.391
 Palm in the ground 

00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:04.527
 And you have to land a blow on the two knuckles of the index and middle fingers of your right hand. 

00:01:04.527 --> 00:01:08.830
 The left side of your body will be pulled back when you hit with your right hand 

00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:14.410
 She is pulled back. So when you hit on the right 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.341
 You need all this rotation to happen at the same time, do it from a relaxed position, relax your hands 

00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:23.780
 And then exhale with the blow. Exhale with the blow 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.305
 Like this 

00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:29.502
 Now let's talk about common mistakes that most people make. 

00:01:29.502 --> 00:01:33.559
 The first is not to beat the chin. This is how you should beat, exactly from the chin. 

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:35.801
 Accurately from the chin 

00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:40.800
 Do not lower, do not lower the hand, do not do like this, do not lower the right hand when you beat the jab 

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:43.960
 It wires a punch, makes you vulnerable to a left hook. 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.439
 Hold your right hand here, hit the chin exactly. The second problem: 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.528
 Bend back and forth. Many guys are trying to move forward, they want to hit more powerful 

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:59.433
 They want to push a punch. If you do that, you lose your balance and your right leg now passes 

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:06.677
 less force hit. So, if you're standing straight, bend your knees, go down for a bit, just barely sit down 

00:02:06.677 --> 00:02:11.612
 And project your weight down, project your power down, so you transfer more weight to your legs 

00:02:11.612 --> 00:02:17.059
 This is what makes the right cross powerful, and you have to stick your right foot into the ground. 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.677
 Like you put out a cigarette with your foot 

00:02:20.677 --> 00:02:22.682
 Like you put out a cigarette with your foot 

00:02:23.516 --> 00:02:25.781
 Don't get up don't lean forward 

00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:29.720
 You also do not need to lean back, you do not need to try to charge a blow, it makes you vulnerable, unbalanced 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.861
 Don't do any of this 

00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:35.374
 Also, the key thing: when you hit the right cross, pull back your left shoulder 

00:02:35.374 --> 00:02:41.309
 This is what allows you to keep balance, prepares your left hook, so that the left hook follows. 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:45.056
 It flies faster, stronger, more power, more balance 

00:02:45.056 --> 00:02:49.531
 You lean forward like this, now come back with a left hook will be longer 

00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:51.419
 And you, besides, are very vulnerable 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:56.937
 Another common mistake with the right cross: Many guys put one foot over the other 

00:02:56.937 --> 00:02:59.824
 Do not stand so, do not put your right foot over the front 

00:02:59.824 --> 00:03:05.253
 If you do that, from here you have to twist your whole self to break through the right cross 

00:03:05.253 --> 00:03:10.735
 From here I can’t get my opponent, unless I wrap myself up badly, and I fall or something else. 

00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:15.975
 This position is not suitable for a long backhand, this position is good for a long backhand. 

00:03:15.975 --> 00:03:21.098
 This position is for jabs, you beat jabs, you run away 

00:03:21.098 --> 00:03:25.151
 Or do you want to be slippery or something else, that's what it is for. If you want to hit your opponent with your right hand 

00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:30.661
 Expose the right leg, create a small angle, give your right leg a straight direction to the target 

00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:36.038
 So you don't have to twist your leg, twist yourself to throw a punch. 

00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:41.748
 From here your right leg has a straight line of sight, your right cross takes off easily 

00:03:41.748 --> 00:03:45.162
 More speed, more balance, more power 

00:03:45.162 --> 00:03:50.695
 Let's talk about some interesting things if you want to try some advanced things. 

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:56.676
 When I come up, there are two options, I can lean back like this, let's say my opponent beats a jab and ... 

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:01.960
 Like this. He hits the jab, I lean back, hit the right cross right over his jab 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.709
 On a little bit. I can do the exact opposite, let's say he hits right. 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.936
 I can bend over here, at the same time breaking through the right cross, here I am 

00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:13.235
 He hits the right cross ... 

00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:17.668
 How it works - it hits the right cross, I shift my head to the side, I insert my right cross 

00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:20.405
 I will win this exchange because his head will be right there 

00:04:20.405 --> 00:04:26.315
 Suppose I hit the right side of the body, I can also sit down, for a start I leave a couple of jabs here and then 

00:04:27.412 --> 00:04:33.780
 Notice how I didn’t look down, I kept my eyes on my head, so I’m not telegraphing that I would hit the right side of the body 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:42.317
 It doesn't matter if I bend my elbow or hit it from above or in a circle or straight 

00:04:42.317 --> 00:04:46.000
 It does not matter. As long as I fully rotate my body, I keep my weight balanced 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.131
 And I stand tight on two legs, the forehand will be suicidal, no matter how he lands on the target 

00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:55.351
 So make sure you practice this punch on the bag, on your opponents 

00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:57.865
 This will be one of your most used boxing punches. 

00:04:57.865 --> 00:04:59.031
 Thank you for watching.
