I'll show you how this did you form

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.740 
I'll show you how this did you form
figures<00:00:42.800> transform<00:00:44.740> first<00:00:45.740> of<00:00:45.860> all<00:00:46.750> pushpan

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
figures transform first of all pushpan

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.880 
figures transform first of all pushpan
this<00:00:47.990> legs<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:49.190> straight<00:00:50.290> let<00:00:51.290> me<00:00:51.410> thank<00:00:51.680> this

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
this legs to straight let me thank this

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.840 
this legs to straight let me thank this
figure<00:00:52.340> is<00:00:52.490> very<00:00:52.520> tall<00:00:53.380> but<00:00:54.380> actually<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.580> to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
figure is very tall but actually you to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.690 
figure is very tall but actually you to
push<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.480> launch<00:00:56.930> deck<00:00:57.260> this<00:00:57.770> one<00:00:57.980> back<00:00:58.340> to

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
push the launch deck this one back to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.060 
push the launch deck this one back to
the<00:00:58.910> lower<00:00:59.510> leg<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:01.000> then<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:02.830> this<00:01:03.830> is<00:01:04.040> a

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
the lower leg and then and this is a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.850 
the lower leg and then and this is a
wrong<00:01:04.489> method<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:05.810> because<00:01:06.020> this<00:01:06.350> one<00:01:06.530> should

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
wrong method and because this one should

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.789 
wrong method and because this one should
not<00:01:06.979> explode<00:01:07.520> like<00:01:07.939> this<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:08.780> you<00:01:09.259> can<00:01:09.500> it

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
not explode like this and you can it

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.250 
not explode like this and you can it
should<00:01:10.159> insert<00:01:10.670> in<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.000> leg<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.480> this<00:01:11.870> tends

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
should insert in the leg and this tends

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.840 
should insert in the leg and this tends
to<00:01:12.410> move<00:01:12.830> if<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:13.910> move<00:01:14.470> like<00:01:15.470> that<00:01:15.650> is<00:01:15.860> limit

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
to move if you move like that is limit

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
to move if you move like that is limit
the<00:01:17.510> movement<00:01:17.720> of<00:01:18.170> his<00:01:18.800> leg<00:01:20.620> so<00:01:21.620> put<00:01:22.070> like<00:01:22.100> this

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
the movement of his leg so put like this

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.260 
the movement of his leg so put like this
again<00:01:23.870> this<00:01:24.770> is<00:01:24.980> wrong<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:26.080> is<00:01:27.080> correct

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
again this is wrong and this is correct

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.120 
again this is wrong and this is correct
okay<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:30.820> then<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:32.510> this<00:01:32.810> arm<00:01:33.130> just

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
okay and then this is this arm just

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.100 
okay and then this is this arm just
simply<00:01:34.670> pull<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:35.390> out<00:01:36.010> make<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.040> move<00:01:37.460> freely

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
simply pull it out make a move freely

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.980 
simply pull it out make a move freely
and<00:01:39.800> then<00:01:40.280> this<00:01:40.370> distance<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.210> done<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:41.780> you

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
and then this distance is done and you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.870 
and then this distance is done and you
can<00:01:42.200> turn<00:01:42.440> it<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.860> front

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
can turn it to front

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.300 
can turn it to front
apply<00:01:45.160> your<00:01:46.160> weapon<00:01:46.760> someone<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:49.100> Hat

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
apply your weapon someone and the Hat

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.360 
apply your weapon someone and the Hat
just<00:01:50.300> pull<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.660> little<00:01:50.810> bit<00:01:51.020> yes<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:51.980> can<00:01:52.130> see

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
just pull a little bit yes you can see

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.610 
just pull a little bit yes you can see
this<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.180> not<00:01:53.330> fair<00:01:53.510> break<00:01:53.810> different<00:01:54.260> just<00:01:54.500> a

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
this is not fair break different just a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.400 
this is not fair break different just a
little<00:01:54.860> bit<00:01:55.420> awkward<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:57.320> then<00:01:57.560> open<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.490> swing

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
little bit awkward and then open a swing

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.920 
little bit awkward and then open a swing
and<00:02:00.790> and<00:02:01.790> that's<00:02:02.660> all<00:02:02.870> for<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:03.590> part<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.970> the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
and and that's all for this part and the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.140 
and and that's all for this part and the
different<00:02:06.650> into<00:02:07.160> this<00:02:07.670> mode<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:10.150> actually

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
different into this mode and actually

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.690 
different into this mode and actually
can<00:02:11.330> add<00:02:11.510> this<00:02:11.690> figure<00:02:12.470> like<00:02:12.890> flapping<00:02:13.250> in

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
can add this figure like flapping in

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.130 
can add this figure like flapping in
swing<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:15.880> his<00:02:16.880> tail<00:02:17.270> is<00:02:17.450> not<00:02:17.630> able<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.870> move

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
swing and his tail is not able to move

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.760 
swing and his tail is not able to move
because<00:02:18.770> it's<00:02:19.100> fixed<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:19.610> on<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.880> body<00:02:20.120> and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
because it's fixed it on the body and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.870 
because it's fixed it on the body and
let's<00:02:21.770> see<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> move<00:02:22.160> ability<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.700> these

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
let's see the move ability of these

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.699 
let's see the move ability of these
figures<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.510> can<00:02:24.260> move<00:02:24.890> his<00:02:25.130> foot<00:02:25.490> very

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
figures you can move his foot very

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:38.710 
figures you can move his foot very
freely<00:02:28.420> see<00:02:29.860> /<00:02:30.860> free<00:02:31.280> movement<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:36.910> also<00:02:37.910> arm
