two slits for the eyes a slit for the

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.550 
two slits for the eyes a slit for the
mouth<00:06:22.210> and<00:06:22.510> then<00:06:22.720> his<00:06:22.840> mouth<00:06:22.990> kind<00:06:23.230> of<00:06:23.320> comes

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
mouth and then his mouth kind of comes

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.440 
mouth and then his mouth kind of comes
down<00:06:23.800> and<00:06:24.040> almost<00:06:24.250> like<00:06:24.340> a<00:06:24.370> frowny<00:06:24.790> face<00:06:25.150> kind

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450
