God or at least part of them soon enough

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.530 
God or at least part of them soon enough
so<00:02:57.300> Moses<00:02:57.690> says<00:02:57.930> Lord<00:02:58.920> Yahweh<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.790> you're<00:03:00.330> not

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
so Moses says Lord Yahweh if you're not

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.610 
so Moses says Lord Yahweh if you're not
going<00:03:00.930> with<00:03:01.140> us

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
don't make us leave and God changed his

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.600 
don't make us leave and God changed his
mind<00:03:05.489> again<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.420> guess<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.620> then<00:03:07.739> Moses<00:03:08.220> asked

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
mind again I guess and then Moses asked

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.050 
mind again I guess and then Moses asked
no<00:03:09.300> Yahweh<00:03:09.900> please<00:03:10.560> let<00:03:10.830> me<00:03:11.010> see<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.430> dazzling

and<00:06:35.139> its<00:06:35.949> face<00:06:36.190> was<00:06:36.490> shining<00:06:36.880> cuz<00:06:37.690> he<00:06:37.840> had<00:06:37.930> been

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
and its face was shining cuz he had been

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.530 
and its face was shining cuz he had been
speaking<00:06:38.560> with<00:06:38.740> the<00:06:38.800> Lord<00:06:39.310> they<00:06:39.880> did<00:06:40.090> not<00:06:40.270> know

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
speaking with the Lord they did not know

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.050 
speaking with the Lord they did not know
it<00:06:40.720> so<00:06:41.590> he<00:06:42.070> didn't<00:06:42.340> know<00:06:42.460> his<00:06:42.610> face<00:06:42.850> was

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
it so he didn't know his face was

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.610 
it so he didn't know his face was
shining<00:06:43.090> or<00:06:43.750> he<00:06:43.810> didn't<00:06:44.050> know<00:06:44.169> he<00:06:44.350> had<00:06:44.380> been

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
shining or he didn't know he had been

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.680 
shining or he didn't know he had been
speaking<00:06:44.860> with<00:06:45.070> the<00:06:45.130> Lord<00:06:45.490> I<00:06:45.880> hope<00:06:46.449> it's<00:06:46.660> the

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
speaking with the Lord I hope it's the

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.890 
speaking with the Lord I hope it's the
former<00:06:46.900> anyway<00:06:47.740> I<00:06:47.979> guess<00:06:48.669> Moses<00:06:49.210> his<00:06:49.360> face<00:06:49.630> was

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
former anyway I guess Moses his face was

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.680 
former anyway I guess Moses his face was
shining<00:06:49.930> a<00:06:50.590> lot<00:06:50.860> after<00:06:51.250> that<00:06:51.280> so<00:06:52.270> he<00:06:52.360> had<00:06:52.389> to

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
shining a lot after that so he had to

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.620 
shining a lot after that so he had to
wear<00:06:52.900> a<00:06:52.960> veil<00:06:53.350> from<00:06:53.740> time<00:06:53.949> to<00:06:54.100> time<00:06:54.479> he<00:06:55.479> was

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630 
wear a veil from time to time he was

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:07.690 
wear a veil from time to time he was
likely<00:06:55.810> still<00:06:56.229> not<00:06:56.710> again<00:06:57.100> speaker<00:06:57.759> though

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.760
