00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello I'm simon dine muscle makers 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.650
 this video is about the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.139
 different types of irritants and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.870
 What kind of stimulus for muscle building 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.550
 The best is already the whole time 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.270
 there are, strictly speaking 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.369
 Four types of irritants that differ 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.800
 just about your intensity easy 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.840
 after that how hard they are the first 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:35.160
 Ride of irritants are subliminal 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.899
 These are simply from the stimuli 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.649
 intensity so you barely 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.649
 perceives 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.690
 For example, if I am using this now 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.579
 word lean here would make biceps cologne 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.559
 that would be a subliminal irritated 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.079
 Basically, even at all 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.600
 not reached the next kind of travel 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.039
 are the slightly stronger incentives but are 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.870
 ultimately still weak 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.870
 it is the flood 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.140
 about weakly weak stimuli that 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:21.920
 Next, what are they 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:24.110
 subliminal strong stimuli and what 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.799
 then come the stimuli are just too 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.390
 are big 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.820
 if I raise an atlas now 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:36.440
 would have to be simple and simple and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:39.159
 gripping a too strong a stimulus says 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.530
 Everything so we can stimulate that way 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.780
 categorize according to their seriousness 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.880
 the intensity of the whole thing will decrease 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.860
 It's getting harder and harder down here 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.319
 that even Cologne with such a buck 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.330
 marca is curling, so to speak 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.890
 with stone or with two cyclists 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.720
 rising young as us together 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.399
 that's what they did when they were traded 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.350
 here it is definitely too hard for it 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.569
 definitely too light that is called here 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.190
 somewhere in this area that would have to 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.409
 optimal appeal lies for the 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.000
 Muscle structure subliminally weak 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.200
 Stimuli are simply still a mystery 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.180
 it would be if I maybe now 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.070
 a ten kilo dumbbell and how cologne 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.870
 that would be a raise i would him 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.610
 but I would perceive one 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.260
 you just do not have 1 muscle building 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.079
 can already process that is 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.079
 that's the kind of irritating thing here 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.030
 the subliminally weak stimuli are 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.630
 it's the role of muscle building 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.750
 play exactly this intensity of 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.570
 Stimuli must be achieved so one 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.519
 delight must be strong enough but always 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.079
 not too strong that he just the 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.250
 muscle so harms you afterwards 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.590
 nothing can do anymore 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.519
 not to be too strong for lincoln 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.920
 ultimately not at all 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.380
 so we could achieve that 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.900
 now here 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.230
 ordered according to the intensity so the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.570
 Of course it's not just the heavy ones 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.910
 severe of a stimulus but somewhere 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.859
 also the duration of vienna attraction works and also 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.230
 to play other factors 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.600
 that is, we have it here again 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.579
 the intensity it must take me in 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.959
 subliminally strong appeal then be 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.819
 Of course there is another foot 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.489
 have already said the duration of the 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.549
 So stimulus is how long this charming 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.300
 is it only a second or the 45th here? 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.460
 seconds 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.080
 by the question the duration of the 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.810
 So right is not just as hard 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.360
 but also how long and the question 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.860
 So how many times that is called 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:34.340
 the frequency is the whole 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.830
 summarize how hard how long and 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.670
 how many times if we have to go there now 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.860
 we can see a discharge 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:51.680
 optimal stimulus lasting between 6 and 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.580
 15 repetitions finally has the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.280
 corresponding duration 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.990
 So we have the intensity that has to 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.080
 everyone for themselves find the weight 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.430
 which is possible over six or ever 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.920
 After that came right back to it 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.660
 clean about 15 times 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.610
 that means the intensities 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.850
 Everyone has to do that by weight 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.770
 even then find the duration 6 15 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.840
 repetitions of this are still there 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.790
 but time of stress peymann 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.109
 attention and stuff like that now 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.340
 deal with not so special 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.930
 important is first the number of 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.610
 repetitions in the end namely on 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.440
 the same thing comes out even we have 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.570
 So also the duration and now the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.440
 ask the frequency so how often that 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.850
 including three sentences and ultimately 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:39.470
 my recommendation , of course, there are 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:41.840
 yet another total of two exercises per 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.419
 muscle group now only rough 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.100
 Orientation per large muscle groups 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.360
 You can certainly take more for 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.860
 a little maybe less 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.290
 depending on the training system according to 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.570
 training concept is sometimes enough 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.070
 have an exercise in 48 explosive training 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.500
 Just to do something with that 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.419
 intensity is extremely high there you can 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.100
 simply from the repetition number of 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.300
 the frequency here is not that much 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.390
 that's what else would happen 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.470
 ultimately resulting in strong irritation 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.880
 now topics in this video 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.070
 but here simply rough the 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.250
 Summary 6 to 15 repetitions 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.919
 of which three sentences maybe two exercises 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.960
 the whole per muscle group so big 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.880
 Muscle groups is optimal 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.690
 now just again here in this 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.610
 received six to 15 repetitions 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.760
 of course a relatively large one with relative 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.800
 large areas 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.410
 Great span of this hypertrophy area 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.970
 6 to 15 repetitions will be the 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.190
 partially confirmed by the 1 of 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.830
 others just not my perception to 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.750
 whole is trained like one 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.750
 lower range so maybe not 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.180
 six to 15 but optimal way 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.360
 maybe here it just changes completely 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.560
 just six to ten or six 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.390
 until twelve has the background that you 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.080
 at the lower repetition range 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.850
 a shorter way the qual did that mean 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.680
 if you maybe repeat with 15 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.510
 and train you notice down the back 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.770
 Repeat really slows down in the 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.750
 eleventh brands more 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.150
 at the twelfth brands completely at the 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.960
 thirteenth added yes yes and from 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.630
 then you have to go over the 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.230
 Fourteenth and fifteen , so to speak 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.880
 torment 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.130
 that is the muscle is still in the 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.530
 able to do the work 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.300
 + The head is often with many 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.280
 athletes really very many 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.270
 athletes no longer ready the way 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.740
 to deal with pain 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.650
 that is if you are in upper 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.420
 repeat range so 13 14 15 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.350
 Exercising repetitions is the way to go 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.790
 Just harder it a bit harder 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.770
 Thumbscrews always become one 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.240
 a little bit more attracted by repetition 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.950
 to repeat during and 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.720
 Repeat range of six 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.580
 repetitions because you just notice 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.650
 the 5 repetition is barely possible now 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.120
 what and who the sixth repetitions 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.860
 there is the matter then relatively fast 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.270
 and clearly the weight does that 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.920
 just so high because six 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.840
 I do not repeat that 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.790
 can handle and that you 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.800
 ultimately not as long as the sick 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.400
 like at maybe 15 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.620
 repeats 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.840
 that's why my tip here at the place 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.600
 six to ten repetitions optimally 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.310
 to the muscle building of it three sentences here 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.570
 they can begin to argue like 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.130
 I also do not know it's always that 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.710
 be sure to have two exercises 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.350
 but in my opinion this is here 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.180
 six to ten repetitions of 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.550
 optimal area for muscle building 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.250
 just has to do with that the 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.560
 Most people are unable to get away from it 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.510
 Head over to a very long way for the agony 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.190
 go whoever it is anyway as he says 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.780
 he has no problem with that he can too 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.000
 without problems in the range of 3 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.160
 Exercise 10 14 15 repetitions and 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.750
 will still build muscle for the 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.550
 Most people and I mean that 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.530
 really 90 maybe even 95 percent 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.169
 the athletes are the lesser 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.910
 Repetitive pay in the end easy 

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:46.590
 at the end of time maybe six 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.150
 or just eight weeks has been successful 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.060
 because you have a not so high off the 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:53.250
 Small must be subliminal anyway 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.800
 Strong appeal achieves proper intensity 

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:58.050
 duration and frequency reached and 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.290
 ultimately with muscle building up blood 

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.880
 becomes 

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:03.169
 See you in the next video many 

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.169
 greetings your 7
