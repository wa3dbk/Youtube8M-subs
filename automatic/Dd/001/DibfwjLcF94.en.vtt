3gs right here and one for the
blackberry<00:00:39.960> curve<00:00:40.410> 8900<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.730> we'll<00:00:41.910> test<00:00:42.090> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
blackberry curve 8900 so we'll test it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.639 
blackberry curve 8900 so we'll test it
out<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.390> curve<00:00:42.600> 8900<00:00:42.989> say<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.530> how

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
out with the curve 8900 say can see how

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.130 
out with the curve 8900 say can see how
it<00:00:43.800> works<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.850> first<00:00:45.120> let's<00:00:45.329> open<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.899> base

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
it works so first let's open up the base

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.510 
it works so first let's open up the base
and<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.129> comes<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.910> kit<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:52.520> as

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
and see what comes to this kit and as

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.639 
and see what comes to this kit and as
the<00:00:53.940> charger<00:00:54.870> base<00:00:55.110> itself<00:00:55.800> pretty<00:00:56.550> large

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
the charger base itself pretty large

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.939 
the charger base itself pretty large
energizer<00:00:58.649> says<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> has<00:00:59.750> two<00:01:00.750> different

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
energizer says it has two different

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.290 
energizer says it has two different
charging<00:01:01.949> locations<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.760> unlike<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
charging locations here and unlike the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.149 
charging locations here and unlike the
powermat<00:01:03.960> system<00:01:04.320> which<00:01:04.439> uses<00:01:04.559> magnets<00:01:05.070> to

powermat system which uses magnets to
align<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> device<00:01:05.790> saw<00:01:05.970> there's<00:01:06.180> some<00:01:06.360> give<00:01:06.930> in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
align a device saw there's some give in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.480 
align a device saw there's some give in
terms<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.500> where<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.010> place<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> device

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
terms of where you can place the device

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.920 
terms of where you can place the device
and<00:01:08.610> still<00:01:08.939> get<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> charge<00:01:09.390> out<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and still get a charge out of it so

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.929 
and still get a charge out of it so
let's<00:01:10.860> set<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.100> aside<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.729> else<00:01:11.880> comes

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
a little bit different it's just a

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.050 
a little bit different it's just a

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
you can see it's kind of thick the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.250 
you can see it's kind of thick the
receiver<00:03:02.819> unit<00:03:03.120> here<00:03:03.449> takes<00:03:03.689> up<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.900> fair<00:03:04.109> bit

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260

receiver unit here takes up a fair bit
of<00:03:04.319> space<00:03:05.030> but<00:03:06.030> then<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.269> can<00:03:06.389> see<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.599> just

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
of space but then you can see it just

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.770 
of space but then you can see it just
plugs<00:03:06.959> right<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.409> you<00:03:07.560> know<00:03:07.650> snaps<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.310> and

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
3g or 3gs with me so what I did is I

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.339 
3g or 3gs with me so what I did is I
stuffed<00:03:40.109> a<00:03:40.319> poor<00:03:40.979> little<00:03:41.150> ipod<00:03:42.150> touch<00:03:42.540> through

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
stuffed a poor little ipod touch through

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.780 
stuffed a poor little ipod touch through
the<00:03:43.470> case<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.859> can<00:03:43.949> hear<00:03:44.069> flip<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.430> around<00:03:44.519> and

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
the case you can hear flip it around and

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.610 
the case you can hear flip it around and
stuff<00:03:45.000> but<00:03:45.180> obviously<00:03:45.540> they'll<00:03:46.229> still<00:03:46.439> work

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
stuff but obviously they'll still work

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.050 
stuff but obviously they'll still work
since<00:03:46.829> it<00:03:46.919> uses<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.189> same<00:03:47.400> port<00:03:47.729> so<00:03:47.849> I'm<00:03:47.939> going

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
since it uses the same port so I'm going

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.960 
since it uses the same port so I'm going
to<00:03:48.090> lay<00:03:48.239> it<00:03:48.269> on<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.509> bottom<00:03:48.689> here<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.849> can<00:03:50.849> now

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
to lay it on the bottom here you can now

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.369 
to lay it on the bottom here you can now
see<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.209> it's<00:03:51.419> charging<00:03:51.840> if<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.139> look<00:03:52.290> at

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
see that it's charging if you look at

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.159 
see that it's charging if you look at
the<00:03:52.530> battery<00:03:53.370> icon<00:03:53.549> there<00:03:54.000> also<00:03:54.900> notice<00:03:55.139> that

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
the battery icon there also notice that

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.920 
the battery icon there also notice that
the<00:03:55.349> blue<00:03:55.530> light<00:03:55.709> again<00:03:55.979> is<00:03:56.189> glowing<00:03:57.090> if<00:03:57.840> I

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
the blue light again is glowing if I

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.729 
the blue light again is glowing if I
lift<00:03:58.139> it<00:03:58.319> up<00:03:58.759> more<00:03:59.759> than<00:03:59.849> a<00:03:59.969> centimeter<00:04:00.239> so

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
lift it up more than a centimeter so

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.839 
lift it up more than a centimeter so
charging<00:04:01.739> goes<00:04:01.889> off<00:04:02.930> put<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.019> back<00:04:04.139> on<00:04:04.849> and

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
charging goes off put it back on and

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.089 
charging goes off put it back on and
then<00:04:05.909> it's<00:04:06.180> charging<00:04:06.419> again<00:04:06.829> okay<00:04:07.829> so<00:04:07.889> I've

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
then it's charging again okay so I've

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.339 
then it's charging again okay so I've
got<00:04:08.250> here<00:04:08.430> a<00:04:08.459> curve<00:04:08.909> 8900<00:04:09.599> here<00:04:10.169> and<00:04:10.259> we're

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
got here a curve 8900 here and we're

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.449 
got here a curve 8900 here and we're
going<00:04:10.469> to<00:04:10.530> test<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.919> out<00:04:10.979> with<00:04:11.039> the<00:04:13.459> Energizer

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459

it<00:04:28.210> respond<00:04:28.570> as<00:04:28.690> if<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:28.900> were<00:04:28.960> charging<00:04:29.320> and

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
it respond as if it were charging and

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.030 
it respond as if it were charging and
you<00:04:32.110> can<00:04:32.200> actually<00:04:32.290> see<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.680> charger

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
you can actually see the charger

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.470 
you can actually see the charger
indicator<00:04:33.400> right<00:04:33.580> there<00:04:33.730> on<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:33.880> battery<00:04:34.210> so

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
indicator right there on the battery so

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.990 
indicator right there on the battery so
it's<00:04:34.810> actually<00:04:35.320> working<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.890> just<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:36.970> you

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
it's actually working and just so you

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.420 
it's actually working and just so you
can<00:04:37.210> see<00:04:37.450> what<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.810> new<00:04:38.560> inductive<00:04:39.040> charging

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
can see what the new inductive charging

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.670 
can see what the new inductive charging
back<00:04:39.730> does<00:04:40.060> in<00:04:40.270> terms<00:04:40.300> of<00:04:40.570> thickness<00:04:41.140> and<00:04:41.380> take

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
back does in terms of thickness and take

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.180 
back does in terms of thickness and take
a<00:04:41.710> quick<00:04:42.010> look<00:04:42.250> at<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.550> here<00:04:43.470> does<00:04:44.470> add<00:04:44.740> you

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
a quick look at it here does add you

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.130 
a quick look at it here does add you
know<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.460> couple<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.300> millimeters<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.990> the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
know a couple of millimeters to the

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.510 
know a couple of millimeters to the
thickness<00:04:47.560> of<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.740> device<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.220> it's<00:04:48.370> not

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
thickness of the device and it's not

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.400 
thickness of the device and it's not
really<00:04:48.940> blended<00:04:49.390> in<00:04:49.510> all<00:04:49.690> that<00:04:49.870> well<00:04:50.050> so<00:04:50.260> it

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
really blended in all that well so it

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.260 
really blended in all that well so it
makes<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.830> device<00:04:50.980> look<00:04:51.250> a<00:04:51.340> lot<00:04:51.460> more<00:04:51.520> bulky

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
makes the device look a lot more bulky

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.210 
makes the device look a lot more bulky
than<00:04:52.450> it<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:52.960> it<00:04:53.230> used<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.590> be<00:04:53.680> with<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.860> stock

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
than it and it used to be with the stock

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.280 
than it and it used to be with the stock
charger<00:04:54.790> um<00:04:54.970> but<00:04:55.210> but<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.660> functionality<00:04:56.230> is

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
charger um but but the functionality is

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.410 
charger um but but the functionality is
still<00:04:56.470> pretty<00:04:56.680> cool<00:04:56.920> so<00:04:57.160> if<00:04:57.340> you<00:04:57.460> really<00:04:58.120> need

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
still pretty cool so if you really need

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.480 
still pretty cool so if you really need
to<00:04:58.480> be<00:04:58.600> charging<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.080> lot<00:04:59.260> this<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.310> something

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
to be charging a lot this is something

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.820 
to be charging a lot this is something
to<00:05:00.640> consider<00:05:00.850> I<00:05:01.120> suppose<00:05:01.480> so<00:05:02.320> that's<00:05:02.440> my<00:05:02.590> quick

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
to consider I suppose so that's my quick
