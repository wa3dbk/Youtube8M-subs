I would presume the USB 3 could be used
for<00:01:05.700> some<00:01:05.850> sort<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.090> external<00:01:06.510> storage<00:01:06.780> being

for some sort of external storage being

for some sort of external storage being
that<00:01:07.500> what<00:01:08.130> else<00:01:08.310> would<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.610> use<00:01:08.640> USB<00:01:09.450> 3<00:01:09.720> for

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that what else would you use USB 3 for

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
that what else would you use USB 3 for
realistically<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.830> additionally<00:01:11.400> in

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
realistically and additionally in

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the controller which I believe can be

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.880 
the controller which I believe can be
used<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> lot<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> different<00:01:18.119> things

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
alright box within a box so we'll go

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.429 
alright box within a box so we'll go
ahead<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.780> pull<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:36.990> into<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> Box<00:01:37.439> out<00:01:39.439> and

of<00:01:40.560> course<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> box<00:01:41.070> within<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.400> box<00:01:41.460> there's

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
of course the box within a box there's

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.819 
of course the box within a box there's
tape<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.630> strangely<00:01:43.500> enough<00:01:43.649> this

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
tape on it but strangely enough this

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.710 
tape on it but strangely enough this
tape<00:01:43.979> has<00:01:44.100> already<00:01:44.340> been<00:01:44.460> cut<00:01:44.759> although<00:01:45.479> I

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
tape has already been cut although I

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.280 
tape has already been cut although I
didn't<00:01:45.990> cut<00:01:46.140> it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
didn't cut it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.810 
didn't cut it
I<00:01:46.409> cut<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.009> outside<00:01:47.130> already<00:01:47.460> but

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
I cut the one on the outside already but

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.539 
I cut the one on the outside already but
there<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.540> box<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.530> open<00:01:49.829> here<00:01:50.189> are<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> two

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
there we go box is open here are the two

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.670 
there we go box is open here are the two
main<00:01:50.850> portions<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> device<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
main portions of the device you have the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.240 
main portions of the device you have the
Mad<00:01:53.070> Catz<00:01:53.310> mojo<00:01:53.880> console<00:01:54.780> itself<00:01:55.250> relatively

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
Mad Catz mojo console itself relatively

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.730 
Mad Catz mojo console itself relatively
small<00:01:56.579> relatively<00:01:57.030> lightweight<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.590> has

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
small relatively lightweight and it has

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.399 
small relatively lightweight and it has
a<00:01:59.009> little<00:01:59.670> adapter<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.540> USB<00:02:00.840> 3<00:02:01.170> port

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
a little adapter in the USB 3 port

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.230 
a little adapter in the USB 3 port
already<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:02.369> what<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.729> can't<00:02:02.939> see<00:02:03.090> because

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
already for what you can't see because

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.819 
already for what you can't see because
all<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> glare<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:03.960> light<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.649> there<00:02:04.740> is

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
all the glare in the light but there is

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:05.990 
all the glare in the light but there is
a<00:02:04.860> little<00:02:05.100> depth<00:02:05.310> ur<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.520> there<00:02:05.640> which<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.909> would

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
a little depth ur in there which I would

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.119 
a little depth ur in there which I would
presume<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.689> would<00:02:07.350> presume<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> bluetooth

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
presume I would presume it's a bluetooth

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.559 
presume I would presume it's a bluetooth
dongle<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.789> said<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.060> had<00:02:09.179> built-in

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
dongle but it said it had built-in

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.230 
dongle but it said it had built-in
Bluetooth<00:02:09.959> 4<00:02:10.259> so

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
Bluetooth 4 so

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.730 
Bluetooth 4 so
that's<00:02:11.390> kind<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.720> interesting<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:12.320> confusing

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
that's kind of interesting and confusing

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.920 
that's kind of interesting and confusing
at<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.890> same<00:02:13.070> time<00:02:13.340> maybe<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
at the same time maybe the the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.320 
at the same time maybe the the
controller<00:02:15.710> is<00:02:15.950> not<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.790> says<00:02:16.970> bluetooth

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
controller is not a it says bluetooth

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.820 
controller is not a it says bluetooth
smart<00:02:17.480> on<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:17.990> maybe<00:02:18.170> that's<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.500> Bluetooth

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
smart on it so maybe that's a Bluetooth

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.920 
smart on it so maybe that's a Bluetooth
smart<00:02:18.980> dongle<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.700> maybe<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.540> doesn't<00:02:20.810> have

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
smart dongle and maybe it doesn't have

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.690 
smart dongle and maybe it doesn't have
bluetooth<00:02:21.290> smart<00:02:21.380> built-in<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.040> don't<00:02:22.640> know

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
bluetooth smart built-in I don't know

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.520 
bluetooth smart built-in I don't know
I'm<00:02:22.850> still<00:02:23.060> very<00:02:23.210> new<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
I'm still very new to this the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.800 
I'm still very new to this the
controller<00:02:24.890> itself<00:02:25.220> feels<00:02:25.970> very<00:02:26.240> solid<00:02:26.570> in

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
controller itself feels very solid in

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.270 
controller itself feels very solid in
the<00:02:26.900> hand<00:02:26.930> let<00:02:27.230> me<00:02:27.290> try<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.470> get<00:02:27.650> two<00:02:27.830> hands<00:02:28.070> on

the hand let me try to get two hands on

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.520 
the hand let me try to get two hands on

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
that it feels a lot like an Xbox

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.670 
that it feels a lot like an Xbox
controller<00:02:34.270> except<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.720> Mad<00:02:36.020> Catz<00:02:36.260> branded

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
controller except the Mad Catz branded

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.890 
controller except the Mad Catz branded
one<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.310> plastic<00:02:37.730> feels<00:02:37.970> kind<00:02:38.780> of

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
one so that the plastic feels kind of

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.800 
one so that the plastic feels kind of
plastic<00:02:39.380> II<00:02:39.500> but<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.070> underside<00:02:40.640> feels<00:02:41.150> solid

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
matte plastic feel like you would get

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.040 
matte plastic feel like you would get
out<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> normal<00:02:45.650> Xbox<00:02:46.130> 360<00:02:46.640> controller<00:02:47.050> but

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
out of a normal Xbox 360 controller but

the neighborhood of 3 to 4 feet maybe a

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.450 
the neighborhood of 3 to 4 feet maybe a
little<00:03:25.940> over<00:03:26.090> meter<00:03:27.070> here<00:03:28.070> we<00:03:28.190> should<00:03:28.340> have

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
little over meter here we should have

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.460 
little over meter here we should have
the<00:03:28.550> power<00:03:28.760> brick<00:03:29.120> let's<00:03:29.780> go<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.020> open<00:03:30.140> that

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
the power brick let's go and open that
