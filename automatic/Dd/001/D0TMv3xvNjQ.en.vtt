a little bit on the lighter end it's

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.859 
a little bit on the lighter end it's
definitely<00:00:23.100> not<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> rig<00:00:24.029> you'd<00:00:24.240> want<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.570> tour

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869

around<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.619> your<00:00:25.920> band<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:27.359> wires<00:00:27.599> would

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
around with your band the wires would

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.980 
around with your band the wires would
probably<00:00:28.140> break<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:29.010> frame<00:00:29.640> itself<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
probably break the frame itself that the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.280 
probably break the frame itself that the
drum<00:00:31.669> set<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.880> actual<00:00:33.120> rack<00:00:33.480> itself<00:00:34.079> is

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
people did mention how the hi-hat is a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.289 
people did mention how the hi-hat is a
little<00:01:10.080> misleading<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.250> 100%<00:01:11.790> agree<00:01:12.060> with

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
little misleading and I 100% agree with

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.050 
little misleading and I 100% agree with
that<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:13.650> feels<00:01:13.950> nothing<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> real

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
that this feels nothing like a real

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.179 
that this feels nothing like a real
hi-hat<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.110> way<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.439> positioned<00:01:17.070> is

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
hi-hat the way it's positioned is

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.160 
hi-hat the way it's positioned is
nothing<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> real<00:01:17.909> hi-hat<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
nothing like a real hi-hat if you if you

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.160 
nothing like a real hi-hat if you if you
position<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> hi-hat<00:01:20.780> like<00:01:21.780> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
position this like a hi-hat like you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.960 
position this like a hi-hat like you
know<00:01:22.290> flat<00:01:22.560> you're<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> get<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
know flat you're going to get a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.609 
know flat you're going to get a
different<00:01:24.210> sound<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> rim<00:01:24.990> than<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
different sound on the rim than you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.289 
different sound on the rim than you
would<00:01:25.770> even<00:01:25.950> hit<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> middle<00:01:26.400> pad<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.090> see<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
would even hit the middle pad so see I

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.149 
would even hit the middle pad so see I
have<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.570> tilted<00:01:27.960> because<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.979> do

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
have it tilted because you really do

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.550 
have it tilted because you really do
have<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> hit<00:01:29.670> within<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.119> limit<00:01:30.540> pair<00:01:30.840> to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
have to hit within this limit pair to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.010 
have to hit within this limit pair to
get<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.979> right<00:01:32.189> sound<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> hi-hat<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.630> by

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
get the right sound of a hi-hat so by

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
get the right sound of a hi-hat so by
positioning<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.770> you'd<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.280> play<00:01:35.460> in

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
positioning it up you'd have to play in

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.719 
positioning it up you'd have to play in
a<00:01:35.670> very<00:01:35.880> awkward<00:01:36.150> position<00:01:36.619> to<00:01:37.619> still<00:01:38.490> kind<00:01:38.700> of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
a very awkward position to still kind of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.569 
a very awkward position to still kind of
get<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> same<00:01:40.009> positioning<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.130> would<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.430> an

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
get the same positioning you would on an

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.330 
get the same positioning you would on an
acoustic<00:01:41.820> drum<00:01:42.240> set<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:43.500> drum<00:01:43.860> thrown<00:01:44.159> does

acoustic drum set the drum thrown does

acoustic drum set the drum thrown does
not<00:01:44.520> come<00:01:44.939> with<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.270> drum<00:01:45.570> set<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.960> bought

girlfriend or why it doesn't want to
hear<00:03:20.889> it<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.340> it's<00:03:21.549> still<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:22.060> still<00:03:22.150> loud

hear it so it's still it's still loud
it's<00:03:23.169> not<00:03:23.440> bad<00:03:23.859> so<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.760> I'd<00:03:33.940> say<00:03:34.150> I've<00:03:34.750> played

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
it's not bad so so I'd say I've played

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.599 
it's not bad so so I'd say I've played
on<00:03:35.169> acoustic<00:03:35.319> drum<00:03:35.829> sets<00:03:36.069> I've<00:03:36.280> used<00:03:36.459> those

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
on acoustic drum sets I've used those

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.270 
on acoustic drum sets I've used those
silence<00:03:37.090> pads<00:03:37.389> on<00:03:38.019> acoustic<00:03:38.680> drum<00:03:38.859> sets<00:03:39.129> and

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
silence pads on acoustic drum sets and

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.839 
silence pads on acoustic drum sets and
this<00:03:39.430> is<00:03:39.609> by<00:03:39.879> far<00:03:40.440> quieter<00:03:41.639> especially<00:03:42.639> on<00:03:42.760> the

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
this is by far quieter especially on the

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.210 
this is by far quieter especially on the
bass<00:03:43.060> drum<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.660> mean<00:03:44.139> I<00:03:44.349> tried<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.769> silencer

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
bass drum I mean I tried the silencer

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.770 
bass drum I mean I tried the silencer
pads<00:03:45.579> on<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:45.910> bass<00:03:46.090> drum<00:03:46.120> you're<00:03:46.419> still<00:03:46.660> going

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
pads on the bass drum you're still going

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.080 
pads on the bass drum you're still going
to<00:03:46.840> get<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:46.959> echo<00:03:47.440> in<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.739> deep<00:03:48.010> bass<00:03:48.340> where

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
to get that echo in that deep bass where

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.220 
to get that echo in that deep bass where
here<00:03:49.419> you<00:03:49.449> have<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:49.900> pad<00:03:50.169> down<00:03:50.530> there<00:03:50.829> so

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
here you have that pad down there so

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.479 
here you have that pad down there so
it's<00:03:53.230> actually<00:03:53.379> really<00:03:53.739> great<00:03:54.099> and<00:03:54.340> that's

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489

electronics involved now you're in the

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.550 
electronics involved now you're in the
same<00:05:33.940> boat<00:05:34.240> as<00:05:34.419> guitarists<00:05:35.020> bass<00:05:35.289> players

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
same boat as guitarists bass players

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.070 
same boat as guitarists bass players
where<00:05:36.580> could<00:05:36.729> go<00:05:36.849> wrong<00:05:37.060> and<00:05:37.450> all<00:05:37.900> of

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
where could go wrong and all of

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.459 
where could go wrong and all of
sudden<00:05:38.289> you're<00:05:38.710> stuck<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.400> with<00:05:39.760> no<00:05:39.940> drummer

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
sudden you're stuck and with no drummer

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.779 
sudden you're stuck and with no drummer
so<00:05:41.469> that's<00:05:41.889> something<00:05:42.039> I<00:05:42.190> would<00:05:42.310> keep<00:05:42.400> in<00:05:42.550> mind

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
so that's something I would keep in mind

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.100 
so that's something I would keep in mind
so<00:05:43.330> that's<00:05:43.450> why<00:05:43.630> I<00:05:43.659> said<00:05:43.870> I<00:05:43.930> wouldn't

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
so that's why I said I wouldn't

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
so that's why I said I wouldn't
necessarily<00:05:44.440> recommend<00:05:44.590> it<00:05:44.979> for<00:05:45.010> people

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
necessarily recommend it for people

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.180 
necessarily recommend it for people
doing<00:05:45.550> shows<00:05:46.139> it's<00:05:47.139> more<00:05:47.349> just<00:05:47.590> for<00:05:47.800> somebody

doing shows it's more just for somebody
