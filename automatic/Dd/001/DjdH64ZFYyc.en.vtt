00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.330
 continue to increase as you say it already 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.229

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.229
 to our very well 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.610
 it was a new conquest with the people who 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.860
 I wrapped myself in a very good way with his 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.450
 sweetheart with your support and I think this does not 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.900
 has to be the exception has to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.170
 come a better tournament has to work 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.520
 even more and good to continue enjoying 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.980
 all this is also the most beautiful 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.590
 do not keep hooking us with people 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.330
 continue to support and above all that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.510
 chivas are the first planes that are 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.800
 of our 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.690
 we have to wrap them up first 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.820
 instance I think we have to learn 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.130
 mutually not also one learns from 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.750
 all young people bring that hunger that 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.540
 ambition to want to succeed and good 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.880
 we have to empathize that experience 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.820
 with youth and try to make a 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.320
 dynamic team a team that go 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.870
 in front who wants to win each one of 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.380
 the parties that get the most 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.320
 number of points and I think the team 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.880
 this pre-season fits very well 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.890
 we are together we are united and good 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.280
 let's fight all for the same 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.990
 goal that is to first think about 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.910
 get away completely from the table 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.280
 percentage in qualifying the league and 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.230
 after dreaming about the championship in the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.930
 individual good day to day follow 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.510
 improving keep preparing me every time 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.000
 more to follow 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.340
 giving the best of me showing the best 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.879
 attitude working I think it's the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.549
 priority and good first of all the 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.610
 championship is not what I dream and good 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.190
 then a future will come with 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.329
 different situations different things 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.769
 Here's what you can miss us less than the 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.420
 Trust has to be at maximum 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.310
 we have to follow the hand of the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.230
 hobby and us 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.209
 to meet the goals that all 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.220
 I think we want the same thing that is the 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.930
 championship then nothing remains but 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.319
 thank them and ask them to continue with 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.319
