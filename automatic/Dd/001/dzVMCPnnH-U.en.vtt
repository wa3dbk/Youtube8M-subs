00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.140
 hello sometimes that happens to the car 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.009
 which is your repair you are not 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.750
 can find body dimensions 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.350
 Well, in particular , let 's say on the front 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:40.500
 parts i use i use such 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.730
 method means i do 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.780
 Fully all measurements that are only 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.729
 I am available to start all the measurements I 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.760
 try 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:54.809
 bonding wick hood 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.410
 that is, it is basic . from which i 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.000
 I'm starting to punch 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.460
 spars glass and arrows wings and all 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.250
 the rest is naturally necessary 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.960
 be sure to check this point any of 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.940
 of these points 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.320
 distance from the door provided of course 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.679
 what's in all the gaps 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.509
 further cars are whole normal in 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.390
 In this case, I have gaps here. 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:23.890
 same distance from door to point 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.740
 and from this point I start to measure 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.960
 entire engine compartment 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.899
 then I bring it all to this 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.250
 leaflet 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.520
 the more sizes there will be 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.790
 more accurate measurement that is, you can measure 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.240
 to any absolutely points if only they 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:48.090
 were symmetrical let's say thefts were 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:51.750
 let's say the edge of the boom wing mount 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.170
 glasses on the rack mount glass 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.289
 the end of the spars here in general is absolutely 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.659
 any points but there is one small 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.020
 but before you do this carefully 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.420
 look at the side members 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.880
 if they have different configurations that 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:15.220
 maybe it is possible the car has 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.140
 asymmetric structure so to speak 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.610
 front end it happens 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.040
 sometimes on japanese cars there 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.800
 Germans on and on sometimes it happens so 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.600
 look carefully spars if 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.900
 they have the same shape 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.160
 that is, symmetrically like this 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.850
 case that is, the basis of 99 percent 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.830
 believe that the whole will be 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.660
 symmetrical 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.830
 in this case, I suppose all the same that 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.670
 this car has symmetrical 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:54.239
 body sizes because glasses and 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.519
 the arrows have the same absolutely shape 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:01.959
 no change and difference is the same 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.739
 I see the most on the spar from I will return 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.340
 dimensions 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:10.980
 which i drew i drew first 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:15.130
 with diana you and then from the center line 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:19.060
 then sit down and start analyzing where 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.519
 how much that also went away 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.160
 Besides 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.750
 look carefully and on the body itself 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.200
 to understand because you might think 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.730
 that this side needs to be pushed here 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.980
 you might think that the other side needs 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.290
 move here here as they say 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.690
 visual inspection 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.950
 let's say here i see this here 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:45.430
 the part is welded and costs relatively 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.180
 this rack exactly but on this side I 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.980
 I see clearly that there is a deviation 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.190
 based on my measurements here this part on 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.200
 8 millimeters went here accordingly 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.500
 my excuse is to suggest what is inside about 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.019
 tom here I see their damage which 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.340
 deformations accordingly this place is me 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.260
 should be pulled inwards 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.420
 that is, sit down carefully and 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.980
 analyze dimensions 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:15.609
 understand how much it took and then 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.650
 you can restore the car 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.810
 without themselves 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.430
 dimensions of control points though 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.620
 it wo n't be easy either but anyway 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.410
 it will be easier than doing it all with 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.630
 bay-floundering trying to put every time 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:36.880
 wings hoods and everything else then you 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:40.509
 put in front of the factory space is 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.479
 there is a middle point put the hood 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:46.960
 check and os hood distance here's to 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.810
 From this point , from the hood to the door 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.490
 if this distance is the same then 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.850
 you can already on the hood loop 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.570
 watch how it will fall on the castle 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.699
 and already draw conclusions it is also 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.530
 figure that is relative to glass 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:07.360
 put on the body put 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:10.539
 hood exactly and then you will understand where you have 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.220
 must be in front of the left and right to 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:17.949
 hood latch on the very eye 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.360
 Well, that somehow all hope this advice 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.360
 he will help in work too
