00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 I will work it imagine yourself more 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.769
 reporter culture now providing 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.250
 in the world of emissions 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.289
 to more communication channels and I know 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.470
 a little about it I have to tell you 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.720
 that between the beds 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:26.090
 and maybe I face my experience 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.039
 I have very good experiences but as 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.580
 presenters one I feel like fish in 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.189
 Water 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.410
 starts at age 16 in the program 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.530
 cultural here elaborates as co-conductor 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.390
 to get to become your driver 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.850
 one year later 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.950
 which he performs for three more years 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.260
 until I decided to do casting for the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.210
 program of academic contests the forum 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.840
 of knowing a very funny program 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.940
 made for children and teenagers 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.430
 they gave me this great opportunity that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.470
 take advantage for four more years until 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.600
 I got access to the workshop of actors of the 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.600
 World 2007 in Miami Florida 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.040
 and see everything happy 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.040
 how funny 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.939
 but as my teacher Adriana says back 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.790
 is 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.810
 so you can interpret it and all the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.410
 people who are behind you 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.410
 You can think about living it and feeling it too 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.380
 and that's where love comes from 11 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.120
 I needed to talk to you with that note 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.280
 that you bring, I thought someone had 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.540
 dead even though I figured it would not be bitter 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.540
 because that leaves you happy 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.100
 Look at the anger at night with surrounding him 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.420
 it was scary and we have not even returned 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.240
 to talk 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.479
 and not just as you expect, maybe that's your 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.479
 problem 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.070
 who always hopes to know what will happen 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.040
 instead of agreeing 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.830
 loves of 12 a new road where I went 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.250
 protagonist crossing moment and what I 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.250

 there are places available or where 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.850
 you are the producer of the moment you do not 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.130

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.020

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.130
