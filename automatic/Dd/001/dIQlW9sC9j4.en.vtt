this experiment does is it shows
children<00:00:29.009> how<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.189> flowers<00:00:29.490> drink<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.269> water

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
children how the flowers drink up water

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.440 
children how the flowers drink up water
from<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.890> bottom<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:32.490> stem<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.360> way

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
from the bottom of the stem all the way

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.170 
from the bottom of the stem all the way
through<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> leaves<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.760> start<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
through to the leaves and to start the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.970 
through to the leaves and to start the
experiment<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.840> need<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.470> have<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.710> cups

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
experiment you need to have your cups

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430 
experiment you need to have your cups
out<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.460> use<00:00:38.580> just<00:00:38.820> clear<00:00:39.030> plastic<00:00:39.240> cups<00:00:39.630> and<00:00:39.840> I

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
out we use just clear plastic cups and I

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.810 
out we use just clear plastic cups and I
put<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.270> cup<00:00:42.270> each<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> water<00:00:43.430> or<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> cup<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
put a cup each of water or a cup of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.650 
put a cup each of water or a cup of
water<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.180> each<00:00:48.110> and<00:00:49.580> then<00:00:50.580> to<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.880> water<00:00:51.120> I

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
water in each and then to the water I

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.140 
water in each and then to the water I
add<00:00:52.520> about<00:00:53.520> 30<00:00:53.880> drops<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.660> food<00:00:54.930> coloring<00:00:56.150> so

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
add about 30 drops of food coloring so

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.580 
add about 30 drops of food coloring so
you<00:00:57.240> can<00:00:57.420> choose<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> color<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.110> food<00:00:58.290> coloring

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
you can choose a color of food coloring

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.160 
you can choose a color of food coloring
that<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.800> want<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.190> use<00:00:59.780> there's<00:01:00.780> some<00:01:00.960> clubs

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that you want to use there's some clubs

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.480 
that you want to use there's some clubs
that<00:01:01.290> work<00:01:01.440> better<00:01:01.650> than<00:01:01.890> others<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.430> think

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
that work better than others I think

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.719 
that work better than others I think
green<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.940> about<00:01:02.970> the<00:01:03.300> slowest<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.580> would

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
green is about the slowest so you would

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:17.270 
green is about the slowest so you would
add<00:01:05.850> 30<00:01:06.119> drops<00:01:06.420> into<00:01:06.780> each<00:01:07.710> cup<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.579> water

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.120 

and<00:01:17.730> it<00:01:17.940> doesn't<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.480> be<00:01:18.600> exact<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and it doesn't have to be exact but the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.110 
and it doesn't have to be exact but the
more<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.490> better<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.450> better<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:23.120> color

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
more the better the better the color

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:34.760 
more the better the better the color
will<00:01:24.300> rise

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.580 

all<00:01:35.399> right<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:35.939> then<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.929> want<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> take<00:01:37.380> your

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
all right and then you want to take your

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.980 
all right and then you want to take your
flowers<00:01:38.039> and<00:01:38.420> usually<00:01:39.420> when<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> purchase

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
them they're very long and again these

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.609 
them they're very long and again these
are<00:01:41.579> carnations<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.539> you<00:01:43.079> want<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.439> it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.479 
through to the petals of the carnation
so<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.150> leave<00:02:18.299> these<00:02:18.739> in<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:20.220> area

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
so you just leave these in the area

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.800 
so you just leave these in the area
that's<00:02:20.579> pretty<00:02:20.910> safe<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.360> children<00:02:21.660> can

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
that's pretty safe and children can

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.530 
that's pretty safe and children can
observe<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.349> changes<00:02:22.739> when<00:02:22.890> they<00:02:22.980> walk<00:02:23.190> by<00:02:23.540> no

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
observe the changes when they walk by no

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.300 
observe the changes when they walk by no

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
explain to them that these aren't to be

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
touched the cups that are or the flower

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.830 
touched the cups that are or the flower
petals<00:02:28.980> right<00:02:29.160> now<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:30.120> let<00:02:30.239> them<00:02:30.390> soak<00:02:30.599> up

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
petals right now just let them soak up

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.210 
petals right now just let them soak up
the<00:02:31.019> water<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.319> that's<00:02:31.470> how<00:02:31.709> they<00:02:31.920> get<00:02:32.069> their

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
the water and that's how they get their

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.880 
the water and that's how they get their
food<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.450> they<00:02:33.599> soak<00:02:33.840> up<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.110> water<00:02:34.319> into

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
food is that they soak up the water into

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.539 
food is that they soak up the water into
the<00:02:35.040> stems<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.810> up<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.079> petals<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.680> then

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
the stems and up to the petals and then

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.539 
the stems and up to the petals and then
after<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.150> few<00:02:39.450> hours<00:02:39.980> you'll<00:02:40.980> start<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.400> notice

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
after a few hours you'll start to notice

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.599 
after a few hours you'll start to notice
color<00:02:41.940> changes<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:43.799> these<00:02:43.920> what<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.190> did<00:02:44.400> red

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
and green and I don't know if you can

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.960 
and green and I don't know if you can
see<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.410> too<00:02:49.590> good<00:02:49.829> but<00:02:50.519> these<00:02:50.670> are<00:02:50.819> no<00:02:50.940> longer

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
see it too good but these are no longer

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.660 
see it too good but these are no longer
white<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.290> red<00:02:52.709> like<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> pinkish<00:02:53.400> and

this is green and if you look at the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.309 
this is green and if you look at the
tips<00:02:55.829> of<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.519> flowers<00:02:57.000> that's<00:02:57.750> we<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.139> see

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
tips of the flowers that's we can see

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.140 
tips of the flowers that's we can see
where<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.590> color<00:02:58.799> has<00:02:59.100> all<00:02:59.310> started<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.940> go<00:03:00.120> to

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
where the color has all started to go to

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.330 
where the color has all started to go to
from<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> food<00:03:01.470> coloring<00:03:01.739> that's<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.220> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
from the food coloring that's in the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.490 
from the food coloring that's in the
water<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.750> same<00:03:03.959> thing<00:03:04.200> with<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.410> green

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
water and the same thing with the green

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.289 
water and the same thing with the green
one<00:03:04.769> if<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:04.920> look<00:03:05.010> on<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.220> edges<00:03:05.609> are<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
one if you look on the edges are the

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.629 
one if you look on the edges are the
petals<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:07.230> food<00:03:07.620> card<00:03:07.859> is<00:03:07.980> come<00:03:08.190> all<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.549> way

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
petals the food card is come all the way

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.479 
petals the food card is come all the way
through<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.959> stem<00:03:10.230> all<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.130> way<00:03:11.220> through<00:03:11.400> the

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
through the stem all the way through the

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.440 
through the stem all the way through the
pedals<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.060> now<00:03:12.269> out<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.720> edges<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:13.349> the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
pedals and now out to the edges of the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
pedals and now out to the edges of the
petal<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.599> this<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.840> really<00:03:16.079> just<00:03:16.109> a<00:03:16.290> cool

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
petal so this is really just a cool

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.400 
petal so this is really just a cool
experiment<00:03:16.859> experiment<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:18.260> showing<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.319> to

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
experiment experiment and showing you to

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.009 
experiment experiment and showing you to
see<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.590> lot<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.799> changes<00:03:20.370> with<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.639> petals

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
see a lot of changes with the petals

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.500 
see a lot of changes with the petals
also<00:03:22.019> it's<00:03:22.319> good<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.560> tell<00:03:22.739> them<00:03:22.859> that<00:03:23.510> the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
also it's good to tell them that the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.210 
also it's good to tell them that the
food<00:03:24.690> card<00:03:24.900> does<00:03:25.049> not<00:03:25.230> hurt<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.680> plant<00:03:25.919> at<00:03:26.130> all

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
food card does not hurt the plant at all

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.360 
food card does not hurt the plant at all
and<00:03:26.959> maybe<00:03:27.959> talk<00:03:28.230> about<00:03:28.260> maybe<00:03:28.620> pollution<00:03:29.250> or

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
and maybe talk about maybe pollution or

that that does get soaked up into the
wildlife<00:03:34.019> plants<00:03:34.739> as<00:03:34.889> well<00:03:34.919> so<00:03:35.609> we<00:03:35.790> want<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.090> be
