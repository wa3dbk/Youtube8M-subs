00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:05.190
 welcome to this the second video these two the presentation 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.210
 after the first video sent this I really got a lot of emails 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.219
 from people who really enjoyed it 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.749
 it may not be that long though 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:16.269
 a number of people have had hands on and the many plays are fun 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.279
 hence this second video 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.179
 given three tips in my previous period 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.069
 and give tips during this fidesz orbit 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.069
 after the first tip it is patient 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.190
 it is very important especially when the volts run a marathon 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.480
 that you are patient with you so do not continue too quickly and 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.460
 that you are just bullshit 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.829
 But we were within two months within six months within a year 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.750
 eventually you get there that caused a traffic jam canceled 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.180
 when a lot was set up 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.330
 eventually the duels could consistently work towards the goal 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.800
 that sounds a lot what i wanted to say 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.160
 but there is a reasonable chance that you will get an injury for the first time 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.340
 month 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.450
 the chance also that you have multiple injuries per program top gear 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.050
 or behind the front runner 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.400
 are you also roaring a million 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.160
 at the moment that you are so injured 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.660
 so very important to take enough rest 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.150
 but who of course wants that by mean you are training for the 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.490
 marathon label 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.560
 but it's just as important to be 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.950
 take enough rest 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.330
 both to go 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.560
 pieces themselves not a super simic and made 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.030
 so it doesn't matter how more injured 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.140
 of course it is very bad 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.570
 too bad and very silly 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.140
 only very important to take a rest from doing that does not differ only 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.800
 but make it worse 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 so the snack bar to be patient 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.230
 a marathon during training 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.480
 but also to be honorable during the marathon itself 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.900
 to run the marathon 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.970
 what we did i walked the man could together with father 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.740
 from the very beginning have gone very smoothly our own pace we are now going 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.170
 we are going to walk because people among us are all very enthusiastic 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.160
 goods 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.159
 and emotionally 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.820
 do that do to people like me cheering enthusiastically 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.820
 and and and therefore get certain 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.090
 adrenaline or 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.070
 you get a new one from the ball then the whole world becomes anp 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.420
 so therefore 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.659
 she may further be you think but I am going to run a little faster 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.080
 we have but it must be two 40 miles long so you need your strength 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.909
 you have to grab something 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.489
 So it is very important to also embrace at home 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.759
 or the people that is so we did it 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.100
 just keep a constant pace and that is what we have done 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.039
 we start a bit awkwardly revealed with all of us in it 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.749
 but at a certain moment 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.269
 after 20 kilometers, no one else can count on anything else for people to eat 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.550
 because we are 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.629
 have kept a constant pace 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.879
 and we also saw and we also knew the people who were working on it 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.199
 running loire who were catching up 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.229
 you see that would be very difficult because we were a country at that time 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.599
 in hands from which they are probably even that but true 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.889
 So 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.120
 it's really why just be patient 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.159
 towards a marathon 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.019
 when injured 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.670
 a great pity a great deal of sin 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.670
 but then adjust your goal more at the official goal 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:04.769
 the bone successor found but a bit different 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.169
 let go a little, for example 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.270
 just keep going just keep going 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.699
 both charity very much more important she wants that difficult 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.789
 the exit if I can alone with nice trainer then with the 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:18.089
 booty 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.740
 it is just very inconvenient 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.189
 the chance is reasonable that you will come across 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.189
 and just continue or use advantage 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:30.929
 well i may have read it once and my mails but i have one 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:35.259
 agreement would be full and and that everyone has years has for the 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.269
 show off roader again but a golden rule is very simple 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.429
 never stop running 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:44.019
 clement and I also did my first marathon, now the last 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.009
 kilometers that the end of the level crossing 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.879
 only i have for myself he hated myself intended nothing anyway with 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:50.609
 running 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.329
 I was still one of the two men in the body during the last one 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.209
 miles though they also have really crazy pace with him but I have 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.039
 not just loose 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.919
 so that case the world 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.719
 go thursday north holland 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:01.970
 when year starts training 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:02.669
 and you sit 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.829
 claim the moped car 20 kilometers 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:05.789
 running 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:09.659
 in and with the 10 kilometers I have but I'm just going to walk a few brabant 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.819
 north it works for me so of course not everyone works for me just like that 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.280
 it so if I go for a walk once 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.439
 I really can't manage to run again 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:21.799
 the nearby is murder van bommel the moment you just murder 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.949
 numbers of very difficult to start running again 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:25.909
 and 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:30.179
 poor and I have that for yourself you also have a better feeling that you are full 

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:32.249
 because this is not the complete one 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:35.249
 route traveled descending the exit 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.400
 if my golden rule is just 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.230
 never start with a miracle 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.539
 the moment it gets really hard and you have walked 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.699
 what I just do is to run less fast 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.240
 so i go to 20 or 30 its less run but you will stay too 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.259
 and even though it is really a very dork thing 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.300
 just keep walking calmly and then you'll be fine 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.250
 we get an extra energy and then you can keep your pace 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.409
 we are going to play football 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.139
 and in the last time i had to pick up report technique that i did very well 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.999
 combine with my golden rule 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.540
 it's just very simple the moment you 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.309
 the running gang have the feeling that you want bommel 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:15.139
 vandenbroucke that feeling very often then you just grab a point 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.639
 looks meters before you grab the ball tree 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.139
 and then say but I am still going to run until those trees and then walk 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.729
 Of course you don't do that 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.729
 those suits.and to a point go so still had walked 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.480
 or you can even have the bed right up to that point or are there afterwards 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.040
 or the center and the runner will walk a little slower but I keep running fast 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.169
 going becomes difficult 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.240
 and if you are at the point i can be me 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.990
 m that you generate some energy again with you just slowly increase your pace again 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.930
 is going 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.930
 so then soon again on the murder command 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.569
 the last two last tip I have I can give him a beer 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:53.189
 maybe not very smart but he does as i did 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:56.840
 at the moment i decided i had the guy run it 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.839
 but I was way too heavy is not a condition 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.279
 but I had decided and I had set the goal but goalkeeper for the time being 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.449
 moment I have told everyone around me 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.659
 I am running for a marathon I must go normally want to go 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.080
 run the rotterdam marathon 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.350
 with many different ones that made you laugh when she heard it and the family 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.590
 also and colleagues over and so he also had the logical can not believe myself either 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.089
 has fallen if I canceled or heard 

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.219
 just the that's what i did i just told everyone i was on 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:26.520
 a constant said 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.880
 when I had to go to Mafia branch last year I could leave but I am 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.160
 a trainer but underestimated 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.629
 a few minutes later 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.520
 and m because you tell everyone 6 because not everyone says 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.110
 both must 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.719
 the moment that I am 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:42.979
 Having made the decision, I sent an email including friends 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:44.559
 and i just told them about it 

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:49.110
 Whenever I have and I especially I could still be training for the former 

00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:50.849
 to fill this up 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.029
 then the mobile 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:56.029
 now it has always caught me with this 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.910
 very simple I just have to express myself 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.889
 because I am because I am all there friends and family 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.960
 My acquaintances and colleagues who all knew that I had a training for the 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.050
 marathon and but I would also show it 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.389
 That helped Mario 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:16.460
 what I have also done is direct residents 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.300
 the accusations are going to run a marathon 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.779
 and immediately I have a gate kate entrance tickets 

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:25.479
 kaapstad bought tickets for the for the rotterdammer marathon 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.110
 and who preferred being hanged at noon 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.270
 and 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.400
 in our living room to see which well and then you have to 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.389
 tell everyone 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:37.770
 that helped me a lot you can still be very wise to say yes 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.770
 it was time for a stick behind the door 

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.370
 may i hope 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.679
 no matter what you were wearing with these tips, the world was on 

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:48.439
 so so again we be patient 

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:51.559
 very important in the end we could m 

00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:54.270
 can take longer than immediately planned but not out 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.409
 will come 

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:57.439
 the longer you wait, the nice of course 

00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:01.099
 normal golden rule go to the schoonoord and at the moment that you 

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:01.580
 really 

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.939
 bilzen van bommel then use the peter portengen league 

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:06.319
 mf tell everyone
