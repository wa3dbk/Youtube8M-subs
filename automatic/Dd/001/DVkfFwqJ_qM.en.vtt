00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
of battery and the flash needs about

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.030 
of battery and the flash needs about
three<00:01:11.130> seconds<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.909> recover<00:01:12.619> from<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.710> full

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
against wall to get the ceiling without

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.450 
against wall to get the ceiling without
any<00:01:45.670> kind<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:46.030> problems<00:01:46.569> and<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:46.960> do<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.460> very

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
any kind of problems and I do this very

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:57.490 
any kind of problems and I do this very
often<00:01:48.789> and<00:01:49.210> it's<00:01:49.719> very<00:01:49.929> practical<00:01:51.689> okay

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.740 

what<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.650> have<00:01:58.800> here<00:01:58.830> is<00:01:59.250> an<00:01:59.400> AF<00:01:59.700> assist<00:02:00.300> light

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
what you have here is an AF assist light

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.950 
what you have here is an AF assist light
it<00:02:01.110> helps<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.650> autofocus<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:03.360> focus

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
it helps the autofocus to focus

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.290 
it helps the autofocus to focus
I'm<00:02:04.530> very<00:02:04.830> good<00:02:05.100> when<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:05.430> shooting<00:02:06.000> at

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
I'm very good when you're shooting at

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.830 
I'm very good when you're shooting at
low<00:02:06.480> lights<00:02:07.130> or<00:02:08.130> even<00:02:08.400> in<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.820> dark<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.420> then

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
low lights or even in the dark and then

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.280 
low lights or even in the dark and then
your<00:02:10.320> camera<00:02:10.800> has<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.490> light<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.910> focus<00:02:12.330> some

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
your camera has a light to focus some

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.440 
your camera has a light to focus some
cameras<00:02:13.710> have<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.070> but<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.910> even<00:02:15.300> more

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
cameras have it but this is even more

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.320 
cameras have it but this is even more
powerful<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.290> more<00:02:16.550> efficient<00:02:17.550> than<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
powerful and more efficient than the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.400 
powerful and more efficient than the
built<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.840> AF<00:02:19.700> assist<00:02:20.700> light<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.390> your<00:02:21.540> camera

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.840 

okay<00:02:25.410> let's<00:02:25.650> talk<00:02:25.830> about<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.280> back<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.520> this

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
okay let's talk about the back of this

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.240 
okay let's talk about the back of this
flash<00:02:27.180> well<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.650> said<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:29.010> have<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
flash well like I said you have to

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.450 
flash well like I said you have to
slidable<00:02:29.670> LCD<00:02:30.360> display<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.110> then<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.220> light

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
slidable LCD display and then the light

and then you have no change chance to
zoom<00:03:34.850> you're<00:03:35.850> right<00:03:36.060> here<00:03:36.300> you<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.900> UV

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
zoom you're right here you have the UV

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.699 
zoom you're right here you have the UV
correction<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.190> if<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:38.730> want<00:03:38.940> more<00:03:39.709> brighter

light<00:03:41.070> or<00:03:42.020> less<00:03:43.020> light<00:03:44.720> depends<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:45.930> what<00:03:46.680> kind

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
light or less light depends on what kind

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.710 
light or less light depends on what kind
of<00:03:46.980> life<00:03:47.190> if<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.580> shoot<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> manual<00:03:48.270> mode<00:03:48.450> you

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
of life if you shoot a manual mode you

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.490 
of life if you shoot a manual mode you
can<00:03:48.930> put<00:03:49.440> down<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:50.010> power<00:03:51.000> ratio<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.510> 1/64<00:03:52.350> of

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
can put down the power ratio to 1/64 of

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.660 
can put down the power ratio to 1/64 of
a<00:03:52.650> second<00:03:53.540> yeah<00:03:54.540> that's<00:03:54.870> very<00:03:55.170> good<00:03:55.590> if<00:03:56.489> you

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
a second yeah that's very good if you

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.940 
a second yeah that's very good if you
want<00:03:57.180> just<00:03:57.630> less<00:03:58.470> light

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.140 

and<00:04:02.950> down<00:04:03.370> there<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.670> have<00:04:03.970> another

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
and down there you have another

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.170 
and down there you have another
information<00:04:05.050> it's<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:06.190> flash<00:04:06.459> range<00:04:06.790> scale

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
information it's the flash range scale

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.800 
information it's the flash range scale
and<00:04:08.080> it<00:04:08.500> shows<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.069> which<00:04:09.660> distance<00:04:10.660> you

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
and it shows you in which distance you

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.979 
and it shows you in which distance you
can<00:04:11.050> put<00:04:11.319> your<00:04:11.590> subject<00:04:12.340> your<00:04:13.150> object<00:04:13.630> which
