00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hi mont android and media to this new 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.220
 video in which I bring you a camera 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.529
 really spectacular and so good is 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.360
 it's about the camera of the htc one m 9 la 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.519
 which we can install directly in 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.590
 our devices without 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.360
 ruth ni recovery without anything and then good 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.119
 the only requirement that we will need 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.119
 is to have android 5.0 and higher or 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.859
 android lollipop once said this 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.779
 it is clear that this application is 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.880
 fully functional amical axis in 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.560
 four 112 councils but they also have me 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.830
 said that it is fully functional in 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.170
 devices like nexus motorola and others 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.170
 so without saying more we begin 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.520
 and good android as you see we already have 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.930
 installed the camera and the gallery I would 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.120
 I will leave the links in the description 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.490
 direct to be installed and how 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.200
 will see once installed to the camera we 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.030
 this icon will appear but if we install the 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.250
 gallery we will get these two icons on 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.710
 htc photo editor and gallery 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.170
 well once done that let's go to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.970
 the camera and how you will see an account 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.730
 with a pretty spectacular design 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.200
 has some touches materialize that the 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.240
 true that they go pretty well with this 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.460
 application the truth of the application 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.470
 been fully functional for me as 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.780
 come focus things too fast 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.460
 that I want to focus for example I'm going to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.890
 focus on this and the truth is that it is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.630
 pretty spectacular excuse me not 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.869
 I can record the video when I'm 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.190
 recording and with screen recording I can not 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.050
 record video since I'm recording 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.430
 screen so I hope and apologize 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.310
 but it is working equally 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.200
 totally correct the video as they see no 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.700
 let me record and well if it is that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.040
 here to loans in this world the menu 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.380
 of three dots we can see different 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.140
 photography options as it would be the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.030
 automatic mode night mode and so on 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.409
 not for example let's put in mode 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.289
 automatic in mode 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.280
 being out in car you see that I do not know what 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:01.799
 it will mean it is also in normal 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.899
 wv to change the different filters 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.670
 of the photograph we are going to put it in 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.140
 automatic itself and here in 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.030
 configurations we can change 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.519
 totally everything we want 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.980
 and for example in trimming we can put 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.410
 in regular four thirds that in my case 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.519
 would use the 13 mega pixels and the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.610
 format 16 ninth would use 99 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.569
 megapixels something like that but the truth is 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.329
 an application that has surprised me 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.150
 very much since we can and configure it 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.069
 everything as we want our 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.410
 restrictive like the google camera here 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.140
 we can see resolution four 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.090
 small medium thirds image adjustment 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.579
 video quality if you are 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.890
 they have video quality in 4k you should leave 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.660
 here that what video quality can 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.360
 make general configuration the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.280
 Grid 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.920
 the trigger the button options 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.810
 volume and it will reset the options 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.120
 we have already passed the button 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.100
 monument will see us that we leave these 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.960
 things that if it says choose a choice of 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.820
 Volume button to choose as an option 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.470
 at the time of pressing the volume by 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.750
 example if we press the volume 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.700
 which is the volume or capture or be made 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.600
 the photograph that the truth is quite 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.370
 well we have the option of flash 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.410
 as you can see is a flash option for 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.990
 activate it depending on the conditions 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.150
 in automatic we have the flash mode 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.720
 which is quite functional and good 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.930
 we can also go here to different 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.460
 options for example in add we can 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.280
 add different of these things but 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.990
 that some devices do not work 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.150
 like mine I do not work some of 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.040
 these so do not make them watered but 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.080
 It should be noted that if we make a 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.450
 gesture to here to the left or to the 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.510
 right does not leave self-portrait I take off 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.610
 since we just wake up if we're going to 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.340
 the camera likewise and the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.460
 homero and if we go to the panorama mode 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.830
 there we can go making a picture 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.530
 panoramic and that the truth is also 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.270
 fully functional so good a 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.710
 android this has been the video today no 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.570
 forget to check the other applications 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.860
 how would the gallery and the editor of 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.990
 photos that are also pretty 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.490
 great but the main theme of the 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.500
 video is the camera that is what most 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.360
 has surprised and good not from android a 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.580
 Once said that this has been the video of 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.020

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.000
 also do not forget to follow me my networks 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.720
