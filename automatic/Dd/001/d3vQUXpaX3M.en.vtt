think<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.620> maybe<00:03:18.950> there<00:03:19.760> should<00:03:19.970> be<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.090> jump

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
think that maybe there should be a jump

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.240 
think that maybe there should be a jump
start<00:03:20.660> before<00:03:20.870> October<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.709> seems<00:03:21.890> like<00:03:22.100> we

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
start before October it seems like we

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.880 
start before October it seems like we
wait<00:03:22.549> until<00:03:22.930> breast<00:03:23.930> cancer<00:03:24.380> awareness<00:03:24.500> month

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
wait until breast cancer awareness month

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.420 
wait until breast cancer awareness month
comes<00:03:25.400> up<00:03:25.610> before<00:03:25.850> we<00:03:26.239> start<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.720> really<00:03:26.870> get

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
comes up before we start to really get

00:03:27.430 --> 00:04:03.280 
comes up before we start to really get
active<00:03:28.430> about<00:03:28.730> it<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:01.610> know<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:01.760> think<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.540> it
