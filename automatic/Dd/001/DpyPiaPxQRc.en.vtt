00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.550
 here we are in the video tutorial of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.180
 how to create a store and how to how 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.490

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.370
 on this side this is a store let's go 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.490
 now to teach them how to create a store 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.189
 that same store but now with wood 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.310
 It is all the same with any object 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.910
 with any item we simply put 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.360
 a chest and we click 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.340
 left on the chest 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.690
 ok there it is and it will not tell you to enter the 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.530
 the remaining value would demonstrate the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.160
 product and we're going to give you $ 50 with 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.290
 50 pesos that and we give you click ok there is 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.080
 and whether it is set to the store just 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.590
 it's that easy now just to 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.510
 you buy simply do this 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.690
 just when you go to a store 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.500
 they left click the same and they will 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.440
 present everything from your own 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.420
 owner of the store and how much 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.780
 product although I forgot to put it to 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.310
 zero here and now how much that 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.470
 They are 50 pesos wood makes me let 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.140
 to put this 4 wood 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.080
 let's close let's go again 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.149
 experience like ok let's now give it 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.979
 left click again 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.020
 and here he will tell us that he has now four 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.399
 wood since I have entered the 4 wood that 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.840
 I had 50 pesos now to buy that 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.780
 in four way 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.210
 or whatever they want, we just give it in 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.880
 the chat we wrote the amount that 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.800
 we want for example I want two we go 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.120
 to buy that 2 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.360
 and as it came they seemed here from below 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.290
 in the wood and in the chest there are two 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.910
 well I think that's all that was like that 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.770
 easy everything you want to sell from 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.500
 animals but I think they have to be 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.740
 in new clear everything you want mind 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.750
 They can sell it if they see it in stores 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.500
 that are a bit expensive that I put a 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.800
 a little bit expensive is because here you earn 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.870
 with jones jones I think I win 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.840
 too much and too fast money is 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.570
 say in a day you can win five 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.190
 thousand pesos the seen I have seen that they are 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.890
 earning too much money and that's why 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.740
 I put it is a bit expensive all a hundred percent 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.750
 a wood and so on good 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.340
 but this is the store we are going to buy 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.680
 this ice already last click right 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.320
 left click that says and we bought the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.500
 ice an ice only remains we go 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.470
 to buy is already then if we go back to 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.410

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.730
