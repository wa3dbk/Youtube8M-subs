00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.610 
now this bipod is kind of an interesting
design<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.180> rotates<00:02:27.620> 360<00:02:28.620> degrees

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
design in that it rotates 360 degrees

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.890 
design in that it rotates 360 degrees
good<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.860> kind<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.730> let<00:02:33.330> your<00:02:33.420> fire<00:02:33.630> down

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
good if you kind of let your fire down

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.610 
good if you kind of let your fire down
however<00:02:36.110> it's<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.200> little<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:38.540> little<00:02:39.540> loose<00:02:39.780> for

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
however it's a little a little loose for

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.850 
however it's a little a little loose for
my<00:02:40.709> taste<00:02:41.010> especially<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.870> lakes<00:02:43.110> this<00:02:43.709> is

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
my taste especially the lakes this is

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.800 
my taste especially the lakes this is
not<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.280> quick<00:02:44.640> folding<00:02:45.030> bipod<00:02:45.180> or<00:02:45.480> anything

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
not a quick folding bipod or anything

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.400 
not a quick folding bipod or anything
like<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.890> actually<00:02:46.980> have<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.250> unscrew

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
like that you actually have to unscrew

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.210 
like that you actually have to unscrew
these<00:02:49.410> two<00:02:49.470> little<00:02:50.040> locking<00:02:50.459> bolts<00:02:52.220> allowed

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
these two little locking bolts allowed

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.550 
these two little locking bolts allowed
to<00:02:53.340> pull<00:02:53.580> down<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:54.989> lock<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.260> back<00:02:55.410> in

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
to pull down you can lock it back in

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.759 
to pull down you can lock it back in
this<00:02:55.650> position<00:02:55.890> on<00:02:56.730> both<00:02:56.970> legs<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.709> can

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
this position on both legs and you can

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.150 
this position on both legs and you can
just<00:02:58.980> tighten<00:02:59.130> them<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.880> place<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:01.830> caused

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
just tighten them in place that caused

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.759 
just tighten them in place that caused
