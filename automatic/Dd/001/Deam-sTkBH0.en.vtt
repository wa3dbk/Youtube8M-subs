00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
pulled over for absolutely nothing you

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.490 
pulled over for absolutely nothing you

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
know anymore you ride with the vest and

certain towns and you're just going to
get<00:01:11.939> pulled<00:01:12.119> over<00:01:12.329> and<00:01:12.539> there's<00:01:12.689> nothing<00:01:13.320> else

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
get pulled over and there's nothing else

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.870 
get pulled over and there's nothing else
going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:13.829> a<00:01:13.859> safety<00:01:14.159> check<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.579> your<00:01:14.729> bike

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
going to do a safety check on your bike

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.289 
going to do a safety check on your bike
so<00:01:15.479> yeah<00:01:15.600> there's<00:01:15.810> absolutely<00:01:17.119> same<00:01:18.119> thing

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
so yeah there's absolutely same thing

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.459 
so yeah there's absolutely same thing
goes<00:01:18.329> with<00:01:18.479> old<00:01:18.749> ladies<00:01:18.869> would<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.409> they

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
goes with old ladies would think they

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:20.749 
goes with old ladies would think they
need<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.649> switch<00:01:20.009> lanes<00:01:20.219> just<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.640> you're

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
need to switch lanes just because you're

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.060 
need to switch lanes just because you're
riding<00:01:20.969> fine

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.460 

I<00:01:27.159> think<00:01:28.120> we<00:01:28.270> get<00:01:28.390> stereotyped<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.290> lot

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
I think we get stereotyped a lot

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.920 
I think we get stereotyped a lot
especially<00:01:29.650> because<00:01:30.460> we<00:01:31.090> ride<00:01:31.300> them<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.840> know

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
especially because we ride them you know

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.930 
especially because we ride them you know
big<00:01:32.200> group<00:01:32.380> sometimes<00:01:32.890> most<00:01:33.400> people<00:01:33.760> that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
big group sometimes most people that

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.280 
big group sometimes most people that
have<00:01:34.120> those<00:01:34.240> 30<00:01:34.540> types<00:01:34.750> probably<00:01:35.170> don't

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
have those 30 types probably don't

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.870 
have those 30 types probably don't
really<00:01:35.470> know<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.680> lot<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.920> actual<00:01:36.460> riders<00:01:36.760> and

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
really know a lot of actual riders and

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.340 
really know a lot of actual riders and
probably<00:01:37.150> know<00:01:37.270> from<00:01:37.330> up<00:01:37.600> with<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.170> media

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
probably know from up with the media

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.310 
probably know from up with the media
shoes<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:39.460> usually<00:01:39.820> it's<00:01:40.060> negative<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:40.720> mean<00:01:41.140> I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
shoes and usually it's negative I mean I

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.870 
shoes and usually it's negative I mean I
think<00:01:41.470> they<00:01:41.710> did<00:01:41.860> an<00:01:41.979> actual<00:01:42.340> movie<00:01:42.670> about

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
think they did an actual movie about

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.790 
think they did an actual movie about
bikers<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.930> probably<00:01:44.290> wouldn't<00:01:44.440> appeal<00:01:44.650> to

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
bikers it probably wouldn't appeal to

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.469 
bikers it probably wouldn't appeal to
the<00:01:44.890> masses<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.790> rate<00:01:45.970> would<00:01:46.210> be<00:01:46.270> low

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
the masses so the rate would be low

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.990 
the masses so the rate would be low
because<00:01:47.050> it's<00:01:47.380> like<00:01:47.500> all<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:48.400> riders<00:01:48.670> don't

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
because it's like all the riders don't

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
because it's like all the riders don't
you<00:01:49.150> know<00:01:49.240> like<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.509> say<00:01:49.630> don't<00:01:49.810> go<00:01:49.840> around

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
you know like you say don't go around

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.350 
you know like you say don't go around
you<00:01:50.380> know<00:01:50.580> stabbing<00:01:51.580> people<00:01:51.850> Robbie<00:01:52.060> board

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
you know stabbing people Robbie board

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.210 
you know stabbing people Robbie board
you<00:01:52.509> jumped<00:01:52.869> into<00:01:53.020> clubs<00:01:53.410> like<00:01:53.590> Mike<00:01:53.920> gangs

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
you jumped into clubs like Mike gangs

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.280 
you jumped into clubs like Mike gangs
it's<00:01:55.150> mostly<00:01:55.390> like<00:01:55.479> that<00:01:55.720> something<00:01:56.020> they're

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
it's mostly like that something they're

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.430 
it's mostly like that something they're
more<00:01:56.500> plan<00:01:56.770> for<00:01:57.160> cause<00:01:58.090> drama<00:01:58.330> where<00:01:58.990> sales

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
more plan for cause drama where sales

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.430 
more plan for cause drama where sales
