 ruslana than you can call all the results 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.690
 for developed bucks on the Dnieper arena for 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.469
 Dnieper 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.090
 for the soul, positive of course, not at all 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:22.020
 positive and so everything stretched out if 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.630
 take in general then 20 years 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.290
 I wanted to collect and unpleasant ridge 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.550
 much of course victory nonsense trudge 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.710
 you pause the car 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.250
 at two months israel that played on 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.410
 dnepr bark one hundred percent so 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.030

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.820
 playing in another half of the Crimea you 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.879
 so metallic can you see all you beat 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.920
 his tadic two months ago 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:55.500
 now talk about it already think not 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.960
 it's worth just talking there 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.300
 there is no way to put out the light and decide it 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.640
 general nonsense we shoot all right 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.380
 said we have a mood and when it 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.610
 they interrupt the breaks and they say 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:16.410
 stretch incomprehensible well very hard and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:22.259
 the more such a schedule that's all not 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.970
 I'm using you hard moral episode 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.670
 of you are the teachings of your head coach 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.500
 there and wamdi table with try the passage 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.670
 such an episode in the bay because there 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.070
 Apu was issued money for what there 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.240
 but this one is just on you in other words 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.549
 can't say 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.369
 I think Iâ€™m sure if from our country 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.430
 such was we had kicked out there they changed 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.280
 keys i come he is a senior man 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.159
 the coach he fits there pushing what 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.090
 like keloid i don't remember 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.850
 suzanne and 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.649
 I just asked him there with my hands 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.740
 that is, he pushed me in the face in every 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.079
 case of disrespect okay there stones 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.259
 if the coach is older man and day and not 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.690
 they see nothing holy before them 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.120
 No, they just will not have the most 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.040
 so we were all allowed to us 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.650
 were like flying butterflies 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.650
 can his dnepr in the walls jumped him 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.390
 the axis of the 45s repels islands widow still 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.250
 tell him god and tar pores rub 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.230
 grab on to understand that you rain 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.209
 it makes no sense and now say no 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.760
 accepted the result that is wanted 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.930
 come out positive on that mood 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.060
 that's natural 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:45.160
 let's say it happens we all need it all 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.129
 take a punch we don't give up all 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.470
 you can move it to the side sc result 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:55.470
 man from captivity are you on the team and on the group 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.990
 rails on us are three teams of nations will go but 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.720
 good naturally from this nothing 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.150
 impossible passed last two matches not 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.620
 how do we say so cold showers are easy 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.760
 To name not so pleasant results 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.220
 need to find a silhouette yourself 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.319
 it is impossible to finish at all carelessly 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.579
 not go there in any case for us 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.400
 important match important even in terms of there 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.049
 standings in terms of 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.420
 psychology to us to be finished on 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.860
 major note exactly 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.860
