00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.680
 we want to show you a practical trick 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.020
 to take advantage of for example a 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.090
 old sheet that you have in house pillar 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:14.280
 frame and embodies galindo our 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.280
 expert dressmakers take care of everything 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.530
 Well, get to work to start what 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.520
 we need is a sheet of measures 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.350
 approximate 240 x 150 centimeters one 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.990
 lace 10 centimeters wide 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.170
 made with bobbins with crochet or 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.270
 well industrial a ribbon pin and the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.280
 tape or vein of 2 centimeters that 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.610
 we will use to tie the petticoat to the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:46.309
 waist the sewing machine white thread 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.670
 and thread for basting meter scissors ruler 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.850
 and pencils to mark or soap 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.850
 needles and pins the estimated time of 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.129
 processing is 12 hours we 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.190
 we will summarize but attentive to each 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.350
 one of the steps 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.360
 you can choose the sheet you want 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.440
 as long as you have approximately 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.880
 measures 240 long by 150 wide 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.240
 like this one that is already extending in 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.240
 meat 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.890
 we choose this because it has embroidery and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.740
 final we will be much prettier 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.650
 this is very important from one extreme 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.890
 we measure 50 centimeters with the meter and 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.470
 we mark with the jaboncillo a point 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.780
 we will repeat the action for the end unite 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.260
 all with the rule 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.040
 finally we cut that rectangle more 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.230
 perfect has left us 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.450
 right away we explain what the 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.440
 we fold the rest of the sheet and 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.440
 we cut in half 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.770
 we unite the two pieces with seam 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.500
 French or blind that is to say we sew by 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.090
 one face and then the other is 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.299
 important to invite first to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.979
 facilitate the voilà sewing here we have 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.979
 the flight of our petticoat 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.480
 attentive now we have to add the 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.940
 lace is time to decorate the part 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.880
 bottom of our petticoat after 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.630
 baste the the sew with the machine and 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.520
 look at the end we remove the basting as 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.270
 keep decorating it 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.890
 we count in the next step the lorzas 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.200
 They will help us to give great volume 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.600
 and shrink to length the length of the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.780
 piece if we want shorter the petticoat 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.380
 It will be enough to make the largest number of 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.900
 orzán 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.120
 the first will be 18 centimeters 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.700
 from the lace 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.310
 with a little pinch we take 3 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.610
 centimeters of fabric and we hold it with 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.620
 pins 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.950
 we sew because we already have it all 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.780
 won very well up to six folds 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.560
 we wanted to do it this time 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.870
 to our petticoat 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.840
 now we do a pucker at the end 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.690
 without lace and these are the two parts 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.980
 that they have to get together is the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.480
 first time we see the look 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.000
 full of the petticoat 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.129
 by the way here will go a hem of 3 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.920
 centimeters wide to enter the 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:23.490
 tape you will need a pin like this 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.260
 so you can adjust it in water to the waist 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.500
 with scissors we have made a 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.090
 opening to the piece you see it here and 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.630
 we have cleaned it with a small 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.630
 hem 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.010
 you want to make a petticoat to some 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.200
 family you have an old sheet that does not 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.510
 use then look how well you have 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.510
 stayed and how pretty the lace 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.519
 no no no
