00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
but I had a bit of a problem with it in

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.439 
but I had a bit of a problem with it in
the<00:00:12.590> text<00:00:13.220> message<00:00:14.440> setup<00:00:15.440> development<00:00:16.189> and<00:00:16.850> I

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
the text message setup development and I

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.630 
the text message setup development and I
thought<00:00:17.689> I<00:00:17.900> would<00:00:18.080> just<00:00:18.289> share<00:00:18.740> with<00:00:19.039> you<00:00:19.310> and

thought I would just share with you and

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.269 
thought I would just share with you and
a<00:00:20.089> solution<00:00:20.869> to<00:00:21.019> the<00:00:21.109> problem<00:00:21.560> that<00:00:22.130> I<00:00:22.189> think

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
a solution to the problem that I think

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.279 
a solution to the problem that I think
most<00:00:22.789> people<00:00:23.060> are<00:00:23.359> going<00:00:23.419> to<00:00:23.539> come<00:00:23.720> or<00:00:23.869> lots<00:00:24.140> of

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
most people are going to come or lots of

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.729 
most people are going to come or lots of
people<00:00:24.650> are<00:00:24.740> gonna<00:00:24.829> come<00:00:25.070> across<00:00:25.249> and<00:00:26.230> and<00:00:27.230> I

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:27.739 
people are gonna come across and and I

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.309 
people are gonna come across and and I
typed<00:00:28.249> into<00:00:28.460> Google<00:00:28.909> to<00:00:29.599> try<00:00:29.749> and<00:00:29.960> solve<00:00:30.140> the

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:30.319 
typed into Google to try and solve the

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.860 
typed into Google to try and solve the
problem<00:00:30.999> and<00:00:31.999> there<00:00:32.180> wasn't<00:00:32.450> anything<00:00:32.660> up

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
problem and there wasn't anything up

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.930 
problem and there wasn't anything up
there<00:00:33.050> about<00:00:33.289> it<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:33.770> I<00:00:33.980> thought<00:00:34.280> having

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
there about it so I thought having

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.580 
there about it so I thought having
struggled<00:00:35.449> and<00:00:35.570> found<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:35.960> arts<00:00:36.260> and<00:00:36.440> myself

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
struggled and found the arts and myself

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.520 
struggled and found the arts and myself
I<00:00:37.039> thought<00:00:37.219> I<00:00:37.280> would<00:00:37.670> do<00:00:37.989> so<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.019> would<00:00:39.140> share<00:00:39.469> it

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
I thought I would do so I would share it

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.689 
I thought I would do so I would share it
with<00:00:39.859> you<00:00:40.039> and<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:41.000> problem<00:00:41.480> is<00:00:41.980> what<00:00:42.980> I<00:00:43.039> found

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
text messages which is what we're on

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.050 
text messages which is what we're on
about<00:01:34.159> here<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.710> then<00:01:36.759> downloads<00:01:37.759> and

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
about here and then downloads and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.539 
about here and then downloads and
basically<00:01:38.570> about<00:01:39.259> sync<00:01:39.649> what<00:01:39.920> it<00:01:40.009> does<00:01:40.189> is<00:01:40.399> it

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
basically about sync what it does is it

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.399 
basically about sync what it does is it
takes<00:01:40.850> all<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.270> stuff<00:01:41.479> off<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.659> iTunes<00:01:42.020> and

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
takes all the stuff off of iTunes and

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.200 
takes all the stuff off of iTunes and
just<00:01:42.530> downloads<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.189> on<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.520> your<00:01:43.670> senses<00:01:44.090> and

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
just downloads it on to your senses and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.499 
just downloads it on to your senses and
history<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.119> did<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.950> all<00:01:49.100> worked

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
history so I did that and it all worked

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.639 
history so I did that and it all worked
reasonably<00:01:50.509> well<00:01:50.600> like<00:01:50.899> I<00:01:51.020> say<00:01:51.200> didn't<00:01:51.500> seem

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
reasonably well like I say didn't seem

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.170 
reasonably well like I say didn't seem
to<00:01:51.740> take<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.950> calendar<00:01:52.340> stuff<00:01:52.670> with<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:53.030> but

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
to take the calendar stuff with it but

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.499 
to take the calendar stuff with it but
there<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:53.420> go<00:01:53.450> that's<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.930> different<00:01:54.770> story

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
there you go that's a different story

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.819 
there you go that's a different story
and<00:01:56.320> then<00:01:57.039> I<00:01:57.219> was<00:01:58.090> trying<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.990> do<00:01:59.680> everything

and then I was trying to do everything
there<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.399> know<00:02:00.549> try<00:02:00.909> everything<00:02:01.180> out<00:02:01.390> on<00:02:01.570> the

freezes up that I think is why it
freezes<00:04:47.130> up<00:04:47.310> now<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:48.120> question<00:04:48.510> is<00:04:48.600> how<00:04:48.780> do

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
freezes up now the question is how do

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.830 
freezes up now the question is how do
you<00:04:49.050> cure<00:04:49.350> it<00:04:49.530> well<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:50.729> way<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:50.910> cured<00:04:51.479> it<00:04:51.660> and

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
you cure it well the way I cured it and

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.140 
you cure it well the way I cured it and
the<00:04:51.960> way<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.440> only<00:04:52.590> simple<00:04:53.250> way<00:04:53.430> I<00:04:53.460> can<00:04:53.820> see<00:04:54.030> if

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
the way the only simple way I can see if

the way the only simple way I can see if
curing<00:04:54.479> it<00:04:54.570> is<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.840> obviously<00:04:55.130> delete<00:04:56.130> your

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400

import them from your old phone if you

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.400 
import them from your old phone if you
don't<00:05:07.200> think<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:08.280> need<00:05:08.310> them<00:05:08.789> or

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
alternatively if you do import them you

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.370 
alternatively if you do import them you
are<00:05:12.030> going<00:05:12.210> to<00:05:12.300> have<00:05:12.479> to<00:05:12.630> delete<00:05:12.960> them<00:05:13.229> and

are going to have to delete them and

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.140 
are going to have to delete them and
once<00:05:14.190> I<00:05:14.400> deleted<00:05:14.820> them<00:05:15.060> all<00:05:15.210> then<00:05:16.640> it<00:05:17.640> seems<00:05:18.000> to

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
once I deleted them all then it seems to

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.390 
once I deleted them all then it seems to
be<00:05:18.240> working<00:05:18.390> absolutely<00:05:19.289> fine<00:05:19.530> so<00:05:19.560> that's

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
be working absolutely fine so that's

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.040 
be working absolutely fine so that's
what<00:05:20.700> you<00:05:20.820> have<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.030> do<00:05:21.300> now<00:05:21.510> as<00:05:21.750> far<00:05:21.990> as

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
what you have to do now as far as

what you have to do now as far as
deleting<00:05:22.650> them<00:05:22.770> is<00:05:22.889> concerned<00:05:23.720> that<00:05:24.720> is<00:05:24.930> not

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
deleting them is concerned that is not

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.529 
deleting them is concerned that is not
the<00:05:25.289> easiest<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.950> jobs<00:05:26.010> either<00:05:26.539> unfortunately
