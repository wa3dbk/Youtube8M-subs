00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.490
 The most curious things then you support 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.800
 this kind of block here in the channel already 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.750
 I left it liked down here and let's go 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.539
 roll up and let's start this picture 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.539
 but then spin the vignette and let's go 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.009
 as this one is the first video of this 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.660
 series 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.520
 nothing better than show the first 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.770
 Privacy Policy 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.890
 Do you know the first easter egg? 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.030
 of the story then it was an advent game and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.250
 in the 2600 atari there at the time of the snores o 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.649
 easter egg was basically the name of the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.930
 creator of the game because I do not know if 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.989
 You know at that time games did not 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.329
 they had no crap credits 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.149
 some then the creator of the game was 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:07.680
 smart and put his name there to 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:09.930
 to perpetuate lara croft is lara croft is 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.479
 one of the hottest characters more 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.570
 important of the games I remember that I 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.540
 had a cdb with the demo of the first game 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.729
 she played on playstation five minutes 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.670
 and there were no more of those 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.049
 breasts that she has in fact would be well 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.360
 minors 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.119
 lara croft breasts became large 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.729
 by an accident there in the production of the game 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.829
 the breeders liked it and only 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.220
 big because of a same mistake and looks 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.270
 there are also a good mistakes I think not 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.670
 in the game animal crossing crosse in game 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.229
 animal crossing of the gamecube console 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.530
 a match may last up to 30 years 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.259
 It's like you can stay playing for 30 years. 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.020
 right in the same game this game is as if 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.210
 be a simulator of life where you are 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.850
 a citizen who has to adapt to life 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.090
 in the field even now imagine you playing 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.110
 a 30-year match made by 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.060
 phases 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.370
 everyone says that Mario breaks the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.410
 Brick blocks with the head is not 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.350
 same 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.080
 no it's not really bad break 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.660
 all the bricks with the hand if you 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.560
 pay attention when he jumps him 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.000
 Put your hand up so if you 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.820
 just as I thought that Mario 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.790
 broke the bricks are the heads missed 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.910
 ugly in 99 put the game cd 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.800
 starcraft and a space shuttle 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.210
 all this to send the game literally 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.390
 to space 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:50.030
 if you play the game, you 're flying there in the middle of the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.940
 nothing until today in the game america mec 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.420
 Bed I did not know how to say that to the gun. 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.930
 The most powerful a nail clipper is 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.180
 even a nail clipper could 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.240
 be a missile launcher or a nuclear bomb 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.330
 to car 4 but the strongest weapon is a 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:12.110
 pilot nail clipper if you go 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.570
 now google and type abel hol a 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.290
 page will start rolling satanic 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.720
 mind 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.840
 this is a reference to the game star fox 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.500
 of nintendo 64 which is like a 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.530
 dodged you into the game because 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:40.070
 star fox is a ship game and such a you 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:42.140
 played on the playstation 2 was the 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.400
 console that many people have played 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.920
 including me 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.920
 but I always wondered why the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.860
 console is so big it looks like a brick 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.530
 this thing then has an explanation 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.370
 of the playstation 2 was inspired by the 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.980
 old computer the hawk 10 30 micro 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.440
 That box of micro has nothing this 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.810
 computer was atari and if you 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.920
 look is very similar even with the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.800
 playstation 2 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.340
 now you know why ps2 is called 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.290
 so if you like this 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.200

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.870

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.690
 I do not know the new frame here on the channel is 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.810
 Let me like it, beauty. It would be too cool. 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.340

 that arrives in 10 thousand likes will be 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.780

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.790
 I liked it here so I'll know if I 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.940
 Can I make more videos of this board? 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.560
