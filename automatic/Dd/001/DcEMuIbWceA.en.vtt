 beach house for when you achieve 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.669

 that you achieve the desired comfort in your home 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.300
 of the beach you have to always keep 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.009
 present that the raw nature does not 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.960
 you have to compete with her so 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.390
 follow the advice that mónica sebastián 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.140
 and will notice how she will play 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.140
 let's see it 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.680
 we are today in the spa of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.300
 We are going to know one of the houses 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.190
 of a great friend of stone builds 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.260
 mónica sebastián and he has opened the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 doors to know how it is that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.730
 He has decorated his whole house trying to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.280
 always maintain the prevalence of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.110
 sea and nature above the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.110
 statement itself let's meet her 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.710
 unique like this thank you very much for 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.940
 receive us 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.060
 in which part of the tail is 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.110
 located your house we are on the north side 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.110
 of the emerald of colán 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.060
 only as you undertook this design well 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.259
 I tell you woman the simplest way was 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.600
 try not to compete with what 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.340
 it really is beautiful to look at 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.539
 first place exactly I thought that what 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.899
 The best thing I could do was to try 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.470
 integrate it and the effort you see so many 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.119
 small windows is big up 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.009
 clear the whole house works like a big 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.420
 frame for the outside part that 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.149
 it really is what comes to us 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.759
 the view exactly as a competitor with 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.890
 this framework does not compete with the nuncio 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.549
 can not be done really can be 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.119
 live as comfortable as possible by integrating 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.119
 nature 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.820
 the choice of colors you've had 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.380
 I see that you have nuanced a lot with the 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.080
 outer part are warm colors 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.590
 earth always with certain ornaments 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.600
 typical of your style and ethnicity of 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.300
 choice for the cushions as you will see 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.760
 always animal prints and I like them 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.390
 a lot of him that I feel that binds me 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.390
 exact 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.490
 only what I like about your statement 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.140
 is that you do not start like a canvas in 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.120
 white begins to bring all those 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.490
 elements that remind you of something else 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.000
 You need you liked these chairs 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.000
 things 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.659
 the ornaments that I choose should always 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.980
 mean a lot to me and in this case 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.799
 this little pig guide is a bit of 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.530
 colorful is the memory of a great 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.870
 my friend and for me it is a way of 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.629
 say that you are presenting now you have 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.250
 a room with a huge space because 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.019
 has double height then that gives you 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.629
 an incredible sense of space 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.500
 besides the light as the glad well 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.269
 how will you see 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.799
 Actually the space is small but 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.540
 the double height gives it a greater 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.540
 perspective greater connectivity 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.099
 exactly and it's a feeling that given 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.620
 which is much bigger and yourself 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.290
 you chose the design of the stairs to 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.599
 air like that is I'm on railing 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.280
 initially then they do not cut you the 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.049
 space because if we had the typical 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.150
 staircase that comes with cement by 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.859
 underneath it would already take away the space that 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.319
 is earned here until you can have a 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.409
 couple of ornaments and ready this is a way 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.930
 enough practice to gain space 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.069
 what we suddenly have this box 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.230
 Tell me 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.270
 that's the picture I like a lot is 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.580
 of vítolo nor that 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.830
 and I do not like it very much because it evokes the sea 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.720
 then you have here several qualities 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.520
 that they are giving to your house 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.470
 only the feeling of space of 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.690
 freedom because it is right in front of the sea 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.540
 you have the use of glass mirrors 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.070
 transparencies that do not give weight to the 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.930
 situation then you have a view 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.090
 fluid I love it like the farmers 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.330
 rather look at this as a microclimate 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.850
 for the screens you're going to give 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.850
 mind now that we move to the terrace 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.810
 tell me about the extension that 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.810
 terraces I love 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.190
 as we said when we received 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.470
 we would have made an appointment with a couple of 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.460
 beds a good day we decided to do this 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.370
 Print 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.930
 but they will change from behind and what 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.699
 let's defend in the shadow part 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.110
 with icor happened what has the wood and 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.630
 it's not even so polished you have more 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:58.840
 rustic and styles if the part of this the 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:05:02.240
 direct regarding dates in the 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.400
 accounts we have five rooms 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.650
 in the kitchen where it's simple and 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.900
 reduced integrated with the dining room the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.360
 Scald where you have a house here 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.789
 that has not had so much effort apart 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.099
 yours not pointers and get your repeated 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.050
 this space for the summer in which 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.270
 you have a great breadth thanks to the 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.400
 light that he has been able to give and that just 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.590
 the winters can I recommend you 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.280
 to the people who 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:31.660
 created in your beach house do not try 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.830
 be prepared to nature 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:38.530
 respect not because the same great strength 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.210
 they have is uncontrollable I do not know if in 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.370
 some moment of the framework that should advance 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.590
 equal the posts 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.040
 but not that it was put in very many 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.540
 what really gunsmith carlos good 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.130
 Monica, thank you very much again for

 Home decoration show the 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.310
