00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:09.939 
early game it's really bad you have him

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:12.290 
early game it's really bad you have him
later<00:07:10.209> in<00:07:10.360> the<00:07:10.449> game<00:07:10.539> is<00:07:10.719> really<00:07:10.899> good<00:07:11.139> and

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
later in the game is really good and

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.059 
later in the game is really good and
people<00:07:13.300> tell<00:07:13.509> me<00:07:13.539> to<00:07:13.749> run<00:07:13.869> two<00:07:14.259> of<00:07:14.469> him<00:07:14.679> and<00:07:14.919> two

people tell me to run two of him and two

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:19.889 
people tell me to run two of him and two
of<00:07:15.219> him<00:07:15.429> I<00:07:15.699> don't<00:07:16.360> like<00:07:16.569> that<00:07:17.099> idea<00:07:18.099> cuz<00:07:18.899> the

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:19.899 
of him I don't like that idea cuz the

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:22.139 
of him I don't like that idea cuz the
chances<00:07:20.319> getting<00:07:20.529> really<00:07:20.800> slim<00:07:21.129> if<00:07:21.399> you<00:07:21.939> have

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:22.149 
chances getting really slim if you have

00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:23.549 
chances getting really slim if you have
two<00:07:22.360> of<00:07:22.479> him<00:07:22.629> cuz<00:07:22.809> the<00:07:22.959> more<00:07:23.139> chances<00:07:23.499> you

00:07:23.549 --> 00:07:23.559 
two of him cuz the more chances you

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:25.529 
two of him cuz the more chances you
might<00:07:23.829> give<00:07:24.369> me<00:07:24.399> getting<00:07:24.669> him<00:07:24.879> more<00:07:25.119> than<00:07:25.329> him

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:25.539 
might give me getting him more than him

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:29.369 
might give me getting him more than him
