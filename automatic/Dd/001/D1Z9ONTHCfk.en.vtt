00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
on the walls in the studio it's the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.139 
on the walls in the studio it's the
coolest<00:00:34.840> thing<00:00:35.140> but<00:00:35.710> it's<00:00:35.829> a<00:00:35.980> really<00:00:36.520> great

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
coolest thing but it's a really great

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.000 
coolest thing but it's a really great
start<00:00:37.480> to<00:00:37.809> be<00:00:37.929> completely<00:00:38.319> honest<00:00:38.739> but<00:00:38.859> you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
start to be completely honest but you

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.680 
start to be completely honest but you
know<00:00:39.129> I<00:00:39.159> think<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.519> process<00:00:39.909> of<00:00:39.999> an<00:00:40.149> album<00:00:40.480> you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
know I think the process of an album you

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.209 
know I think the process of an album you
start<00:00:41.019> somewhere<00:00:41.289> it<00:00:41.559> goes<00:00:41.589> somewhere<00:00:42.039> else

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
start somewhere it goes somewhere else

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.759 
start somewhere it goes somewhere else
and<00:00:42.760> I<00:00:42.940> think<00:00:43.420> it<00:00:43.510> takes<00:00:43.629> all<00:00:43.929> these<00:00:44.170> different

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
and I think it takes all these different

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.340 
and I think it takes all these different
turns<00:00:45.429> and<00:00:45.850> it<00:00:46.030> turns<00:00:46.269> into<00:00:46.449> your<00:00:46.899> great<00:00:47.109> body

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
turns and it turns into your great body

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.040 
turns and it turns into your great body
of<00:00:47.589> work
