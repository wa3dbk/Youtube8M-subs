00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.419
 at the time two Chinese decided to stare mandates in testing and wished 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.519
 and that is actually the Western economies, as we have seen 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.919
 and I think they are people now 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.990
 and rich math with the idea of â€‹â€‹machine can sustain those greenhouses 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.869
 all of thailand that they are in a lock up for peace that is not in 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.870
 state innovation i think those people are one more 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.919
 the debate that he does not state that those people state they are 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.089
 neither 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.280
 here a disadvantaged position learns to be integrated into the world economy 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.690
 and actually in the west we started from them as something like the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.089
 market would be interested in the economy 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.300
 in china that's that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.350
 yes they would silently integrate them into the same way 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.690
 world economy 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.630
 and the image appears to be the case 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.430
 and that fascinates you actually see that there is less and the world economy 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.270
 especially the western economies are financial crisis going on that is 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.270
 caused to a very large extent 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.090
 in china that has come on a further fall on the market that suddenly become a big one 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.720
 has become a player 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.530
 and everything you see that does and that just puts the twentieth worldwide 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.290
 For example, it would be an example of the Chinese six pairs whole 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.950
 much then it is complained very hard about having to consume 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.250
 but the result of Chinese saving behavior 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.190
 and what that influences global saving behavior 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.200
 It really is that interest rates have become much worse 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.540
 and you see that that is in the west actually in that the past ten years 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.920
 and economic growth in particular has taken place in sectors that are struggling with 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.700
 schools are funded 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.180
 and because the interest rate was very low, it did meanwhile cover the costs of venture capital 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.170
 only more increase that have risen since 2000 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.749
 and you see that Western beats society as well as Western economies 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:14.900
 m the perpetrator the banking sector the entire financial sector has become very large 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.979
 has actually become too large 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.640
 and you get real sire people have benefited a lot 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.110
 You see how much he is traveling home are often financed with a debt 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.089
 seen many houses through the strikes and the western economies 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.039
 and they had no harmful effects 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:36.609
 and even though it is not China's intention to have such effects 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.669
 As a small economies, Singapore has suffered a lot 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.529
 even uses the trade balance or something in the order of 20 in a row 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.329
 percent you find that peak but if it comes to the economy with a time of 3 2 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.379
 billiards 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.429
 residents of sinti decide to do that 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:56.049
 then talk disrupts that really share the other economy 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:00.979
 their own passes to the world bank two weeks ago and they are expected to 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:05.049
 that in the next thirty years will be with 20 percent of the Chinese population 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.629
 therefore produce criminal demands for the countryside to the city 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.959
 that's about 200 million people even a little bit more 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.329
 it's not that easy to say what names 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.899
 is the fundamental value of a home 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:22.130
 If you don't know how big the demand for homes will be look up 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.919
 houses that are now being built resumed for speculation or that are now empty 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.429
 It may well be that he believes there will be residents in five years 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.989
 in western economies like house prices, it does rise very quickly 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.339
 the birth rate is declining tells me that the population is shrinking 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.069
 and that is actually weird but what it not voted by the foundations 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.969
 So we have already promised that I do or have the same problems in China 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.890
 are I see people who work for warn 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.259
 very prominent economists can only come but me 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.739
 You are, after all, a little inclined to the moment they believe 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:58.589
 differences 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:02.629
 He wants to look up if you now build railway lines that aren't here right now 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:03.829
 need it right away 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.299
 If you move 200 million people to the city from the countryside then you have 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.439
 need a lot of transportation 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.339
 because we organize 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:15.920
 if you know a city known for their 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.459
 traffic jams but yes with a little girl if you go 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.450
 have transported Alkmaar Cossack boys system 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.180
 excellent that a lot of people are busy with a lot 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.139
 high up 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.190
 and lines and high speed lines they are busy with in lemiers in the netherlands 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.650
 to be 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.110
 That was a sexual offense in Almere 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.199
 and he can certainly come back if there is a double dip in the economy 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.909
 the first chinese economy 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.229
 is still too much dependent on export 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:47.499
 but you will see 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:51.289
 as soon as a fight with slightly more domestic demand comes that stimulates 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.009
 wdp there grow in china what a lot of products 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.400
 and we may ask the chinese about nam fc lisse zn from your pot software 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.570
 note school call upside down 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.009
 they also provide employment in China 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.129
 and that feeds a fair income and if people use it more 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.330
 know the economic growth in China 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.720
 Moreover, the third place in labor costs is whether or not 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.990
 will come soon 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.219
 and economists differ about this 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:22.720
 and my appraisal is that there is still enough a reservoir of labor 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.530
 for Chinese mines out with or without and the labor costs land in 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.569
 that sentence will not increase very quickly 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.330
 I am afraid that his China will remain a very long and very formidable opponent 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.460
 for the western world 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.030
 and that we should not count rich that are the same traps they were on wall 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.840
 street be the case
