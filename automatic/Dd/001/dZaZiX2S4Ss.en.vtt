00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
with it with my dad so nothing really

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
new there's what it looks like I'll show

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.270 
new there's what it looks like I'll show
you<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:07.670> pocket<00:01:10.330> so<00:01:11.330> not<00:01:11.600> really<00:01:11.980> good<00:01:12.980> pocket

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
you the pocket so not really good pocket

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.660 
you the pocket so not really good pocket
yet<00:01:13.640> but<00:01:14.800> about<00:01:15.800> 95%<00:01:16.690> of<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:18.220> time<00:01:19.220> I'm

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
yet but about 95% of the time I'm

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.790 
yet but about 95% of the time I'm
catching<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:21.770> baseball<00:01:22.550> which<00:01:23.420> is<00:01:23.690> very<00:01:24.530> good

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
catching the baseball which is very good

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.610 
catching the baseball which is very good
because<00:01:25.160> this<00:01:25.610> glove<00:01:25.970> was<00:01:26.510> extremely<00:01:27.290> stiff

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
because this glove was extremely stiff

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.130 
because this glove was extremely stiff
when<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:27.890> got<00:01:28.160> it<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:29.120> still<00:01:29.660> not<00:01:29.840> even<00:01:29.990> close

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
when I got it it's still not even close

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.580 
when I got it it's still not even close
to<00:01:30.440> be<00:01:30.560> broken<00:01:30.860> in<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:31.810> like<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:32.960> said<00:01:33.020> about

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
to be broken in and like I said about

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.680 
to be broken in and like I said about
95%<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.610> time<00:01:34.820> I'm<00:01:35.000> catching<00:01:35.450> the

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
95% of the time I'm catching the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.200 
95% of the time I'm catching the
baseballs<00:01:36.260> and<00:01:36.560> about<00:01:37.160> 5%<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.000> time

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
baseballs and about 5% of the time

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.690 
baseballs and about 5% of the time
they're<00:01:38.420> just<00:01:38.830> falling<00:01:39.830> down<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.280> pocket

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
they're just falling down the pocket

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.160 
they're just falling down the pocket
popping<00:01:41.210> out<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:43.480> I'm<00:01:44.480> pretty<00:01:44.720> happy<00:01:44.960> with

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
popping out and I'm pretty happy with

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.050 
popping out and I'm pretty happy with
that

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060
