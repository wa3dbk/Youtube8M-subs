00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.350
 hello everyone how about in this video about talking about carbohydrates 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.309
 Carbon or carbohydrate foods are composed of carbohydrates 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.850
 proteins and fats wolf also have vitamins and minerals that we say a 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.510
 part and then there's the fiber but the three big components are the 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.579
 carbohydrates proteins and fats 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.140
 to know the carbon needs 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.600
 carbohydrates that was divided into two large hydrate groups of 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.310
 simple carbon complex carbohydrates what is the difference 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.800
 amizian complexes slow charging 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.399
 here the fast action simplicities because you are because when the 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.870
 we eat the cassation and slowly it will cost more time to decompose 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.980
 the ones in getting club thing 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.000
 what is it that the body needs to function the nervous system the brain 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.920
 you need just pass 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.310
 between the carbohydrate and west traineras fast action 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.190
 the very fast behind and occurs in what is called with a glucose peak and 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.500
 slow social complaint takes him out much more slowly was getting little things to 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.290
 little in a constant way 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.270
 this look at it euro by military the glycemic index glycemic index 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.910
 but in this idea is 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.860
 theory that does not learn has to know to whom but good I explain it 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.450
 for 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.490
 Real estate companies 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.649
 well, all the elements have a glycemic index the higher it is 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.540
 means the fastest body can have the sanitation glucose and 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.600
 that's worse for health 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.499
 what are the complex carbohydrates of rooms 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.499
 they challenge them slow they are 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.380
 the good dates 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.640
 good past 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.640
 the general general legumes 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 at the headquarters of one of the fruits 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.190
 and what are the carbon expenses simple that criminal sentencing sensation 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.460
 the n-ii the sugar gendarmerie 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.779
 the refining females 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:15.689
 these two pairs of food when marginalized French sterling have 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.199
 suffered more manipulation 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.730
 ellis will go back simpler the more your glycemic index will grow and 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:25.729
 then the body will take less to decompose 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:31.509
 our diet should be based on carbohydrates are the base of the pyramid 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:36.689
 food but we have to consume especially the healthy consume 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.049
 turn carbon complexes is to say whole grain whole grain breads 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.150
 vegetables vegetables 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.299
 fruits 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.760
 it's not that whole grain whole grain breads 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.379
 I gained 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.810
 - what the refined white befesa really the calories are the same 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.960
 but what they are is much more nutritious park because for example grain dt 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:02.939
 Diego 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.749
 if these bonuses when trying armenteros 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.869
 the pure this form to the wheat claw 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.539
 second part indirectly 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.699
 we all want to win but we have 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.779
 the germ of wheat and we have the savior we have everything then yes many 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:20.800
 nutrients 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.109
 instead the refined flours to go through one 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.739
 where professors the entity has managed to sell wheat the Salvadoran capital 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.639
 removed the wheat germ santiago which can be followed 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.409
 and with those three crowns in how many years I had three floors and refined 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.689
 that they do not contribute anything 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.950
 practically good and if it separates us previously the criminal bands and so 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.809
 healthy as integral rooms you have to have enough eye also with this 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:52.299
 theme of the integrals because sometimes you can go buy a whole grain bread and os 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.930
 you will find it is done d guess white refined apple has taken about 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.229
 goya on the other hand the savior 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:04.570
 in this standard sense aguinaga said and san antonio 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.679
 but farc the wheat germ is missing 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:13.049
 then gasol is really integral is completely whole or they are going to check 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.049
 the records with whole wheat flour 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.329
 those are the ones that are made with directly everything that is what 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:23.860
 according to january 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.289
 well yes 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.880
 min this is a little the concepts that you need to know it is very important that 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.660
 we include in our diet carbohydrates there diets 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.690
 that the astra division marshes for health 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.729
 there are two carbon units 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.129
 what they contribute the most 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.849
 lots of energy 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:50.520
 in particular each gram of carbon fat provides 4 calories provides energy to 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.939
 body 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.999
 and what do we need to function 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.580
 it's the gasoline nba laughs 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.190
 the one of our town 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.240
 it is very important that you consume them less how can we even 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.189
 the carbohydrates in our diet 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.279
 For example for breakfast in the morning we can consume 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.249
 the panther 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:17.639
 we can the eee consume whole grains of cereals these 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.910
 processed refined commonly used colors make this one more 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.339
 real españa maradona with these premises nothing 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:26.759
 they are accordion cereals 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.180
 the reform has to go to the store 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.620
 if the cereals we can find good sensations that they will ask 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.610
 talk and do many comprehensive road ideas 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.430
 Everything will get fixed 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.439
 covers of wheat has broken streams 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:46.099
 and so what they do all all is mixed with terrific makeup 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.189
 then at lunch time you can eat a piece of bread 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:53.680
 whole you can eat legumes potatoes 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.309
 Enough 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:57.050
 / lof de españa 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.219
 monterde cereals of the aunts I'll talk when I talk about cereals 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:05.409
 and then already in the hour until the last hours of the day as we can 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.650
 know what else you can ask the state, such as the rains 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.650
 then of course the mountain town of Tandil 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.900
 well I hope that in villa and it shows open and large carbon 

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:21.770
 they start worrying about putting more whole foods that are much more 

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:27.259
 nutritious and many pairs for our health that today are refining 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:31.169
 everyone giving you would not experience that they are preparing food 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.919
 and I hope that I have served you stores of absence of clear weakness
