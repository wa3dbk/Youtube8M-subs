00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.769
 hello every day we study everything 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.080
 hockey publications in the press and blogs and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.150
 we choose the most interesting in our opinion 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.289
 you are watching continental fiction and with 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.289
 you anastasia fomkina 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.199
 Russian national team final match 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.420
 group stage only a shootout 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.609
 defeated the Slovaks Alexander the horns 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.250
 figured out the reasons so vague 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.649
 games of Russians after sixty five 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.840
 7 ral game minutes on the shootout game 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.129
 with Americans hockey team Russia 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.170
 Expectedly not enough 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.420
 emotions at a meeting with the team of Slovakia 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 wards zinetula Bilyaletdinov should 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.200
 were winning on class considering 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 how much did they surpass the Slovaks in 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.010
 individual mastery by 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 it seemed that datsyuk and q all do 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.000
 right but a nut of excitement is clearly not 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.680
 enough plus impressed 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.050
 dedication Slovaks who 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.480
 blocked the lion's share of our shots 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.309
 guys only once lotsa for real 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.890
 bailed out his team by hooking the edges 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.409
 trap gun shot Malkin start 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.420
 Ovechkin completely lost but Radulov 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.340
 tried to play actively and was one of 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.100
 few players will make up the Russian team 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.049
 who tried to aggravate 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.330
 once again not impressed with action 3 4 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.280
 triples in attack opportunity zantu lebel 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.170
 or dingo would be worth trying to change 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.710
 in some places Valery is nichushkin and Nikolay 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.750
 kulemina 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.180
 looking in the top three tereshchenko would still 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.210
 more reliability and anisimova combination 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.189
 appeared in waste by far the best of 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.829
 Russians in the match against Slovakia was 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.659
 goalkeeper semen varlamov sport.ru counting 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.570
 that the warlama with his game deserved the right 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.799
 called the main goalkeeper the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.659
 that the seed will come out fresh and 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.880
 concentrated it was easy to predict 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.860
 much harder because of slovenia 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.740
 wait for him to never make a mistake 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.210
 and reflect all that will fly into his gate 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.220
 after the third period where work 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.009
 varlamov was not much more than 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.990
 plowing on the bench bobrovsky first 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.090
 once varlamov saved at the end of 2 minutes 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.159
 when severely shipped with a penny 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.500
 and closer to the first break was rescued after 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.390
 powerful wrist cast of the ax of parable 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.060
 total dodge varlam was in the second 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.500
 period defenders criminally fussed on 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.730
 pyatake fires blazing 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.630
 and it became absolutely terrible in 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.180
 minority 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.400
 Varlamov did not panic and dragged everything 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.260
 if inaccuracy semen allowed himself 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.480
 on the twenty-sixth minute when not immediately 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.580
 shared the puck behind the gate with Putin and then 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.350
 then saved and on overtime iv 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.330
 shootout series 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.490
 27 reflected throws of 27 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.050
 barely taken bullets from 2 varlamov 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.600
 definitely does not consider competition with 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.730
 beaver lost his hero 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.080
 the gate was in Slovakia and on Latsa 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.210
 held almost his best match 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.490
 Artem Agapov season 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.080
 appreciated the game goalkeeper 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.480
 Malkin shot shot ovechkin 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.490
 laid pirouettes of lots of all rainbows 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.620
 it was nothing in the second period he even 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.570
 played with the puck behind the gate such 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.820
 caught confidence on tereshchenko attempt 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.920
 punish him for it put his 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.110
 fifth point however and in most 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.240
 Slovak goalkeeper Russians good 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.520
 did not twist only the voltage injected 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.070
 better attacking frame country to end 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.100
 fought and the Slovak defense Ovechkin and 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.840
 Kovalchuk Malkin and Datsyuk Radulov hanging 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.300
 over swallow shay overlooked and over and 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.850
 served aside for an hour 5 minutes clean 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.630
 playing time 3 opponent goalkeeper so 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.630
 and did not miss 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.000
 unable to beat the main time team 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.950
 Slovakia Russian hockey players have provided 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.599
 yourself an extra match voucher to 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.969
 quarter finals and the Russians will play with 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.530
 Norwegians according to our sport.ru 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.430
 encounter with vikings serious problems 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.670
 should not experience 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.439
 and that's why just because the swarm 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.510
 Johanson is trying to play fast 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.129
 active hockey patterns and by the Swedish 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.290
 such hockey implies the presence of 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.849
 a certain level of skill which 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.709
 Norwegians are clearly lacking 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.439
 we beat the lady well, it's more convenient to play 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.120
 number two is almost certainly not a match 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.010
 will be very difficult for the national team 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.599
 Russia and therefore strongly worry because of 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.700
 not reaching the quarter finals where in rather 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.560
 just shine Finn can not be on 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.290
 the good will come in as good such 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.780
 training hockey expert sergey 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.599
 Himaev also believes that Norway Russia 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.299
 no match we played with her 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.129
 the quarter finals of the 2012 World Cup 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.260
 then for a slightly different team 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.509
 Norwegian decent in attack but they have 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.120
 very weak goalkeepers watched their match with 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:21.160
 the Finns haugen launched everything on his spirit 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.050
 was unreliable and so the combat team 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.930
 another question is what masters of high 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.150
 class there is not enough they play 2 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.190
 half the link is our plus can 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.680
 physically surpass the norse to force 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.710
 their wrong you have to play a lot more 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.690
 aggressively than with the Slovaks if the team 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.190
 Russia to cope with Norway and another and 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.770
 can not be the next opponent 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.750
 our team will be Finland igor 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.240
 Erokonko notes accents in the game of the future 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.889
 rival Russian team is a collection of 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.780
 despite losing at least 5 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.360
 most important players were on the verge of winning 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.120
 over canada canada team that just isn't 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.070
 I did, but I confused myself from that very same 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.070
 Finn plays exactly as he plays 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.320
 conditional euro round usual trap 122 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.510
 extreme tight middle zone leg nation 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.580
 ground and manin villagers stew 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.570
 like a three not bad but building isis 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.340
 coped badly 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.500
 in the end, against the request they detached slightly 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.630
 modified three Olya Yakunin 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.409
 instead of karpeko ski came out you see to them 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.720
 coped 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:19.150
 cancellation also scored effort mid and 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.349
 Amur tu that so far this is the best link 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.810
 Finns from whom to wait 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.669
 always trouble karpik narrow 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.010
 moved candy alise altonov 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.900
 and this triple gathering began to light about 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.889
 once you can say bad results 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.990
 match from Canada and 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.240
 you can say good which was even 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.219
 more possible in the quarter finals many 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.259
 you wish precisely the time as though time to 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:41.819
 purely technically reading the game less 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.819
 preferred for the Russian team 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.870
 shortage of personnel that is what the coming years 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.170
 risking to face the national team 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.820
 Vitaly Slavin beats the main thing 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.160
 seemingly great hockey side 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.590
 ceased to grow stars nichushkin 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.210
 Tarasenko then Kovalchuk Ovechkin Malkina 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.370
 Vayu year looked much brighter 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.500
 if you take the defenders at all guard 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.540
 most of us have all hope of the same age 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.880
 and yes bitch Markov who dragged the team 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.310
 still at the Moscow World Cup 2007 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.100
 years not by chance in all seriousness 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.050
 argued they were invited to Sochi 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.120
 39-year-old potter and what I do not see who 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.310
 from Russians is able to play Sergei better 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.590
 on the blue line and this is the worst 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.130
 dead end dead end for development in our 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.230
 traditions 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.000
 because the team and is forced to play from 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.620
 defense even with Slovaks it 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.960
 the only way to achieve results 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.760
 these are the realities of our cool hockey 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.760
 there are not enough players even for two fives 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.350
 our program has come to an end watch out for 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.240
 hockey and we will follow the news 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.390
 it was continental reading to see you soon 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.390
 meeting
