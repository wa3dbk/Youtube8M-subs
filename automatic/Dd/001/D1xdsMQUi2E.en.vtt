is making right now is accessories to
the<00:00:17.140> Rose<00:00:17.350> engine<00:00:17.890> so<00:00:18.520> we've<00:00:19.390> already

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
the Rose engine so we've already

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.510 
the Rose engine so we've already
explained<00:00:20.230> the<00:00:20.410> purling<00:00:20.800> tool<00:00:20.980> and<00:00:21.220> how<00:00:21.369> it

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
explained the purling tool and how it

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.570 
explained the purling tool and how it
works<00:00:21.790> but<00:00:22.540> it's<00:00:23.170> it's<00:00:23.560> very<00:00:23.680> nice<00:00:24.160> and<00:00:24.460> that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
works but it's it's very nice and that

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.630 
works but it's it's very nice and that
it<00:00:24.820> does<00:00:25.060> rotate<00:00:25.720> it<00:00:26.230> rotates<00:00:26.770> off-center<00:00:27.460> in

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
it does rotate it rotates off-center in

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.569 
it does rotate it rotates off-center in
increments<00:00:28.360> of<00:00:28.779> a<00:00:28.869> thousand<00:00:29.410> per<00:00:30.310> increment

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
increments of a thousand per increment

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.690 
increments of a thousand per increment
so<00:00:31.150> you<00:00:31.630> can<00:00:31.810> run<00:00:32.439> it<00:00:32.560> around<00:00:32.829> in<00:00:33.010> a<00:00:33.100> circle<00:00:33.130> you

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
so you can run it around in a circle you

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.030 
so you can run it around in a circle you
can<00:00:34.210> run<00:00:34.360> it<00:00:34.480> in<00:00:34.630> and<00:00:34.810> out<00:00:34.870> on<00:00:35.200> a<00:00:35.260> flat<00:00:35.710> with

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
can run it in and out on a flat with

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.250 
can run it in and out on a flat with
this<00:00:36.250> thumb<00:00:36.520> knob<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:37.060> use<00:00:37.570> it<00:00:37.750> as<00:00:37.900> a<00:00:37.930> pencil

work in this direction this direction in

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.459 
work in this direction this direction in
rotary<00:02:02.289> so<00:02:03.130> if<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.430> have<00:02:03.549> several<00:02:03.850> layers<00:02:04.240> of

other which ruins the look of your parts

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.730 
other which ruins the look of your parts
the<00:02:12.280> only<00:02:12.520> way<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.730> can<00:02:13.030> fix<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.320> to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
the only way you can fix that is to

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.970 
the only way you can fix that is to
bring<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.160> Chuck<00:02:15.460> in<00:02:15.730> 90<00:02:16.540> degrees<00:02:16.990> in<00:02:17.230> every

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
bring the Chuck in 90 degrees in every

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.160 
bring the Chuck in 90 degrees in every
direction<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.730> that's<00:02:19.150> what<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.599> Chuck<00:02:19.959> is

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
direction and that's what this Chuck is

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.210 
direction and that's what this Chuck is
for<00:02:20.580> although<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:22.690> roller<00:02:23.349> bearing<00:02:23.860> double

is<00:02:24.950> very<00:02:25.280> nice<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.970> no<00:02:26.960> bearing<00:02:27.470> double<00:02:28.310> bump

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
is very nice a no bearing double bump

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.570 
is very nice a no bearing double bump
also<00:02:29.090> works<00:02:29.330> really<00:02:29.900> well<00:02:30.230> on<00:02:30.470> almost<00:02:31.040> every

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
also works really well on almost every

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.210 
also works really well on almost every
rosette<00:02:32.090> especially<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.050> ones<00:02:33.290> where<00:02:34.010> the

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
rosette especially the ones where the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.360 
rosette especially the ones where the
bumps<00:02:35.120> are<00:02:35.270> farther<00:02:35.810> apart<00:02:36.020> so<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:36.980> doesn't

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
bumps are farther apart so it doesn't

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.120 
bumps are farther apart so it doesn't
require<00:02:37.630> having<00:02:38.630> two<00:02:38.990> bearings<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:39.830> just

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
require having two bearings it just

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.280 
require having two bearings it just
requires<00:02:40.550> having<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:41.030> convex<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.050> concave

requires having a convex and concave

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.280 
requires having a convex and concave
surface<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.790> same<00:02:44.000> rubber<00:02:44.300> we<00:02:44.900> have<00:02:45.080> two

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
surface on the same rubber we have two

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.140 
surface on the same rubber we have two
different<00:02:45.710> styles<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.340> allow<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.880> do

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
different styles that allow you to do

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.420 
different styles that allow you to do
double<00:02:47.960> bumping<00:02:50.980> one<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.220> nice<00:02:52.400> things

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
double bumping one of the nice things

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.760 
double bumping one of the nice things
about<00:02:52.910> this<00:02:53.300> machine<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:54.110> we<00:02:54.260> left<00:02:54.500> two

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
about this machine is that we left two

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.310 
about this machine is that we left two
inches<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.370> spindle<00:02:55.850> on<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.690> back<00:02:56.870> end<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:57.200> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.980 
inches of spindle on the back end of the
machine<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.890> allow<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.459> pump<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.000> all<00:02:59.780> it

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
machine to allow it to pump and all it

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.300 
machine to allow it to pump and all it
needs<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.950> spring<00:03:01.490> a<00:03:02.650> pumping<00:03:03.650> rosette<00:03:04.100> and

needs is a spring a pumping rosette and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.840 
needs is a spring a pumping rosette and
a<00:03:05.300> 90<00:03:05.690> degree<00:03:06.020> rubber<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:07.280> machine<00:03:07.700> is

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
a 90 degree rubber and the machine is

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.870 
a 90 degree rubber and the machine is
fully<00:03:08.150> functional<00:03:09.340> functionable<00:03:10.340> in<00:03:10.520> the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
45 you can also turn it all the way

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.310 
45 you can also turn it all the way
straight<00:04:04.160> up<00:04:04.400> 90<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.060> tighten<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:05.780> back<00:04:05.989> up

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
straight up 90 and tighten it back up

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.490 
straight up 90 and tighten it back up
now<00:04:06.860> every<00:04:07.430> design<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.630> your<00:04:08.810> rosettes<00:04:09.290> have
