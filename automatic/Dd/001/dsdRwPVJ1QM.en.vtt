 he was a short stasi that we there 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.080

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.480
 I do not think a board richey me 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.480
 we conclude with us already agree 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:42.660
 the direct conclusion of the sensitive 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:52.520

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:57.870
 with over my god to you immediately 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:00.000
 This immediately reaches the hate people 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.620
 a right has no sense of julian 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.970
 relationship does not work 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.370
 but I make the unsafe 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.700
 Maybe Julian should or could 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.060
 we change what it's about now 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.459
 So our relationship so I do not know if 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.190
 that can only continue 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.760
 sometimes it is not so nice 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.990

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.580
 perhaps thinking of a 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.410
 separation or forgave nevertheless 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.660
 maybe just a split on time too 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.120
 time maybe you say something about it 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.520
