what<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.239> hold<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:36.989> that's<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.769> Chaos

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
what the hold on that's the Chaos

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.479 
what the hold on that's the Chaos
Emerald<00:00:39.269> it<00:00:39.839> looks<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.530> doesn't<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.949> but

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
Emerald it looks like it doesn't it but

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.579 
Emerald it looks like it doesn't it but
in<00:00:41.610> fact<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.150> a<00:00:42.269> fake<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.930> created<00:00:43.350> after

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
in fact it's a fake one I created after

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.880 
in fact it's a fake one I created after
researching<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.610> real<00:00:44.850> emerald<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:46.019> has<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
researching the real emerald it has the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.819 
researching the real emerald it has the
same<00:00:47.159> wavelength<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.000> properties<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.620> it's

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
same wavelength and properties but it's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.220 
same wavelength and properties but it's
less<00:00:50.129> powerful<00:00:50.520> than<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.000> real<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.480> what

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
less powerful than the real one what

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
less powerful than the real one what
it's<00:00:52.859> designed<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.460> reverse<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.059> energy

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
it's designed to reverse the energy

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.840 
it's designed to reverse the energy
field<00:00:54.719> inside<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.530> chaos<00:00:55.859> emeralds<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.489> blow

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
field inside the chaos emeralds and blow

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.590 
field inside the chaos emeralds and blow
up<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:58.260> looks<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.739> real<00:00:58.890> even<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.910> machine<00:01:00.300> can't

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
up it looks so real even a machine can't

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.130 
up it looks so real even a machine can't
tell<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> difference<00:01:01.170> huh<00:01:02.100> fake<00:01:02.760> emerald<00:01:03.140> hey

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
tell the difference huh fake emerald hey

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.859 
tell the difference huh fake emerald hey
guys<00:01:04.410> long<00:01:05.250> time<00:01:05.280> no<00:01:05.910> see<00:01:06.179> hi<00:01:07.080> how<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.679> get<00:01:08.340> you

talking about now I know what's going on

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.359 
talking about now I know what's going on
let<00:01:12.899> me<00:01:13.050> try<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.440> see<00:01:13.679> me<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:13.979> Chaos

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
let me try to see me for the Chaos

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.139 
let me try to see me for the Chaos
Emerald<00:01:14.970> all<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:16.220> now<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.429> time<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.000> get

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
weapon using the fake emerald I made

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.240 
weapon using the fake emerald I made
what<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:29.970> mean<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.900> was<00:01:31.110> my<00:01:31.320> idea<00:01:31.350> there's

Amy<00:01:36.840> isn't<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.070> Chaos<00:01:38.820> Emerald<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:40.020> looks

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
Amy isn't that a Chaos Emerald it looks

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.789 
Amy isn't that a Chaos Emerald it looks
like<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.590> day<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.790> fact<00:01:42.049> I<00:01:43.049> created<00:01:43.530> after

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
like a day but in fact I created after

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.310 
like a day but in fact I created after
searching<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.700> real<00:01:45.030> emerald<00:01:45.540> stop<00:01:46.049> fooling

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
searching the real emerald stop fooling

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.469 
searching the real emerald stop fooling
around<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:47.100> same<00:01:47.340> wavelength<00:01:47.939> as<00:01:48.060> no<00:01:48.240> time

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
around the same wavelength as no time

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.080 
around the same wavelength as no time
Rafferty's<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.009> alright<00:01:50.280> power<00:01:50.610> than

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
Rafferty's but it's alright power than

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.170 
Rafferty's but it's alright power than
really<00:01:51.680> awesome<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:53.189> designed<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.790> reverse

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
really awesome it's designed to reverse

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
really awesome it's designed to reverse
the<00:01:54.360> energy<00:01:54.840> field<00:01:55.079> inside<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> chaos

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the energy field inside the chaos

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.050 
the energy field inside the chaos
emeralds<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.820> blow<00:01:57.180> up<00:01:57.210> yes<00:01:58.200> that's<00:01:58.409> about<00:01:58.799> it

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
emeralds and blow up yes that's about it

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.749 
emeralds and blow up yes that's about it
it<00:02:00.060> looks<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.560> even<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:01.799> she<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.399> tell<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it looks so even if she can tell the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.469 
it looks so even if she can tell the
difference<00:02:03.140> this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.350> awesome<00:02:05.060> okay<00:02:06.060> that's

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
difference this is awesome okay that's

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.579 
difference this is awesome okay that's
it<00:02:06.750> hey<00:02:07.140> guys<00:02:07.439> better<00:02:07.979> luck<00:02:08.160> next<00:02:08.220> time
