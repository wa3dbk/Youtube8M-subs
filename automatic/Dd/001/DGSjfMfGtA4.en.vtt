that's<00:06:51.020> pretty<00:06:51.529> much<00:06:51.680> all<00:06:51.860> I<00:06:51.919> wanted<00:06:52.219> to<00:06:52.279> say

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
that's pretty much all I wanted to say

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.100 
that's pretty much all I wanted to say
so<00:06:53.979> this<00:06:54.979> is<00:06:55.159> probably<00:06:55.550> going<00:06:55.999> to<00:06:56.180> be<00:06:56.360> the<00:06:56.870> one

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
so this is probably going to be the one

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.719 
so this is probably going to be the one
and<00:06:57.259> only<00:06:57.319> place<00:06:57.650> that<00:06:57.919> I<00:06:57.979> go<00:06:58.159> and<00:06:58.279> get<00:06:58.400> my<00:06:58.460> hair

00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:58.729 
and only place that I go and get my hair

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.749 
and only place that I go and get my hair
done<00:06:58.879> that<00:06:59.499> for<00:07:00.499> as<00:07:00.650> long<00:07:00.860> as<00:07:01.039> I<00:07:01.129> decided<00:07:01.490> to

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 
done that for as long as I decided to

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:06.640 
done that for as long as I decided to
