smurfs<00:00:59.899> collectible<00:01:00.899> game<00:01:01.739> i<00:01:02.190> think<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.180> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
smurfs collectible game i think it's a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.190 
smurfs collectible game i think it's a
figure<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.379> game<00:01:04.619> piece<00:01:05.960> little<00:01:06.960> game

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
figure it's a game piece little game

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.359 
figure it's a game piece little game
piece<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.350> i<00:01:12.200> guess<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.619> would<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
piece so i guess you would have to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.249 
piece so i guess you would have to
collect<00:01:14.760> all<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> pieces<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.689> play<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> game

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:30.740
