00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
this set and everything I thought it

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.769

much<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.410> actually<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:29.269> before<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> decided

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
much it actually was before I decided

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.709 
much it actually was before I decided
whether<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.500> order<00:00:31.710> own<00:00:32.009> up<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:33.540> today's

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719

think it was and the usual price is 42

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.240 
think it was and the usual price is 42

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.170 
yeah I'm looking forward to trying it

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:40.650 
yeah I'm looking forward to trying it
looks<00:07:35.380> quite<00:07:35.770> interesting<00:07:37.380> hmm<00:07:39.090> so<00:07:40.090> yeah<00:07:40.300> that

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:40.660 
looks quite interesting hmm so yeah that

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.940 
looks quite interesting hmm so yeah that
is<00:07:40.810> everything<00:07:41.140> you<00:07:41.230> get<00:07:41.320> in<00:07:41.470> the<00:07:41.560> set<00:07:41.740> and<00:07:41.920> I

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:41.950 
is everything you get in the set and I

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.740 
is everything you get in the set and I
think<00:07:42.190> for<00:07:42.400> twenty<00:07:42.940> nine<00:07:43.090> pound<00:07:43.360> I<00:07:43.480> think<00:07:43.660> that

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:43.750 
think for twenty nine pound I think that

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.890 
think for twenty nine pound I think that
that's<00:07:43.810> a<00:07:44.050> really<00:07:44.440> good<00:07:44.530> by<00:07:44.740> actually<00:07:45.190> and

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 
that's a really good by actually and

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.390 
that's a really good by actually and
because<00:07:46.900> apparently<00:07:47.260> this<00:07:47.530> on<00:07:47.770> its<00:07:47.920> own<00:07:48.070> is

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 
because apparently this on its own is

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.590 
because apparently this on its own is
like<00:07:48.550> 27<00:07:49.120> pounds<00:07:49.300> so<00:07:51.150> it's<00:07:52.150> pretty<00:07:52.420> much

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:52.600 
like 27 pounds so it's pretty much

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.300 
like 27 pounds so it's pretty much
likely<00:07:52.900> to<00:07:52.960> get<00:07:53.050> any<00:07:53.200> other<00:07:53.500> I<00:07:53.680> am<00:07:53.980> so<00:07:54.130> like<00:07:54.280> a

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:54.310 
likely to get any other I am so like a

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.600 
likely to get any other I am so like a
couple<00:07:54.640> of<00:07:54.700> quid<00:07:54.960> so<00:07:56.190> that's<00:07:57.190> good<00:07:57.340> if<00:07:57.430> you<00:07:57.490> ask
