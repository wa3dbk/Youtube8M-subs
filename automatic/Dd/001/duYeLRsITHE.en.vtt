00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
coming back he seems to have gotten

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.150 
coming back he seems to have gotten
quite<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.510> bit<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.840> redesign<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.590> think<00:00:23.039> this

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
quite a bit of a redesign I think this

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.189 
quite a bit of a redesign I think this
is<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> good<00:00:23.580> thing<00:00:23.880> because<00:00:24.029> Goro<00:00:24.869> has<00:00:25.019> never

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
is a good thing because Goro has never

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.349 
is a good thing because Goro has never
been<00:00:25.410> too<00:00:26.010> interesting<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.000> character

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
been too interesting of a character

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.429 
been too interesting of a character
myself<00:00:27.720> he's<00:00:27.869> kind<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.349> those

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
myself he's kind of one of those

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.320 
myself he's kind of one of those
characters<00:00:28.859> like<00:00:29.010> idol<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.670> Killer<00:00:29.939> Instinct

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
characters like idol and Killer Instinct

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.120 
characters like idol and Killer Instinct
back<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.630> day<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.260> fit<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.529> spot

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
back in day that just fit that spot

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.650 
back in day that just fit that spot
pretty<00:00:32.550> damn<00:00:32.790> well<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> end<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
pretty damn well at the end of a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.139 
pretty damn well at the end of a
character<00:00:34.020> roster<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.160> will<00:00:35.670> say<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:35.940> he

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
character roster but I will say that he

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.119 
character roster but I will say that he
looks<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.540> lot<00:00:36.660> better<00:00:36.930> than<00:00:37.020> he<00:00:37.260> ever<00:00:37.290> has<00:00:37.829> been

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
looks a lot better than he ever has been

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.400 
looks a lot better than he ever has been
before<00:00:38.190> I'm<00:00:39.030> wondering<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:39.870> characters<00:00:40.230> like

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
before I'm wondering if characters like

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.200 
before I'm wondering if characters like
Shiva<00:00:40.710> will<00:00:41.070> also<00:00:41.370> make<00:00:41.489> an<00:00:41.640> appearance<00:00:41.940> at

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
Shiva will also make an appearance at

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.720 
Shiva will also make an appearance at
this<00:00:42.510> rate<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.440> things<00:00:43.649> considered<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
this rate but all things considered the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.340 
this rate but all things considered the
fact<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.090> he's<00:00:45.329> here<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.840> he's<00:00:46.200> getting

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
fact that he's here and he's getting

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.260 
fact that he's here and he's getting
somewhat<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> redesign<00:00:47.460> does<00:00:47.730> mean<00:00:48.000> that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
somewhat of a redesign does mean that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.270 
somewhat of a redesign does mean that
we're<00:00:48.750> gonna<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> lot<00:00:49.350> more<00:00:49.559> similar<00:00:50.010> stuff

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
we're gonna see a lot more similar stuff

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.790 
we're gonna see a lot more similar stuff
to<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.449> actually<00:00:51.840> kind<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> surprised

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
to this I'm actually kind of surprised

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.000 
to this I'm actually kind of surprised
that<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.940> brand<00:00:54.300> new<00:00:54.539> character

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
that this was not a brand new character

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.110 
that this was not a brand new character
all<00:00:56.010> things<00:00:56.280> considered<00:00:56.610> they<00:00:56.789> were<00:00:56.850> saying

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
all things considered they were saying

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.610 
all things considered they were saying
that<00:00:57.210> half<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> roster<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.109> mostly<00:00:58.410> going<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
that half the roster is mostly going to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.560 
that half the roster is mostly going to
be<00:00:58.680> composed<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.280> newer<00:00:59.489> characters<00:00:59.789> but

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
be composed of newer characters but

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.689 
be composed of newer characters but
there<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> specific<00:01:01.260> catch<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.070> Goro<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
there is a specific catch to Goro and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.630 
there is a specific catch to Goro and
it's<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.239> he's<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.739> DLC<00:01:04.739> character<00:01:05.280> or

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it's that he's a DLC character or

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's that he's a DLC character or
technically<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> pre-order<00:01:07.020> bonus<00:01:07.490> character

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
technically a pre-order bonus character

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.399 
technically a pre-order bonus character
now<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> don't<00:01:09.360> know<00:01:09.450> how<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.689> guys<00:01:09.960> exactly

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
feel about this stuff but what it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.969 
feel about this stuff but what it
eventually<00:01:12.750> comes<00:01:13.140> down<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.860> got

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
which is not even a year after they

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.630 
which is not even a year after they
relieved<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.500> actual<00:03:02.860> first<00:03:03.100> time<00:03:03.250> we<00:03:03.370> saw<00:03:03.610> it

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
relieved the actual first time we saw it

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.330 
relieved the actual first time we saw it
so<00:03:04.090> that's<00:03:04.720> kind<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:04.990> crazy<00:03:05.170> I'm<00:03:05.470> very<00:03:05.920> happy
