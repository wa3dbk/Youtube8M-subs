we're<00:00:43.320> talking<00:00:43.440> about<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.579> let's<00:00:44.789> go

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
we're talking about it so let's go

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.950 
we're talking about it so let's go
basically<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.320> rounded<00:00:46.829> locks<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.780> we<00:00:48.780> saw

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
basically it's rounded locks so we saw

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.880 
basically it's rounded locks so we saw
this<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:50.010> moon<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.379> round<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
this kind of in moon it was a round and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.610 
this kind of in moon it was a round and
locks<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.460> pretty<00:00:53.789> random<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
locks it was pretty random with the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.020 
locks it was pretty random with the
excavators<00:00:55.620> digging<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.550> tunnels<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
excavators digging up the tunnels and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.729 
excavators digging up the tunnels and
ruining<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> mr.<00:00:57.690> father<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.440> wasn't

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
ruining the mr. father that wasn't

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.170 
ruining the mr. father that wasn't
really<00:00:58.859> round<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.370> was<00:00:59.489> randomized<00:00:59.940> for

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
really round that was randomized for

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.360 
really round that was randomized for
that<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.530> happened<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.129> didn't

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
that like that happened that didn't

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.149 
that like that happened that didn't
happen<00:01:02.670> at<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> certain<00:01:03.059> time<00:01:03.530> but<00:01:04.530> by<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:04.979> my

happen at a certain time but by but my

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.580 
happen at a certain time but by but my
random<00:01:05.580> locks<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.909> mean<00:01:06.260> something<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.470> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
random locks I mean something like a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.950 
random locks I mean something like a
certain<00:01:08.159> door<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.580> can't<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:08.970> opened<00:01:09.090> until

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
certain door that can't be opened until

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.539 
certain door that can't be opened until
say<00:01:10.860> sit<00:01:11.549> let's<00:01:11.729> say<00:01:11.790> around<00:01:11.850> 30<00:01:12.439> until<00:01:13.549> until

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
say sit let's say around 30 until until

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
say sit let's say around 30 until until
you<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.850> X<00:01:15.119> amount<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.479> kills<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> around<00:01:16.170> 30

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you have X amount of kills and around 30

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.320 
you have X amount of kills and around 30
or<00:01:16.710> something<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.490> maybe<00:01:18.090> some

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
or something like that or maybe some

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.929 
or something like that or maybe some
certain<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> good<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.430> can't<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
certain so good that you can't get to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.070 
certain so good that you can't get to
all<00:01:21.060> sitting<00:01:21.330> around<00:01:21.360> cuz<00:01:22.310> I'm<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.520> gun

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
all sitting around cuz I'm the gun

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.380 
all sitting around cuz I'm the gun
unlock<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.259> certain<00:01:25.650> would<00:01:26.100> work<00:01:26.490> perfectly

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
unlock a certain would work perfectly

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.649 
unlock a certain would work perfectly
because<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.420> look<00:01:30.540> at

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
because if you like if you look at

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.690 
because if you like if you look at
zombies<00:01:30.960> now<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.070> reg<00:01:32.340> went<00:01:32.579> on

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
zombies now you can get reg went on

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
zombies now you can get reg went on
round<00:01:32.820> three<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.450> lastly<00:01:33.810> you'd<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.170> set<00:01:34.380> till

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
round three and lastly you'd be set till

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.660 
round three and lastly you'd be set till
25<00:01:35.009> then<00:01:35.369> it'll<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.759> pointless<00:01:36.150> if<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:38.280> Reagan

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
25 then it'll be pointless if the Reagan

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.490 
25 then it'll be pointless if the Reagan
was<00:01:38.850> watching<00:01:39.299> till<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> certain<00:01:39.659> around<00:01:40.020> then

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
was watching till a certain around then

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.800 
was watching till a certain around then
they<00:01:40.920> could<00:01:41.400> actually<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> damage<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
they could actually up the damage in it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.350 
they could actually up the damage in it
so<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.950> will<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.220> more<00:01:44.460> useful<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:45.090> now

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
so it will be more useful because now

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.999 
so it will be more useful because now
the<00:01:45.420> really<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.350> overpowered

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the really really really overpowered

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.670 
the really really really overpowered

fucking<00:01:50.520> useless<00:01:50.700> after<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.990> they

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
fucking useless after that but they

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.830

could afford to up the damage because

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.200 
could afford to up the damage because
now<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.229> couldn't<00:01:55.560> because<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.189> they<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
now they couldn't because if they up the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.450 
now they couldn't because if they up the
damage<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.659> didn't<00:01:58.079> make<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.380> round<00:01:58.500> didn't

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
damage and didn't make it round didn't

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.300 
damage and didn't make it round didn't
make<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.700> unlock<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.149> certain<00:02:00.570> round<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:01.530> it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
make it unlock a certain round then it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.730 
make it unlock a certain round then it
would<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.939> way<00:02:03.090> too<00:02:03.149> overpowered<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
would just be way too overpowered way to
