 they are often in opposition the threats of the mouth I am knowing 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.230
 through the mouth 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.550
 these have ravaged that make the texture smell 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.430
 the textures are not very doubtful or something that becomes unpleasant or pointy 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.659
 good you can not only hurt yourself 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.400
 but it's not nice for him either 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.119
 for the baby with trumpets in motion 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.150
 the toys have to help 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.160
 that boy can be paid from Tehran to move 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.869
 who are listening to these questions since the baby is reflected on his 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:11.799
 own axis 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.209
 rabanal lower and upper limbs the head you start a catheter is not 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.529
 can move 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:22.299
 after the important to be able to help him with is presenting affected that the 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.120
 sedena move on its own axis nothing in the arzeno prejean liza make advisable 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.289
 the balls the game with ball 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:31.419
 because not being able to do 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:35.169
 mod maple is going to be frustrated in the interested 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:39.809
 you will not like toys that you can manipulate quietly and that if 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:43.760
 you drop it you can win it because the ball lacks license can 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:48.079
 cling to that pitch the judges of this stage are simple Thursdays 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.079
 they are not very complex 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.759
 i in the case of bindi the products 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.829
 they do not have shrill or electronic sounds 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.090
 babies this height their condition 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.359
 It is very sensitive 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.219
 and we run the risk that 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.729
 a strong sound the vultures the dialogue is giving signs of strength is 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.589
 in that phase the look 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:14.079
 after gaining the look she later astanÃ¡ in the look fundamentally 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.559
 about people the faces that attracts them most 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:21.379
 for a lot of things but good the theme of the face to substantiate this was 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.259
 Per hundred but you can also maintain a dialogue with the look 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.649
 that's the most important thing because you do not even look at a lot of objects 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.589
 much more than a baby more chiquitito of course they will always prefer 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.559
 the face of the norm 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:39.409
 perhaps it is not easier for me to be the most favorable for them with respect to the use 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.559
 of the judges three to six months 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.829
 of the five sectors begin to 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.839
 to want to take toys 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:49.859
 ii in the case of the palaces of May with the forwards that can be 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.899
 taken is important for parents to teach 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.409
 to use it as they make sound as you model different pieces 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.709
 and in the case of the strips of cradles that are the ones that are placed 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.219
 tribas trout ride it is important that the father sets it well that no 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.319
 is resolved for mexico does not take it to the neck and I may have had 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.899
 some kind of problem we start more preference 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.090
 they prefer one object than another 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.580
 they show that and that's how you can stimulate French in the locality 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.939
 of three faithful 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:26.539
 you should instead prefer a toy prefer to play with your shoe 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.479
 you have to respect that because you're getting to know 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.919
 in which there are still no concepts 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.330
 one has memory knows what the state's electoral things are for 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.909
 and he is exploring it 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:44.069
 he is getting to know me through his on the other hand to talk about touching him 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:44.970
 it was long 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.290
 to stimulate is not to ask that imitates that limit me in what I do what I say 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.430
 You have to show our 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.189
 noting that he alleged 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:58.339
 but they present to things and through it is by nothing all that I can bieler 

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:59.950
 they will do what they can with that 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.629
 the important thing is to take into account that also ahmadineyad on the axis itself 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:06.270
 people move 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.499
 and the need for contact through the eyes 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:13.270
 and the need to have faces and canada 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.680
 those are the two most important things because you summary is much more social
