browsing or apps for instance let's try

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.550 
browsing or apps for instance let's try
Google<00:05:37.150> Maps<00:05:37.360> that<00:05:37.690> probably<00:05:37.960> won't<00:05:38.080> even<00:05:38.470> do

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
Google Maps that probably won't even do

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.159 
Google Maps that probably won't even do
now<00:05:38.710> I<00:05:38.950> mean<00:05:39.520> it's<00:05:39.729> all<00:05:39.909> at<00:05:40.300> dependent<00:05:41.020> at<00:05:41.110> the

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
now I mean it's all at dependent at the

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.230 
now I mean it's all at dependent at the
moment<00:05:41.470> but<00:05:41.560> as<00:05:41.770> of<00:05:42.190> now<00:05:42.220> nothing's<00:05:42.970> full

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
moment but as of now nothing's full

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.990 
moment but as of now nothing's full
screen<00:05:43.539> but<00:05:43.750> videos<00:05:44.099> but<00:05:45.099> as<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.400> was<00:05:45.550> told

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
screen but videos but as I was told

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.640 
screen but videos but as I was told
720p<00:05:46.900> video<00:05:47.320> output<00:05:48.570> 1080p<00:05:49.570> content<00:05:49.900> output

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
720p video output 1080p content output

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.909 
720p video output 1080p content output
so<00:05:50.890> it<00:05:51.190> should<00:05:52.979> it<00:05:53.979> should<00:05:54.370> be<00:05:55.090> full<00:05:55.450> screen

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
so it should it should be full screen

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.390 
so it should it should be full screen
but<00:05:56.919> it's<00:05:57.039> not<00:05:57.220> and<00:05:59.039> other<00:06:00.039> than<00:06:00.159> have<00:06:00.310> the

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
but it's not and other than have the

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.760 
but it's not and other than have the
quality<00:06:00.729> is<00:06:00.789> fine<00:06:01.000> on<00:06:01.659> the<00:06:01.960> audio<00:06:02.380> through<00:06:02.740> the

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
quality is fine on the audio through the

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.390 
quality is fine on the audio through the
HDMI<00:06:02.979> is<00:06:03.340> really<00:06:03.640> cool<00:06:03.849> um<00:06:04.800> so<00:06:05.800> I<00:06:05.860> guess<00:06:05.979> I<00:06:06.039> mean

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
HDMI is really cool um so I guess I mean

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.180 
HDMI is really cool um so I guess I mean
but<00:06:06.789> if<00:06:07.090> you<00:06:07.210> have<00:06:07.330> an<00:06:07.450> Apple<00:06:07.690> TV<00:06:07.890> you<00:06:08.890> really

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
but if you have an Apple TV you really

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.740 
but if you have an Apple TV you really
don't<00:06:09.400> even<00:06:09.460> need<00:06:09.789> this<00:06:10.000> because<00:06:10.390> it<00:06:10.539> kind<00:06:10.690> of

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
don't even need this because it kind of

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.149 
don't even need this because it kind of
pretty<00:06:10.960> much<00:06:11.110> just<00:06:11.289> does<00:06:11.620> the<00:06:11.770> same<00:06:11.800> thing

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
pretty much just does the same thing

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.670 
pretty much just does the same thing
that<00:06:12.310> will<00:06:12.460> t<00:06:12.580> me<00:06:12.700> does<00:06:12.849> you<00:06:13.150> can<00:06:13.300> just<00:06:13.680> stream

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
that will t me does you can just stream

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.730 
that will t me does you can just stream
it<00:06:14.740> stream<00:06:15.250> the<00:06:15.370> videos<00:06:15.640> to<00:06:15.849> your<00:06:16.000> TV<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:16.750> the

it stream the videos to your TV so the

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.899 
it stream the videos to your TV so the
main<00:06:17.890> reason<00:06:18.190> for<00:06:18.220> me<00:06:18.400> buying<00:06:18.580> this<00:06:18.789> is

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
main reason for me buying this is

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.550 
main reason for me buying this is
because<00:06:19.150> I<00:06:19.270> was<00:06:19.450> informed<00:06:19.900> that<00:06:19.960> I<00:06:20.080> can<00:06:20.260> browse

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
but that's not the case so um make this

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.850 
but that's not the case so um make this
might<00:06:31.120> be<00:06:31.270> going<00:06:31.540> bad<00:06:31.750> I'll<00:06:32.110> try<00:06:32.380> tweaking<00:06:32.680> it

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
might be going bad I'll try tweaking it

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.910 
might be going bad I'll try tweaking it
a<00:06:32.919> little<00:06:33.130> bit<00:06:33.220> more<00:06:33.400> and

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
a little bit more and
