00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:11.519
 [Music] 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.809
 everybody still sees us as the republic 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.690
 of bananas, right? 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.060
 Do you think there are palm trees in 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.820
 home and miranda in samba so it's clear 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.150
 this sells faster it sells 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.050
 most immediate way this does not build 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.390
 on the other hand a future of design of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.430
 design ideas from brazil but sells 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.680
 so that comes in front of the beach fashion 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.530
 Brazilian diesel has an important 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.020
 we are one of the largest producers of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.700
 indigo in the world among the three largest 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 right producers 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 so this is very important because 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.100
 this helps to grow the market and we have 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.770
 now the expectation that the world is 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.530
 is seeing us as a country of creation 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.050
 an innovative country a country that he is 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.390
 multiple that is plural and light nÃ© that what 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.100
 difference brazil without beach clothes 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.070
 in aviation 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.119
 speak on cheap products not product 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.240
 of pike 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.310
 I've never heard of any market that 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.830
 Brazil was a launcher of another fashion 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.920
 announced at the beach hand our 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.630
 consuming your wife she does not 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.729
 admits the past of another product with the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.490
 same piece name of the same party 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.829
 summer year only the same piece many times 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.130
 so the ball with evidence to mix it up 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.310
 It's our people, the sweat I think nobody 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.500
 take the course other women just so 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.229
 like black bikini and daisson can 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.619
 Italian ac use the best super brands 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.110
 chic she attacks the court does not support 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.369
 a white powder checkers the only brand 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.659
 I know that everyone 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.299
 do you know her? 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.049
 if you ask anyone 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.920
 on the consumer very hardly they 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.530
 will remember 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.119
 although we already have some brands 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.659
 who are making a great effort 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.290
 In this sense, there is now a more 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.700
 is still very limited knowledge is a 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.039
 big knowledge 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.418
 I think we have shape 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.418
