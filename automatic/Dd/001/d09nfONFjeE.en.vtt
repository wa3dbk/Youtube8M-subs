gonna<00:00:09.660> be<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.960> same<00:00:10.400> but<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:12.059> little<00:00:12.929> bit<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.320> a

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
gonna be the same but a little bit of a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.340 
gonna be the same but a little bit of a
difference<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.250> regards<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:15.210> how<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.990> feels

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
difference in regards to how it feels

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.929 
difference in regards to how it feels
and<00:00:16.770> size<00:00:18.770> for<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> Defender<00:00:20.279> Series<00:00:20.310> on<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and size for the Defender Series on the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.060 
and size for the Defender Series on the
iPad<00:00:21.330> air<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:22.350> pretty<00:00:22.470> much<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.800> four

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
iPad air so it's pretty much a four

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.320 
iPad air so it's pretty much a four
piece<00:00:23.250> case<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> inner<00:00:24.210> shell

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
piece case you have the inner shell

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.080 
piece case you have the inner shell
which<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.990> two-piece<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.830> our<00:00:26.519> inside<00:00:26.910> it's

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
which is a two-piece and our inside it's

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.570 
which is a two-piece and our inside it's
also<00:00:27.300> padded<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:27.960> some<00:00:28.320> type<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.680> foam<00:00:28.920> which

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
also padded with some type of foam which

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.669 
also padded with some type of foam which
protects<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> backside<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.260> iPad<00:00:31.650> air

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
protects the backside of the iPad air

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.680 
protects the backside of the iPad air
and<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.460> also<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> outer<00:00:33.210> silicone

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
and you also have the outer silicone

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.959 
and you also have the outer silicone
layer<00:00:34.079> which<00:00:34.290> obviously<00:00:34.920> adds<00:00:35.219> another<00:00:35.730> layer

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
layer which obviously adds another layer

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.610 
layer which obviously adds another layer
of<00:00:36.180> protection<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.870> if<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.050> look<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> front

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
of protection so if we look at the front

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.020 
of protection so if we look at the front
side<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> built-in<00:00:38.760> screen

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
side you have a built-in screen

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.510 
side you have a built-in screen
protector<00:00:39.410> which<00:00:40.410> works<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:40.980> right<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.340> it's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
protector which works all right now it's

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.459 
protector which works all right now it's
not<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:41.969> good<00:00:42.270> as<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> regular<00:00:42.989> screen

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
not as good as a regular screen

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.770 
not as good as a regular screen
protector<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.700> does<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> job<00:00:45.270> done

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
protector but it does get the job done

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.319 
protector but it does get the job done
now<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> would<00:00:46.980> say<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> downside<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
now I would say that the downside to the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.000 
now I would say that the downside to the
built-in<00:00:48.719> screen<00:00:48.870> protector<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.890> it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
built-in screen protector is that it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
built-in screen protector is that it
will<00:00:50.190> take<00:00:50.430> away<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> little<00:00:51.239> bit<00:00:51.390> of

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
will take away a little bit of

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.200 
will take away a little bit of
responsiveness<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.280> display<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.000> also

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
responsiveness to the display and also

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.630 
responsiveness to the display and also
clarity<00:00:54.899> now<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.710> thing<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> keep<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.160> mind<00:00:56.219> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
clarity now one thing to keep in mind is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.790 
clarity now one thing to keep in mind is
that<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.480> don't<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that if you really don't like the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.500 
that if you really don't like the
built-in<00:00:59.280> protecting<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.910> always<00:01:00.120> pop

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
built-in protecting you can always pop

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.840 
built-in protecting you can always pop
it<00:01:00.690> off<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.230> use<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> regular<00:01:02.309> screen

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
it off and use a regular screen

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.340 
it off and use a regular screen
protector<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.719> you're<00:01:04.500> looking<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
protector if you're looking for a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.500 
protector if you're looking for a
another<00:01:07.350> alternative<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.280> still<00:01:08.790> use<00:01:09.090> the

there's also some OtterBox branding
overall<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> Defender<00:01:42.329> Series<00:01:42.360> feels<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.229> lot

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
overall the Defender Series feels a lot

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.109 
overall the Defender Series feels a lot
thinner<00:01:43.680> than<00:01:43.829> previous<00:01:44.399> versions<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
thinner than previous versions of the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.330 
thinner than previous versions of the
OtterBox<00:01:45.630> Defender<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:47.070> all

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
OtterBox Defender but I think that all

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.670 
OtterBox Defender but I think that all
has<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.790> do<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> design<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.259> iPad

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
has to do with the design of the iPad

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.270 
has to do with the design of the iPad
air<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.729> doesn't<00:01:51.060> feel<00:01:51.090> too<00:01:51.509> bulky

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
air so it really doesn't feel too bulky

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
air so it really doesn't feel too bulky
which<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.490> really<00:01:53.850> nice<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.930> course<00:01:55.140> you
