 today is super suitable for this 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.980
 spring season because we are going to 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.109

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.359
 The time they are very alive because we can 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.070
 make these complements we are also going to 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.050
 make a super easy orbits 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.849
 do and we're going to try to make this 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.099
 makeup suits us so much for the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.840
 day as for the night then I hope 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.820

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.079

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.079

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.030
 www dotcom fashion points that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.550
 it's also here in the bottom 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.739
 The first thing I will do is apply a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.890
 lighter concealer with my skin tone 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.290
 around the eyelid so that way I 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.260
 work as a primer and the shadows me 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.050
 last a lot longer now I'm going to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.809
 blur with a sponge and now with 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.700
 this white shadow I'm going to apply it on 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.250
 all my matches to make it another 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.680
 base color and ends with this tone 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.020
 yellow is a bit bright and here 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.299
 this shadow I'm going to apply it on the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.369
 eyelid mobile this color we will go 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.259
 building look that at the beginning 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.440
 it is a very soft yellow but I 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.830
 I want it to be a little more vibrant the 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.830
 colour 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.530
 and now I'm going to have a very dark coffee and 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.390
 I'm going to put it in the part of the basin 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.340
 this is going to give me a lot of depth in the 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.190
 eye and make my look look a lot 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.869
 more dramatic then I'll start it 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.360
 to put in the basin and now with a 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.060
 brush that is clean that does not have 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.340
 no other product I will start 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.430
 blend very well to blend 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.250
 the yellow with the change that I just 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.440
 put and now with a brown color a lot 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.020
 cutest we lived visited the dorados 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.899
 I'll put it well the external part of 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.360
 eye forming a vee so that the look 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.399
 that more quality that does not look so strong 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.350
 the color transition inc after 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.580
 play ball to touch up the yellow to 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.430
 that you are very visible more and finally in 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.260
 the eyebrow bone I'm going to clean 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.390
 with corrector and that also goes to me 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.610
 bring much more light to the stands 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.490
 then I will apply the shadow again 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.780
 white on the brow bone to bring 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.780
 light to the eye 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.100
 and be able to mix the colors very well 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.190
 alright now I'm going to apply an eyeliner 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.190
 liquid 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.930
 we do this with patience so that 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.190
 we are going to look pretty nice the line 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.620
 graph as you can see 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.480
 but finally I'm going to end up in a 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.410
 cat tail then just me 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.650
 prolonged stripes 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.120
 and then one that part of the line with the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.120
 downstairs 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.740
 so I have the triangle of the 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.080
 angle of cat after with a skewer 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.710
 thinner very precise as a 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.020
 black shadow and I begin to polish my 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.120
 line since I am not able to delineate 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.490
 perfectly my eyes then with the 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.380
 I can reflect on it, I 'm going now 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.350
 to delineate the part of the eyelashes 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.880
 down with the same black shadow and like 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.160
 I do not want the bag to look small 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.190
 I'm going to use this white eyeliner in 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.500
 the water line to grant it 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.060
 much bigger and more awake and this 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.370
 It is a very good tool for 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.320
 that have small eyes perhaps and 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.540
 applied a concealer this inside the 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.970
 hollows and the others is nor corrector 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.800
 favorite and clean very well all the 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.920
 society that has been able to create the 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.730
 pure shadows the delineated in his step is 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.879
 very important 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.640
 step by step and giving light to the eyes with a little 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:10.819
 illuminator on the part of the lacrimal and 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:15.469
 I'm going to put another little bit on the bone 2 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:19.519
 so good now I 'm going to clean them I'll 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:21.709
 to comb my eyebrows and I'm going to make them up 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.570
 with the shade coffee I remember that I have a 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.340
 eyebrow video 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.340
 to look at it more 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.169
 and the bed I'm going to do a little bit of 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.090
 outline tell me in the comments of 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.250
 the bottom part if you want me to make a 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.069
 video dedicated exclusively to 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.990
 outline to explain how to do it 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.990
 according to the type of face they have 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.460
 perhaps and trying to disguise a little 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.460
 My front 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:11.400
 and my nose is not very good and here I go 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.520
 to apply the powder very well always use 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.210
 and the other flush that is like the habits 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.210
 very nice 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.010
 this is a maybelline lipstick that 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.110
 love is purple very very strong 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.850
 so I think it contrasts very well 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.820
 all this colorful that we put we go 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.670
 our face for spring but 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.740
 we also put dark colors so that 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.600
 this makeup works for us also in 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.340
 the night then it is very versatile what 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.120
 We can use at any time 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.070
 of the day and is ideal for this spring 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.720
 for the hairstyle I'm going to make some waves 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.440
 super easy in the front 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.710
 I simply divide the front of 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.330
 my hair and I make a thick wave for 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.460
 that I stay much more loose and look 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.849
 very very natural I go back to doing what 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.740
 same 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.229
 and the truth is that I want this 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.059
 effect can only be seen forward though 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.729
 let's do in this part and we will stay 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:11.840
 super nice in our hairstyle we do 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.320
 the same one more time 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:19.270
 in the cap of the capu as they call 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.760
 you and the same thing we do from the other side 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.250
 the idea is that it looks like a very 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.650
 romantic but at the same time with very colorful 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.320
 striking as yellow the pink 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.190
 of the blush and the purple lipstick that 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.190
 we use here 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:37.349
 but also with the sobriety of the 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:41.029
 brown colors that we put in the basin and 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.029
 on the outside of our 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.319
 well that was all for the video of 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.840
