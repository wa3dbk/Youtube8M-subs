do you think the motivation was of the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.950 
do you think the motivation was of the
Swedish<00:01:04.229> authorities<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:05.339> opposing<00:01:05.760> bail<00:01:06.270> do

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
Swedish authorities in opposing bail do

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.300 
Swedish authorities in opposing bail do
you<00:01:07.049> think<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.470> done<00:01:07.650> purely<00:01:07.979> on

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
you think that was done purely on

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.730 
you think that was done purely on
judicial<00:01:09.210> grounds<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.810> don't<00:01:10.409> believe<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
judicial grounds I don't believe that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.429 
judicial grounds I don't believe that
and<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.340> don't<00:01:11.580> think<00:01:11.790> most<00:01:12.060> people<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.049> think

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and I don't think most people do I think

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.350 
and I don't think most people do I think
it<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.700> vindictive<00:01:15.680> punitive<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:17.640> punish<00:01:18.060> him

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it was vindictive punitive to punish him

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.070 
it was vindictive punitive to punish him
not<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> charge<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.790> a<00:01:20.790> sort<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.479> minor

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
not for the charge of a sort of minor

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.440 
not for the charge of a sort of minor
charge<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.860> sexual<00:01:23.130> assault<00:01:23.700> which<00:01:24.119> they

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
charge of sexual assault which they

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080 
charge of sexual assault which they
investigated<00:01:25.409> once<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.979> rejected<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.939> then

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
investigated once and rejected and then

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.170 
investigated once and rejected and then
they<00:01:27.390> started<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.170> again<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.909> think<00:01:29.909> and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
they started it up again I think and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.690 
they started it up again I think and
most<00:01:30.450> people<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.500> honest<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
most people do to be honest that the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.240 
most people do to be honest that the
Swedes<00:01:33.030> are<00:01:33.329> acting<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.380> behalf<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.040> bigger
