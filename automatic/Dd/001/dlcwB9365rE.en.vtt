this<00:01:39.180> game<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.439> m4<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.759> really<00:01:42.119> good<00:01:42.420> i

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
this game but the m4 is is really good i

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.109 
this game but the m4 is is really good i
recommend<00:01:43.170> using<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> m4<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.579> very<00:01:44.850> similar

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
recommend using the m4 it's very similar

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.929 
recommend using the m4 it's very similar
to<00:01:45.270> cod4<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.770> played<00:01:46.979> cod4<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.759> you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
to cod4 if you played cod4 because you

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.350 
to cod4 if you played cod4 because you
have<00:01:48.060> with<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.299> m16<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.290> m4<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.360> both

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
have with the m16 and the m4 and both

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
have with the m16 and the m4 and both
guns<00:01:51.630> well<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.290> game<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.890> m16<00:01:53.520> was

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
guns well in that game the m16 was

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.700 
guns well in that game the m16 was
better<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.420> black<00:01:54.840> ops<00:01:55.079> personally<00:01:55.680> I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
better but in black ops personally I

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.990 
better but in black ops personally I
feel<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:58.189> m4<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> better<00:01:59.790> all-around

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
feel that the m4 is a better all-around

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.230 
feel that the m4 is a better all-around
gun<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.799> seem<00:02:02.009> use<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.340> advanced<00:02:02.610> UAV<00:02:02.820> I

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
gun and you seem use that advanced UAV I

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.609 
gun and you seem use that advanced UAV I
actually<00:02:03.600> thought<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> advanced<00:02:04.530> UAV

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
actually thought the advanced UAV

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.469 
actually thought the advanced UAV
wouldn't<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.250> been<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.369> good<00:02:05.670> because<00:02:06.210> it

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
wouldn't have been that good because it

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.059 
wouldn't have been that good because it
just<00:02:06.630> seemed<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.990> UAV<00:02:07.350> except<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.950> see

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
just seemed like a UAV except you see

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.690 
just seemed like a UAV except you see
the<00:02:08.190> direction

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the direction

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.240 
the direction
but<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.110> really<00:02:10.229> use<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.679> directions<00:02:11.129> to

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
but you can really use the directions to

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.670 
but you can really use the directions to
your<00:02:11.280> advantage<00:02:11.640> because<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.349> look<00:02:13.590> at

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
your advantage because you can look at

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.050 
your advantage because you can look at
the<00:02:13.769> map<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:13.980> let's<00:02:14.400> say<00:02:14.519> somebody's<00:02:14.879> running

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the map and let's say somebody's running

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.180 
the map and let's say somebody's running
away<00:02:15.480> from<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.840> then<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:16.349> predict<00:02:16.830> their

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
away from you then you can predict their

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.530 
away from you then you can predict their
next<00:02:17.489> location<00:02:17.819> like<00:02:18.120> all<00:02:18.239> right<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.480> few

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
next location like all right in a few

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.720 
next location like all right in a few
seconds<00:02:19.260> they'll<00:02:19.470> be<00:02:19.560> up<00:02:19.709> more<00:02:19.980> or<00:02:20.220> if<00:02:20.610> they're

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
seconds they'll be up more or if they're

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.160 
seconds they'll be up more or if they're
running<00:02:20.819> towards<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.569> move<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.959> side

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
running towards you can move to the side

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.350 
running towards you can move to the side
or<00:02:22.200> get<00:02:22.560> ready<00:02:22.709> for<00:02:23.069> him<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.849> actually<00:02:24.150> is

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
or get ready for him it actually is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.540 
or get ready for him it actually is
really<00:02:24.750> good<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.500> think<00:02:26.099> might

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
really good and it's I think might

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.100 
really good and it's I think might
actually<00:02:26.760> be<00:02:27.060> better<00:02:27.300> than<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.599> blackbird

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
actually be better than a blackbird

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.290 
actually be better than a blackbird
because<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> blackbird<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.580> would<00:02:29.700> almost<00:02:29.849> focus

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
because a blackbird I would almost focus

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.150 
because a blackbird I would almost focus
on<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.599> too<00:02:30.780> much<00:02:30.810> because<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.739> would<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.950> like

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
on it too much because I would be like

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.059 
on it too much because I would be like
oh<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.700> have<00:02:33.450> access<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.170> seeing<00:02:34.500> everyone<00:02:34.590> and

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
oh I have access to seeing everyone and

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.979 
oh I have access to seeing everyone and
I'd<00:02:35.160> be<00:02:35.250> focused<00:02:35.700> on<00:02:35.849> everyone's<00:02:36.660> exact

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
I'd be focused on everyone's exact

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.930 
I'd be focused on everyone's exact
location<00:02:37.470> but<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.489> just<00:02:38.610> do<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> quick

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
location but I can just do a quick

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.890 
location but I can just do a quick
glance<00:02:39.269> at<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.080> advanced<00:02:40.860> UAV<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:42.720> just

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
glance at the advanced UAV and it just

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.620 
glance at the advanced UAV and it just
seems<00:02:43.080> all<00:02:43.290> around<00:02:43.590> better<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.730> 12<00:02:45.330> point

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
seems all around better and a 12 point

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.839 
seems all around better and a 12 point
streak<00:02:45.989> is<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.769> think<00:02:46.920> easier<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.459> get<00:02:47.579> than<00:02:47.640> an

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
streak is I think easier to get than an

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.789 
streak is I think easier to get than an
eighth<00:02:48.000> kill<00:02:48.329> streak<00:02:48.630> because<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.440> can<00:02:49.590> die

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
eighth kill streak because you can die

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.050 
eighth kill streak because you can die
multiple<00:02:50.310> times<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.700> still<00:02:50.880> get<00:02:51.030> that

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
multiple times and still get that

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.979 
multiple times and still get that
advanced<00:02:51.569> UAV<00:02:52.819> but<00:02:53.819> let's<00:02:54.030> see<00:02:54.209> what<00:02:54.239> are<00:02:54.810> some

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
advanced UAV but let's see what are some

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.410 
advanced UAV but let's see what are some
other<00:02:55.140> exciting<00:02:55.739> things<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:57.000> game<00:02:57.209> I

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
other exciting things in this game I

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.660 
other exciting things in this game I
really<00:02:57.930> like<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.349> quick-draw<00:02:58.860> book<00:02:59.099> at<00:02:59.280> perk

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
really like the quick-draw book at perk

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.589 
really like the quick-draw book at perk
and<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:01.069> sleight-of-hand<00:03:02.069> perk<00:03:02.640> sleight<00:03:03.569> of

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
and the sleight-of-hand perk sleight of

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.650 
and the sleight-of-hand perk sleight of

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
hand with the that second ability is

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.210 
hand with the that second ability is
pretty<00:03:07.049> amazing<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.829> see<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.130> i'm

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
pretty amazing and you see here i'm

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.600 
pretty amazing and you see here i'm
using<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:09.799> still<00:03:10.799> no<00:03:10.980> no<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.250> name<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.549> this

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
using the still no no the name of this

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.680 
using the still no no the name of this
gun<00:03:11.849> but<00:03:12.090> even<00:03:12.299> though<00:03:12.390> it's<00:03:12.480> like<00:03:12.540> my

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
gun but even though it's like my

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.190 
gun but even though it's like my
favorite<00:03:12.870> i<00:03:13.170> think<00:03:13.319> it's<00:03:13.410> like<00:03:13.440> km<00:03:14.280> something

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
favorite i think it's like km something

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.220 
favorite i think it's like km something
sorry<00:03:16.200> about<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.560> but<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:18.630> just<00:03:18.660> does<00:03:18.959> work

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
sorry about that but it just does work

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.590 
sorry about that but it just does work
it's<00:03:19.609> really<00:03:20.609> good<00:03:20.760> up<00:03:20.850> close<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.450> i

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
it's really good up close and i

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.530 
it's really good up close and i
recommend<00:03:21.900> hip<00:03:22.200> firing<00:03:22.440> with<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:23.359> like<00:03:24.359> that

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
recommend hip firing with it like that

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.420 
recommend hip firing with it like that
because<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:25.109> really<00:03:25.410> much<00:03:25.799> more<00:03:25.980> accurate

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430
