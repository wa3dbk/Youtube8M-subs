00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.120 
800 watts at 2 ohms and 1200 watts RMS
at<00:00:29.310> 1m<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.420> let's<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.590> baby<00:00:31.859> does

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
at 1m so let's see what this baby does

00:00:32.130 --> 00:02:43.630 
at 1m so let's see what this baby does
in<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> real<00:00:32.759> world

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.460 

so<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.730> results<00:02:45.090> are<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.330> for<00:02:45.360> our<00:02:45.780> certified

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
so the results are in for our certified

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.090 
so the results are in for our certified
RMS<00:02:46.920> power<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.400> our<00:02:48.060> dynamic<00:02:48.780> RMS<00:02:49.140> power<00:02:49.319> so

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
RMS power and our dynamic RMS power so

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.000 
RMS power and our dynamic RMS power so
for<00:02:50.670> certified<00:02:51.060> at<00:02:51.209> 4<00:02:51.390> ohms<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:51.780> got<00:02:51.930> 662<00:02:52.799> watts

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
RMS at 2 ohms certified we got 1037 RMS

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.039 
RMS at 2 ohms certified we got 1037 RMS
and<00:02:58.500> at<00:02:59.430> 1<00:02:59.700> ohm<00:02:59.880> we<00:03:00.060> got<00:03:00.209> thirteen<00:03:00.750> hundred<00:03:01.019> and

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
and at 1 ohm we got thirteen hundred and

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.860 
and at 1 ohm we got thirteen hundred and
eighty<00:03:01.230> four<00:03:01.590> watts<00:03:01.950> RMS<00:03:02.580> now<00:03:03.330> we<00:03:03.390> also<00:03:03.630> did

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
eighty four watts RMS now we also did

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.600 
eighty four watts RMS now we also did
the<00:03:03.959> dynamic<00:03:04.440> test<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:05.160> well<00:03:05.370> like<00:03:05.489> we<00:03:05.580> said

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
the dynamic test like well like we said

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.300 
the dynamic test like well like we said
earlier<00:03:06.030> in<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.180> video<00:03:06.769> dynamic<00:03:07.769> at<00:03:07.920> 4<00:03:08.190> ohms

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
earlier in the video dynamic at 4 ohms

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.080 
earlier in the video dynamic at 4 ohms
we<00:03:08.549> got<00:03:08.690> 666<00:03:09.690> watts<00:03:09.900> RMS<00:03:10.440> at<00:03:10.860> 2<00:03:11.400> ohms<00:03:11.610> eleven

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
we got 666 watts RMS at 2 ohms eleven

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.090 
we got 666 watts RMS at 2 ohms eleven
hundred<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.480> twenty-eight<00:03:12.900> watts<00:03:13.290> RMS<00:03:13.799> and

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
hundred and twenty-eight watts RMS and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.009 
hundred and twenty-eight watts RMS and
at<00:03:14.700> 1<00:03:14.970> ohm<00:03:15.920> 1647<00:03:16.920> RMS<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.970> definitely<00:03:18.660> quite<00:03:18.989> a

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
at 1 ohm 1647 RMS so definitely quite a

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.509 
at 1 ohm 1647 RMS so definitely quite a
bit<00:03:19.230> higher<00:03:19.410> than<00:03:19.650> what<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.890> manufacturer

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
bit higher than what the manufacturer

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.660 
bit higher than what the manufacturer
says<00:03:20.700> on<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.030> Box<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:22.670> manufacturer

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
says on the Box the manufacturer

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.160 
says on the Box the manufacturer
actually<00:03:24.060> rated<00:03:24.620> 4<00:03:25.620> ohm<00:03:25.769> 500<00:03:26.280> watts<00:03:26.430> RMS<00:03:27.170> 2

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
actually rated 4 ohm 500 watts RMS 2

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.810 
actually rated 4 ohm 500 watts RMS 2
ohms<00:03:28.380> at<00:03:28.620> 801<00:03:29.810> ohm<00:03:30.810> at<00:03:31.109> $1200<00:03:31.980> m/s<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:32.730> we

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
ohms at 801 ohm at $1200 m/s so we

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.490 
ohms at 801 ohm at $1200 m/s so we
definitely<00:03:33.209> got<00:03:33.359> some<00:03:33.570> some<00:03:33.900> good<00:03:34.079> results

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
definitely got some some good results

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.250 
definitely got some some good results
with<00:03:35.070> dynoing<00:03:35.430> this<00:03:35.670> amplifier<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:37.019> clearly

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
with dynoing this amplifier so clearly

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.710 
with dynoing this amplifier so clearly
you<00:03:37.470> can<00:03:37.590> see<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.859> jad<00:03:38.160> 1201<00:03:38.850> by<00:03:39.060> nvx<00:03:39.480> as<00:03:39.690> a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
you can see the jad 1201 by nvx as a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.050 
you can see the jad 1201 by nvx as a
true<00:03:39.959> performer<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.680> definitely<00:03:41.160> exceeds

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
true performer it definitely exceeds

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.819 
true performer it definitely exceeds
what<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.359> manufacturer<00:03:42.959> says<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.410> that's

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
what the manufacturer says and that's

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.620 
what the manufacturer says and that's
great<00:03:44.130> because<00:03:44.340> you're<00:03:44.670> realistically<00:03:45.450> going

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
great because you're realistically going

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.780 
great because you're realistically going
to<00:03:45.750> get<00:03:46.079> true<00:03:46.500> power<00:03:46.799> once<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.280> put<00:03:47.459> this<00:03:47.609> in

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
to get true power once you put this in

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.430 
to get true power once you put this in
the<00:03:47.880> car<00:03:48.090> yeah<00:03:48.510> we've<00:03:48.690> got<00:03:48.870> 4<00:03:49.079> batteries

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
the car yeah we've got 4 batteries

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.470 
the car yeah we've got 4 batteries
hooked<00:03:49.739> up<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.150> we<00:03:51.150> don't<00:03:51.299> have<00:03:51.389> an

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
hooked up to this we don't have an

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.300 
hooked up to this we don't have an
alternator<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.170> kind<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.769> see<00:03:52.920> down<00:03:53.130> there

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
alternator and kind of see down there

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.449 
alternator and kind of see down there
our<00:03:53.609> bank<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.269> batteries<00:03:54.389> but<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:56.040> advantage

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
our bank of batteries but the advantage

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.340 
our bank of batteries but the advantage
of<00:03:56.579> testing<00:03:56.940> this<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.329> that<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.049> can<00:03:58.170> really

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
of testing this is that you can really

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.780 
of testing this is that you can really
see<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.650> you're<00:03:59.040> really<00:03:59.069> going<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.459> get<00:03:59.639> what

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
see that you're really going to get what

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.360 
see that you're really going to get what
you<00:03:59.819> pay<00:04:00.060> for<00:04:00.090> with<00:04:00.420> this<00:04:00.569> amplifier<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.980> think

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
you pay for with this amplifier I think

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.180 
you pay for with this amplifier I think
it's<00:04:02.489> great<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.730> mean<00:04:03.030> getting<00:04:03.209> 1200<00:04:03.600> watts<00:04:04.190> you

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
it's great I mean getting 1200 watts you
