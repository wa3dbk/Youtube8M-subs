00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.260
 here they are looking for the leaves 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.700
 of the plant genes of the genius plant of the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.950
 my garden is a small one 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.960
 great now I will gather more than anything else 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.939
 large plantain to make syrup 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.470
 it is very well recognized in all meadows 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.059
 yesterday at the course we just did 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.640
 one round we collected a lot of 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:32.099
 plants among the question to the penta gine 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.460
 chicory flowers we found 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.649
 SJW so many things we did and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.359
 so we also did the syrup e 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.789
 I want to show it to you too 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.039
 today therefore this is the plantain 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.530
 see you recognized already said also 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.710
 in my other signed lines 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.550
 very marked of these leaves there 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 another little girl if I walk a bit it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.960
 I find another here I find another little one 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.059
 and so on so I did nothing but 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.339
 collect the leaves 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.520
 look at this italian state test from 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.390
 I'm going to wash a beautiful big one and then 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.090
 after I show you they have to be chopped 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.900
 put in the pot with sugar water 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.150
 honey 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.090
 you have to wait for everything to dry 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.860
 and then it filters to make the exit here 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.450
 these are the crowds of plantain that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.370
 we have obviously gathered a lot 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.710
 more I see masses so to do it 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.800
 see this is the big plantain 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.080
 see and it begins to break up now 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.540
 to put it in hot water with it 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.150
 sugar and honey to do just that 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.810
 syrup I 'll show you 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.060
 here I go to break it into this 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.070
 so that to make small 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.810
 small as possible then if we said 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.600
 so we can also avoid more 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:05.990
 chopped up sleep is more the bottle 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:11.360
 it is better to make the smaller size smaller 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.910
 big when we're going to break yours 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.300
 we appreciate you could also do the 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.300
 Crescent moon 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:51.049
 taken since yesterday we got the cleaver 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:51.049
 without this moment very much in hand 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:02.400
 at this point you can put it in the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:05.280
 pot of that postcard then le 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.389
 doses are and I have already written to you here 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.669
 under 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:11.730
 4 I do not know if of herbs cut of leaves 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:13.859
 of plant gene and 300 grams of sugar 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.409
 of course we do not put one 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.439
 white sugar and then if we want this 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.959
 also adds the honey recipe from 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.629
 250 grams of honey even though we have 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.079
 done quietly once below 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.079
 with sugar 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.800
 you will touch the honey and then 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.590
 consider to add more 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.490
 handfuls of heavy herbs and at least two 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.440
 glasses of water 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.850
 meanwhile the water then goes to cooking 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.430
 evaporate 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.910
 then the sugar remains, of course yes 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.490
 then melt candy and honey 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.490
 I have organic honey having everything to 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.310
 what to do with agriculture where I take it 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.120
 pollen then a raw honey 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.980
 biological integral therefore we must 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.890
 make it caution at least twenty 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.180
 minutes even 30 twenty minutes half an hour 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.700
 suspects that the water will evaporate 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.730
 absolute therefore that all the property 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.560
 of the plantation are absorbed 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.880
 from the guide but the sugar because then 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:23.570
 we have our syrup finished we have 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.950
 put the plantain syrup inside 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.400
 the maple syrup package 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.110
 as I said at the beginning it is a lot 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.930
 good very sweet so it can be 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.460
 eaten by everyone even by children 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.910
 I mentioned that my husband 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.010
 because unfortunately he is a smoker and not 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.810
 can stop often and willingly 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.630
 depend of the cough 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.390
 also nocturnal but presence of families 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.700
 so this syrup gives them a hand 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:54.470
 we had already tried it already 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.840
 done and the reaction is almost positive 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.550
 immediately meaning those who suffer from 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.740
 right very strong with a teaspoon of 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.360
 this must be absolute here 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.240
 so instead of going to buy 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.480
 syrups in pharmacies now summer do a 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.430
 ride in campania and do it by yourself is 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.430
 really really very simple like 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.820
 I've already told you quickly 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.370
 I am writing it here below 4 handfuls 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.440
 of what disadvantages but can be 67 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.710
 they can be two in proportion 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.970
 it is covered with a little water 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.490
 usually with four nice throws 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.310
 full of plant leaves and put 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.590
 300 g of brown sugar and 250 grams 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.320
 of honey you can do it even a little bit 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.060
 less sugary if you want or even 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.740
 I only have brown sugar 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.139
 in other words , I did it without it 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.199
 the honey absolutely came 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:48.889
 very good then it is kept in the fridge 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:51.680
 like many syrups I repeat the therapy 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:55.159
 it is made is recommended by maria 3 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.620
 well a spoon every morning also 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:59.449
 because it suffers from bronchial asthma and asm 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.610
 so allergic that those take you 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.249
 very strong cough attacks almost the 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.520
 amount of phlegm present brings them to 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:09.560
 have the feeling of drowning 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.050
 try I recommend you can do 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.009
 lots of things from you and they are not 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.960
 difficult 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:18.080
 if you have difficulties you can 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.479
 contact me otherwise I hope in September 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.610
 to be able to make a second meeting 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.189
 to gather the herbs will be there will be 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.180
 other blooms and preparations therefore 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:30.159
 we will do them together 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.159
 ok low bash kiss
