00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
basic basic menu system you'll probably

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
basic basic menu system you'll probably
be<00:01:27.840> shooting<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.320> some<00:01:28.590> sort<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.920> auto<00:01:29.159> mode

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
switch between say landscape or portrait

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.490 
switch between say landscape or portrait
but<00:01:32.790> auto<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.180> think<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> way<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> go<00:01:34.259> for

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
but auto I think is the way to go for
