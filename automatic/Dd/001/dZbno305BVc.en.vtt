00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.520
 Y 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.020
 or what there is, I hope you are very well 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.030
 my name is víctor and today we are going to 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.709
 draw an emerald from minecraft what 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.470
 first thing I'm going to do is measure by 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.870
 centimeter to make many pictures of 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.430
 this way 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.610
 let's make a space of 2 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.250
 centimeters by 14 centimeters 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.730
 the emerald is 11 centimeters with 14 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.730
 centimeters 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.360
 in this way with the squad we are going to 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.360
 start making space 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.149
 and put in quick camera so that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.149
 you see how this is done 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.990
 but it has with the measures we can 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.990
 make a frame freedom 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.390
 here I'm arranging the rest for not 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.390
 wrong to make the pictures 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.220
 after we have all the 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.610
 pictures let's highlight the way 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.610
 laterality 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.870
 and the last one showed her feathers 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.650
 they can also do it without highlighting 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.650
 and only the pictures 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.610
 and let's start cool 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.790
 and with the colors they will lose the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.830
 strokes 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.830
 as it is placed with a range of greens 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.500
 We do a combination of white and 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.500
 green for brightness 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.930
 he also used a blue-green for the 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.930
 light 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.150
 and the emerald of May is ready 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.840
 if you want, you can put more 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.630
 shadows so they look 3d with the same 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.270
 squad rule we measure the diagonal of a 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.500
 square we use a darker color 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.500
 and we started to contrast 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.480
 or 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.510
 do not 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.989
 and ready 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.640
