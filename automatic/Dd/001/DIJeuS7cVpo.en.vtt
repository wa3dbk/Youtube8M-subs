in<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.090> land<00:01:27.299> mine<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.630> everything's<00:01:27.900> pretty

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
in a land mine so everything's pretty

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.960 
in a land mine so everything's pretty
normal<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.009> new<00:01:29.189> point<00:01:29.520> counter<00:01:29.850> is

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
normal but the new point counter is

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.300 
normal but the new point counter is
totally<00:01:30.390> different<00:01:30.750> he<00:01:31.650> switches<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> gun

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
totally different he switches to a gun

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
totally different he switches to a gun
in<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> secondary<00:01:33.479> I'm<00:01:33.689> assuming

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
in here this is a secondary I'm assuming

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.200 
in here this is a secondary I'm assuming
the<00:01:34.110> fmg9<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.070> foldable<00:01:35.430> submachine<00:01:36.030> gun

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the fmg9 it's a foldable submachine gun

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.870 
the fmg9 it's a foldable submachine gun
made<00:01:36.720> by<00:01:36.869> magpul<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> real<00:01:38.520> gun<00:01:38.729> though

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
made by magpul it is a real gun though

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880 
made by magpul it is a real gun though
it's<00:01:39.030> only<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.240> prototype<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.780> real<00:01:39.930> life<00:01:40.140> it's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
it's only a prototype in real life it's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
it's only a prototype in real life it's
actually<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.490> pretty<00:01:41.670> simple<00:01:41.939> gun<00:01:42.150> issues<00:01:42.390> 9

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
actually a pretty simple gun issues 9

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
actually a pretty simple gun issues 9
millimeter<00:01:42.960> Parabellum<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> lot

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
millimeter Parabellum and it's a lot

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.469 
millimeter Parabellum and it's a lot
like<00:01:44.460> shooting<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.850> Glock<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.240> actually

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
like shooting a Glock it's actually

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.350 
like shooting a Glock it's actually
based<00:01:45.600> off<00:01:45.869> at<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.079> glock<00:01:46.290> 17<00:01:46.560> or<00:01:47.009> 18<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
based off at the glock 17 or 18 it's a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.149 
based off at the glock 17 or 18 it's a
cool<00:01:48.659> looking<00:01:49.049> gun<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:49.979> not<00:01:50.100> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
cool looking gun it's really not that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.580 
cool looking gun it's really not that
amazing<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.000> pretty<00:01:51.180> simple<00:01:51.420> gun<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.500> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
amazing it's a pretty simple gun so it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.420 
amazing it's a pretty simple gun so it
sounds<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:52.979> are<00:01:53.009> gonna<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.280> some

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
sounds like we are gonna have some

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.770 
sounds like we are gonna have some
pretty<00:01:53.579> cool<00:01:53.759> secondary<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.540> just

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
pretty cool secondary is not just

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
pretty cool secondary is not just
pistols<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.250> either<00:01:56.399> good<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:56.670> bad

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
pistols so that is either good or bad

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.760 
pistols so that is either good or bad
depending<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.299> what<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> land

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
depending on what you like so the land

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.020 
depending on what you like so the land
mine<00:01:58.950> goes<00:01:59.159> off<00:01:59.340> before<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> get<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
mine goes off before I get to the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.580 
mine goes off before I get to the
juggernaut<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.659> want<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.079> focus<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
juggernaut I want to focus on the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.050 
juggernaut I want to focus on the
mini-map<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.219> does<00:02:02.490> look<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.759> it's

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
mini-map it does look like it's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.120 
mini-map it does look like it's
three-dimensional<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:04.500> could<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.829> huge

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
three-dimensional that could be huge

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.319 
three-dimensional that could be huge
guys<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.490> know<00:02:05.579> how<00:02:05.729> sometimes<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.210> don't

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
guys you know how sometimes you don't

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.819 
guys you know how sometimes you don't
know<00:02:06.450> guys<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> first<00:02:07.140> floor<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.530> second

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
know guys on the first floor the second

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.790 
know guys on the first floor the second
floor<00:02:08.090> hopefully<00:02:09.090> they<00:02:09.780> put<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.440> some<00:02:10.679> way

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
floor hopefully they put in some way

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.080 
floor hopefully they put in some way
that<00:02:10.979> we<00:02:11.069> can<00:02:11.220> differentiate<00:02:11.640> between<00:02:11.819> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
that we can differentiate between the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.340 
that we can differentiate between the
two<00:02:12.270> because<00:02:12.510> i<00:02:12.629> know<00:02:12.690> that's<00:02:12.959> been

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
two because i know that's been

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.570 
two because i know that's been
kind<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.560> an<00:02:13.680> annoying<00:02:13.950> thing<00:02:14.250> if<00:02:14.340> you're<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.550> a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
kind of an annoying thing if you're in a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.240 
kind of an annoying thing if you're in a
two-story<00:02:14.940> building<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.740> next<00:02:16.950> part<00:02:17.160> is

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
two-story building so the next part is

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.000 
two-story building so the next part is
much<00:02:17.490> bigger<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.840> juggernaut<00:02:19.440> he<00:02:19.650> hits<00:02:19.890> his

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
much bigger the juggernaut he hits his

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.920 
much bigger the juggernaut he hits his
juggernaut<00:02:20.400> killstreak<00:02:20.910> at<00:02:21.030> 14<00:02:21.420> points

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
juggernaut killstreak at 14 points

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.020 
juggernaut killstreak at 14 points
remember<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.710> doesn't<00:02:23.040> say<00:02:23.190> kills<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.790> does

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
remember it doesn't say kills it does

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.180 
remember it doesn't say kills it does
save<00:02:24.270> points<00:02:24.660> now<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:25.260> hoping<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:25.980> based

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
save points now I'm hoping this is based

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.100 
save points now I'm hoping this is based
on<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.490> homefront<00:02:26.700> system<00:02:27.330> which<00:02:27.810> basically

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
on the homefront system which basically

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.660 
on the homefront system which basically
means<00:02:28.320> let's<00:02:28.590> say<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:28.770> cap<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.070> flag<00:02:29.370> maybe

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
means let's say you cap a flag maybe

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.310 
means let's say you cap a flag maybe
that<00:02:29.910> equals<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.270> point<00:02:30.510> or<00:02:30.750> two<00:02:30.780> points<00:02:31.230> even

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
that equals a point or two points even

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.020 
that equals a point or two points even
or<00:02:31.530> if<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.650> defend<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.070> flag<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.730> don't<00:02:32.910> just

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
or if you defend a flag you don't just

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.400 
or if you defend a flag you don't just
get<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.210> kill<00:02:33.510> maybe<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.810> get<00:02:33.900> two<00:02:34.050> points<00:02:34.200> and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
get a kill maybe you get two points and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.680 
get a kill maybe you get two points and
that's<00:02:34.530> just<00:02:34.680> speculation<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.910> clearly<00:02:36.330> it's

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
that's just speculation but clearly it's

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.260 
that's just speculation but clearly it's
not<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.410> be<00:02:37.470> about<00:02:37.680> kills

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
not just going to be about kills

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.310 
not just going to be about kills
juggernaut<00:02:39.270> if<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.630> watch<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.050> rest<00:02:40.230> of

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
juggernaut if you watch the rest of

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.350 
juggernaut if you watch the rest of
survival<00:02:40.710> trailer<00:02:41.070> juggernaut<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.880> basically

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
survival trailer juggernaut is basically

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.690 
survival trailer juggernaut is basically
this<00:02:42.450> giant<00:02:42.990> suit<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:43.890> put<00:02:44.250> on<00:02:44.280> and

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
this giant suit that you put on and

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.310 
this giant suit that you put on and
makes<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.090> gives<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.510> basically<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.110> ton<00:02:46.290> of

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
makes you gives you basically a ton of

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.750 
makes you gives you basically a ton of
power<00:02:46.530> that's<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.250> most<00:02:47.370> likely<00:02:47.550> outcome

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
power that's the most likely outcome

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.110 
power that's the most likely outcome
because<00:02:48.630> it's<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.590> care<00:02:50.040> package<00:02:50.190> drop<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.730> how

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
because it's a care package drop is how

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.400 
because it's a care package drop is how
it<00:02:51.240> comes<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.660> sounds<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.080> comes<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.350> a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
it comes it sounds like it comes in a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.550 
it comes it sounds like it comes in a
care<00:02:52.620> package<00:02:52.740> drop<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:54.140> next<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.410> is

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
care package drop so next and this is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.840 
care package drop so next and this is
the<00:02:55.680> huge<00:02:55.920> part<00:02:56.100> guys<00:02:56.250> if<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.520> look<00:02:56.700> at<00:02:56.820> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
the huge part guys if you look at the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.520 
the huge part guys if you look at the
bottom<00:02:57.210> right-hand<00:02:57.390> corner<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:58.020> is<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.200> huge

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
bottom right-hand corner this is a huge

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.040 
bottom right-hand corner this is a huge
change<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:59.730> looks<00:03:00.180> like<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.540> can<00:03:00.690> now<00:03:00.780> pick

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
change it looks like you can now pick

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
like the point counter has reset now

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.720 
like the point counter has reset now
this<00:03:28.560> could<00:03:28.740> be<00:03:28.800> totally<00:03:29.040> thought<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.610> maybe

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
this could be totally thought and maybe

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.130 
this could be totally thought and maybe
you<00:03:29.850> can't<00:03:30.030> add<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.300> it<00:03:30.390> but<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.630> sure<00:03:30.870> looks

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.410 
you can't add to it but it sure looks
like<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.500> me<00:03:31.550> that<00:03:32.550> you<00:03:32.730> might<00:03:32.760> be<00:03:33.060> able<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.270> go

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420

wonder<00:04:20.280> how<00:04:20.460> they're<00:04:20.609> going<00:04:20.730> to<00:04:20.790> handle<00:04:21.150> that

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
wonder how they're going to handle that

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.520 
wonder how they're going to handle that
maybe<00:04:21.540> it<00:04:21.690> drops<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:22.080> little<00:04:22.200> bit<00:04:22.440> because

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
maybe it drops a little bit because

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.290 
maybe it drops a little bit because
they're<00:04:22.740> keeping<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.160> meter<00:04:23.460> now<00:04:23.700> it's<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:24.030> meter

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
they're keeping a meter now it's a meter

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.840 
they're keeping a meter now it's a meter
so<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.470> could<00:04:25.919> maybe<00:04:26.070> drop<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.580> think<00:04:26.729> it'd<00:04:26.820> be

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
so it could maybe drop I think it'd be

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.110 
so it could maybe drop I think it'd be
cool

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
cool

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.820 
cool
if<00:04:27.240> you<00:04:27.330> guide<00:04:27.540> it<00:04:27.840> goes<00:04:28.020> down<00:04:28.260> like<00:04:28.470> three

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
if you guide it goes down like three

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.860 
if you guide it goes down like three
spots<00:04:29.130> instead<00:04:29.520> of<00:04:29.610> every<00:04:29.850> spot<00:04:30.120> who<00:04:30.630> knows

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
spots instead of every spot who knows

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.510 
spots instead of every spot who knows
that's<00:04:31.260> just<00:04:31.440> speculation<00:04:31.590> but<00:04:32.250> like<00:04:32.370> i<00:04:32.490> said

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
that's just speculation but like i said

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.800 
that's just speculation but like i said
it<00:04:32.790> definite<00:04:33.210> looks<00:04:33.360> like<00:04:33.449> they're<00:04:33.600> going<00:04:33.690> to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
it definite looks like they're going to

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.900 
it definite looks like they're going to
