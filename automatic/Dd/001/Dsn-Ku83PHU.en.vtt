00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.849
 the most revolutionary mexico and the usa is the suspension system 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.219
 the car started with one in four balls half filled with nitrogen gas 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.679
 This compressed gas mixture works as a large flexible shock absorber 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.069
 the shot was passed under an awning oil pressure working group 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.390
 along with the other components in the poll 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.880
 so unique spring comfort is determined it was a revolutionary one 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.910
 The solution that ensured a perfect combination of shock absorption is the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.460
 suspension and excellent roadholding 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.650
 In addition, the system ensures the famous variable height setting 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.420
 and it always keeps the car horizontal on the road and at a fixed distance from 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.000
 the road surface regardless of the load 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 the security of the system it was fantastic 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.610
 the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.000
 tilburg the wolf citroÃ«n ds 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.629
 this werewolf take care to a large extent for it could give an hour discount 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.050
 ds 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.900
 they are suitable for the vision 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.210
 until recently the attic vision from replacing then brown had everyone sitting 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.410
 and that comes down to bringing 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.260
 of the sector 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.450
 the lot of model in mind but came to get the banner out 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.630
 and if successful 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.250
 it is that there is a surprise 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.840
 that the denominator example of a 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.590
 the brewer completely free 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.990
 the van burr 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.340
 this shape 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 this must of course be it washed out of the whole 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.950
 blasted the yellow card with the news outside 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.980
 the bulbs brought to the print 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.980
 and that was for the vision 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.780
 what the result is not always what we expected 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.490
 an edge 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.380
 should in principle be better 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.420
 and that is also possible because an important component has been overlooked 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.189
 and then we have found a solution 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.409
 what has been overlooked 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.609
 there are relatively many small parts in the film 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.109
 so just work 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.549
 the shock absorbers research locked up in the world 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.559
 a band to get the liquid 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:25.089
 the way in which that happens ultimately determines the comfort of the car 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:30.499
 to get it out broadly 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.149
 this thread is removed 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:35.059
 the foreman can get out of there 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.479
 it is the school paler 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:38.519
 but can't 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.519
 caught caught by a fire is gone 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.509
 we found something on that 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:46.619
 bottom use 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.619
 many tree threads made as you see 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.399
 have a new school made 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:56.649
 they are not placed 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.759
 the whole is concluded with a teammate murder 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.879
 clearance as much as possible 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.879
 and the final result twitter like 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.549
