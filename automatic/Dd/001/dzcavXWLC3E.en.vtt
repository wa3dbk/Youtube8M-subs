00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 people what it's back to the start today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 I have another borderlands 2 june 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.400
 Stair money for you but before we 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.650
 I just want to start today 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.150
 giving sometimes quite tiny warnhinweis 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.889
 and there is a new one or me 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.170
 but knows as me is just past 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.670
 a bug here in this room in central 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.439
 and if I have an item here or 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.850
 A weapon drops simply sucked her 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.020
 through the floor away I'll show you this 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.080
 just a moment I have just like that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.609
 bought a card so i'm doing now 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.930
 just go away and how you see them 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.310
 weapon is now just through the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.720
 soil weg gets the weapon then too 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.949
 not again so if through the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.829
 should happen then is the only one 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.239
 possibility simply with old f4 the game 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.559
 to quit to restart because of it 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.059
 then stop not stores so that is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.129
 just as a very short warning notice 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.660
 before the video begins so please 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.250
 no more weapons drop in the rest 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 sanctuary it should go so at least 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.360
 it still worked that way yesterday and so 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.980
 then I've got something very short and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.750
 Although for all people on playstation 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.550
 has play and doubles the weapons 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.110
 hamborn and levels want to be and 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.640
 Although I have a very loyal abonnent 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.510
 who followed me for a very long time and the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.629
 me always very nice comments 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.370
 writes sometimes quite large announces gave me 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.780
 written that if I want to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.030
 Just mention it in my video 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.619
 may he play on classic and you 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.260
 would double and also level 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.689
 his name would be his psn 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.189
 the crew 2500 for all who do not know 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.830
 I write how this is written 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.270
 just once in the comments 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.770
 and thank you so much that you do not 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.780
 So offered I said yes I play 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.100
 also pc and again clearly have that 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.680
 I've said that a few times but me 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.060
 just do not just nobody because it 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.500
 just too much is that is a mega 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.670
 time consuming and so much time I have 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.430
 Just not and I have meanwhile 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.509
 also a little bit more than before and me 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.920
 just do not pack that I can people 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.000
 do not live so I just have that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.850
 I do not know time I'm sorry too 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.320
 but it's just that way, but no matter now 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.869
 me just to myself but here today 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.270
 the unique pocket rocket from the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.040
 mister talks companion of carnage dlc 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.750
 it was relatively easy to get 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.280
 and relatively cool I find them 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.490
 Menorca pretty cool wise one 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.450
 alternative to 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.229
 Herald is easy because she has one 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.670
 pretty good explosive pistol is the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.490
 Also very good with the whole picture 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.740
 works so she has a reason 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.479
 Damage of 710,000 again 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.069
 is extremely high for a pistol again 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.950
 Extremely high accuracy 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.030
 89.3 is also a pistol 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.129
 Almost exactly that, especially from 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.840
 detroit pistons looking at the harrell 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.870
 now only thinks a lot lower 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.879
 Accuracy and the celebration raid is 20 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.120
 I also can not do that a piste 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:27.750
 Charging speed 2 817 is pretty 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.010
 good and yes the smart i have now 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.170
 rather the weapon no free fix yes 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.970
 yet another rocket with a free 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.950
 fix the belief i raised the celebration raid 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.450
 but it does not matter if you do not have any fixes 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.829
 is not too bad 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.690
 just cool off the weapon too 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.980
 and of course I'll show you right away 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.950
 the charm and how to get that but 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.069
 first here to the red text you have 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.930
 ever thought the text increased so far 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.819
 I know the magazine size and the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.920
 weapon damage red texts always work 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.269
 anything unless is so is the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.310
 I always rock at the pocket 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.720
 you have two different and yes 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.130
 Of course, first of all the damage 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.170
 an unkempt dummy 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.790
 so yes and what the red text also 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.870
 make that splash damage has so 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.819
 if you shoot next makes the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.560
 still two million damage like that 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.019
 now first on the upper body makes 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.730
 her a damage of about 35 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.880
 million and in critical hit 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.209
 range 78 million if you are the enemy 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.919
 now if you have an opponent however 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.540
 beats then you have a critical one 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.579
 strike area of a fundamentally harm 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.200
 So not critical of about 11 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.450
 million and in critical hit 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.220
 range of 24 million German already 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.900
 really very good damage 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.609
 quite open with two pocket rockets looks 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.109
 the whole but also extremely cool and 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.950
 However, I find now actually 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.660
 Pretty cool 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.250
 First , of course, they are cool and 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.310
 second, the harm is really real 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.750
 extremely high and yes so much and now 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.750
 I'll just show you the weapons 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.360
 gets 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.700
 so and the whole extremely easy you 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.440
 you just have to do just one 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.120
 Talk about vending machines in any bar 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.310
 or to any place in the dlc 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.220
 I recommend the Bergers Creator bar 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.450
 or the game , because you just because 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.010
 pretty short run away has like 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.990
 actually with most machines and 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.730
 yes, I'll just thank you 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.860
 the normal offer you will find then 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.820
 such as an explicit one here 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.890
 pocket rocket you can then 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.020
 easy for about 55 talk talk 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.580
 buy it really no big deal 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.140
 So there's not always that 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.579
 offered but quite often so 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.900
 every second or third time should 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.700
 actually one so be there 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.169
 really extremely easy to get and 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.460
 Also a pretty cool weapon for that 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.320
 and that's why it's so much 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.460
 Recommended and yes I hope so 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.480
 like you always liked or video 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.890
 helped 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.240
 if so, that's just one 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.320
 rating or an abo or net 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.310
 I would comment as always 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.600
 extremely happy about it 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.070
 and yes then I want to say people 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.270
 their skin is pure we look at each other 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.270
 fall bye next time
