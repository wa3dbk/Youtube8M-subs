00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
any movement doesn't seem to work so

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.240 
any movement doesn't seem to work so
that's<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.189> bit<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:33.530> fault<00:00:34.530> i<00:00:34.680> reckon<00:00:34.980> because

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
that's a bit of a fault i reckon because

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.040 
that's a bit of a fault i reckon because
it's<00:00:35.370> good<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:36.059> able<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.510> identify<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it's good to be able to identify the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.639 
it's good to be able to identify the
files<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.710> your<00:00:37.860> side<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:39.090> anyway<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.469> could

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
files on your side so anyway you could

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.380 
files on your side so anyway you could
sort<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.070> find<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> road<00:00:41.610> file<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> drag<00:00:42.210> it

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
sort of find the road file and drag it

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.729 
sort of find the road file and drag it
in<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> desktop<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.559> really

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
in from the desktop but it's not really

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.100 
in from the desktop but it's not really
worth<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.820> change<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.360> size<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
worth it you can change the size here to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.900 
worth it you can change the size here to
a<00:00:46.140> pixel<00:00:46.590> width<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.219> need<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> particular

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
a pixel width if you need a particular

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.819 
a pixel width if you need a particular
pixel<00:00:48.120> width<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.680> don't

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
pixel width now do you know you don't

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.220 
pixel width now do you know you don't
but<00:00:50.070> there<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.199> is

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
but there is one that you do and that is

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.180 
but there is one that you do and that is
when<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.129> put<00:00:53.309> an<00:00:53.430> icon<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.360> your<00:00:54.420> podcast<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
when you put an icon on your podcast it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.970 
when you put an icon on your podcast it
has<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.850> measure<00:00:57.090> through<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.230> are<00:00:58.320> 300<00:00:58.829> by

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
has to measure through there are 300 by

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.450 
has to measure through there are 300 by
300<00:00:59.570> otherwise<00:01:00.570> they<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.440> need<00:01:01.829> falls<00:01:02.070> apart

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
300 otherwise they just need falls apart

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.280 
300 otherwise they just need falls apart
when<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> goes<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:04.339> iTunes<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.880> 300<00:01:06.390> by<00:01:06.510> 300<00:01:06.840> or

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
when it goes to iTunes so 300 by 300 or

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.950 
when it goes to iTunes so 300 by 300 or
or<00:01:07.560> larger<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.400> sees<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.150> 300<00:01:09.540> by<00:01:09.659> 300

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
or larger it sees but I think 300 by 300

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.399 
or larger it sees but I think 300 by 300
is<00:01:10.290> wedged<00:01:10.530> go<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
is wedged go and so when you do that

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.770 
is wedged go and so when you do that
just<00:01:13.770> remember<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.090> constrain<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
just remember that you can constrain the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.690 
just remember that you can constrain the
proportions<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.860> change<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.340> means

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
proportions so you can change that means

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
proportions so you can change that means
that<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.180> change<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.810> say<00:01:18.990> 500<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that you can change that to say 500 and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.950 
that you can change that to say 500 and
when<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.729> press<00:01:21.090> ENTER<00:01:21.509> cuz<00:01:21.750> it's

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
when you press ENTER cuz it's

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.260 
when you press ENTER cuz it's
constrained<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.070> proportions<00:01:23.880> will<00:01:24.060> stay

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
constrained the proportions will stay

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.649 
constrained the proportions will stay
the<00:01:24.450> same<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.720> he<00:01:25.049> look<00:01:25.350> much<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.619> same

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
the same and he look much the same

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.289 
the same and he look much the same
anyway<00:01:27.659> we'll<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:27.930> back<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.350> 300<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
anyway we'll go back to 300 and the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.630 
anyway we'll go back to 300 and the
proportions<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:30.930> paid<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.140> same<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:32.460> can

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
proportions are paid the same you can

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.850 
proportions are paid the same you can
click<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> its<00:01:33.780> original<00:01:33.840> size<00:01:34.409> which<00:01:34.829> is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
click it to its original size which is

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.050 
click it to its original size which is
enormous<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:36.030> don't<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:38.420> the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
enormous and we don't want that so the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.990 
enormous and we don't want that so the
command<00:01:42.060> Z<00:01:42.390> which<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.159> returning

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
command Z which is the one for returning

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.660 
command Z which is the one for returning
it<00:01:45.180> back<00:01:45.210> which<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.750> very<00:01:46.079> useful<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.950> might<00:01:47.280> say

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it back which is very useful I might say

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.249 
it back which is very useful I might say
and<00:01:48.030> edit<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:50.780> under<00:01:51.780> command

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and edit I think it is under command

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.850 
and edit I think it is under command
said<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.100> add<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.579> undo<00:01:54.530> multiple<00:01:55.530> actions

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
said you add can undo multiple actions

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.980 
said you add can undo multiple actions
in<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.479> back<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:57.840> some

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
in this you can go back with some

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.990 
in this you can go back with some
backwards<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.439> packets<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.860> backwards<00:01:59.250> so

as long as you haven't quit out of the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
program you can go back to what you were

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.790 
program you can go back to what you were
doing<00:02:05.549> now

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.350 

we<00:02:09.800> have<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> go<00:02:10.069> from<00:02:10.250> here<00:02:10.550> what<00:02:11.060> are<00:02:11.120> we<00:02:11.209> going

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
we have a go from here what are we going

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.390 
we have a go from here what are we going
to<00:02:11.450> do<00:02:11.569> well<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.910> can<00:02:14.060> position<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:15.129> in<00:02:16.129> very

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
to do well you can position it in very

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.059 
to do well you can position it in very
specific<00:02:16.550> locations<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:17.660> I've<00:02:18.470> never<00:02:18.830> used

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
specific locations but I've never used

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.949 
specific locations but I've never used
at<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.610> always<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:20.000> drag<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.450> do<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.810> by

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
at I always just drag it and do it by

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.320 
at I always just drag it and do it by
eyesight<00:02:21.410> but<00:02:22.310> nice<00:02:22.519> thing<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.819> can<00:02:22.970> do<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.209> to

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
eyesight but nice thing you can do is to

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.170 
eyesight but nice thing you can do is to
rotate<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.989> slightly<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.860> for<00:02:25.580> instance<00:02:25.610> now

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
rotate it slightly so for instance now

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.400 
rotate it slightly so for instance now
he's<00:02:26.420> rotated<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.610> he's<00:02:29.209> his<00:02:29.480> image<00:02:30.019> here

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
he's rotated and so he's his image here

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.650 
he's rotated and so he's his image here
get<00:02:31.069> rid<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.370> arrow<00:02:31.640> that's<00:02:32.450> pretty

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
get rid of this arrow that's pretty

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.220 
get rid of this arrow that's pretty
garish<00:02:33.910> I'm<00:02:34.910> not<00:02:35.120> very<00:02:35.299> good<00:02:35.390> at<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.690> sign<00:02:35.930> by

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
garish I'm not very good at the sign by

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.680 
garish I'm not very good at the sign by
the<00:02:36.290> way<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.370> which<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.150> will<00:02:38.239> notice<00:02:38.420> when

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
the way so which you will notice when

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.050 
the way so which you will notice when
you<00:02:38.780> go<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.959> my<00:02:39.170> side<00:02:39.760> what<00:02:40.760> you've<00:02:40.940> already

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
you go to my side what you've already

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.069 
you go to my side what you've already
been<00:02:41.269> there<00:02:41.329> because<00:02:41.599> you<00:02:41.660> looking<00:02:41.870> at<00:02:41.959> this

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
been there because you looking at this

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.979 
been there because you looking at this
so<00:02:42.950> I'm<00:02:43.430> crap<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.000> design<00:02:44.329> so<00:02:44.660> I'm<00:02:44.780> sorry

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
so I'm crap and design so I'm sorry

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.130 
so I'm crap and design so I'm sorry
about<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.230> but<00:02:45.650> anyway<00:02:46.610> if<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.569> want<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.959> and

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
about that but anyway if you want to and

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.660 
about that but anyway if you want to and
you<00:02:48.170> want<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.470> rotate<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.069> bit<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.400> reckon

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
you want to rotate it a bit I reckon

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.430 
you want to rotate it a bit I reckon
that's<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.150> quite<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.720> nice<00:02:50.959> thing<00:02:51.200> today

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
that's so quite a nice thing today

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.319 
that's so quite a nice thing today
rotated<00:02:52.010> even<00:02:52.250> just<00:02:52.430> marginally<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.150> make

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
rotated even just marginally to make

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.270 
rotated even just marginally to make
things<00:02:53.540> look<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.810> bit<00:02:53.959> better<00:02:54.170> another<00:02:55.069> thing

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
things look a bit better another thing

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.650 
things look a bit better another thing
you<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.489> do<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.910> hold<00:02:56.060> down<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.510> command

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
you can do is to hold down the command

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.580 
you can do is to hold down the command
key<00:02:57.849> while<00:02:58.849> you're<00:02:59.209> doing<00:03:00.049> it<00:03:00.200> which<00:03:00.379> is<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
key while you're doing it which is the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.400 
key while you're doing it which is the
flower<00:03:00.829> key<00:03:01.190> go<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.090> one<00:03:02.329> of<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.540> corners<00:03:03.110> and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
flower key go to one of the corners and

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.500 
flower key go to one of the corners and
you<00:03:03.829> can<00:03:04.010> rotate<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.700> like<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:05.090> does<00:03:05.360> the

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
you can rotate it like that does the

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.869 
you can rotate it like that does the
same<00:03:05.750> thing<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.920> way<00:03:07.069> you<00:03:07.129> can<00:03:07.310> kind<00:03:07.579> of<00:03:07.700> see

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
same thing that way you can kind of see

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.729 
same thing that way you can kind of see
what<00:03:08.120> what<00:03:08.599> you're<00:03:08.750> doing<00:03:08.959> either<00:03:09.260> way<00:03:09.410> works

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
what what you're doing either way works

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.589 
what what you're doing either way works
really<00:03:10.040> well<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.640> that's<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:11.060> really<00:03:11.329> common

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
really well and that's a really common

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.720 
really well and that's a really common
thing<00:03:12.109> throughout<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.889> graphics<00:03:13.220> programs

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
thing throughout the graphics programs

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.150 
thing throughout the graphics programs
on<00:03:13.940> max<00:03:14.239> as<00:03:14.540> well<00:03:14.799> one<00:03:15.799> of<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:15.980> great

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
on max as well one of the great

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.860 
on max as well one of the great
advantages<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.790> max<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.540> they<00:03:17.690> keep

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
advantages of max is that they keep

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.890 
advantages of max is that they keep
things<00:03:18.319> common<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:19.370> can<00:03:19.549> flip<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.180> completely

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
things common you can flip it completely

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.449 
things common you can flip it completely
so<00:03:21.260> he's<00:03:21.470> now<00:03:21.680> facing<00:03:21.889> the<00:03:22.190> opposite

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
so he's now facing the opposite

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.660 
so he's now facing the opposite
direction<00:03:22.519> you<00:03:23.120> can<00:03:23.269> turn<00:03:23.510> him<00:03:23.660> upside<00:03:23.750> down

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
direction you can turn him upside down

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.920 
direction you can turn him upside down

way so and once again you can do the
