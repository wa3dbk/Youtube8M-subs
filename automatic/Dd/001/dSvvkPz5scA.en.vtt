found them in cognac color because

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.910 
found them in cognac color because
that's<00:00:59.659> what<00:00:59.780> I<00:00:59.809> wanted<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:00.619> I<00:01:00.680> wanted

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
so these have a different feel like the

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.179 
so these have a different feel like the
outside<00:01:05.510> but<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.110> inside<00:01:06.530> is<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.830> actual

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
outside but the inside is the actual

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.010 
outside but the inside is the actual
center<00:01:07.520> that<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:07.820> sent<00:01:08.090> us<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.540> then<00:01:08.930> they

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
center that you sent us and then they

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.530 
center that you sent us and then they
have<00:01:09.200> two<00:01:09.409> buckles<00:01:09.860> on<00:01:10.070> them<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:13.270> so<00:01:14.270> I<00:01:14.299> just

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
have two buckles on them and so I just

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.420 
have two buckles on them and so I just
have<00:01:14.750> one<00:01:14.900> my<00:01:15.110> ever<00:01:15.290> comes<00:01:15.619> unless<00:01:15.890> warmers

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
have one my ever comes unless warmers

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.070

them back out and like a spring version
with<00:01:46.010> different<00:01:46.340> colors<00:01:46.640> but<00:01:46.909> this<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.540> just<00:01:47.720> a

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
with different colors but this is just a

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.570 
with different colors but this is just a
burgundy<00:01:48.350> color<00:01:48.380> they're<00:01:48.740> super<00:01:49.100> soft<00:01:49.280> and

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
stretchy and I would recommend going

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.620 
stretchy and I would recommend going
down<00:01:51.440> this<00:01:51.590> size<00:01:51.800> because<00:01:52.550> they<00:01:53.090> tend<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.420> like

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
down this size because they tend to like

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.060 
down this size because they tend to like
they<00:01:53.840> don't<00:01:53.990> hold<00:01:54.080> their<00:01:54.229> shape<00:01:54.260> very<00:01:54.710> well<00:01:54.920> so
