00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
review of the Tresemme simply no frizz

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.820 
review of the Tresemme simply no frizz
spray<00:00:06.990> gel<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:08.240> I<00:00:09.240> guess<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.139> know<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.500> in

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
spray gel and I guess you know that in

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.860 
spray gel and I guess you know that in
and<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.040> itself<00:00:11.190> should<00:00:11.580> indicate<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.540> is

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
and of itself should indicate that it is

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.930 
and of itself should indicate that it is
not<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.320> same<00:00:13.500> thing<00:00:13.559> as<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.460> heat<00:00:14.730> tamer

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
not the same thing as the heat tamer

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.630 
not the same thing as the heat tamer
spray<00:00:15.299> but<00:00:15.870> after<00:00:16.170> using<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.949> for<00:00:17.190> years<00:00:17.369> I

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
spray but after using this for years I

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.880 
spray but after using this for years I
kind<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> expected<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.750> be<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> first

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
kind of expected this to be so the first

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.609 
kind of expected this to be so the first
time<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.220> used<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.480> right<00:00:21.750> after<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
time I used this was like right after I

clearance for like two dollars so um I
got<00:00:26.849> home<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.779> sprayed<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.289> into

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470

my hair and like on the first two sprays
I<00:00:30.660> was<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.869> oops<00:00:31.369> it<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.880> gel<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.320> not

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
I was like oops it is a gel so it's not

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.760 
I was like oops it is a gel so it's not
like<00:00:35.309> for<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.090> think<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.780> lot<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.110> people<00:00:37.260> have

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
like for I think a lot of people have

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.410 
like for I think a lot of people have
tried<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.430> I'm<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.820> use<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.149> kind

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
tried this so I'm going to use this kind

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.180 
tried this so I'm going to use this kind
of<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.690> comparison<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.290> texture<00:00:40.590> this

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
of as a comparison of the texture this

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.299 
of as a comparison of the texture this
is<00:00:41.489> pretty<00:00:42.480> much<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> texture<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.410> water<00:00:43.950> I

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
is pretty much the texture of water I

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.700 
is pretty much the texture of water I
mean<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.940> consistency<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.989> that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
mean it's that consistency it's that

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.510 
mean it's that consistency it's that
viscosity<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.610> know<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.840> water

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
viscosity you know it's it's water

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.459 
viscosity you know it's it's water
consistently<00:00:50.520> basically<00:00:51.260> consistency<00:00:52.260> i

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
consistently basically consistency i

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.340 
consistently basically consistency i
think<00:00:52.739> i<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:52.829> said<00:00:53.070> consistently<00:00:53.430> um<00:00:54.350> this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
think i just said consistently um this

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.619 
think i just said consistently um this
is<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.860> somebody<00:00:56.190> took<00:00:56.430> hair<00:00:56.820> gel<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.420> kind

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
is like somebody took hair gel and kind

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.180 
is like somebody took hair gel and kind
of<00:00:57.690> watered<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.199> down<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.530> put<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> spray

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
of watered it down and put it in a spray

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.740 
of watered it down and put it in a spray
bottle<00:00:59.510> it<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.690> definitely<00:01:00.899> thicker<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.890> is

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
bottle it is definitely thicker it is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.460 
bottle it is definitely thicker it is
here<00:01:03.750> let<00:01:03.899> me<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.170> spray<00:01:04.409> some<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.710> my<00:01:04.799> hand

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that but obviously you know if this were

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.330 
that but obviously you know if this were
a<00:01:12.119> water<00:01:12.390> consistency<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.439> would<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.740> be

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
a water consistency it would just be

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.920 
a water consistency it would just be
sliding<00:01:14.760> off<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:14.880> hand<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.450> now<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> need<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.900> to

something<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:37.680> four<00:03:38.040> dollars<00:03:38.430> on<00:03:38.700> like<00:03:39.510> all

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
that it's definitely a very good price I

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.090 
that it's definitely a very good price I
mean<00:05:29.970> this<00:05:30.450> is<00:05:30.660> not<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:30.840> small<00:05:31.320> bottle<00:05:31.800> at<00:05:31.950> all

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
mean this is not a small bottle at all

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.700 
mean this is not a small bottle at all
and<00:05:32.460> you<00:05:32.970> do<00:05:33.150> not<00:05:33.270> use<00:05:33.630> very<00:05:33.900> much<00:05:34.140> of<00:05:34.320> it<00:05:34.440> once

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
and you do not use very much of it once

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.750 
and you do not use very much of it once
again<00:05:35.070> um<00:05:36.170> just<00:05:37.170> one<00:05:37.500> or<00:05:37.620> two<00:05:37.650> sprays<00:05:38.130> unless

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
again um just one or two sprays unless

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.250 
again um just one or two sprays unless
your<00:05:38.940> hair<00:05:39.120> is<00:05:39.210> really<00:05:39.390> long<00:05:39.510> or<00:05:40.050> if<00:05:40.140> it's

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
your hair is really long or if it's

your hair is really long or if it's
really<00:05:40.470> short<00:05:40.770> you<00:05:41.280> might<00:05:41.460> not<00:05:41.580> even<00:05:41.640> need
