plug<00:04:37.450> on<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.930> elgato<00:04:38.410> so<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:38.920> didn't<00:04:39.160> work

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
plug on the elgato so it didn't work

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.670 
plug on the elgato so it didn't work
anymore<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:39.790> had<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.030> order<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.300> new<00:04:40.540> one

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.460 
anymore and I had to order a new one
then<00:04:41.680> two<00:04:42.010> days<00:04:42.490> later<00:04:42.550> I<00:04:43.180> did<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.840> exact<00:04:44.350> same

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
then two days later I did the exact same

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
then two days later I did the exact same
thing<00:04:44.920> to<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.190> new<00:04:45.340> one<00:04:46.620> my<00:04:47.620> clumsy<00:04:48.100> vote<00:04:48.250> over

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
thing to the new one my clumsy vote over

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.780 
thing to the new one my clumsy vote over
here<00:04:48.640> but<00:04:48.850> um<00:04:49.410> luckily<00:04:50.410> this<00:04:50.680> time<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:51.250> worked

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
here but um luckily this time it worked

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.180 
here but um luckily this time it worked
but<00:04:52.180> I<00:04:52.240> had<00:04:52.510> to<00:04:52.690> stick<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.320> cable<00:04:53.680> in<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.010> set

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
but I had to stick the cable in and set

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.800 
but I had to stick the cable in and set
a<00:04:54.220> little<00:04:54.490> weight<00:04:54.700> on<00:04:54.730> top<00:04:54.940> of<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.390> so<00:04:55.540> it<00:04:55.660> had

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
a little weight on top of it so it had

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.540 
a little weight on top of it so it had
pressure<00:04:56.140> in<00:04:56.410> just<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.740> right<00:04:56.770> direction<00:04:57.070> but

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
pressure in just the right direction but

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.860 
pressure in just the right direction but
it<00:04:58.030> worked<00:04:58.210> one<00:04:58.330> hundred<00:04:58.540> percent<00:04:58.570> of<00:04:58.810> the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
it worked one hundred percent of the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.870 
it worked one hundred percent of the
time<00:04:58.930> but<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.620> couple<00:05:00.040> days<00:05:00.190> before<00:05:00.580> I<00:05:00.610> moved

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
time but a couple days before I moved

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.030 
time but a couple days before I moved
out<00:05:01.120> I<00:05:01.420> was<00:05:01.840> trying<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.140> record<00:05:02.440> something<00:05:02.740> and

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
out I was trying to record something and

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.620 
out I was trying to record something and
it<00:05:03.760> wasn't<00:05:04.390> working<00:05:04.810> reliably<00:05:05.530> like<00:05:06.450> it<00:05:07.450> would

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
it wasn't working reliably like it would

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.330 
it wasn't working reliably like it would
record<00:05:07.990> for<00:05:08.260> a<00:05:08.290> good<00:05:08.410> 10<00:05:08.650> minutes<00:05:08.680> then<00:05:09.100> all<00:05:09.310> of

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
record for a good 10 minutes then all of

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.040 
record for a good 10 minutes then all of
a<00:05:09.460> sudden<00:05:09.490> just<00:05:09.760> disconnect<00:05:10.420> even<00:05:10.690> if<00:05:10.780> i<00:05:10.870> use

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
a sudden just disconnect even if i use

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.020 
a sudden just disconnect even if i use
the<00:05:11.200> setup<00:05:11.500> that<00:05:11.650> worked<00:05:11.920> on<00:05:12.010> it<00:05:12.190> for<00:05:12.340> so<00:05:12.910> many

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
the setup that worked on it for so many

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.480 
the setup that worked on it for so many
months<00:05:13.210> beforehand<00:05:13.840> so<00:05:13.960> i'm<00:05:14.380> not<00:05:15.100> entirely

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
months beforehand so i'm not entirely

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.370 
months beforehand so i'm not entirely
sure<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:16.030> status<00:05:16.360> of<00:05:16.450> that<00:05:16.600> i<00:05:16.660> haven't<00:05:17.050> really

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
sure the status of that i haven't really

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.710 
sure the status of that i haven't really
tried<00:05:17.590> using<00:05:17.830> it<00:05:18.070> since<00:05:18.220> i<00:05:18.370> got<00:05:18.520> here<00:05:18.820> so<00:05:19.690> i

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
tried using it since i got here so i

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.600 
tried using it since i got here so i
might<00:05:20.320> have<00:05:20.560> to<00:05:20.680> order<00:05:20.830> a<00:05:20.950> new<00:05:21.040> one<00:05:21.190> of<00:05:21.460> those

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
might have to order a new one of those

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.130 
might have to order a new one of those
so<00:05:21.820> there<00:05:21.970> might<00:05:22.120> be<00:05:22.180> another<00:05:22.570> couple<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.080> days

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
so there might be another couple of days

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.580 
so there might be another couple of days
between<00:05:23.940> this<00:05:24.940> video<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.660> when<00:05:26.110> Let's<00:05:26.350> Plays
