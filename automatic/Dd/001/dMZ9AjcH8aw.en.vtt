confused about how to do the trick I

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.680 
confused about how to do the trick I
decided<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.560> make<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> tutorial<00:00:05.339> top<00:00:05.970> two

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
decided to make a tutorial top two

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.270 
decided to make a tutorial top two
incredibly<00:00:07.080> difficult<00:00:07.290> it's<00:00:08.040> actually

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
incredibly difficult it's actually

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.690 
incredibly difficult it's actually
really<00:00:08.519> simple<00:00:08.760> all<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.360> need<00:00:09.389> our<00:00:09.690> cards<00:00:10.700> um

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
really simple all you need our cards um

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.379 
really simple all you need our cards um
a<00:00:11.759> quick<00:00:12.540> setup<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.139> that's<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.299> what<00:00:15.299> you

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
a quick setup and that's it so what you

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.230 
a quick setup and that's it so what you
do<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:16.830> let's<00:00:17.160> say<00:00:17.340> her<00:00:17.640> cards<00:00:17.970> gonna<00:00:18.119> be

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
do is so let's say her cards gonna be

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.679 
do is so let's say her cards gonna be
the<00:00:18.630> three<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.960> hearts<00:00:19.160> and<00:00:20.390> then<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.510> need

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
the three of hearts and then you need

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.390 
the three of hearts and then you need
two<00:00:21.840> identical<00:00:22.380> cards<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.039> you're<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.340> to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
two identical cards so you're going to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.880 
two identical cards so you're going to
need<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.640> set<00:00:23.939> up<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> second<00:00:24.420> deck<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.680> take

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
need to set up a second deck and to take

like one of the cards from that deck I'm

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.750 
like one of the cards from that deck I'm
using<00:00:28.230> two<00:00:28.470> jokers<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> know<00:00:29.519> they're

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
using two jokers that I know they're

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.950 
using two jokers that I know they're
different<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.420> I'm<00:00:30.769> I<00:00:31.940> don't<00:00:32.940> always<00:00:33.059> second

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
different but I'm I don't always second

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.020 
different but I'm I don't always second
deck<00:00:34.079> right<00:00:34.260> now<00:00:34.320> I'm<00:00:34.680> showing<00:00:35.489> how<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.820> do

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
deck right now I'm showing how to do

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.780 
deck right now I'm showing how to do
this<00:00:36.270> um<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.190> pretend<00:00:38.579> they're<00:00:38.670> both

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
this um so pretend they're both

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.369 
this um so pretend they're both
identical<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.420> they're<00:00:39.570> book<00:00:39.719> blank<00:00:40.110> right

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
identical and they're book blank right

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.160 
identical and they're book blank right
so<00:00:41.390> first<00:00:42.390> thing<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> want<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so first thing you do is you want to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.110 
so first thing you do is you want to
sign<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.739> them<00:00:43.890> pre<00:00:44.309> sign<00:00:44.520> them<00:00:44.760> with<00:00:44.969> your

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120

sign one of them pre sign them with your
name<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.399> then<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.760> how<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.879> set<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
name and then this is how you set up the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.229 
name and then this is how you set up the
deck<00:00:48.450> her<00:00:49.170> card<00:00:49.640> your<00:00:50.640> card<00:00:50.879> that's<00:00:51.120> already

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
deck her card your card that's already

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.990 
deck her card your card that's already

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
signed behind it you both closing will

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.180 
signed behind it you both closing will
face<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.719> face<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.289> down<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
face up and then face it down is the

how<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.780> double<00:01:19.020> lifts<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.100> too

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
how to do double lifts it's not too

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.980 
how to do double lifts it's not too
terribly<00:01:20.790> difficult<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.270> over<00:01:21.570> practice

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
terribly difficult with over practice

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.020 
terribly difficult with over practice
but<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.350> basically<00:01:22.650> taking<00:01:23.400> two<00:01:23.640> cards

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
but it's basically taking two cards

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.719 
but it's basically taking two cards
itself<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.100> flipping<00:01:26.100> them<00:01:26.250> over<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
itself and flipping them over and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.870 
itself and flipping them over and
pretending<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.659> card<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:29.340> click

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
pretending it's one card so just click

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.600 
pretending it's one card so just click
double<00:01:30.240> lift<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.170> she<00:01:31.229> now<00:01:31.650> thinks<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
double lift and so she now thinks that

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.289 
double lift and so she now thinks that
this<00:01:33.450> card<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.970> you've<00:01:36.090> signed

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
this card the one that you've signed

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.690 
this card the one that you've signed
already<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.930> her<00:01:37.200> card<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.159> we're<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.579> do

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
already is her card so we're going to do

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.249 
already is her card so we're going to do
is<00:01:38.850> anything<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.210> okay<00:01:39.509> well<00:01:39.869> now<00:01:40.020> I'm<00:01:40.110> gonna

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
is anything like okay well now I'm gonna

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.260 
is anything like okay well now I'm gonna
just<00:01:40.890> take<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.189> card<00:01:41.430> I'm<00:01:41.549> gonna<00:01:41.700> fold<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.090> so

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
just take this card I'm gonna fold it so

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
you fold it tight like this and then

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.440 
you fold it tight like this and then
once<00:01:44.939> more

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
once more

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.330 
once more
