00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:32.359
 buds 66 on this side I have to be 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:34.310
 doing egg tasks battisti fast 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.200
 and Matthew sagasta we see go here 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.170
 yolks and by tula beat the egg whites 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.739
 entity not be 100 grams of sugar 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.959
 although webber approximately 50 grams 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:50.480
 in the yolks and 50 in these clear well h 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.400
 remember remember to start doing the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.909
 buds and first beat the yolks and 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.909
 after 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.069
 has been discussed the gems now you what 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.569
 I'm going to show I started to beat the egg whites 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.060
 parties 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.829
 you are not going to happen if you are late will 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.829
 take longer to lift dinners 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.920
 after having good well 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.030
 vanish and shake this you will mix 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.870
 with chocolate butter and flour 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.870
 in a little while 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.810
 with 50 grams 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.810
 in a bowl and on the other hand 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.190
 with the rest of 50 grams that appeared 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.190
 the preparation of the wide 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.350
 I think we make vanilla 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.650
 the difference 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.540
 beyond with the 50 grams of sugar 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.970
 look how foam 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.740
 if it is approximately 8 minutes 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.740
 is going to stay this way 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:35.039
 when you have half a day 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:39.889
 of 300 grams of butter marÃ­a in the 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.889
 microwave and butter that I forgot 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.630
 so I'm not complaining 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.510
 300 grams and semi-orange with 120 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.340
 grams of butter mvia and 40 I have 40 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.230
 grams of flour very little we 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.520
 very large very pollutes 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:02.570
 we start here integrating everything I 'm going to 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.570
 sacrifice part of this 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.330
 imagine 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.530
 we have an investment is because I am 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.530
 stopping in entity 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:19.409
 the chocolate with the butter that now 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:22.289
 incorporate with wings to day 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.029
 then we continue here and now 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.360
 we incorporate if these six weeks 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:29.369
 we discussed with 50 grams of sugar that 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.099
 I'm incorporating the 300 let's see 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:34.099
 chocolate with 120 grams of butter 

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:42.389
 desired with chocolate that is not yet 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.980
 usually look and English but proceed to 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:50.760
 fill as woodland 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:53.380
 and now a little incorporating more 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.640
 exactly have a lot of preparation 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.840
 more creamy 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.840
 this is aerated 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:06.700
 the volcano that gives the pills 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.700
 chocolate 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.560
 the original that invented it 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.540
 the effect the effect goes a dessert 5 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:45.920
 with the hot fork 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.920
 combines with both 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.970
 and finally the 40 grams in it and the 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:52.970
 that I had stayed on the coasts 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.199
 totally
