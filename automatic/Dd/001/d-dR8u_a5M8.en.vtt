00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.859
 he tells us leo can speak spanish 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.570
 we were just watching the game like this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.760
 Well then we learned the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.520
 information we have talked about 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.680
 It is surely a tear and good now 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.439
 we must wait for recovery as 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.130
 like the other times and obviously not what 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.130
 you count for travel no no no 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.480
 but beyond that, it's very good 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.089
 while it is in June of the year to write 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.559
 now I say worry that the injuries 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.410
 of the finger are always in that muscle and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.050
 in that leg and I 'm not a specialist 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.449
 I always worry that you can 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.570
 pre-selection concerns when the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.730
 injuries are in the same player but not 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.640
 you have to try to be optimistic to have 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.649
 tranquility that I think that's very 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.769
 important and having to try to have 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.630
 as quiet as possible because the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.120
 pressure is always with a little bit in 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.479
 against so it does not come close to the global and 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.490
 is pressed that that anxiety you 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.979
 can 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.439
 then we will try to be optimistic and 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.960
 be calm and good we have some 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.909
 players like cited games in the case 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.430
 Nicolas had already had it in the 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.770
 start in the case of organ and roncal 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.930
 and at the first time, although at a facun 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.630
 I know from before so good 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.689
 let's hope they have their minutes because 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.509
 we have to have open the panorama by 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.580
 the doubts first for the yields and 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.649
 second so it has to do with the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.330
 question that you did before more 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.670
 I'm talking about defenders 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.250
 but we're talking about injuries and the 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.899
 injury to the shelter sometimes occur 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.280
 they arrive in the moments that 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.110
 inconveniences and you have to be 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.960
 prepared knows the assistant of 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.150
 passarella 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.540
 and I know how much they bothered him when 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.380
 they pulled players up at that time 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.380
 so 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.369
 if I had had as vision said a 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.020
 certain sense 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.360
 how 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.680
 would not have summoned two players of the 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.760
 Argentine championship are playing the 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.370
 first positions because I believe with the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.460
 300 400 players in Europe 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.850
 Argentineans can well be found 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.490
 a third 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.410
 and a player at most is very good 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.350
 but I think contacts there 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.020
 in Europe you could have left them 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.800
 here the Argentine championship no no what 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.600
 I listened to Carlos the comment he made 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.520
 I have nothing to say simply 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.620
 thank you for everything you have done for 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.480
 the Argentine soccer because it has left 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.360
 champion of america world champion us 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.150
 gives great joys to the Argentines of 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.370
 sports point of view is a teacher and 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.220
 good to thank you for what it is and so 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.590
 what he did and why he keeps doing that 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.290
 no mirror serves us all as 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.690
 it has already happened to me and good sometimes and not 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.340
 excited players because they were 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.500
 fighting the title but now they seem to me 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.080
 how good we are close to the world and 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.530
 the times are shortened but good all 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.810
 the opinions are respectable about 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.330
 all of a person like Carlos no no 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.390
 He could talk a lot because he did not 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.220
 dark that said but I repeat again is 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.760
 a person 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.920
 and he jumps is a great coach 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.850
 well mirror for many and simply 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.850
 thank you once again
