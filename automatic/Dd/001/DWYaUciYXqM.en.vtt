00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.670 

I'm<00:00:05.279> Michael<00:00:05.700> Binion<00:00:06.210> working<00:00:07.140> for<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.410> times

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
I'm Michael Binion working for the times

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.310 
I'm Michael Binion working for the times
I've<00:00:08.340> written<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.730> piece<00:00:08.910> about<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.630> possible

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
I've written a piece about the possible

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.379 
I've written a piece about the possible
railway<00:00:10.679> links<00:00:11.010> between<00:00:11.490> China<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.150> Europe

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
railway links between China and Europe

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.180 
railway links between China and Europe
of<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.320> so-called<00:00:13.559> new<00:00:14.130> Silk<00:00:14.900> Road<00:00:16.190> caravans

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
of the so-called new Silk Road caravans

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.870 
of the so-called new Silk Road caravans
laden<00:00:17.789> with<00:00:17.940> spices<00:00:18.439> precious<00:00:19.439> stones<00:00:19.880> silver

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
laden with spices precious stones silver

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880 
laden with spices precious stones silver
in<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.240> route<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.140> that's<00:00:22.350> been<00:00:22.470> there

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
in this route is one that's been there

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.500 
in this route is one that's been there
for<00:00:23.100> hundreds<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.910> years

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
for hundreds of years

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.529 
for hundreds of years
the<00:00:25.050> idea<00:00:25.410> now<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:26.340> duplicate<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.390> route

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the idea now is to duplicate the route

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.630 
the idea now is to duplicate the route
by<00:00:27.930> new<00:00:28.410> rail<00:00:28.890> lines<00:00:29.250> linking<00:00:30.230> China<00:00:31.230> with<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
by new rail lines linking China with the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.250 
by new rail lines linking China with the
Middle<00:00:32.880> East<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.300> Europe

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
Middle East and Europe

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.490 
Middle East and Europe
this<00:00:35.160> will<00:00:35.399> allow<00:00:36.059> goods<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.780> transported

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
this will allow goods to be transported

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.049 
this will allow goods to be transported
in<00:00:37.890> about<00:00:39.050> 15-20<00:00:40.050> days<00:00:40.230> instead<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.850> least

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
in about 15-20 days instead of at least

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.540 
in about 15-20 days instead of at least
a<00:00:42.390> month<00:00:42.690> which<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.129> takes

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
a month which is what it takes

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.299 
a month which is what it takes
if<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.820> send<00:00:45.120> goods<00:00:45.960> by<00:00:46.200> ship<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.190> way

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
if you send goods by ship all the way

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.240 
if you send goods by ship all the way
around<00:00:47.550> through<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> Suez<00:00:48.270> Canal<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.899> Europe

it's the trans-siberian railway it has a
little<00:00:58.710> model<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.699> given<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> me<00:01:00.180> by<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
little model that was given to me by the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
little model that was given to me by the
Russian<00:01:00.840> Railways<00:01:01.199> Minister<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> rather

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
Russian Railways Minister it's a rather

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.100 
Russian Railways Minister it's a rather
sweet<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.670> crystal<00:01:03.449> model<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.870> doesn't

sweet little crystal model it doesn't

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.800 
sweet little crystal model it doesn't
look<00:01:04.260> anything<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.830> now<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.369> course

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
look anything like that now of course

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.070 
look anything like that now of course
and<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> branch<00:01:07.700> from<00:01:08.780> ljubljana<00:01:09.780> day

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and there is a branch from ljubljana day

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
and there is a branch from ljubljana day
which<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.470> about<00:01:10.619> 2/3<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.400> way<00:01:11.520> across<00:01:11.880> to

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
which is about 2/3 of the way across to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
which is about 2/3 of the way across to
the<00:01:12.090> pacific<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.320> goes<00:01:13.500> down<00:01:13.770> through

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the pacific that goes down through

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.210 
the pacific that goes down through
mongolia<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.000> straight<00:01:15.299> into<00:01:15.479> beijing<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
mongolia and straight into beijing the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.219 
mongolia and straight into beijing the
problem<00:01:17.580> about<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.790> railway<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.049> is

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
problem about that railway is that it is

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.679 
problem about that railway is that it is
very<00:01:19.500> heavily<00:01:19.830> used<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.610> almost<00:01:21.000> full<00:01:21.450> in

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
very heavily used it's almost full in

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.380 
very heavily used it's almost full in
fact<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.200> also<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:23.369> completely<00:01:23.970> controlled

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
fact and also it's completely controlled

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.600 
fact and also it's completely controlled
by<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> Russians<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.979> Russian

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
by the Russians because it is a Russian

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.609 
by the Russians because it is a Russian
route<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.540> Chinese<00:01:27.930> are<00:01:28.170> looking<00:01:28.470> for

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
route the Chinese are looking for

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.560 
route the Chinese are looking for
something<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.430> would<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.729> an<00:01:29.850> alternative

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
something which would be an alternative

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.679 
something which would be an alternative
to<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> trans-siberian<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.400> main<00:01:33.329> aim

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
to the trans-siberian and the main aim

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.859 
to the trans-siberian and the main aim
is<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.770> rail<00:01:35.159> link<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:36.060> has<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.659> come

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
is to get a rail link that has to come

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.160 
is to get a rail link that has to come
out<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.229> Istanbul<00:01:38.119> Istanbul<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.329> only<00:01:39.990> way

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
out at Istanbul Istanbul is the only way

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.280 
out at Istanbul Istanbul is the only way
into<00:01:40.470> Europe<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.130> doesn't<00:01:41.549> pass<00:01:41.820> through

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
into Europe that doesn't pass through

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.530 
into Europe that doesn't pass through
lines<00:01:43.290> controlled<00:01:43.920> by<00:01:44.070> Russia<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.909> Turks<00:01:45.180> are

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
lines controlled by Russia the Turks are

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.660 
lines controlled by Russia the Turks are
digging<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:46.110> big<00:01:46.320> tunnel<00:01:46.619> under<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> Bosphorus

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
digging a big tunnel under the Bosphorus

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.149 
digging a big tunnel under the Bosphorus
which<00:01:48.600> should<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.960> open<00:01:49.229> next<00:01:49.380> year<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.979> so

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
which should be open next year and so

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.889 
which should be open next year and so
that<00:01:50.340> will<00:01:50.490> mean<00:01:50.640> if<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.570> rail

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
that will mean if you can get a rail

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.010 
that will mean if you can get a rail
link<00:01:52.110> into<00:01:52.590> Turkey<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.790> go<00:01:54.240> into

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
link into Turkey you can go into

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.260 
link into Turkey you can go into
Istanbul<00:01:55.530> under<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> Bosphorus<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.700> you're

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
Istanbul under the Bosphorus and you're

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.499 
Istanbul under the Bosphorus and you're
already<00:01:57.540> then<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.680> main<00:01:59.250> European<00:01:59.759> rail

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
already then in the main European rail

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
already then in the main European rail
network<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.590> take<00:02:01.740> your<00:02:01.920> goods

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
network and then you can take your goods

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.499 
network and then you can take your goods
to<00:02:02.610> wherever<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.060> want

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
to wherever you want

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.289 
to wherever you want
of<00:02:04.200> course<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.619> problems<00:02:05.040> are<00:02:05.299> firstly

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
of course the problems are firstly

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.960 
of course the problems are firstly
technical<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.590> main<00:02:07.770> difficulty<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.940> that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
technical the main difficulty is that

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.530

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
the broader gauge so if you're running a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.180 
the broader gauge so if you're running a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
down to Turkey then you have to actually

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.400 
down to Turkey then you have to actually

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
where the two gauges meet and you have

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.150 
where the two gauges meet and you have
to<00:02:56.140> have<00:02:56.290> cranes<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.890> can<00:02:57.190> translate<00:02:58.140> cargo

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160

across<00:04:15.670> there<00:04:15.940> that<00:04:16.239> Cossacks<00:04:16.750> are<00:04:16.959> thinking

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
across there that Cossacks are thinking

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.229 
across there that Cossacks are thinking
of<00:04:17.410> building<00:04:17.830> another<00:04:18.100> one<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.060> would

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
of building another one so you would

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.630 
of building another one so you would
have<00:04:19.390> two<00:04:19.660> links<00:04:20.019> into<00:04:20.440> their<00:04:20.650> system<00:04:21.100> which

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
have two links into their system which

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.540 
have two links into their system which
again<00:04:21.940> is<00:04:22.240> now<00:04:22.630> broad-gauge<00:04:23.410> it's<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.190> Soviet

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
again is now broad-gauge it's the Soviet

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.310 
again is now broad-gauge it's the Soviet
gauge<00:04:24.789> and<00:04:25.090> here<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:25.539> would<00:04:25.630> come<00:04:25.870> all<00:04:26.110> the

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
way around you can see

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.280 
way around you can see
this<00:04:27.280> black<00:04:27.550> line<00:04:27.580> sort<00:04:28.210> of<00:04:28.330> weaving<00:04:29.170> around

close<00:04:42.460> link<00:04:43.240> with<00:04:43.690> Iran<00:04:44.430> now<00:04:45.430> there<00:04:45.670> are<00:04:45.730> two

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
close link with Iran now there are two

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.220 
close link with Iran now there are two
ways<00:04:46.120> now<00:04:46.450> of<00:04:46.630> going<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:46.960> wouldn't<00:04:47.170> either

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
ways now of going you wouldn't either

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.530 
ways now of going you wouldn't either
continue<00:04:47.950> all<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.250> way<00:04:48.340> over<00:04:48.640> to<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:48.970> port<00:04:49.270> on

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
continue all the way over to the port on

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.650 
continue all the way over to the port on
the<00:04:50.110> Caspian<00:04:50.620> Sea<00:04:50.760> then<00:04:51.760> a<00:04:52.030> train<00:04:52.420> would<00:04:52.600> have

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
the Caspian Sea then a train would have

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.140 
the Caspian Sea then a train would have
to<00:04:52.930> be<00:04:53.050> put<00:04:53.260> on<00:04:53.290> a<00:04:53.410> ferry<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:53.980> go<00:04:54.220> across<00:04:54.730> to

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
to be put on a ferry and go across to

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.490 
to be put on a ferry and go across to
Azerbaijan<00:04:56.280> just<00:04:57.480> port<00:04:58.480> somewhere<00:04:58.810> near<00:04:59.080> Baku

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
Azerbaijan just port somewhere near Baku

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.280 
Azerbaijan just port somewhere near Baku
and<00:04:59.770> then<00:05:00.640> there<00:05:00.850> is<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.060> line<00:05:01.390> existing

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
and then there is a line existing

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.170 
and then there is a line existing
through<00:05:02.650> these<00:05:02.890> mountainous<00:05:03.610> Republic's

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
through these mountainous Republic's

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.410 
through these mountainous Republic's
we've<00:05:04.360> got<00:05:04.540> Georgia<00:05:05.430> Armenia<00:05:06.430> Azerbaijan

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
we've got Georgia Armenia Azerbaijan

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.480 
we've got Georgia Armenia Azerbaijan
the<00:05:07.600> problem<00:05:07.930> is<00:05:08.050> Armenia<00:05:08.800> this<00:05:08.980> tiny<00:05:09.280> little

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
the problem is Armenia this tiny little

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.910 
the problem is Armenia this tiny little
Republic<00:05:10.060> tucked<00:05:10.300> in<00:05:10.480> here<00:05:10.750> next<00:05:11.290> to<00:05:11.500> Turkey

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
Republic tucked in here next to Turkey

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.430 
Republic tucked in here next to Turkey
has<00:05:12.670> closed<00:05:13.120> its<00:05:13.390> border<00:05:13.750> with<00:05:13.900> Turkey<00:05:14.290> these

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
has closed its border with Turkey these

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.590 
has closed its border with Turkey these
two<00:05:14.710> have<00:05:14.920> been<00:05:15.100> at<00:05:15.280> loggerheads<00:05:15.520> for<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.180> long

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
two have been at loggerheads for a long

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.930 
two have been at loggerheads for a long
long<00:05:16.870> time<00:05:17.140> so<00:05:17.890> there's<00:05:18.100> a<00:05:18.160> proposal<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.820> build

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
long time so there's a proposal to build

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.530 
long time so there's a proposal to build
a<00:05:19.120> diversionary<00:05:19.750> line<00:05:20.080> just<00:05:20.800> across<00:05:21.130> from

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
a diversionary line just across from

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.870 
a diversionary line just across from
Georgia<00:05:22.540> into<00:05:22.840> Turkey<00:05:23.380> so<00:05:24.220> that's<00:05:24.430> one<00:05:24.670> way<00:05:24.850> of

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
Georgia into Turkey so that's one way of

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.870 
Georgia into Turkey so that's one way of
going<00:05:25.530> but<00:05:26.530> of<00:05:26.680> course<00:05:26.890> it<00:05:27.070> means<00:05:27.190> putting<00:05:27.640> all

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
going but of course it means putting all

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.020 
going but of course it means putting all
the<00:05:28.090> train<00:05:28.360> on<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.630> ferry<00:05:29.050> now<00:05:29.140> that's<00:05:29.500> quite

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
the train on a ferry now that's quite

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.340 
the train on a ferry now that's quite
cumbersome<00:05:31.030> and<00:05:31.210> expensive<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.840> other<00:05:32.140> way

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
cumbersome and expensive the other way

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.590 
cumbersome and expensive the other way
of<00:05:32.500> course<00:05:32.530> would<00:05:32.980> be<00:05:33.010> to<00:05:33.160> come<00:05:33.580> by<00:05:34.270> land

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
of course would be to come by land

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.520 
of course would be to come by land
across<00:05:35.260> into<00:05:35.830> Iran<00:05:36.540> there<00:05:37.540> are<00:05:37.840> two<00:05:38.320> countries

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
across into Iran there are two countries

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.920 
across into Iran there are two countries
that<00:05:38.770> are<00:05:38.950> fairly<00:05:39.730> crucial<00:05:40.060> to<00:05:40.420> the<00:05:40.540> missing

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
that are fairly crucial to the missing

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.740 
that are fairly crucial to the missing
link<00:05:41.260> and<00:05:41.500> that<00:05:41.620> is<00:05:41.920> either<00:05:42.510> Afghanistan<00:05:43.510> or

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
link and that is either Afghanistan or

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.620 
link and that is either Afghanistan or
Iran<00:05:44.320> and<00:05:44.890> once<00:05:45.820> you're<00:05:46.000> in<00:05:46.030> Iran

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
Iran and once you're in Iran

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.170 
Iran and once you're in Iran
you<00:05:47.169> can<00:05:47.350> then<00:05:47.500> carry<00:05:47.710> on<00:05:47.919> into<00:05:48.130> Turkey<00:05:48.610> the

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
you can then carry on into Turkey the

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.320 
you can then carry on into Turkey the
problem<00:05:49.540> is<00:05:49.660> both<00:05:49.930> these<00:05:50.290> two<00:05:50.560> countries<00:05:51.330> they

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
problem is both these two countries they
