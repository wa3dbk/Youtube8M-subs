00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
my concentrated I think this kind of

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.840 
my concentrated I think this kind of
game<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.370> season<00:02:41.760> game<00:02:42.320> life<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.850> the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
game the season game life of that the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.920 
game the season game life of that the
motivation<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.860> more<00:02:46.860> than<00:02:47.100> half<00:02:47.690> did<00:02:48.690> they

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
motivation is more than half did they

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.440 
motivation is more than half did they
was<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:49.860> good<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.340> play<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.580> game<00:02:50.850> like<00:02:51.240> tonight

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
was it good to play a game like tonight

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
against Angola maybe not quite as tough

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.050

keep the difference and thinking

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.510 
keep the difference and thinking
tomorrow<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:14.100> normal<00:03:14.640> what<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.780> wasn't<00:03:16.230> a

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
tomorrow is normal what it wasn't a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.600 
tomorrow is normal what it wasn't a
great<00:03:17.520> game

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610

great game
plus<00:03:18.820> I'm<00:03:18.970> great<00:03:19.120> for<00:03:19.600> spirit<00:03:20.020> and<00:03:20.500> then<00:03:20.740> just

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
plus I'm great for spirit and then just

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.080 
plus I'm great for spirit and then just
to<00:03:22.060> keep<00:03:22.210> the<00:03:22.360> difference<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.640> any<00:03:24.640> summer

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
to keep the difference and any summer

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.790 
to keep the difference and any summer
because<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.570> situation<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:26.140> different<00:03:26.560> is

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
because the situation is different is

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.800 
because the situation is different is
not<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.100> normal<00:03:27.370> situation<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.960> group<00:03:29.460> is

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
not a normal situation and the group is

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.400 
not a normal situation and the group is
thinking<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:31.960> we<00:03:32.520> keep<00:03:33.520> the<00:03:33.580> energy<00:03:34.380> for<00:03:35.380> a

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
thinking that we keep the energy for a

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.860 
thinking that we keep the energy for a
big<00:03:35.740> challenge<00:03:35.980> tomorrow<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.820> a<00:03:37.000> good<00:03:37.360> basic

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
big challenge tomorrow it's a good basic

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.430 
big challenge tomorrow it's a good basic
physical<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:39.010> we<00:03:39.310> have<00:03:39.460> to<00:03:39.640> be<00:03:39.790> get<00:03:40.660> rest<00:03:40.990> and

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
physical and we have to be get rest and

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.010 
physical and we have to be get rest and
recuperate<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.580> energy<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.120> get<00:03:43.510> ready<00:03:43.750> I

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
recuperate the energy and get ready I

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.750 
recuperate the energy and get ready I
think<00:03:44.320> tomorrow<00:03:44.620> will<00:03:44.800> be<00:03:45.070> one<00:03:45.670> hundred

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
think tomorrow will be one hundred

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.330 
think tomorrow will be one hundred
percent<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.600> last<00:03:46.810> thing<00:03:47.040> because<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.070> what's

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
percent the last thing because of what's

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.970

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
aspect and the mental aspect with the

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.820 
aspect and the mental aspect with the
team<00:03:56.980> has<00:03:57.730> how<00:03:58.450> has<00:03:58.600> this<00:03:58.780> affected<00:03:58.959> them<00:03:59.440> do

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
team has how has this affected them do

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.100 
team has how has this affected them do
you<00:03:59.920> believe<00:04:00.130> they<00:04:00.310> can<00:04:00.489> overcome<00:04:00.880> this<00:04:01.120> yeah

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
you believe they can overcome this yeah

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.050 
you believe they can overcome this yeah
for<00:04:02.590> sure<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:03.010> think<00:04:03.370> they<00:04:03.520> are<00:04:03.880> playing

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
for sure I think they are playing

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.680 
for sure I think they are playing
together<00:04:05.130> sometimes<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.340> be<00:04:06.520> missing<00:04:07.330> easy

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
together sometimes to be missing easy

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.890 
together sometimes to be missing easy
shots<00:04:07.989> but<00:04:08.800> all<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.790> game<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.450> whole<00:04:10.630> game

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
shots but all the game the whole game

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.520 
shots but all the game the whole game
playing<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.500> get<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.980> passing<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.730> ball<00:04:12.910> and

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
playing to get the passing the ball and

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.090 
playing to get the passing the ball and
I<00:04:14.530> think

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
I think

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.750 
I think
