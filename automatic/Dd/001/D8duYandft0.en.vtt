00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.520
 so I'll explain how to make meyong heel 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.909
 and I'm doing my little one here 

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:09.289
 to lose 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.279
 so I did is the face of my mind 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:17.029
 is an adult going to be our any bigger mind after I make in the recipe 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.560
 immediately what is for you and is also on team b so I did the 

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:22.460
 way 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.550
 I did a two month stay 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.550
 david itaqui has 24 total points 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.280
 I avoid doing that but I remember if you would normally stay, I could not stand it 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.989
 thinner sending thinner also want to stay in my most delicate 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.660
 but plot demonstration did nothing to run behind 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.630
 and I scored 24 points 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.830
 r 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.240
 I put eight points out of ten physical women now 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.420
 You'll have to divide and 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.780
 a part of the port in a rush 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.570
 a pact in the other half not as they were 24 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.320
 ana human guilhermino 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.420
 This one is controversial. 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.060
 I put half of the funds are 12 six months 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.160
 how do you know that ballack number that starts 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.340
 I have to start my career is the beginning of my career 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.340
 so I know this is what the war in lebanon 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.820
 so I looked for the number one half of the points and the other two for 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.960
 a barracks in the park 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.000
 half the points I want the heel 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.660
 the others they in turn must go we will work only the heel 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.660
 I do not feel more intellectual taquari 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.150
 so the copenhagen a csn i have worked on this career now i go 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.900
 I will come back 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
 I've been fed up in my career and that 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 will be 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.240
 the first point you have teaching do and the rest you do 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.920
 a click or 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.770
 Why do you have it here? 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.249
 why cut the barrel of the media 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.249
 a short essay on the list 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.229
 but it seems this career of the notice here criticized 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.379
 in the next 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.069
 second career win 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.999
 to draw 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.469
 moore without making 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.469
 and make goal 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.599
 take it off 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:38.389
 take one 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.389
 do it 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.319
 taking 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.059
 taking today 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.039
 pulling more neymar 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:56.729
 the second career 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:59.099
 you will repeat these two dry runs 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.389
 the first and second that is 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.079
 we take without making 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.329
 and do the trick 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.329
 and you will repeat these two careers 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.829
 that yes 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.849
 a year ago that means learning to stay off 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.579
 for your part, what are you and me? 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.999
 finish it will stay 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.999
 but not less last year the bauru 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:34.729
 next season 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.959
 She wants to be like him. 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.089
 took without making and does the fluminense 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:42.589
 the entire career 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.069
 I do not know what to do 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.399
 min 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.369
 do not have to do 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:51.359
 but working so you have a square
