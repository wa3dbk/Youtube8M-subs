boring<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.430> won't<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> said<00:01:39.570> none<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
boring it won't like I said none of the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.660 
boring it won't like I said none of the
matches<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.650> come<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:40.890> World<00:01:41.100> Cup<00:01:41.340> cards

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
matches will come out World Cup cards

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.160 
matches will come out World Cup cards
etc<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.270> many<00:01:42.450> things<00:01:42.600> will<00:01:42.720> come<00:01:42.840> out<00:01:42.960> seeing

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
etc so many things will come out seeing

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.859 
etc so many things will come out seeing
of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> season<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.329> wanted<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.659> say

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
of the season but what I wanted to say

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.069 
of the season but what I wanted to say
is<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.259> used<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.770> 2.5<00:01:47.310> million<00:01:47.759> squad<00:01:48.119> but

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
is it used to be 2.5 million squad but

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.830 
is it used to be 2.5 million squad but
now<00:01:49.320> I've<00:01:49.500> changed<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.570> expensive<00:01:51.570> squads

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
now I've changed it to expensive squads

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.920 
now I've changed it to expensive squads
in<00:01:52.020> there<00:01:53.009> um<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:53.880> how<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.270> explain<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.659> Im

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
in there um I don't how to explain it Im

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.499 
in there um I don't how to explain it Im
basically<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:56.100> want<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.700> 3<00:01:57.090> million

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
basically I want it to be 3 million

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.700 
basically I want it to be 3 million
minimum<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.049> then<00:01:58.140> i<00:01:58.229> thought<00:01:58.259> other<00:01:58.590> people

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
minimum but then i thought other people

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.459 
minimum but then i thought other people
need<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> play<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.540> it's<00:02:00.540> gonna<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.170> full

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
need to play so it's gonna be a full

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.830 
need to play so it's gonna be a full
inform<00:02:01.890> team<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.399> has<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.729> look<00:02:02.969> expensive<00:02:03.450> or

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
inform team it has to look expensive or

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.149 
inform team it has to look expensive or
it<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.530> full<00:02:04.710> inform<00:02:05.009> team

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
it can be a bit of a full inform team

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.950 
it can be a bit of a full inform team
with<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.240> example<00:02:06.299> i'll<00:02:06.659> give<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
with like so for example i'll give it to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.779 
with like so for example i'll give it to
you<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
you like this and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.910 
you like this and
it<00:02:09.299> can<00:02:10.049> be<00:02:10.200> something<00:02:10.439> like<00:02:11.150> Robin<00:02:12.150> Newberry

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
it can be something like Robin Newberry

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.259 
it can be something like Robin Newberry
remin<00:02:13.920> Lewandowski<00:02:14.670> could<00:02:14.849> be<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.030> best

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
remin Lewandowski could be the best

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.470 
remin Lewandowski could be the best
possible<00:02:15.659> Bundesliga<00:02:16.500> team<00:02:16.799> wit<00:02:17.760> without<00:02:18.209> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
possible Bundesliga team wit without the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.179 
possible Bundesliga team wit without the
informs<00:02:18.840> that's<00:02:18.989> fine<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.950> best

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
informs that's fine but with the best

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.069 
informs that's fine but with the best
possible<00:02:20.430> one<00:02:20.879> or<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:21.629> just<00:02:21.659> be<00:02:21.840> high

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
possible one or it can just be high

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.809 
possible one or it can just be high
rated<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.829> have<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.069> tweet<00:02:23.370> me<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.549> pic

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
rated you just have to tweet me a pic

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.880 
rated you just have to tweet me a pic
and<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.450> will<00:02:24.569> decide<00:02:24.810> whether<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.230> do<00:02:25.379> it<00:02:25.409> that

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
and I will decide whether to do it that

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.149 
and I will decide whether to do it that
way<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.250> gets<00:02:26.430> more<00:02:26.790> subs<00:02:27.120> involved<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.159> it's

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
way it gets more subs involved and it's

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.830 
way it gets more subs involved and it's
still<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.579> concept<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.150> expensive<00:02:30.659> teams

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
still the concept of expensive teams

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.899 
still the concept of expensive teams
expensive<00:02:31.739> doesn't<00:02:32.069> necessarily<00:02:32.700> have<00:02:32.879> to

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
expensive doesn't necessarily have to

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.089 
expensive doesn't necessarily have to
mean<00:02:33.030> 10<00:02:33.420> million<00:02:33.840> expensive<00:02:34.799> can<00:02:34.950> mean

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
mean 10 million expensive can mean

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.160 
mean 10 million expensive can mean
expensive<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.670> their<00:02:35.849> prime<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.659> being<00:02:36.959> that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
expensive in their prime it being that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.440 
expensive in their prime it being that
card<00:02:37.409> itself<00:02:37.739> like<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.010> normal<00:02:38.280> gold<00:02:38.639> card<00:02:38.909> so

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
card itself like the normal gold card so

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.179 
card itself like the normal gold card so
suppose<00:02:39.689> we<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:39.989> like<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.379> hybrid<00:02:40.680> let's<00:02:40.980> say

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
suppose we have like a hybrid let's say

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.369 
suppose we have like a hybrid let's say
rebury<00:02:41.700> left<00:02:41.909> side<00:02:42.090> with<00:02:42.299> like<00:02:42.480> Bundesliga

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
rebury left side with like Bundesliga

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.599 
rebury left side with like Bundesliga
team<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.889> left<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.250> then<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.459> could<00:02:44.549> have

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
team to the left and then we could have

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.940 
team to the left and then we could have
it<00:02:44.819> bruh<00:02:45.060> there<00:02:45.599> with<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> psg<00:02:46.319> team<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.829> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
it bruh there with a psg team to the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.349 
it bruh there with a psg team to the
right<00:02:47.129> and<00:02:47.370> went<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.639> the<00:02:47.790> scene<00:02:47.939> has<00:02:48.060> come<00:02:48.209> out

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
right and went to the scene has come out

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.360 
right and went to the scene has come out
it'll<00:02:48.629> look<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.959> lot<00:02:49.169> better<00:02:49.379> so<00:02:49.950> here<00:02:50.129> we<00:02:50.159> come

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
it'll look a lot better so here we come

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.099 
it'll look a lot better so here we come
up<00:02:50.459> against<00:02:50.849> an<00:02:50.970> info<00:02:51.299> see<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.599> this<00:02:51.840> team

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
up against an info see like this team

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.710 
up against an info see like this team
this<00:02:52.680> isn't<00:02:52.980> exactly<00:02:53.400> your<00:02:53.489> typical<00:02:53.970> my<00:02:54.419> whole

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
this isn't exactly your typical my whole

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720 
this isn't exactly your typical my whole
point<00:02:54.900> was<00:02:54.989> 2.5<00:02:55.590> million<00:02:55.950> team<00:02:56.159> 23<00:02:56.549> million

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
point was 2.5 million team 23 million

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.659 
point was 2.5 million team 23 million
minimum<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.349> looks<00:02:58.650> expensive<00:02:59.129> general

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
minimum that it looks expensive general

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.339 
minimum that it looks expensive general
it<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.819> reasonably<00:03:00.450> expensive<00:03:00.989> i<00:03:01.049> think<00:03:01.230> it's

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
it is reasonably expensive i think it's

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.619 
it is reasonably expensive i think it's
almost<00:03:01.919> a<00:03:02.099> million<00:03:02.280> if<00:03:02.519> not<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:03.209> like<00:03:03.239> suppose

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
almost a million if not but like suppose

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.599 
almost a million if not but like suppose
that<00:03:03.840> was<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.989> 300k<00:03:04.650> inform<00:03:04.980> team<00:03:05.129> generally

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
that was a 300k inform team generally

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.940 
that was a 300k inform team generally
the<00:03:05.730> whole<00:03:05.909> concept<00:03:06.329> is<00:03:06.480> expensive<00:03:06.989> teams<00:03:07.260> but

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
the whole concept is expensive teams but

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.759 
the whole concept is expensive teams but
it<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.579> also<00:03:08.609> look<00:03:09.209> expensive<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:10.079> also<00:03:10.739> a

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
it can also look expensive that also a

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.199 
it can also look expensive that also a
good<00:03:10.980> point<00:03:11.220> because<00:03:11.280> everyone<00:03:11.730> wants<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.060> own

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
good point because everyone wants to own

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.030 
good point because everyone wants to own

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
opponent on expensive teams it was just

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.040 
opponent on expensive teams it was just
a<00:04:46.020> one-sided<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.830> was<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.480> completely<00:04:48.480> fair

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050
