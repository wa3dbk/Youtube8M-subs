for<00:00:43.260> something<00:00:43.800> that's<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.190> little<00:00:44.610> more

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
for something that's a little more

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.490 
for something that's a little more
adaptable<00:00:45.420> maybe<00:00:45.780> something<00:00:46.200> that's<00:00:46.289> gonna

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
adaptable maybe something that's gonna

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.770 
adaptable maybe something that's gonna
make<00:00:46.710> things<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.160> little<00:00:47.520> easier<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:48.030> us<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
make things a little easier on us in the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.319 
make things a little easier on us in the
future<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.039> thought<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.700> was<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> pretty

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
future and I thought this was a pretty

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.750 
future and I thought this was a pretty
darn<00:00:52.050> good<00:00:52.140> solution<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.070> attack<00:00:53.430> seemed

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
darn good solution and in attack seemed

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.049 
darn good solution and in attack seemed
to<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.030> really<00:00:54.809> come<00:00:55.020> through<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:56.059> now

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
to have really come through here now

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.540 
to have really come through here now
what<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.780> essentially<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> USB

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
what it is is essentially it is a USB

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.900 
what it is is essentially it is a USB
cable<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.600> would<00:01:00.989> expect<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.640> follow

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
cable as you would expect and you follow

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.260 
cable as you would expect and you follow
along<00:01:03.210> four<00:01:03.690> foot<00:01:04.140> four<00:01:05.040> feet<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.280> cable<00:01:05.460> to

along four foot four feet of cable to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.340 
along four foot four feet of cable to
the<00:01:06.420> very<00:01:06.600> end<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.540> micro

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350

the very end and you have the a micro
USB<00:01:11.250> connector<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.560> this

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
USB connector here then you have this

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.100 
USB connector here then you have this
unusual<00:01:13.979> little<00:01:14.549> caddy<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> top<00:01:15.930> on

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
unusual little caddy here with a top on

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.649 
unusual little caddy here with a top on
it<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.439> has<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> lightning<00:01:17.659> Thunderbolt

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it that has a lightning Thunderbolt

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.260 
it that has a lightning Thunderbolt
connector<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.290> end<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:21.030> turns

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
connector on the end of it and not turns

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.539 
connector on the end of it and not turns
it<00:01:21.390> into<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.630> lightning<00:01:21.930> cable<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.189> simple

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
it into a lightning cable just as simple

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:23.870 
it into a lightning cable just as simple
as<00:01:23.640> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
as that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.990 
as that
so<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.509> charge<00:01:25.200> Android<00:01:27.229> Apple<00:01:28.820> just<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
so you can charge Android Apple just to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.260 
so you can charge Android Apple just to
illustrate<00:01:30.180> I've<00:01:30.990> got<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.470> old<00:01:31.909> rather<00:01:32.909> grimy

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
illustrate I've got the old rather grimy

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
illustrate I've got the old rather grimy
iPad<00:01:34.259> retina<00:01:35.030> or<00:01:36.030> iPod<00:01:36.420> mini<00:01:36.570> sorry<00:01:37.250> stick

iPad retina or iPod mini sorry stick

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.109 
iPad retina or iPod mini sorry stick
that<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.549> there<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.570> that's<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.110> do

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
that in there and that's all you do

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.179 
that in there and that's all you do
obviously<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.659> plugged<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.009> it's

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
obviously that's not plugged in so it's

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.240 
obviously that's not plugged in so it's
not<00:01:44.310> gonna<00:01:44.460> charge<00:01:45.350> but<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.439> means<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
not gonna charge but it means that you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.270 
not gonna charge but it means that you
can<00:01:47.430> plug<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.820> any<00:01:48.060> micro<00:01:48.840> USB<00:01:49.500> cable<00:01:49.950> into

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
can plug in any micro USB cable into

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.030 
can plug in any micro USB cable into
here<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.909> effectively<00:01:51.780> charge<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.740> long<00:01:52.890> as

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
here and effectively charge as long as

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.730 
here and effectively charge as long as
it<00:01:53.189> carries<00:01:53.610> enough<00:01:53.960> power<00:01:54.960> along<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.530> says

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
it carries enough power along it says

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.940 
it carries enough power along it says
some<00:01:56.060> USB<00:01:57.060> cables<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.630> heart<00:01:57.810> quite<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.799> good

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
some USB cables to heart quite as good

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.770 
some USB cables to heart quite as good
as<00:01:59.100> others<00:01:59.369> some<00:01:59.820> are<00:01:59.939> only<00:02:00.090> data<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.689> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
as others some are only data and that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.740 
as others some are only data and that
sort<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.079> thing<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:02.360> it's<00:02:03.360> really<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:05.750> piece

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
sort of thing so it's really this piece

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.559 
sort of thing so it's really this piece
of<00:02:06.930> apparatus<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.149> genius

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
of apparatus here that is the the genius

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.660 
of apparatus here that is the the genius
behind<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:10.050> there<00:02:10.979> are<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.190> number<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.580> these

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
behind it there are a number of these

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.910 
behind it there are a number of these
solutions<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.780> market<00:02:13.170> but

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
solutions on on the market but
