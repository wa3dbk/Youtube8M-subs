00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:13.820
 hello how about my name Leonardo we're going to 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:17.690
 give a pattern to this second part which 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.869
 we are going to do the conformation of how 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.480
 we can visualize and have an order 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.150
 visual because it's very common that 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.900
 we lost ourselves inside canvas 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.649
 of sketch modeling in views and 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.320
 many times we do not know how 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:39.620
 raise that view so that we 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.499
 let's start the drawing of that drawing ok a 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.480
 recommendation that I give them if they are 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:48.859
 beginners or intermediate in the use of 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.249
 sketch and especially this that have that 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.379
 possibility of directing the view so that 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:57.710
 we can accommodate it which 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:01.399
 we can change the books books 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.640
 means cartesian system units 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.950
 universal in English which the books 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.189
 corresponds to the three axes for 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.140
 modeled in three dimensions than red 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.890
 it has always been like this 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:21.440
 the red indicates the x axis the green indicates 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.320
 the y-axis is the blue indicates the z- axis in 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.729
 most of the software or 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.100
 modeling programs interested dimension 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.660
 either mesh either three more either 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.320
 autocad whether this sun word and so on 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.470
 most always indicate these colors 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.409
 about what green x red is blue 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.149
 to have identified which are colors 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.600
 basic and are the three basic axes 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.450
 well let's start let's make a 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.039
 simple personal rectangle you have to 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.130
 put a plan view for this we go 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.850
 to go to this tool that is the one 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.670
 views 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.960
 we went to plant view that is the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.150
 top view let rectangle point 0 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.220
 0 always advisable to use this 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:13.350
 point let's go to a square that is 10.10 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.739
 in this way we have our square 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.569
 now we're going to do in extrusion 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.810
 of this element 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:27.689
 and to differentiate we're going to make the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.689
 top view be on the top 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.540
 a circle 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.360
 let's trace 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.810
 the center so that we do not 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.810
 let's lose 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.890
 we already know that the circle corresponds to 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.980
 the top view if we go to the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.580
 front view and let's trace a 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.580
 triangle 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.170
 we know that the triangle the view 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.569
 frontal ok let's look right at the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.680
 right view let's draw a touch 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.680
 one x 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.200
 in this way we know that the view 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.970
 right lateral is the touch we go to the 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.380
 back view of the back view 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:16.310
 let's make these two lines 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.830
 to divide the face of the view of 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.350
 this way we know that this view of 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.260
 cube in the rear view we go to the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.550
 left side view and we're going to do 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.550
 a plus sign 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.380
 in this way we know that the sign of 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.930
 more is dividing into four faces the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.970
 face of the cube and in this way we know 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.120
 that the left view we also have 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.890
 the isometric view that corresponds to 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.230
 that perspective view 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.170
 if we want to remove this view in 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.540
 perspective we can go see 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.239
 sorry to camera and we have the option to 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.360
 perspective see how it becomes more 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.630
 isometric more at the angle 30 degrees 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.489
 our this our metric floor 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.150
 cube we're going to camera we 're going to 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.160
 perspective and see how it goes these points 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.680
 of flight to give the feeling of 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.710
 perspective and good here we already have 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.740
 our sight 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.050
 our five views of the cube the part 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.860
 lower is empty indicates that it is the 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:24.160
 part of the cube below us if 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.290
 we want to draw a circle on how 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.970
 we just did if we go to the 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.220
 top view that is the view circle 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.940
 plant appears the circle in this way 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.820
 can we draw 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.000
 how much we do in this view if 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.470
 we want the front view with 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.129
 or the triangle line see that 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.110
 we can trace 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.779
 I'm doing this on the outside 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.779
 we have the square our stroke as 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:54.469
 if it were in v and it is in plant but 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:56.089
 we are in the view of this frontal ok 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:58.099
 in my new way if we go 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:59.539
 at the right view that is the tache see 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.339
 how is this element because it is in 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.649
 perspective we go to camera 

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:06.080
 perspective let's see that it disappears or that 

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:09.940
 if we in sight in plan in sight 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:14.440
 right lateral we draw a circle 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.000
 see that I go back to this I mean that 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.020
 you have to have an order in the views 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.030
 so that we can accommodate ourselves 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.750
 also in the back view that is 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.840
 this element we can do we are going to 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.020
 make a rectangle 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.630
 in this way we have that we can 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.720
 form without changing the ucs 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.639
 the Cartesian system of the east axes 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.080
 not the position so that we are not 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:45.990
 tracing is more comfortable 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.379
 and in the same way and way we are going to 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.710
 eliminate these with double quick click 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:55.879
 select the whole figure in this way 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:59.129
 we can accommodate ourselves to rotate 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:01.770
 if we select the cube we go 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:04.770
 to the front view corresponding to the 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.530
 triangle let's rotate we select 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.199
 a position from where the point is 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:13.710
 center of rotation axis one position 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.670
 where the anchor starts, see that I 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.540
 I can rotate 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.400
 easier in this way I can rotate the 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.510
 Cube 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.880
 so that we can manipulate it 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:32.830
 now well if I try to put it to no 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:35.470
 perspective view in isometric 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.590
 it's a little complicated to know where 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.720
 I'm obviously guiding it with a 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.000
 little more experience then I'm going 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.220
 grabbing more more the wave but if it 's a 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.440
 little more complicated and it is very convenient 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.440
 we who handle the views 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:59.320
 well that would be the second part and we 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.470
 we see on the next occasion until 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.470
 then
