00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.590
 no one seems to doubt that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.530
 flowers are the most immaculate pleasant gift 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.960
 for any reason and sometimes without it flowers 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.070
 with accompanied mankind on all his 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.010
 historical path 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.590
 becoming symbols of love beauty glory 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.230
 and rebirth, and can therefore be 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.320
 modern women have become often called 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.210
 flowers are among the most desirable and 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.300
 remembered gifts but unfortunately 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.739
 Age is not long bouquet to have joy 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.620
 great alternative 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.510
 potted indoor plant such 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.239
 the gift will last for years 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.269
 if it is correct to care for it azalea and 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.430
 the main thing you content for the hall is 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.800
 she needs cold from only 10 15 degrees 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.159
 content and to be constantly 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.760
 wet land repotting it is also very 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.700
 how to be neat when she 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.740
 the azalea is blooming and it transfers well 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 the room is cool but not freezing 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.840
 case that you can also water it later 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.210
 when it is already intact and transplants 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.430
 makes this room then we continue 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.390
 shed also contains spray 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.460
 the leaves then when the threat 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.320
 frosts and passed can be taken where 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.140
 minutes to the balcony for example just even 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.119
 there is a cottage to the country where in partial shade such 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.030
 put her to keep her there too 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.920
 spray watering and then you can 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.340
 install it while before budding 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.890
 it's already somewhere closer to september so its 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.500
 brings them home but a permanent place 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.899
 sets and starts watering and as if 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.820
 again the same spray 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.600
 and the only thing about her condition is 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.210
 cold and and it should be 10-15 degrees only 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.520
 Well, watering it with soft separated water. 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.649
 you can pour a little sweetener 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.630
 the decline of citric acid withdrawal that 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.990
 sally needs acidic soil 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.300
 also to create cool conditions 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.520
 zalyu obkladyvat do not make ice in 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.760
 refrigerator these ordinary and obkladyvat 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.170
 and and ice the only thing is when she 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.600
 blooms and need to spray 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.760
 neatly well without getting on the flower 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.800
 because flowers from water will turn black 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.090
 of all indoor flowers which 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.420
 give women a gift 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.640
 the hall is one of the most beloved and after 8 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.940
 March on the windowsills of many apartments 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.849
 this amazing plant bloomed to 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.489
 and the hall pleased you longer its time 3 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.319
 plant transplant when the hall takes a year 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.150
 in general, any flower and pot gives 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.970
 literally two and a half centimeters 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.090
 more but not anymore it all seems 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.640
 it created such a care for him if you 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.830
 for example purchased land, it is already underway 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.560
 fully ready for the hall she goes already 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.540
 and acidified and how much is necessary and and there 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.329
 already everything is gone and if you yourself 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.370
 components make it something but 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.920
 be and for example our land a little bit 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.019
 peat humus hall and a little psy 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.440
 a teaspoon there for example per kilogram 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.890
 three 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.110
 land and necessarily component then 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.480
 will be needles from the woods in whether dry which 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.420
 falls here it is collected washes well 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.060
 washes and adds ground it attaches 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.700
 acid soil here is such as would not and 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.030
 the soil but must be loose 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.209
 the soil is not difficult to was in severe 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.579
 water and earth in it will rot away 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.980
 roots are also definitely needed anyway 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.739
 drainage to prevent water from stagnating 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:47.950
 pot for example its only mandatory 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:50.319
 also indicated well feed the azalea as 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.310
 before budding to 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:57.880
 gain more like these oils for 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.400
 to bloom more fertilizing well 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.989
 Now available in any store 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.810
 buy there are specialized for 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.970
 azaleas just for the hall all that and 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.459
 need to eat for possible for vein for 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.060
 blooming one common buy to 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.940
 water well feed it once through 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.910
 for example, I start there somewhere in the middle 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.010
 summer of July and the pier every two 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.500
 weeks watering can also be out in 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.690
 root feeding is bred well this 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.360
 watering and can be foliar dressing 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.940
 it is bred but there is less concentration 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.340
 then spray potted leaves 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.740
 plant is an excellent gift or men 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.000
 the most correct flower for strong 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.460
 half of humanity 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.860
 florists consider 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.800
 chrysanthemums chrysanthemum of course she is much 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.710
 the simpler is azalea but she also has her own 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.900
 cons I'm generally all blooming as if all 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.470
 blooming rose and for or chrysanthemum 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.120
 arrogance and need cold 10-15 is theirs 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.289
 minimum temperature for good 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.750
 growth well hordes of chrysanthemum there is another 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.130
 flaw and ate loves spider mite and 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.620
 aphid 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.740
 it's like they have roses and chrysanthemums 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.660
 the flowers they love her but desirable 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.940
 so that it cannot be processed yet 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.830
 ordinary soap solution household 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.440
 soap is bred in a con it 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.599
 and jumping is simple but if i'm already wound up 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.139
 here soap does not help need something already 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:24.389
 another chrysanthemum take well transplant 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.130
 chrysanthemum can also go right outside 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.810
 it blooms to chrysanthemum practically 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.550
 blooms all year round but it is quite 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.759
 a little rest period while she 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.889
 picks up new buds and everything when nuts 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.900
 with lamb and chrysanthemums and can not be cut 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.389
 completely some cut it straight 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.060
 completely all so that she and her roses 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.729
 you can not lick so need only here well 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.490
 these flowers are trimmed to bend to 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.860
 first appearances of new kidneys are obtained 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.599
 so that she does not lose all the power of atoms if 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.719
 and it cuts off the root 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:56.930
 the system will be there it is a tip and not not 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:06:00.990
 have enough strength to develop 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.240
 also chrysanthemum feed just me 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.800
 was so ordinary Fritz at all for 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.570
 Chrysanthemum no matter how much 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.940
 common for what exactly 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.909
 chrysanthemums mostly and versatile for 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.240
 flower chrysanthemum like such as 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.580
 I 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.110
 Well, diffused light is not very direct 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.620
 the sun in the direct sun she will 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.110
 to burn 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.330
 where there is a full day this can be but 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.580
 bloom in the web abundantly but sometime 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.440
 such diffused light is just bright 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.199
 diffused light to avoid direct 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.289
 rays and one more tip for last 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:33.180
 before giving a pot plant 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.580
 find out from the future owner of this 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.520
 an exotic gift if he has 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.780
 conditions and the main desire for care and 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.780
 growing flowers
