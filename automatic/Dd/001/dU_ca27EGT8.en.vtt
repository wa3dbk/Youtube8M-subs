hey<00:00:01.050> everyone<00:00:01.380> so<00:00:01.560> in<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.070> last<00:00:02.280> pin<00:00:02.490> cast<00:00:02.730> we

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hey everyone so in the last pin cast we

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.710 
hey everyone so in the last pin cast we
saw<00:00:03.300> that<00:00:04.430> we<00:00:05.430> could<00:00:05.580> start<00:00:06.000> using<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.450> Python

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
saw that we could start using the Python

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.959 
saw that we could start using the Python
interpreter<00:00:06.839> by<00:00:08.120> going<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.330> all<00:00:09.960> programs

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
interpreter by going to all programs

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.850 
interpreter by going to all programs
Python<00:00:11.969> 2.7<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.870> then<00:00:13.080> starting<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.590> command

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
Python 2.7 and then starting the command

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.900 
Python 2.7 and then starting the command
line<00:00:13.980> from<00:00:14.190> here<00:00:15.320> now<00:00:16.320> let's<00:00:16.590> say<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.830> are<00:00:17.130> you

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
line from here now let's say you are you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.230 
line from here now let's say you are you
want<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:19.310> start<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.550> python<00:00:21.150> interpreter

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
want to start the python interpreter

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.029 
want to start the python interpreter
from<00:00:21.720> anywhere<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> windows<00:00:22.830> command

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
from anywhere on the windows command

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.880 
from anywhere on the windows command
line<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.519> example<00:00:23.779> let's<00:00:24.779> say<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.019> start<00:00:25.710> off

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
line for example let's say I start off

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.019 
line for example let's say I start off
my<00:00:26.130> command<00:00:26.760> line<00:00:26.789> interpreter<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:29.029> just

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
my command line interpreter and I just

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.780 
my command line interpreter and I just
want<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.420> type<00:00:31.019> Python<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.740> want<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
want to type Python and I want that the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.150 
want to type Python and I want that the
Python<00:00:33.059> interpreter<00:00:33.180> should<00:00:33.600> start<00:00:33.960> now<00:00:34.170> as

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
Python interpreter should start now as

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.620 
Python interpreter should start now as
you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.550> see<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.850> gives<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.420> an<00:00:36.480> error

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
you can see it gives you an error

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.090 
you can see it gives you an error

it<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.640> start<00:00:44.940> by<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.690> what

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
it to start by them so to do that what

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.619 
it to start by them so to do that what
you<00:00:48.750> need<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.890> need<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> add

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
you need to do is we need to add

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.130 
you need to do is we need to add
something<00:00:51.629> called<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:53.789> Python<00:00:54.180> path<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
something called the Python path to the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.250 
something called the Python path to the
windows<00:00:55.530> path<00:00:55.770> variable<00:00:56.780> before<00:00:57.780> doing<00:00:58.109> that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
windows path variable before doing that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.319 
windows path variable before doing that
we'll<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.500> take<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.129> quick<00:00:59.160> look<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.730> what<00:01:00.180> do

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
we'll just take a quick look at what do

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.930 
we'll just take a quick look at what do
we<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.260> Python<00:01:01.440> 27<00:01:02.309> directory<00:01:02.730> that

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
we have in the Python 27 directory that

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.509 
we have in the Python 27 directory that
was<00:01:03.359> created<00:01:03.690> during<00:01:03.780> install<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:05.129> as<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.400> can

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
was created during install so as you can

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.510 
was created during install so as you can
see<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.790> am<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.600> C<00:01:06.810> Drive<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:08.189> Python

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
see I am in the C Drive and the Python

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.149 
see I am in the C Drive and the Python
27<00:01:09.119> trick<00:01:09.360> tree<00:01:09.540> which<00:01:09.900> was<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.890> default

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
27 trick tree which was the default

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.520 
27 trick tree which was the default
directory<00:01:11.369> where<00:01:11.760> white-nose<00:01:12.210> installed<00:01:12.659> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
directory where white-nose installed so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.740 
directory where white-nose installed so
if<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.950> dir<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.150> will<00:01:15.299> see<00:01:15.450> various

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
if I do a dir here you will see various

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.330 
if I do a dir here you will see various
files<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> doc<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
files so you have the doc you have a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
files so you have the doc you have a
include<00:01:17.670> directory<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.659> Lib

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
include directory you have a Lib

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.560 
include directory you have a Lib
directory<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.670> various<00:01:20.670> other<00:01:20.850> files<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
directory and various other files the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.240 
directory and various other files the
main<00:01:21.780> file<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> need<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> look<00:01:23.070> at

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
main file here that you need to look at

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.510 
main file here that you need to look at
for<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.909> Python<00:01:24.360> dot<00:01:24.540> e<00:01:24.750> XE<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.369> is

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
for now is Python dot e XE so this is

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.399 
for now is Python dot e XE so this is
the<00:01:26.640> Python<00:01:26.970> executable<00:01:27.600> which<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> basically

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the Python executable which is basically

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.950 
the Python executable which is basically
it<00:01:29.280> will<00:01:29.520> run<00:01:29.790> your<00:01:29.939> Python<00:01:30.299> programs<00:01:30.689> or

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it will run your Python programs or

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.690 
it will run your Python programs or
which<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.590> Python<00:01:31.890> interpreter<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.579> you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
which is the Python interpreter that you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.630 
which is the Python interpreter that you
had<00:01:33.420> started<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.140> first<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.340> saw<00:01:35.520> in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
had started in the first as you saw in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.090 
had started in the first as you saw in
the<00:01:35.729> first<00:01:35.880> screencast<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.500> idea<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.950> so

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the first screencast so the idea is so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.460 
the first screencast so the idea is so
that<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.430> should<00:01:38.509> tell<00:01:39.509> windows<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:40.439> I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that we should tell windows that when I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.010 
that we should tell windows that when I
type<00:01:40.710> Python<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.430> should<00:01:41.880> find<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.390> file<00:01:42.630> from

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
type Python it should find the file from

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.789 
type Python it should find the file from
here<00:01:43.320> which<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.710> C<00:01:44.610> Python<00:01:45.119> 27<00:01:46.700> Pisan<00:01:47.700> dot<00:01:47.880> exe

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
here which is C Python 27 Pisan dot exe

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.190 
here which is C Python 27 Pisan dot exe
so<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.320> we<00:01:52.320> are<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> go<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:54.200> my

go<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.019> end<00:02:14.230> we'll<00:02:14.769> add<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.069> semicolon

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
go to the end we'll add a semicolon

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.220 
go to the end we'll add a semicolon
we'll<00:02:16.720> add<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.319> see<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:19.269> exact<00:02:19.689> location

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
we'll add this see the exact location

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:29.430 
we'll add this see the exact location
the<00:02:20.709> CIM<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.790> Python<00:02:22.150> dot<00:02:22.299> exe<00:02:22.510> file<00:02:28.440> right

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
the CIM of the Python dot exe file right

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.949 
the CIM of the Python dot exe file right
so<00:02:29.860> that's<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.970> that's<00:02:31.420> all<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.690> need<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.870> do

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
so that's it that's all you need to do

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.360 
so that's it that's all you need to do
we<00:02:32.049> don't<00:02:32.170> need<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.620> give<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.860> full<00:02:33.010> path<00:02:33.250> to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
we don't need to give the full path to

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.069 
we don't need to give the full path to
buy<00:02:33.579> 30x<00:02:34.120> we<00:02:34.269> just<00:02:34.480> need<00:02:34.569> to<00:02:34.659> tell<00:02:34.840> where<00:02:35.049> to

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
buy 30x we just need to tell where to

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.399 
buy 30x we just need to tell where to
find<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.609> should<00:02:36.760> do<00:02:36.879> the<00:02:36.909> trick

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
find it so this should do the trick

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.750 
find it so this should do the trick
okay<00:02:38.670> let's<00:02:39.670> see<00:02:40.829> we'll<00:02:41.829> close<00:02:42.159> this<00:02:42.340> command

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
okay let's see we'll close this command

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.990 
okay let's see we'll close this command
window<00:02:43.590> will<00:02:44.590> close<00:02:44.920> this<00:02:45.250> command<00:02:45.609> window<00:02:45.879> as

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
window will close this command window as

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.470 
window will close this command window as
well

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
well

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:56.360 
well
we'll<00:02:46.900> start<00:02:47.290> our<00:02:47.530> new<00:02:47.769> command<00:02:48.159> window<00:02:48.459> and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.220 

we'll<00:02:57.370> type<00:02:57.579> Python<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:59.560> we<00:02:59.680> go<00:03:01.230> let's

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
we'll type Python and here we go let's

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.559 
we'll type Python and here we go let's
just<00:03:02.560> print<00:03:03.599> this<00:03:04.599> is<00:03:05.019> spite<00:03:05.799> them<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.569> this

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
just print this is spite them and this

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.920 
just print this is spite them and this
works<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:10.060> what<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.269> can<00:03:10.389> see<00:03:10.569> is<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.780> can

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
works so so what you can see is you can

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.879 
works so so what you can see is you can
be<00:03:11.079> in<00:03:11.170> C<00:03:11.379> Drive<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.920> can<00:03:12.099> be<00:03:12.280> wherever<00:03:12.609> and

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
be in C Drive you can be wherever and

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.949 
be in C Drive you can be wherever and
let's<00:03:14.889> say<00:03:15.190> let's<00:03:16.120> say<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:16.359> have<00:03:16.599> created<00:03:16.780> a

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
let's say let's say I have created a

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.599 
let's say let's say I have created a
directory<00:03:17.109> called<00:03:17.410> Python<00:03:17.889> programs<00:03:18.340> so

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
directory called Python programs so

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.759 
directory called Python programs so
let's<00:03:18.819> say<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.299> go<00:03:19.540> there<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:20.049> still<00:03:20.379> that<00:03:20.590> bit

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
let's say I go there I still that bit

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.819 
let's say I go there I still that bit
here<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.340> will<00:03:22.120> see<00:03:22.269> so<00:03:23.139> now<00:03:23.349> you<00:03:23.410> can<00:03:23.650> use

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
here and you will see so now you can use

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.800 
here and you will see so now you can use
your<00:03:23.859> you<00:03:24.340> can<00:03:24.519> start<00:03:25.150> your<00:03:25.269> path<00:03:25.389> readable

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
your you can start your path readable

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.069 
your you can start your path readable
from<00:03:26.019> anywhere<00:03:26.470> on<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.739> command<00:03:27.040> line<00:03:28.079> this

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
from anywhere on the command line this

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.979 
from anywhere on the command line this
will<00:03:29.230> be<00:03:29.349> handy<00:03:29.709> as<00:03:29.889> we<00:03:30.160> start<00:03:30.370> programming

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
will be handy as we start programming

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.790 
will be handy as we start programming
using<00:03:31.989> Python<00:03:32.019> in<00:03:32.620> our<00:03:33.069> next<00:03:33.340> string<00:03:33.549> cost
