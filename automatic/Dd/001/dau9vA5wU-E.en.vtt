00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
app there is a bit of a learning curve

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.390 
app there is a bit of a learning curve
and<00:00:59.320> I'm<00:00:59.650> just<00:00:59.770> gonna<00:00:59.860> preface<00:01:00.220> this<00:01:00.340> by

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
and I'm just gonna preface this by

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.160 
and I'm just gonna preface this by
saying<00:01:00.610> when<00:01:01.000> I'm<00:01:01.150> at<00:01:01.360> a<00:01:01.450> disadvantage<00:01:01.600> of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
saying when I'm at a disadvantage of

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.229 
saying when I'm at a disadvantage of
this<00:01:02.350> weird<00:01:02.590> angle<00:01:02.980> here<00:01:03.160> so<00:01:03.190> if<00:01:03.580> I<00:01:03.730> don't<00:01:03.880> get

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
this weird angle here so if I don't get

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.929 
this weird angle here so if I don't get
this<00:01:04.449> it's<00:01:04.809> not<00:01:04.989> my<00:01:05.229> fault<00:01:05.500> so<00:01:06.310> I'm<00:01:06.400> gonna<00:01:06.490> try

bounce oh I got into the center alright
never<00:01:12.159> mind<00:01:12.219> this<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.820> a<00:01:12.850> really<00:01:13.090> good<00:01:13.210> angle

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
never mind this is a really good angle

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:22.380 
never mind this is a really good angle
for<00:01:13.509> me<00:01:14.520> okay<00:01:15.520> well<00:01:15.939> okay<00:01:16.859> and<00:01:18.210> alright<00:01:21.390> so

for me okay well okay and alright so
anyway<00:01:23.079> learning<00:01:23.590> curve<00:01:23.740> takes<00:01:24.100> some

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
anyway learning curve takes some

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:25.950 
anyway learning curve takes some
practice<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:24.700> patience<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.270> get<00:01:25.390> those<00:01:25.569> pigs

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
practice and patience to get those pigs

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
fun and play really just kind of learn

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.169 
fun and play really just kind of learn
how<00:01:29.319> the<00:01:29.799> best<00:01:29.979> way<00:01:30.219> it<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.429> to<00:01:30.729> bounce<00:01:30.969> the

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
how the best way it is to bounce the

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.419 
how the best way it is to bounce the
balls<00:01:31.359> and<00:01:31.630> aim<00:01:31.780> them<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.619> distance<00:01:33.340> you

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
balls and aim them and the distance you

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:34.770 
balls and aim them and the distance you
need<00:01:33.549> to<00:01:33.670> be<00:01:33.789> away<00:01:33.999> from<00:01:34.060> it<00:01:34.329> and<00:01:34.479> of<00:01:34.539> course

need to be away from it and of course

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.139 
need to be away from it and of course
the<00:01:35.079> angle<00:01:35.530> at<00:01:36.100> which<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.490> shoot<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.939> balls

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149
