00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.240
 Hello dear friends with you Maxim 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.559
 this is another vlog on the live channel 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.660
 he will be fully devoted mortal 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.390
 kombat x since quite a lot 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.310
 similar protection even 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.070
 questions are asked about this game 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.220
 Here in this video I decided to answer right 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.099
 at all so that when the question was asked I 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.410
 right in this video bullet I bullet and so 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.079
 the very first one will i buy mortal 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.579
 kombat x will be a collectible version for 8 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.190
 999 on playstation 4 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.170
 I will play there on the playstation 4 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.980
 I will record on playstation 4 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.030
 video of the passage so I answered 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.600
 absolute majority of questions 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.149
 related to mortal kombat x 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.039
 it's time to wrap up what I think 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.469
 about the pk version if you watch me 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.439
 recently its generally for the first time know that 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.320
 on while i play exclusively in 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.479
 emulators benefits even in emulators 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.700
 arcade machines because in 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.740
 set-top box emulators do n't make much sense 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.689
 play that for more fresh consoles 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.970
 you can often play old games 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.070
 for example on playstation 3 you cut in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.170
 playstation 1 and some games 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.990
 playstation 2 on some nintendo 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.960
 Lim quietly play nintendo 64 there 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.049
 our previous and so on and here multi 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.720
 arcade emulator abbreviated mom on pc 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.240
 Generally the cutest thing in modern 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.640
 games on it bought there in the incentive or 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.329
 there is no crutches you 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.540
 the bum 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.479
 but wait you can enjoy them i 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.670
 I don't convince you of anything I don't play 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.229
 the incentive a couple of times really made 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.780
 similar errors for example when passed 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.409
 first two batmen first of course 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.280
 first of the arkham series 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.329
 face big challenges 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.700
 technical nature as always 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.680
 constantly if i even know in vidosike 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.469
 I declare that I have technical problems 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.039
 character bitch I write about the change as 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.769
 juvenile degenerates with 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.450
 mini computer though i have a drop dead 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.579
 computer of course an old video card 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.379
 nevertheless everything is configured works 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.540
 clearly about this I am one time 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:24.010
 spent very sour therefore 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.590
 me working cars doing their business on 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.220
 computer i work there and there everything is clear 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.590
 and there should be a quick question 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.099
 answered at least he is not very 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.319
 refers to mortal kombat'a so on 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.659
 playstation see a lot now 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.639

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.639
 last few unclear what was playing 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:48.280
 it's in mortal kombat 9 pass bonus 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:50.049
 the test tower is probably still short 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.329
 video will write down the water specific url 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.609

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.750
 I think about this game is not how about 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:01.150
 some kind of a batch about a specific 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.049
 full bitch perfect practically 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.569
 I'll write down the game probably mortal kombat x 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.439
 mortal kombat x what happened to him before 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.840

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.190

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.209
 platformers on which i play the game 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.650
