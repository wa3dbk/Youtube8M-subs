00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
plane a boat and a train and you just

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.100 
plane a boat and a train and you just
stick<00:00:39.180> these<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.600> here<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.260> push<00:00:40.500> em<00:00:41.090> and

stick these in here and you push em and
it<00:00:43.110> tells<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> little<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:43.950> about<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
it tells you a little bit about it

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.210 
it tells you a little bit about it
obviously<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.320> whole<00:00:46.470> purpose<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.160> is

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
obviously the whole purpose of this is

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.840 
obviously the whole purpose of this is
to<00:00:47.400> make<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.000> match<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.800> put<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.400> front<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
to make a match so you put the front and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:01.340 
to make a match so you put the front and
the<00:00:50.940> back<00:00:50.970> but<00:00:51.870> when<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.170> don't<00:01:00.350> hopefully

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the back but when you don't hopefully

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
the back but when you don't hopefully
you<00:01:01.470> can<00:01:01.650> hear<00:01:01.830> this<00:01:10.490> yes<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.120> don't

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you can hear this yes so if you don't

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.149 
you can hear this yes so if you don't
make<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> match<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.260> tells<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.830> it's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
make a match it tells you that it's

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.660 
make a match it tells you that it's
silly<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.890> make<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> match<00:01:20.370> it

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
silly and then if you do make a match it

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.850 
silly and then if you do make a match it
tells<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.390> made<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> match<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.320> it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
tells you that you made a match and it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.800 
tells you that you made a match and it
