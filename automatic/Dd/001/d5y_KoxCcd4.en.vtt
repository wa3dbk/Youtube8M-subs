water bottle in your hamster's carrier

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.010 
water bottle in your hamster's carrier

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
so definitely I get a bottle and then

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.050 
so definitely I get a bottle and then
you'll<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.440> able<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.800> pour<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.550> water<00:01:59.580> and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
you'll be able to pour the water and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
you'll be able to pour the water and
account<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.540> next<00:02:00.780> thing<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.200> dried<00:02:01.560> food<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
account the next thing is dried food and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.750 
account the next thing is dried food and
you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.240> either<00:02:03.420> get<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:04.110> ziploc<00:02:04.710> bag<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.550> I

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
you can either get a ziploc bag but I

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.389 
you can either get a ziploc bag but I
prefer<00:02:06.150> these<00:02:06.570> stacking<00:02:07.320> containers<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.100> I

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
prefer these stacking containers so I

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.199 
prefer these stacking containers so I
just<00:02:09.360> put<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.140> hamster<00:02:10.619> mix<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:11.910> get

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
just put the hamster mix and then I get

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.449 
just put the hamster mix and then I get
pallets<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.170> then<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.500> seed<00:02:13.740> mix<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.250> this

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
pallets and then the seed mix and this

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.000 
pallets and then the seed mix and this
should<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.910> enough<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.989> last<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.650> really
