00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.560
 presentation of the troops of the elixir 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.990
 black who are the minions the researchers 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.619
 pigs the walkyries the golems and 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.510
 the witches 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.160
 we start with the million units of 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.080
 flight he attacks his opponents by their 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.730
 hiding from the black elixir on it 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.480
 can not be attacked by guns or 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.550
 by the mortars 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.170
 but otherwise he has a weakness that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.090
 are aerial bombs and tusks 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.739
 antiaircraft offensive strategies 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.480
 the cute can be destroyed in one 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.960
 shot by an air bomb or a head 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.579
 researcher 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.379
 we must also be wary of the towers of 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.120
 wizards and tesla hide who 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.829
 can very quickly annihilate all your 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.539
 cute especially if they are in group in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.829
 defensive strategy to prevent the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.309
 damage minions too quickly your 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.690
 city 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.520
 put all around bombs 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.379
 aerials and searchers sa 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.079
 capacity of accommodation and two places 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.210
 the duration of his training is 45 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.219
 seconds his speed of movement and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.320
 30 of his attack speed and a 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.400
 second and the level of the barracks for 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.930
 unlock it and 2 1 the rider of 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.790
 pig can jump over the walls 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.799
 which allows you to destroy the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.729
 opposing defenses more easily in 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.200
 offensive strategy 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.670
 it is better to send them by group 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.320
 to get rid of it as quickly as possible 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.759
 possible opposing defenses that you 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.350
 pose the most problems to your 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.490
 troops in defensive strategy the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.350
 pig riders are doing too much 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.580
 directly on the enemy faster 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.140
 that some of your troops 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.700
 for example if you have archers 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.049
 in your clan castle they will be able to 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.729
 pull quietly while the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.189
 pig riders will hold them back 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.960
 its accommodation capacity and five 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.970
 the duration of his training and two 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.310
 minutes his speed of movement and 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.140
 24 his attack speed and a second 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.159
 and the level of the barracks for the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.750
 unlock and two for the wave and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.720
 ricky a fierce warrior at the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.950
 flamboyant hair are the strategies 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.270
 offensive did not use the cities 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.920
 as a group because they tend 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 to stay around the city 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.729
 which means that they will be quick 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.259
 decimated by your opponent in 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.759
 defensive strategy the walkyries are 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.380
 effective against troops slightly 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.119
 but their weaknesses 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.520
 are the troops that attack from a distance 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.329
 the walkyria has a housing capacity 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.190
 of 8 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.470
 the duration of his training and 15 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.590
 minutes his speed of movement and 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.080
 24 his speed attack and 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.060
 1.8 seconds the level of the barracks for 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.860
 unblock and three continue 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.420
 with the golem that once it explodes 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.280
 there are only two little gaulle left 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.780
 and nick who continue to attack in 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.069
 offensive strategy but tvo golem 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.989
 front and your weakest troops 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.120
 behind the spring trap will be 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.129
 ineffective against golems but by 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.900
 elsewhere when it will change to 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.879
 little goalie and mick there the trap 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.319
 will work in defensive strategy seen 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.940
 that golem has a lot of health points 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.920
 but such in the middle of your defenses 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.079
 to distract your opponents and better 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.819
 protect your defenses his ability to 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.890
 housing they occupy and 30 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.019
 the duration of his training is 45 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.380
 minutes his speed of movement and 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.260
 12 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.819
 his attack speed and 2.4 seconds the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.470
 level of the barracks to unlock it 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.090
 and four the witch can summon 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:06.560
 skeletons that were once 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:07.879
 warriors warriors witches 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.680
 improve can invoke more than 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.250
 skeletons both in strategy 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.720
 offensive 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.640
 it is better to consider it as a 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.379
 support troop because of its lack of 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.519
 life points also do not launch 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.290
 directly on the battlefield 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.819
 but wait until the rest of your 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.889
 troops and started cleaning the 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.880
 opposing defenses before launching it 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.230
 defensive strategy 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.850
 place your clan castle at 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.859
 inside your walls for better 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.940
 protect your witch's space from 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.889
 accommodation is 12 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.170
 the duration of his training and 20 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.470
 minutes his speed of movement and 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.750
 12 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.430
 his attack speed and 0.7 seconds 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.750
 the level of the barracks for the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.160
 unlock and 2.5 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.630
 so we end up for the end of the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.639
 presentation of the troops of the elixir 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.620
