00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
so you can see me and after we can use

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.390 
so you can see me and after we can use
this<00:03:52.500> elevator<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.340> back<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:54.569> just<00:03:55.400> use

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
this elevator and back to just use

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.830 
this elevator and back to just use
incubator<00:03:57.380> and<00:03:58.380> they<00:03:58.709> again<00:03:59.040> get<00:03:59.760> some<00:04:00.209> stuff

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
incubator and they again get some stuff

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.360 
incubator and they again get some stuff
not<00:04:01.739> both<00:04:01.980> but<00:04:02.280> only<00:04:02.790> one<00:04:02.940> ways<00:04:03.840> way<00:04:04.230> we<00:04:05.190> can

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
not both but only one ways way we can

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.940 
not both but only one ways way we can
find<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:06.000> soma<00:04:07.310> some<00:04:08.310> stuff<00:04:08.520> let<00:04:09.269> me<00:04:09.420> show<00:04:09.600> you

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
find the soma some stuff let me show you

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.789 
find the soma some stuff let me show you
only<00:04:10.950> one<00:04:12.050> that<00:04:13.050> started<00:04:13.519> more<00:04:14.519> time<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.650> you

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
only one that started more time so you

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.370 
only one that started more time so you
can<00:04:16.829> see<00:04:17.190> in<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.609> box<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:18.750> already<00:04:18.900> have

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
can see in this box we already have

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.640 
can see in this box we already have
resources<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:20.480> again<00:04:21.480> can<00:04:21.780> use<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.380> divider

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
resources so again can use the divider
