00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
it's very difficult to imagine the

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.830 
it's very difficult to imagine the
impact<00:02:07.430> it<00:02:07.640> will<00:02:07.760> have<00:02:07.850> on<00:02:08.090> finishing<00:02:08.450> force

the target is to finish as high as

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.809 
the target is to finish as high as
possible<00:02:32.030> way<00:02:32.720> but<00:02:32.800> will<00:02:33.800> be<00:02:34.040> at<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.370> moment<00:02:34.550> I

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
possible way but will be at the moment I

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.259 
possible way but will be at the moment I
must<00:02:35.030> say<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:36.110> front<00:02:36.380> behind<00:02:37.040> us<00:02:37.459> we<00:02:37.880> depend

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
must say in front behind us we depend

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.050 
must say in front behind us we depend
only<00:02:38.420> on<00:02:38.630> our<00:02:38.840> result<00:02:39.320> in<00:02:40.250> front<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.730> us<00:02:40.910> we

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
only on our result in front of us we

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.020 
only on our result in front of us we
depend<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.630> our<00:02:42.019> results<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.489> results<00:02:43.519> of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
depend on our results and the results of

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.180 
depend on our results and the results of
the<00:02:44.150> other<00:02:44.239> teams<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.290> that's<00:02:45.470> impossible<00:02:45.830> to

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
the other teams so that's impossible to

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:56.860 
the other teams so that's impossible to
predict<00:02:53.470> still<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:55.280> think<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:56.090> lot<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.570> twists

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
predict still I think a lot of twists

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.320 
predict still I think a lot of twists
and<00:02:57.050> turns<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.580> Premier<00:02:58.970> League<00:02:59.000> until

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.240 
favorite in there Liverpool has an
advantage<00:03:04.970> they<00:03:05.390> don't<00:03:05.660> play<00:03:05.950> any<00:03:06.950> other

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
advantage they don't play any other

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.770 
advantage they don't play any other
competition<00:03:07.670> when<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.120> Premiership<00:03:08.569> for<00:03:08.750> a

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
competition when the Premiership for a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.910 
competition when the Premiership for a
long<00:03:08.959> long<00:03:09.140> time<00:03:09.519> so<00:03:10.519> they<00:03:10.730> have<00:03:11.590> only<00:03:12.590> one

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
long long time so they have only one

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.069 
long long time so they have only one
target<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:14.000> they<00:03:14.750> can<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.440> course<00:03:16.510> be<00:03:17.510> stable

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
target and they can of course be stable

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.920 
target and they can of course be stable
in<00:03:18.350> their<00:03:18.590> preparation<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.630> that's<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.750> little

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
in their preparation and that's a little

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:33.479 
in their preparation and that's a little
advantage<00:03:21.320> but<00:03:22.090> could<00:03:23.090> be<00:03:23.209> very<00:03:23.239> traumatic

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:41.319 

it's<00:03:34.489> possible<00:03:37.540> no<00:03:38.540> III<00:03:39.079> III<00:03:39.700> you<00:03:40.700> know<00:03:40.730> why<00:03:41.060> I

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
it's possible no III III you know why I

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.370 
it's possible no III III you know why I
don't<00:03:41.750> know<00:03:41.930> more<00:03:42.260> than<00:03:42.380> you<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.959> nobody

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
don't know more than you and nobody

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.990 
don't know more than you and nobody
knows<00:03:45.620> that's<00:03:45.890> why<00:03:46.100> it's<00:03:46.280> interesting<00:03:46.640> as

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
knows that's why it's interesting as

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.170 
knows that's why it's interesting as
well<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.769> it's<00:03:48.769> a<00:03:48.920> possibility<00:03:49.310> yes<00:03:49.700> but<00:03:50.000> they

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
well and it's a possibility yes but they

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.690 
well and it's a possibility yes but they
can<00:03:50.420> win<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:52.430> premiership<00:03:52.850> of<00:03:53.180> course<00:03:53.450> but<00:03:53.780> I

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
can win the premiership of course but I

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.470 
can win the premiership of course but I
don't<00:03:55.700> know<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:55.910> still<00:03:56.150> think<00:03:56.540> maybe<00:03:58.269> CGS<00:03:59.269> to

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
don't know I still think maybe CGS to

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.539 
don't know I still think maybe CGS to
game<00:03:59.690> its<00:03:59.900> games<00:04:00.350> in<00:04:00.560> hand<00:04:00.769> and<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.130> two<00:04:01.310> games

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
game its games in hand and the two games

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.569 
game its games in hand and the two games
at<00:04:01.790> home<00:04:02.680> where<00:04:03.680> they<00:04:03.920> are<00:04:04.040> strong<00:04:04.340> in<00:04:04.489> the

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
at home where they are strong in the

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.800 
at home where they are strong in the
Premier<00:04:04.940> League's<00:04:05.090> over<00:04:05.390> have<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.570> huge

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
Premier League's over have a huge

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.860 
Premier League's over have a huge
advantage<00:04:06.820> you<00:04:07.820> see<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:11.329> danger<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.840> danger

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
advantage you see the danger the danger

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:33.610 
advantage you see the danger the danger
can<00:04:12.440> come<00:04:12.470> from<00:04:12.859> everywhere

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.000 

no<00:04:34.620> rational<00:04:35.070> explanation<00:04:35.160> in<00:04:35.850> that<00:04:36.060> but

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
no rational explanation in that but

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.310 
no rational explanation in that but
maybe<00:04:38.010> if<00:04:38.910> they<00:04:39.060> have<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.210> style<00:04:39.600> but<00:04:39.750> suited<00:04:40.169> us

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
maybe if they have a style but suited us

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.400 
maybe if they have a style but suited us
and<00:04:41.389> maybe<00:04:42.389> as<00:04:42.630> well<00:04:42.780> because<00:04:43.080> we<00:04:43.199> turned

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
and maybe as well because we turned

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:58.330 
and maybe as well because we turned
every<00:04:43.680> time<00:04:43.860> up<00:04:44.070> is<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.280> strong<00:04:44.790> performance<00:04:53.030> I

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.180 

don't<00:04:59.340> think<00:04:59.610> I<00:04:59.789> need<00:05:00.060> to<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:01.440> explain<00:05:02.010> how

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
don't think I need to to explain how

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.270 
don't think I need to to explain how
important<00:05:02.669> it<00:05:02.789> is<00:05:02.910> for<00:05:02.970> us<00:05:03.410> we<00:05:04.410> have<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.620> target

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
important it is for us we have a target

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.020 
important it is for us we have a target
that<00:05:05.639> is<00:05:05.789> to<00:05:06.180> win<00:05:06.300> our<00:05:06.479> games<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.880> we<00:05:08.880> know

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
that is to win our games and we know

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.170 
that is to win our games and we know
that<00:05:09.240> every<00:05:09.539> game<00:05:09.690> now<00:05:09.990> becomes<00:05:10.530> of<00:05:11.160> course<00:05:11.940> a

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
that every game now becomes of course a

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.449 
that every game now becomes of course a
fighter
