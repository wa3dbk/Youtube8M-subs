really wish he was in the striker

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
really wish he was in the striker
position<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.450> would<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.689> made<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:48.990> team<00:01:49.259> so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
position it would have made this team so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.399 
position it would have made this team so
much<00:01:50.220> better<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.759> make<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.180> they<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:52.200> would

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
much better to make and they just would

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.440 
much better to make and they just would
it<00:01:52.829> would<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.040> been<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.759> good<00:01:54.000> but

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it would have been so so good but

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.209 
it would have been so so good but
regardless<00:01:54.869> um<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.189> far

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
regardless um this is what I have so far

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.649 
regardless um this is what I have so far
the<00:01:56.610> three<00:01:56.790> centre-backs<00:01:57.090> they're<00:01:57.420> good

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the three centre-backs they're good

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.510 
the three centre-backs they're good
they're<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.380> fastest<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.310> when<00:01:59.430> you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
they're not the fastest but when you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.859 
they're not the fastest but when you
have<00:01:59.640> company<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.270> center<00:02:00.540> faqs<00:02:00.689> you

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
have company in the center faqs you

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.780 
have company in the center faqs you
can't<00:02:01.110> complain<00:02:01.439> too<00:02:01.680> much<00:02:01.710> those<00:02:02.280> other<00:02:02.490> two

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
can't complain too much those other two

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.219 
can't complain too much those other two
sentiments<00:02:03.270> are<00:02:03.329> all<00:02:03.450> actually<00:02:03.659> part<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
sentiments are all actually part of the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.649 
sentiments are all actually part of the
BPL<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.740> they<00:02:04.799> are<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.399> good<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.420> I

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
BPL and they are all really good but I

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.449 
BPL and they are all really good but I
wouldn't<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.590> too<00:02:07.829> crazy<00:02:08.039> about<00:02:08.220> them

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
wouldn't get too crazy about them

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.889 
wouldn't get too crazy about them
because<00:02:08.729> they're<00:02:08.910> not<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.330> quickest<00:02:09.720> but

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
because they're not the quickest but

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.660 
because they're not the quickest but
they<00:02:09.989> are<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.259> course<00:02:10.440> very<00:02:10.739> strong<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.489> only

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
they are of course very strong the only

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.949 
they are of course very strong the only
problem<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:11.970> if<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.180> come<00:02:12.360> up<00:02:12.450> against<00:02:12.780> any

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
problem is if you come up against any

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.670 
problem is if you come up against any
sort<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
sort of

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.399 
sort of

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
Pacey or any legend because legend seems

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.349 
Pacey or any legend because legend seems
to<00:02:16.500> be<00:02:16.620> really<00:02:16.769> strong<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.189> fast<00:02:17.730> you're

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359

in that damn Bell Eden belly was a much

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.040 
in that damn Bell Eden belly was a much
better<00:04:38.460> striker<00:04:38.849> than<00:04:39.180> Lukaku<00:04:39.659> which<00:04:39.780> just

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
better striker than Lukaku which just

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.899 
better striker than Lukaku which just
doesn't<00:04:40.169> make<00:04:40.440> sense<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:41.250> know<00:04:41.340> he's<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.520> he's

doesn't make sense you know he's a he's
a<00:04:41.940> cam<00:04:42.270> but<00:04:42.539> I<00:04:42.569> moved<00:04:42.780> him<00:04:42.960> up<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.139> a<00:04:43.199> striker

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
a cam but I moved him up to a striker

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.439 
a cam but I moved him up to a striker
because<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.860> needed<00:04:44.190> him<00:04:44.789> to<00:04:44.849> pair<00:04:45.180> up<00:04:45.300> with

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
because I needed him to pair up with

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:46.670 
because I needed him to pair up with
someone<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:45.900> look<00:04:46.139> at<00:04:46.259> that<00:04:46.379> for<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.560> strike

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
someone and look at that for a strike

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.409 
someone and look at that for a strike
honestly<00:04:47.099> Dan<00:04:47.340> Bailey<00:04:47.550> was<00:04:47.819> very<00:04:48.120> very

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
honestly Dan Bailey was very very

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.270 
honestly Dan Bailey was very very
impressive<00:04:48.810> at<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.139> striker<00:04:49.379> position<00:04:49.860> but

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
impressive at the striker position but

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.559 
impressive at the striker position but
that<00:04:50.400> was<00:04:50.550> honestly<00:04:50.940> about<00:04:51.180> it<00:04:51.330> that's<00:04:51.479> the

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
that was honestly about it that's the

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.059 
that was honestly about it that's the
only<00:04:51.960> good<00:04:52.139> thing<00:04:52.199> I<00:04:52.440> can<00:04:52.620> say<00:04:52.740> about<00:04:52.770> the

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
only good thing I can say about the

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:54.830 
only good thing I can say about the
squad<00:04:53.280> been<00:04:53.490> bail-in<00:04:53.699> courtois<00:04:54.300> were<00:04:54.720> the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
squad been bail-in courtois were the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.330 
squad been bail-in courtois were the
only<00:04:54.960> ones<00:04:55.259> that<00:04:55.440> made<00:04:55.560> me<00:04:55.710> think<00:04:55.919> okay<00:04:56.280> you

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
only ones that made me think okay you

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.860 
only ones that made me think okay you
know<00:04:56.580> I<00:04:56.610> don't<00:04:56.940> want<00:04:57.120> to<00:04:57.180> kill<00:04:57.300> myself<00:04:57.479> today

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
know I don't want to kill myself today

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.779 
know I don't want to kill myself today
but<00:04:58.409> the<00:04:58.470> rest<00:04:58.650> of<00:04:58.770> them<00:04:58.889> I<00:04:59.069> honestly<00:04:59.280> got<00:04:59.669> to

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
but the rest of them I honestly got to

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.399 
but the rest of them I honestly got to
the<00:04:59.849> point<00:04:59.940> where<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.180> just<00:05:00.449> hated<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.990> game<00:05:01.199> so

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
the point where I just hated the game so

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.649 
the point where I just hated the game so
much<00:05:01.650> Lukaku<00:05:02.460> finally<00:05:02.879> makes<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.180> decent<00:05:03.360> run

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
much Lukaku finally makes a decent run

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.180 
much Lukaku finally makes a decent run
and<00:05:03.840> puts<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.199> over<00:05:04.319> the<00:05:04.500> keepers<00:05:04.889> head<00:05:05.039> as

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
and puts it over the keepers head as

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.980 
and puts it over the keepers head as
well<00:05:05.340> which<00:05:05.759> was<00:05:05.879> pretty<00:05:06.030> nice<00:05:06.300> but<00:05:06.810> yeah

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990
