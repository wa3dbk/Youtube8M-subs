go around the edge of the bowl with a
spatula<00:01:13.760> just<00:01:14.300> to<00:01:14.540> reincorporate<00:01:15.500> any<00:01:16.130> little

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
spatula just to reincorporate any little

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.609 
spatula just to reincorporate any little
dry<00:01:16.729> lumps<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.300> flour<00:01:17.540> that<00:01:17.870> have<00:01:18.020> got<00:01:18.229> stuck

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
dry lumps of flour that have got stuck

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.620 
dry lumps of flour that have got stuck
around<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.369> edges<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:20.060> they<00:01:20.300> can<00:01:20.450> come

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
around the edges so that they can come

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.020 
around the edges so that they can come
into<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.930> center<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.530> be<00:01:21.890> taken<00:01:22.220> care<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.490> and

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
into the center and be taken care of and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:40.779 
into the center and be taken care of and
so<00:01:23.270> in<00:01:23.510> goes<00:01:23.750> three<00:01:24.260> fluid<00:01:24.560> ounces<00:01:24.860> of<00:01:25.010> water

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.520 

then<00:01:41.789> as<00:01:41.969> soon<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.450> got<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.929> lumps<00:01:43.409> out

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
then as soon as it's got the lumps out

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.740 
then as soon as it's got the lumps out
of<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.859> it's<00:01:44.159> ready<00:01:44.429> a<00:01:44.700> lot<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.329> people<00:01:45.570> talk

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
of it it's ready a lot of people talk

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.319 
of it it's ready a lot of people talk
about<00:01:45.979> better<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.399> cookery<00:01:47.820> books<00:01:48.060> saying

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
about better in cookery books saying

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.899 
about better in cookery books saying
that<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.079> let<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.649> stand<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.789> I've

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
that you have to let it stand but I've

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.850 
that you have to let it stand but I've
tried<00:01:51.090> making<00:01:51.390> pancakes<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.289> indeed<00:01:52.590> York

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
tried making pancakes and indeed York

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.370 
tried making pancakes and indeed York
four<00:01:53.039> puddings<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.179> letting<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.020> batter

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
four puddings and letting the batter

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.990 
four puddings and letting the batter
stand<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.159> found<00:01:56.429> it<00:01:56.549> makes<00:01:56.729> no<00:01:56.969> difference

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
stand and I found it makes no difference

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.179 
stand and I found it makes no difference
so<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.840> make<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> batter<00:01:58.350> whenever<00:01:59.039> it's

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
so just make the batter whenever it's

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.549 
so just make the batter whenever it's
convenient
