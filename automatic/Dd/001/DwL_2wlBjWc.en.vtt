00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
again somebody that was mashing the shit

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.840 
again somebody that was mashing the shit
out<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.719> me<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.170> don't<00:00:34.980> think<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.670> fair

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
out of me I don't think that it's fair

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420 
out of me I don't think that it's fair
because<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:37.140> person<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> other<00:00:38.040> person

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
because the person the other person

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.720 
because the person the other person
that's<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.760> awakened<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:40.800> only<00:00:41.190> chance<00:00:41.489> they

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
that's not awakened the only chance they

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.660 
that's not awakened the only chance they
have<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.090> come<00:00:42.629> at<00:00:42.809> me<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.110> beat<00:00:43.379> me<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.800> by

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
have to come at me and beat me is by

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.729 
have to come at me and beat me is by
being<00:00:45.570> aggressive<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.379> giving<00:00:46.680> me

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
being aggressive and not giving me

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.740 
being aggressive and not giving me
breathing<00:00:47.070> room<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.579> therefore<00:00:48.270> they<00:00:48.480> need<00:00:48.570> to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
breathing room so therefore they need to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.450 
breathing room so therefore they need to
imagine<00:00:49.170> into<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.500> combos<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.100> me<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.309> stuff

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
imagine into the combos on me and stuff

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.000 
imagine into the combos on me and stuff
so<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.390> able<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:52.020> fucking<00:00:52.530> sub<00:00:52.800> into

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
so if I'm just able to fucking sub into

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.490 
so if I'm just able to fucking sub into
a<00:00:53.039> counter<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:54.000> kind<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.570> makes<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
a counter it kind of just makes it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.900 
a counter it kind of just makes it
redundant<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.430> saying<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> just

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
redundant you know I'm saying it just

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.790 
redundant you know I'm saying it just
means<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> fucking<00:00:58.079> The<00:00:58.140> Awakening<00:00:58.230> is

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
means that a fucking The Awakening is

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680 
means that a fucking The Awakening is
gonna<00:00:59.010> win<00:00:59.250> almost<00:00:59.730> 90<00:01:00.059> percent<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> time

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
gonna win almost 90 percent of the time

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.540 
gonna win almost 90 percent of the time
it's<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.289> hundred<00:01:01.859> percent<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> time

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it's not a hundred percent of the time

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.719 
it's not a hundred percent of the time
so<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.629> wanted<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.559> put<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.189> out<00:01:05.250> that's

awakened<00:01:16.439> uses<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> counter<00:01:17.580> against<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.150> big

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
awakened uses the counter against a big

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.450 
awakened uses the counter against a big
awakening<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.320> bigger<00:01:19.619> working<00:01:19.979> doesn't<00:01:20.220> get

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
awakening the bigger working doesn't get

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.320 
awakening the bigger working doesn't get
his<00:01:20.580> guard<00:01:20.820> broken

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
his guard broken

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.390 
his guard broken
he<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.960> gets<00:01:22.080> done<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.710> half<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.070> second

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
he just gets done for like half a second

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.740 
he just gets done for like half a second
and<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:23.580> he's<00:01:23.759> able<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.000> attack<00:01:24.150> again<00:01:24.540> I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
and then he's able to attack again I

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.630 
and then he's able to attack again I
don't<00:01:25.470> agree<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.890> either<00:01:26.009> because

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
don't agree with that either because

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.240 
don't agree with that either because
again<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.600> another<00:01:27.780> disadvantage<00:01:28.250> put

that<00:03:00.599> you<00:03:00.900> know<00:03:01.019> second<00:03:01.349> edition<00:03:01.709> just<00:03:01.799> add<00:03:02.010> a

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
that you know second edition just add a

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.099 
that you know second edition just add a
little<00:03:02.340> bit<00:03:02.489> more<00:03:02.639> health<00:03:03.030> all<00:03:03.569> right<00:03:03.840> so

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
little bit more health all right so

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.020 
little bit more health all right so
let's<00:03:04.739> say<00:03:04.889> they'll<00:03:05.159> last<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.700> two<00:03:05.879> more

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
let's say they'll last like two more

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.530 
let's say they'll last like two more
dashes<00:03:06.569> then<00:03:06.959> on<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.409> demo<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:08.700> when<00:03:09.419> they're

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
dashes then on the demo but when they're

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.670 
dashes then on the demo but when they're
gone<00:03:09.720> they're<00:03:09.780> gone<00:03:10.079> for<00:03:10.319> good

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
gone they're gone for good

gone they're gone for good
okay<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.280> think<00:03:11.609> that's<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.299> big<00:03:12.689> issue

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
okay I think that's like the big issue

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.140 
okay I think that's like the big issue
here<00:03:13.049> that<00:03:13.500> they're<00:03:13.919> able<00:03:14.099> to<00:03:14.250> come<00:03:14.489> back<00:03:14.790> and

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
here that they're able to come back and

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.479 
here that they're able to come back and
it's<00:03:15.629> like<00:03:15.750> nothing<00:03:15.900> happened<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:17.099> feels

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
it's like nothing happened so it feels

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.089 
it's like nothing happened so it feels
kind<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.849> stupid<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.389> redundant<00:03:18.840> now<00:03:19.650> the

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
kind of stupid and redundant now the

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.280 
kind of stupid and redundant now the
next<00:03:20.430> thing<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:20.639> the<00:03:20.760> head<00:03:20.940> boxes<00:03:21.479> there's<00:03:22.199> a

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
there's been a few instances where for
