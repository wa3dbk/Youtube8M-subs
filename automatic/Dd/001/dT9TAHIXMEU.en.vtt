k

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.499 

I<00:01:53.049> do<00:01:54.049> you<00:01:54.200> think<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.520> foundation<00:01:56.270> of

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
I do you think that the foundation of

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.270 
I do you think that the foundation of
our<00:01:56.659> part<00:01:56.900> of<00:01:56.960> our<00:01:57.049> band<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.470> know<00:01:57.500> majority

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
our part of our band you know majority

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.340 
our part of our band you know majority
of<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.490> probably<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.299> more<00:01:59.930> than<00:02:00.140> metal

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
of it probably a more than metal

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.240 
of it probably a more than metal
percentile<00:02:01.000> but<00:02:02.000> um<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:03.380> know<00:02:03.500> just<00:02:03.710> like<00:02:04.130> all

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
percentile but um you know just like all

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.710 
percentile but um you know just like all
the<00:02:04.280> all<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.640> other<00:02:04.850> elements<00:02:05.030> in<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.450> music

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
the all the other elements in the music

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.770 
the all the other elements in the music
huh<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:07.250> know<00:02:07.340> offset<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.149> definitely

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
huh you know offset it I definitely

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.210 
huh you know offset it I definitely
think<00:02:09.020> that<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.350> know<00:02:09.440> but<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.679> derivative<00:02:10.190> of

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
think that you know but a derivative of

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.520 
think that you know but a derivative of
metal<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:10.789> yeah<00:02:11.660> I<00:02:11.690> just<00:02:11.900> think<00:02:12.170> it's<00:02:12.260> done<00:02:12.410> in

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
metal in yeah I just think it's done in

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.130 
metal in yeah I just think it's done in
a<00:02:12.590> different<00:02:12.890> way<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.040> mean<00:02:13.310> it's<00:02:13.400> not<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:14.140> way

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
a different way I mean it's not the way

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.770 
a different way I mean it's not the way
that<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.980> metal<00:02:16.459> traditionally<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.269> done<00:02:17.750> I

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
that that metal traditionally is done I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.199 
that that metal traditionally is done I
think<00:02:17.930> um<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.280> took<00:02:19.550> some<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.880> some<00:02:20.180> of

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
think um it just took some of some of

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.930 
think um it just took some of some of
the<00:02:20.420> basic<00:02:20.989> idea<00:02:21.310> or<00:02:22.310> just<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.700> know<00:02:22.730> the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
the basic idea or just you know the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.449 
the basic idea or just you know the
heaviness<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.269> it<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.860> know<00:02:24.980> just<00:02:25.190> added

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
heaviness of it and you know just added

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.750 
heaviness of it and you know just added
new<00:02:25.580> elements<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.209> it<00:02:26.420> made<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.870> what<00:02:26.989> it<00:02:27.019> is

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
new elements and it made it what it is

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.030 
new elements and it made it what it is
do<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:28.850> think<00:02:29.090> Deftones<00:02:29.989> fills<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.830> hole

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
do you think Deftones fills the hole

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.940 
do you think Deftones fills the hole

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
it was passé and it was it lasted for a

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.740 
it was passé and it was it lasted for a
couple<00:03:07.400> years<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.940> then<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.150> was<00:03:08.239> gone<00:03:08.299> and

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
couple years and then it was gone and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.599 
couple years and then it was gone and
our<00:03:09.560> main<00:03:09.709> golden<00:03:10.070> span<00:03:10.280> i<00:03:10.310> think<00:03:10.519> is

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
our main golden span i think is

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.870 
our main golden span i think is
longevity<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:12.260> i<00:03:12.470> think<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.859> only<00:03:13.040> way<00:03:13.250> that

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
longevity and i think the only way that

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.759 
longevity and i think the only way that
we're<00:03:14.030> going<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.209> continue<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.870> have<00:03:15.079> that

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
we're going to continue to have that

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.220 
we're going to continue to have that
longevity<00:03:15.950> is<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.510> stand<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.079> our<00:03:18.109> own

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
longevity is to is to stand on our own

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.949 
longevity is to is to stand on our own
and<00:03:18.799> be<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.220> just<00:03:19.459> be<00:03:19.640> our<00:03:19.760> own<00:03:19.880> band<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.450> try

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
and be and just be our own band and try

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.660 
and be and just be our own band and try
not<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.200> fit<00:03:21.500> in<00:03:21.620> too<00:03:21.769> much<00:03:21.950> with<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.220> certain

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
not to fit in too much with a certain
