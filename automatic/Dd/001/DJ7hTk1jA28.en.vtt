00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
notice it um one I fixed the black line

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.440 
notice it um one I fixed the black line
at<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.570> top<00:02:57.720> which<00:02:58.590> isn't<00:02:58.890> hard<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.280> i<00:03:00.030> added

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
at the top which isn't hard and i added

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.520 
at the top which isn't hard and i added
a<00:03:00.570> color<00:03:00.750> correction<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> make<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.410> look<00:03:01.500> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
a color correction to make it look a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.100 
a color correction to make it look a
little<00:03:01.620> more<00:03:01.769> than<00:03:02.310> we're<00:03:02.459> pretty<00:03:02.910> full<00:03:03.269> we

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
little more than we're pretty full we

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.630

think about the color correction if you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.350 
think about the color correction if you
liked<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.300> in<00:03:12.450> bath<00:03:12.930> before<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:14.340> way<00:03:14.610> you

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
liked it in bath before this way you

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.550 
liked it in bath before this way you
guys<00:03:15.450> don't<00:03:15.720> like<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:15.989> one<00:03:16.200> I'll<00:03:16.320> try

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
guys don't like this one I'll try

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.650 
guys don't like this one I'll try
another<00:03:16.830> one<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.430> see<00:03:17.700> how<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.910> works<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.329> think

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
another one and see how it works I think

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.990 
another one and see how it works I think
it<00:03:18.750> looks<00:03:18.900> nice<00:03:19.049> um<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:20.070> obviously<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.640> do<00:03:20.820> my

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
it looks nice um but obviously you do my

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.479 
it looks nice um but obviously you do my
exported<00:03:21.930> or<00:03:22.110> imported<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.920> little<00:03:23.100> different

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
exported or imported a little different

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.420 
exported or imported a little different
and<00:03:23.670> uh<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.900> know<00:03:24.930> fuck<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.500> up<00:03:25.709> but<00:03:26.310> other

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
and uh you know fuck it up but other

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.740 
and uh you know fuck it up but other
than<00:03:26.519> that<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.820> know<00:03:26.850> that's<00:03:27.269> really<00:03:27.480> that

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
than that you know that's really that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.970 
than that you know that's really that
that's<00:03:28.079> that's<00:03:28.350> all<00:03:28.530> about<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.799> color

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
that's that's all about the color

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.979 
that's that's all about the color
correction<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.430> think<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.090> looks<00:03:30.120> good<00:03:30.329> I<00:03:30.570> think

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
correction I think it looks good I think

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.170 
correction I think it looks good I think
the<00:03:31.049> vector<00:03:31.410> looks<00:03:31.590> even<00:03:31.920> better<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.549> don't

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
the vector looks even better I don't

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.340 
the vector looks even better I don't
like<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.420> vector<00:03:33.720> like<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.079> what<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
like the vector like the what the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.750 
like the vector like the what the
diamonds<00:03:34.500> on<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:34.829> because<00:03:35.130> i<00:03:35.190> think<00:03:35.549> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
diamonds on it because i think the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.009 
diamonds on it because i think the
Diamonds<00:03:36.120> where<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.510> diamonds<00:03:36.780> are<00:03:36.840> look

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
Diamonds where the diamonds are look

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.819 
Diamonds where the diamonds are look
stupid<00:03:37.500> but<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.930> let's<00:03:39.930> just<00:03:40.140> be<00:03:40.290> let
