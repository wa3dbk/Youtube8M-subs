smooth and that's one thing some roms

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.679 
smooth and that's one thing some roms
really<00:00:21.990> black<00:00:22.609> but<00:00:23.609> I'm<00:00:23.760> glad<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
really smooth I might actually keep this

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.380 
really smooth I might actually keep this
one<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.789> long<00:00:26.970> time<00:00:28.640> if<00:00:29.640> suppose<00:00:29.970> roms<00:00:30.240> I
