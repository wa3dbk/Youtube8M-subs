00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
a problem for us really but um the light

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.910 
a problem for us really but um the light
fixture<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> living<00:00:58.469> room<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.800> all

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
fixture in the living room it's all

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.860 
fixture in the living room it's all
melted<00:00:59.370> because<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.090> flames<00:01:00.390> because<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
melted because of the flames because the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.380 
melted because of the flames because the
flames<00:01:01.109> are<00:01:01.320> about<00:01:01.500> six<00:01:01.920> feet<00:01:02.100> high<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.609> I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
flames are about six feet high and I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.119 
flames are about six feet high and I
guess<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> heat<00:01:04.110> melt<00:01:04.530> melted<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
guess just the heat melt melted the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.090 
guess just the heat melt melted the
fixture<00:01:05.930> wait<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.350> from<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.590> fireplace

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.950 
probably burned up the carpet a little
bit<00:01:54.079> um<00:01:55.640> I'm<00:01:56.640> thinking<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.299> could<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.600> fire

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
bit um I'm thinking that could be a fire

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.240 
bit um I'm thinking that could be a fire
hazard<00:01:58.070> no<00:01:59.070> I<00:02:00.060> don't<00:02:00.719> think<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.229> because<00:02:02.040> I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
hazard no I don't think so because I

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.069 
hazard no I don't think so because I
mean<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> boulders<00:02:03.060> surrounding<00:02:03.930> it

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
mean we have the boulders surrounding it

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.980 
mean we have the boulders surrounding it
so<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> fire<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.579> know<00:02:05.909> get<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:06.240> onto

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
so the fire can you know get out onto

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.419 
so the fire can you know get out onto
the<00:02:07.079> couches<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.680> stuff<00:02:07.950> what<00:02:08.160> kind<00:02:08.369> of

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the couches and stuff what kind of

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.609 
the couches and stuff what kind of
boulders<00:02:08.819> are<00:02:09.000> they<00:02:09.179> they're<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.110> really

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
