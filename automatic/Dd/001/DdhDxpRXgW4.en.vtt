I<00:04:15.620> just<00:04:15.949> did<00:04:16.280> one<00:04:16.459> on<00:04:16.719> my

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230

I just did one on my
right<00:04:18.740> side<00:04:19.040> and<00:04:19.340> now<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.430> did<00:04:19.700> one<00:04:19.850> on<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.060> left

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
right side and now I did one on the left

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.850 
right side and now I did one on the left
side<00:04:20.450> I'm<00:04:20.600> just<00:04:20.780> crossing<00:04:21.050> them<00:04:21.470> over<00:04:21.740> each

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
side I'm just crossing them over each

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:30.250 
side I'm just crossing them over each
other<00:04:22.040> so<00:04:22.480> it<00:04:23.480> stays<00:04:23.780> put<00:04:26.650> okay<00:04:29.050> there<00:04:30.050> goes

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
other so it stays put okay there goes

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.670 
other so it stays put okay there goes
third<00:04:30.650> one<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:32.450> that's<00:04:32.930> how<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:34.010> looks<00:04:34.310> now

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
third one so that's how it looks now
