00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
their ponds for 8 x 10 but two foot deep

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.620 
their ponds for 8 x 10 but two foot deep
that's<00:02:21.770> going<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.070> be<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.220> smaller<00:02:22.610> liner<00:02:23.000> than

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
that's going to be a smaller liner than

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.050 
that's going to be a smaller liner than

behind me along the fence line that runs
about<00:02:46.370> 20<00:02:46.760> feet<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.510> you're<00:02:47.990> not<00:02:48.170> locked<00:02:48.590> in

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
about 20 feet so you're not locked in

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.890 
about 20 feet so you're not locked in
that<00:02:48.980> side<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.550> always<00:02:49.880> get<00:02:50.210> an<00:02:50.360> exercise

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
that side you can always get an exercise

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.280 
that side you can always get an exercise
liner<00:02:51.460> or<00:02:52.460> just<00:02:53.240> an<00:02:53.360> extra<00:02:53.660> piece<00:02:53.840> of<00:02:53.900> liner

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
liner or just an extra piece of liner

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.010 
liner or just an extra piece of liner
and<00:02:54.530> add<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.910> your<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.360> know<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.540> your<00:02:56.780> pond

with the rock necklace you can be a
little<00:03:04.700> creative<00:03:04.970> in<00:03:05.510> fact<00:03:05.780> on<00:03:06.050> this<00:03:06.380> one<00:03:06.590> I'm

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
little creative in fact on this one I'm

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.700 
little creative in fact on this one I'm
standing<00:03:07.820> on<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.840> skimmer<00:03:09.170> I've<00:03:09.440> got<00:03:09.680> a

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
standing on the skimmer I've got a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.980 
standing on the skimmer I've got a
little<00:03:09.860> hatch<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.640> can<00:03:11.000> open<00:03:11.150> up<00:03:11.390> right

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
little hatch that I can open up right

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.110 
little hatch that I can open up right
underneath<00:03:12.320> my<00:03:12.530> feet<00:03:12.740> and<00:03:13.010> get<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.670> my<00:03:13.790> skimmer

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
underneath my feet and get to my skimmer

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.520 
underneath my feet and get to my skimmer
so<00:03:14.660> there's<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.930> lot<00:03:15.020> of<00:03:15.080> different<00:03:15.170> ways<00:03:15.380> you

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.920 
so there's a lot of different ways you
can<00:03:15.740> work<00:03:16.070> with<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:16.340> pond<00:03:16.610> kit<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.330> make<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.750> look

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
can work with a pond kit to make it look

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.110 
can work with a pond kit to make it look
very<00:03:18.140> unique<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.760> know<00:03:19.850> like<00:03:20.090> a

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
very unique and you know like a

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.020 
very unique and you know like a
custom-built<00:03:20.750> pond<00:03:21.310> but<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:22.460> save<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.850> money

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
custom-built pond but you save the money

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.820 
custom-built pond but you save the money
and<00:03:23.240> you<00:03:23.330> have<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.230> advantage<00:03:24.350> of<00:03:24.680> knowing

and you have the advantage of knowing

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.530 
and you have the advantage of knowing
everything<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.340> going<00:03:25.460> to<00:03:25.490> work<00:03:25.550> right<00:03:26.270> out<00:03:26.330> of
