00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.020
 Hello and welcome to a new show showed flag we are yes 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.369
 today on the beautiful riding facility Pegasus in Wülfrath takes place here today 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.599
 our second round or he said ours with correct that 2 and then drives 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:26.649
 Concerts instead 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.789
 We all started in the West on the 16th of December Achim Corporation 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.899
 with Cavallo Luis the equestrian fans on Friday wiki-watch us of course 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.650
 major construction projects Sarnoff 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.600
 and how now comes to him to my partners 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.870
 here is Linda Weber we have given everything now you have something completely 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.380
 especially designed for our contest 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.130
 now shoot all districts 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.900
 The Reisholzer team member I'm especially into psychology and 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.460
 the communication between horse and human 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.670
 and there have to be some questions SID superficially harmless 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.700
 but I think so if exactly look at the answers 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.320
 then he wants to know how the relationship between the two is I caught it 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.550
 stop abroad 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.100
 the participants humanize their horse 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.600
 on the one hand or 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.450
 maybe on the other hand that's too fair to consider this 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.670
 an interesting question and so that clarify these answers 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.660
 what is based on a questionnaire so we can really get out there then 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.340
 the relationship between horse and rider what scythe contest indispensable 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.170
 really is 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.030
 definitely Viennese urban 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.140
 Marketing Manager Ulrike Beck and would rather feel the arrived 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.140
 candidates 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.909
 However, before it went to the interviewed shoot filled the candidates 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.330
 in a relaxed atmosphere the communication delayed by our technical experts 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
 rather would be designed questionnaires 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.290
 close to the island in southern Andes 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.140
 that is a quarter lower Volksbank Münster 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.840
 for the deadly at all, as I do that at the moment it will be the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.420
 appropriate attitude, we must be very important that with the message has part 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.469
 2 0 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.019
 from there flew and if that land is agreed that is 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.359
 It is pleased that Vienna is compensating reports from the outside 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.409
 Feels comfortable in Istanbul and Becker could really deliver 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.619
 Attentions fulfilled by me at the very least realized reasons 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:30.449
 satisfied 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.949
 what is involved with our guests 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:34.899
 January 2010 draw 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.619
 who presented these findings 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.529
 So I can say my opinion 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:44.129
 it's so I'm always serious but also Matt Cooke that's good at it 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.909
 collaborate that the rockers are that they are interested and then 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.729
 Of course he also comes nominal voltage newspaper in the face maybe work out 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:56.679
 the ears down when you scratch us so I just think you can tell 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:00.239
 It also increases whether the well-aware money is a community on 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.509
 The field shines but when a desire to do something then he feels 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.419
 I think I train her 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.799
 Never again what do you think are the five most important needs of his horse 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.389
 So I definitely think the day before water 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.269
 welfare and in any case the 11 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.469
 come out relaxed and capable of doing well for 11 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.089
 if I trashed the wrong ones 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:29.079
 After the accident that is not different I realize that my client currently has 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.549
 frank-walter Steinmeier learn to speak 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.919
 It's not hard to put it down to punishment 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.640
 that you feel comfortable exercising putting the internet in persistent trends 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:43.579
 hold back first is that I am not after the storms my weight 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.739
 shift 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.739
 and so on, so to speak, a second and then 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.159
 the voice comes to it 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.550
 the Internet 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.609
 Only old ones underwent the deadline for it to go on 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.259
 and at the end then sometime if he does not come to Bremen 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.289
 wants to change 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:05.959
 that are necessary 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.280
 if I feel it now, it will be long 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.769
 that's right 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.530
 I think I had to first think about what problems it has alleged 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:14.669
 in The Hague 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:19.180
 and that is human once the both surface pendant 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.549
 to recruit the narrower 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.930
 of Mustafa slowly work alongside it and think me first and 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.539
 torn stubborn 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.280
 but not to anyone talking about this topic that sour a nice that me 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.150
 anyway, the horse was over 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.009
 Stendal 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.990
 even a little bit of freedom to give up after that and it by doing so 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.240
 successful 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.689
 Paris RP 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.689
 who finally made us trust again 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:46.490
 Super 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.480
 here you can find in our special 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.860
 and why 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.410
 as a judge or he means first of all Iverson with previous day 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:55.819
 because I think so 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.940
 these are values ​​out of the company most interested in FOTA 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.780
 And anyone who does not know Bernhard can not do it fast 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.270
 other 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.889
 with little exercise to give way to food and thus is quite clear for the feast 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.340
 to distinguish between what I can well done 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.940
 Brennan that was bad done that is for me the most important ban 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.040
 Forever the NZ who does not know yet Leckerlis is a nonsense about most 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.480
 Furthermore, it was first time but you can achieve almost anything with treats 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.080
 some people 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.750
 At the last minute Steffi could not welcome any candidates in the 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.939
 short interview 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:37.939
 because he's far too late because of the devastating weather 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.779
 Petkovic spread the FTC 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.339
 every day it comes in at more than 30 percent 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:50.039
 of course, if you already benefited for the first 30 and come 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.449
 visibly pleased 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.449
 Frankfurt is ready 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.680
 40 30 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.680
 there died oec 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.690
 his followers that that too so we come from the reform also BP that it 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:12.699
 no other way than now it's your turn to be open to all participants 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.120
 are happening on the time-threatened side 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.830
 when exactly this is the case of the Federal Returning Officer 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.770
 order here we have ten finalists who will be on the big one 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.969
 be invited to open-air event times 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.330
 he assumes that it is more to say the goal is that the federal government 

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:30.249
 Freedom and that I can also very excited about who used the race 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:31.789
 Be sure 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.600
 Anyway are very interesting then could trier-ruwer
