00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.400
 hello to all these sharks meet again 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.600
 for a new video on gt online and 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.730
 today we will talk about the stimulus 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.689
 package that was finally delivered to 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.070
 gta players online so what is that 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.839
 is that the stimulus package if you 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.429
 have missed in fact it's due to the 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.019
 connection problems that had at 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.869
 throwing throw rockstar line 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.640
 thought we're going to give 500 thousand dollars 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.110
 to players who played during the month 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.239
 of October all the players who played 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.100
 during the month of October received 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.840
 normally today on their account 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.170
 in bank I was in India 500 thousand 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.699
 dollars 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.109
 at first they said they would do 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:47.059
 it turns into two times two 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.980
 transfers of $ 250 thousand but 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.019
 did I receive a transfer of 500 thousand 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.579
 dollars directly so I do not know 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.550
 if there are any we have not received 2 or not 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.129
 tell me if you are different there is 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.899
 the update that was done there are two 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.570
 days I believe now and it has not 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.940
 changed a lot about glitches 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.670
 duplicating cars 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.730
 get the police cars into his 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.650
 garage and even money I think I 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.690
 by trying again the silver glitch 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.280
 but if someone tried I well 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.170
 that leaves the info in the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.660
 comments that's about it all 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.370
 what is news about gta 5 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.600
 lately they have not launched yet 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.230
 their weekend social coop as he 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.110
 had announced 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.640
 good it should come later if 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.080
 you ge if you ever missed this 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.670
 what were social club weekends 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.470
 it's actually special weekends where 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.340
 we will have access to particular objects 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.320
 this is a bit of the gameplay 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.290
 now we know a little delirium we 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.180
 caught himself with a frozen crew member 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.420
 just transported to the top of the tower with 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.880
 the freighter is the one where loth 12 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.430
 actually I never had with his 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.060
 pretty 4 4 yellow you will see who he has 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.340
 rolled and landed without exploding in 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.260
 downstairs it's really quite surprising 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.660
 was on a normal session I 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.180
 do not understand why we did 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.650
 photos a little before I want to enjoy 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.050
 also of this video that is doing heins put 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.790
 on the crew so the crous and gta 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.080
 5 x arc to find you the link of a 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.060
 exception of course if you are 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.860
 again and that you arrive one is 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.860
 currently 86 members 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.320
 at the time I'm recording this video it 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.890
 is there a leader a commissioner who is 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.440
 drake 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.840
 we have six lieutenant 21 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.670
 representative and muscles 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.590
 here we would be cool if we reached 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.880
 the 100 members 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.780
 this weekend it could be really 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.700
 nice and so at the beginning of the videos 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.070
 I did not know how it was going 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.480
 turn I told myself we'll discuss 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.040
 on what she actually puts on skype 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.989
 it's a bit too mess because 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.370
 have to add people and everything so 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.230
 it's not too practical, I prefer 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.390
 that 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.980
 I was recommended to use my bowl 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.450
 and so I think we're going to spend on 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.440
 mumble actually on meuse who is well 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.390
 we can do different things 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.409
 rooms and so if there are people who 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.430
 want to run errands that there are 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.360
 people who want to make survival 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.890
 that there are people who want to make 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.360
 deathmatch is enough to put yourself in a 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.590
 room and then the people who will come 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.780
 in this room you will be able to discuss 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.480
 than this theme and it will be really 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.129
 perfect for the life of a crew and especially 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.930
 you to have fun for Easter and 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.819
 people who talk about deathmatch while 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.459
 you are in a survival mode you are 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.769
 trying to survivors at the 20th ring 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.660
 so that's to simplify the 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.829
 things that I want to do that and for that 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.110
 everyone can talk a little 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.970
 with everyone and exchange two 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.410
 rooms from time to time you go 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.420
 find all the information for 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.220
 connect to my bowl in the 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.129
 description of this video so watch 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.109
 all that stuff or download soft mumble 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.180
 is also available on ipad on 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.150
 iphone and on android sure for people 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.950
 who use their ipad their iphone or 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.750
 their android to communicate next to 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.640
 their playstation 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.750
 so normally it should satisfy 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.030
 just about everyone 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.069
 I hope you'll like it 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.579
 do not hesitate to tell me what you are 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.889
 think 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.380
 it's always nice to have 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.870
 returns and so for now this same 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.069
 tired people a mumble of 12 seats but 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.720
 if there are people who come in 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.069
 the more it will be enough to play I will pass 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.459
 the soft word in unlimited and one 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.329
 understands to go much more than that 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.859
 I hope you enjoy 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.870
 always my videos do not hesitate to 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.030
 suggest series suggestions that 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.070
 you want to do with me I want 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.769
 also to remind you that I have 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.130
 disable notifications on the 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.510
 playstation network for not that 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.450
 swarm in my videos when I get 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.550
 a message a friend request so this is 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.830
 for that I usually read very 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.660
 very few my messages on psn i'm doing 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.099
 that when I turn on my playstation and 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.260
 when I turn it off so do not worry 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.000
 not if I do not read them it goes a lot 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.039
 faster to go to the crew site and 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.380
 to sent a message there because this 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.660
 site there I read it every day or 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.190
 several times a day so really so 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.199
 you want to communicate with me it's 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.820
 the best place to do it otherwise 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.530
 there is on skype you can see me 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.630
 always the message is on youtube 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.889
 but the psn is not something that 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.080
 I 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.999
 read a lot a lot here I hope 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.860
 that you enjoyed this video that 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.930
 which is rather long with a lot 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.120
 information but I think it's 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.710
 not bad and it sends a message to 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.270
 at least every member of the crew that 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.129
 I do not have the chance to meet all 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.069
 days on the servers since they are a 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.439
 little bit limited in place do not hesitate 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.210
 to share it with your friends 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.789
 are members of the crew also for 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.930
 that they have the info and as I say if 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.529
 you have questions or questions 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.150
 suggestions 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.349
 it's in the comments that it's 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.349
 go go ciao
