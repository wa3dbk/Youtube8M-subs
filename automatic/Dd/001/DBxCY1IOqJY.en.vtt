that<00:06:51.180> way<00:06:51.389> we<00:06:51.659> are<00:06:51.689> we<00:06:52.620> sort<00:06:52.860> of<00:06:52.919> experienced

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
that way we are we sort of experienced

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:55.639 
that way we are we sort of experienced
whether<00:06:53.819> rich<00:06:54.089> or<00:06:54.210> poor<00:06:54.569> the<00:06:54.960> same<00:06:55.139> hunger

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:58.219 
whether rich or poor the same hunger
here<00:06:56.550> it's<00:06:56.729> difficult<00:06:57.000> because<00:06:57.389> wherever<00:06:57.990> you

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
here it's difficult because wherever you

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:00.139 
here it's difficult because wherever you
go<00:06:58.409> there's<00:06:58.589> food<00:06:58.830> and<00:06:59.009> you<00:06:59.099> can<00:06:59.279> smell<00:06:59.639> it

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
and from here really sometimes find it

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.709 
and from here really sometimes find it
hard<00:07:03.830> at<00:07:04.830> that<00:07:05.129> time<00:07:05.490> the<00:07:06.089> Quraysh<00:07:06.449> had

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:06.719 
hard at that time the Quraysh had

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:08.659 
hard at that time the Quraysh had
decided<00:07:07.110> to<00:07:07.409> pick<00:07:07.589> off<00:07:07.800> the<00:07:08.039> weaker<00:07:08.460> members

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:08.669 
decided to pick off the weaker members

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:10.790 
decided to pick off the weaker members
who<00:07:09.330> didn't<00:07:09.659> have<00:07:09.810> strong<00:07:10.080> tribal

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
who didn't have strong tribal

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.250 
who didn't have strong tribal
allegiances<00:07:11.069> and<00:07:11.839> some<00:07:12.839> of<00:07:12.990> the<00:07:13.169> torches

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260 
allegiances and some of the torches

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.890 
allegiances and some of the torches
they<00:07:14.530> suffered<00:07:15.100> were<00:07:15.760> horrendous<00:07:16.480> you<00:07:16.840> know

they suffered were horrendous you know

they suffered were horrendous you know
we<00:07:17.500> might<00:07:17.950> think<00:07:18.160> it's<00:07:18.370> difficult<00:07:18.910> to<00:07:19.330> walk

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:19.510 
we might think it's difficult to walk

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.480 
we might think it's difficult to walk
down<00:07:19.720> makes<00:07:20.020> and<00:07:20.260> keyword<00:07:20.620> each<00:07:20.950> other<00:07:21.190> today
