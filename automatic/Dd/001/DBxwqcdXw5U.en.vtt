00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.210
 so that 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.219
 come to life for natural nails after 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.009
 as 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.039
 decided to get rid of artificial over 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.560
 artificial material on the nails 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.239
 we need abrasive material then 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.460
 There are files easier to put it 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:36.220
 what kind of blades are we going to use in 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:40.190
 this option we need a file 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:44.089
 240 grit it in that case 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.180
 if you had gel on your nails 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.070
 removed very easily therefore more 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.439
 rough abrasiveness is not necessary to take 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.059
 because you are his artificial style 

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:56.839
 material can and do harm to natural 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.570
 nail because not always comfortable left 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.299
 hand on right 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.600
 work clients therefore I advise you to take 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:09.189
 squirrels darling less abrasive for 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:14.200
 in order to better perform 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:19.369
 on ourselves this or that let's say the function 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:22.250
 file 240 grit for acrylic can take 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.909
 file 150 120 grit it in that case 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.500
 you still have so much to say on your nails 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.500
 materials not precipitation 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.390
 2 plug is a grinder 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.150
 after you remove more 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.979
 amount of nail material 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.010
 I turn your natural nail 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.390
 Attention 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.610
 in order not to injure 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.130
 natural plate after you 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.320
 will work 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.320
 abrasive tool item you 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.660
 monaco you will need a grinder for 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.170
 order to remove from the surface of the nail 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.980
 rough strips from those that are left from 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.780
 first tool 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.810
 the grinder can be of different abrasivity 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.170
 they are such as they are in the saw blade 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.630
 the form 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.220
 vacuum de blocks with what you have 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.970
 home at hand basically you can 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.250
 use as a grinder 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.250
 the next tool is a polisher 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.460
 double-sided polisher for 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.940
 order to even more smoothly and make 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.520
 surface more smooth after 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.440
 we worked the grinder so the third 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.320
 The tool is our polishing and 4 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.860
 the tool is a file for natural 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.430
 nails to the final 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.130
 stage to give the nail shape that is 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.400
 highlight shape on free edge 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.830
 nail does not matter natural or 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.950
 artificial after you have gone 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.400
 all stages of removing artificial residues 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.540
 material you will need to shape 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.910
 for natural nails 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.269
 we will use proteins like this 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:11.540
 Here is a thin she on metal 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:14.040
 protein-based very good quality 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.660
 can be used as at home 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.590
 conditions so and professionals this 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.959
 professional 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.209
 fork for artificial nails who 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.319
 artificial nails are still you 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.920
 keep the length 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.480
 can use a file 180 grit 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:34.220
 which you originally used 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.220
 removing artificial material from nails
