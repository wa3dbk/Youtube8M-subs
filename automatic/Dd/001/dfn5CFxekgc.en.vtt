regular<00:01:11.899> analog<00:01:12.899> one<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.689> it's<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.719> pretty

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
regular analog one so it's a pretty

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.700 
regular analog one so it's a pretty
decent<00:01:16.350> looking<00:01:16.759> display<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.530> as<00:01:19.530> far<00:01:19.649> as

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
legroom is concerned it's pretty decent

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.520 
legroom is concerned it's pretty decent
as<00:01:23.280> well<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.869> let's<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.079> look<00:01:25.200> at<00:01:25.380> the
