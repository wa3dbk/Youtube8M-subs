when<00:00:06.510> that<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.750> arm<00:00:07.019> breaks<00:00:07.319> an<00:00:07.559> opposite<00:00:08.010> way

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
when that the arm breaks an opposite way

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.310 
when that the arm breaks an opposite way
you<00:00:08.910> know<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.240> would<00:00:09.450> have<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.719> pretend<00:00:10.110> it's

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
you know I would have to pretend it's

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.820 
you know I would have to pretend it's
breaking<00:00:11.419> it<00:00:12.419> was<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> lot<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.900> like<00:00:13.169> stretching

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
breaking it was a lot of like stretching

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.709 
breaking it was a lot of like stretching
I<00:00:13.980> should<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.249> done<00:00:14.370> some<00:00:14.580> yoga<00:00:14.969> before<00:00:15.389> but

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
I should have done some yoga before but

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.540 
I should have done some yoga before but
it<00:00:16.139> was<00:00:16.289> hard<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.680> me<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.860> just<00:00:17.039> get<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.280> weird

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
it was hard for me to just get in weird

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.250 
it was hard for me to just get in weird
positions<00:00:17.790> and<00:00:18.240> pretend<00:00:18.540> like<00:00:18.570> okay<00:00:19.050> now

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
positions and pretend like okay now

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.230 
positions and pretend like okay now
you're<00:00:19.440> now<00:00:19.920> your<00:00:20.070> arms<00:00:20.370> breaking<00:00:20.850> their<00:00:21.060> arm

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
you're now your arms breaking their arm

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.840 
you're now your arms breaking their arm
breaking<00:00:21.660> was<00:00:22.160> actually<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.310> just<00:00:23.340> ended<00:00:23.790> up

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
breaking was actually we just ended up

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.420 
breaking was actually we just ended up
replacing<00:00:24.240> his<00:00:25.080> arm<00:00:25.530> completely<00:00:25.950> with<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
muscles etc after that we have the actor

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.639 
muscles etc after that we have the actor
scanned<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.880> 3d<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.140> track<00:00:52.620> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
scanned in 3d and then we track that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.830 
scanned in 3d and then we track that
geometry<00:00:53.370> lines<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> real<00:00:54.300> actor<00:00:54.660> and

geometry lines with a real actor and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.750 
geometry lines with a real actor and
then<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.110> match<00:00:55.560> the<00:00:55.800> lighting<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.250> set<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
then we match the lighting on set and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.360 
then we match the lighting on set and
textures<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.840> shading<00:01:01.130> Wolfe's<00:01:02.130> have<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
textures and the shading Wolfe's have a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.880 
textures and the shading Wolfe's have a

about<00:01:08.179> transforming<00:01:09.179> a<00:01:09.270> human<00:01:09.689> into<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> wolf

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
about transforming a human into a wolf

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.279 
about transforming a human into a wolf
part<00:01:11.579> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> process<00:01:12.539> that<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.929> wanted<00:01:13.200> to

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
part of the process that we wanted to

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.039 
part of the process that we wanted to
show<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.340> painful<00:01:14.880> transformation<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
show was the painful transformation of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.690 
show was the painful transformation of
saying<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:17.189> joint<00:01:17.789> reverses<00:01:18.600> itself

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
saying your joint reverses itself

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.709 
saying your joint reverses itself
transforming<00:01:20.700> from<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.030> joint<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.569> was<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
transforming from a joint that was a

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.050 
transforming from a joint that was a
human<00:01:22.109> joint<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.829> a<00:01:22.859> wolf's<00:01:23.280> trainer<00:01:23.609> from<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
human joint to a wolf's trainer from a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.080 
human joint to a wolf's trainer from a
human<00:01:24.810> hand<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> wolf<00:01:25.709> pod

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.030 

we<00:01:30.659> put<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> lot<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.140> tracking<00:01:31.500> marks<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
we put a lot of tracking marks on the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.090 
we put a lot of tracking marks on the
face<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.580> then<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.530> visually<00:01:34.530> grow<00:01:34.770> hair

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
face so then we can visually grow hair

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.969 
face so then we can visually grow hair
and<00:01:35.430> whiskers<00:01:35.640> from<00:01:36.270> from<00:01:36.869> his<00:01:36.990> real<00:01:37.170> face<00:01:37.409> so

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and whiskers from from his real face so

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.440 
and whiskers from from his real face so
we<00:01:38.130> would<00:01:38.310> track<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> computer-generated

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
we would track in a computer-generated

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.930 
we would track in a computer-generated
face<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.440> him<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.130> would<00:01:41.220> grow<00:01:41.460> it

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
face on to him and then we would grow it

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.910 
face on to him and then we would grow it
generated<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.600> hair<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.049> by<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:43.500> because

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
generated a hair and by now because

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.530 
generated a hair and by now because
you're<00:01:44.280> starting<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.820> real<00:01:45.030> human<00:01:45.210> face

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
you're starting with a real human face

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.920 
you're starting with a real human face
and<00:01:45.900> we<00:01:46.860> used<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.390> in-house<00:01:48.390> developed

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and we used that in-house developed

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.050 
and we used that in-house developed
software<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.590> allowed<00:01:49.890> us<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.100> deform<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
software that allowed us to deform a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.180 
software that allowed us to deform a
dog's<00:01:51.450> face<00:01:51.600> or<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> human<00:01:52.229> face<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.950> were<00:01:53.070> able

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
dog's face or a human face we were able

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.430 
dog's face or a human face we were able
to<00:01:53.340> take<00:01:53.580> his<00:01:53.880> face<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.570> distort<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.290> ways

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
to take his face and distort it in ways

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.930 
to take his face and distort it in ways
that<00:01:55.649> made<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.920> much<00:01:56.070> more<00:01:56.280> scary<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.850> yet

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
that made it much more scary and yet
