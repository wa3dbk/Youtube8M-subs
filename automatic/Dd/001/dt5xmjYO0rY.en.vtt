 generation 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:01:01.039
 it's not from dr 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.780
 designed according to his own image 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.119
 aim for the only known android

 great admiration of the admiralty 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.340
 he becomes more active as a star fleet

 emotion and ignorance of human 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.680
 eigenarten is data beginning even more likely 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.330
 but a kind of disturbance factor is in progress 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.490

 again people have like trains and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 thereby always humans becomes more like 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.530
 and its own crises shit 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.530
 lived through 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.729
 probably due to the currently active 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.970
 Hypes we have in sixth place 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.740
 Thick inflatable b-max created as 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.619
 health robot from the brother of 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.259

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.159
 to a sensitive hero gaddafi 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.630
 hamada is the name of the developer of the 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.239
 roboters has him with a 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.069
 incredible learning ability provided the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.630
 he allows situations quickly and 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.800
 actually have to estimate suitably 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.360
 We too much now 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.580
 from this latest film of demands 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.810
 So we're going to do it with a movie 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.010
 make a recommendation 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.380
 look at this movie 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.760
 he is still running I have problems with 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.610
 but putting is not bad we do 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:42.390
 simply further 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:44.640
 the governator i mean the model t 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.530
 800 that's not only extremely strong and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.510
 is brutal but also random 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.140
 looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger will 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:56.190
 in the year 2029 from the malicious ks 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.900
 skynet back to 1984 all over there 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.459
 he kill the mother of john connor the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.109
 in the future the resistance against 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.549
 skynet leads in comparison to the 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.980
 most other terminators which 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.019
 emotional ties frustration and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.150
 could play a certain humor 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.590
 the t 800 is almost perfect 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.720
 emotionless 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.340
 he has only the ability and 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.230
 Conversations the best possible 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.060
 but then answer should calculate 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.040
 not to be fulfilled for his sake kills 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.640
 he batting everything without batting an eyelid 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.660
 and everyone and everything and everyone 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.660
 already said everything and everyone 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.660
 emotionless the terminator is like that 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 is depressive place four years from per 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.340
 pickup by the galaxy marvin too 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.950
 known as marvin the paranoid android 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.750
 is one of sirius cybernetics 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.090
 Cooperation designed robot he is 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.760
 part of the equipment of the spaceship heart 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.440
 made of gold and incredibly intelligent first 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.269
 the first prototype for robots with 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.830
 real human personality image 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.990
 and is 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.730
 one has already mentioned permanently 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.870
 Depressed and complaining his hat 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.880
 the size of an entire planet 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.560
 which is why he also constant access 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.600
 because it simply can not be his 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.980
 to pay attention to the whole 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.910
 ability also gives them the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.620
 skills constant 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.330
 probability calculations 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.500
 create and how depressing that is 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.280
 we all know 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.660
 each one ever 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.520
 he is the probability calculus 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.010
 made of white as depressing 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.910
 that's why I'm so happy 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.910
 I have never had a 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.780
 in third place is a drunk 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.220
 smokey and above all nasty 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.810
 Candidate without any 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.360
 moral concepts or a certain 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.500
 and one does not speak of philippe 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.720
 I really love my bender 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.670
 futurama no luc philippe is not there 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.950
 is really called by real name 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.500
 By the way bender bender rodrigues wears 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.500
 the serial number so what he higher and 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.510
 is of type pentium june 22 that of matte 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.820
 groening and david axmann invented 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.620
 figure meets all anti-heroes clichés 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.270
 and also impresses with a general 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.850
 anti human attitude 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.710
 He is the absolute opposite of the 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.360
 standard robot image of the normal 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.010
 he is spoken of for the future 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.630
 in german by hans rainer müller der 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.600

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.300
 simpsons with 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:49.480
 in second place is the waste allocation 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.480
 according to lifter class short 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.139

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.699
 exploited and devastated earth 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.069
 he left alone 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.659
 glitch a personality as well as feelings 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.729
 He learned to develop one 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.780
 great curiosity and starts interesting 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.789
 to collect things 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.879
 the little loveable robot is 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.349
 it developed to collect garbage and 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:28.000
 blocks to squeeze but over the course of 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.770
 Decades begins to wonder if it is 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.750
 not even more about his little one 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:37.000
 robotic life could give as his 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:39.340

 situation nevertheless emotions reactions 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.810
 reflecting that makes him a very 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.570
 good emotional anchor within the
