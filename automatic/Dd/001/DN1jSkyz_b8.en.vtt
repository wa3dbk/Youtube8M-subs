00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.309
 that here I am directly mine can 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.920
 And that was my job for 60 days vegan 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.130
 live a self-experiment about that 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.380
 on stern de blob the idea came to me 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.759
 at work at stern where i like 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.599
 graphic artist for the title page 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.700
 responsible 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.230
 a colleague made me high 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.779
 attila hildmann attentive 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.550
 vegan that sounded to me until 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.500
 There always stand for the life of one 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.559
 horde hippies but what I saw then 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.480
 another type of crisp and healthy 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.690
 is trained and not so 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.820
 eco above all, but a lot of delicious 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.320
 looking recipes that made me 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.880
 curious, I could probably live like that 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.650
 within a self-experiment it led 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.300
 I keep weighing myself here in enns 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.950
 the first vegan supermarket in hamburg 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.680
 I can still do that before I go shopping 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.530
 a small smoothie at katharina 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.520
 hello i would like a carrot 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.520
 with lemon juice 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.540
 To live vegan means to change 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.980
 even when shopping as a vegan 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.600
 I do not just go without fish and 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.330
 meat as well as the vegetarians do it 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.330
 but on all animal products eg 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.310
 eggs milk and honey, I hope the lord 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.840
 photo futh beans and lentils are 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.310
 good replacement products that are important to me 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.530
 nutrients mainly provide protein and 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.660
 my by the way for newbies it is real 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.850
 whimsical thing on the shelves so one 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.450
 By the way , there's something totally here 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.940
 weird a whole complete vegan 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.400
 Turkey out side I have no idea 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.560
 who should eat something like that 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.560
 turkey there is something missing immediately 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.640
 and I do that a bit too 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.950
 actually always like meat 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.990
 biofleisch but even here 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.720
 I feel more and more often 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.490
 to support mass animal husbandry 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.380
 meat is so side dish and so on 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.149
 cheap like never before but I would like 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 do not support me instead 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.650
 conscious and sustainable change 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.660
 Today, therefore, there is a parsley 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.879
 salad for the I have a few more ingredients 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.410
 However , this is what you need 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.989
 Vegan shopping already clearly on 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.550
 wallet almost 80 euro but it's worth it 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.810
 I finally buy myself 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.849
 high quality food 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.380
 they may also cost something in general 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.760
 Plagues me during the eight weeks 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.190
 surprisingly little doubt 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.140
 I feel really great, but we do 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.690
 next to me such a guy in his suv stands 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.549
 nice a citizen in hand and me 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.470
 then my vegan shopping in the backpack 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.489
 stand beside it there one comes already 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.379
 kind of stupid 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.019
 why am I doing this? 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.640
 all the easier fish i miss 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.560
 during my experiment again and again 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.360
 and in my favorite restaurant the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.400
 devil cuisine I was almost at the 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:03:05.000
 lamb bratwurst become weak though 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:06.980
 I also managed that 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.120
 difficult it was easy at home my 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.489
 Woman was annoyed because the common 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.200
 Food became more and more expensive, especially 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.390
 because we also have two teenagers in the house 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.980
 I do not always have everything 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.430
 then started extra for me 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.810
 Cook 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.810
 that was the topic of the table 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.870
 that was my first taboo lee with quinoa 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.140
 instead of couscous and I think it tastes good 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.549
 really good out of the break over time 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.470
 of course I have some delicious ones 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.510
 tried the recipes and the best on 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.549
 my blog if it is 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.810
 So sometimes an inspiration should be missing 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.310
 Here are some ideas after 60 days vegan 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.870
 I can say that live 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.970
 Self-experiment was a real success 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.739
 I am doing very well and I can 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.579
 even only others advise it once 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.500
 try 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.629
 Of course sometimes it's hard to keep up 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.030
 but it might be worth it 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:59.920
 I rarely have a fish but now 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.920
 I definitely want to continue vegan
