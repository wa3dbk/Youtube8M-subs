 if nothing changes by michael fassbender 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.190
 incredible so written in two the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.790
 files we're not just freshly 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.960
 started 2015 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:16.070
 we are in territory so in two 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.780
 years ago assassin's creed the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.780
 movie was good 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.680
 in my opinion 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.680
 most not all the majority of 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.680
 films 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.550
 that are based on video games, so 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.520
 they took them out of video games are a 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.950
 crap they have nothing to do with 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.230
 a good egg I also understand that no 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.470
 you can put a game of one bronze 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.080
 from 15 to 16 hours in an hour 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.230
 in that part I also understand people 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.990
 what 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.770
 who develops films about 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.080
 video games but 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.960
 if they are going to do it they are professionals but 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.960
 They should do something for their amazing 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.750
 almost all 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.320
 but good 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.030
 that's my opinion so I hope not 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.250
 damage it 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.190
 so it looks like I'm going to make a wall 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.420
 expresses 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.710
 so the birds have subscribed in 2016 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.060
