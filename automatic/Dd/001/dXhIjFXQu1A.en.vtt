won't<00:01:17.040> get<00:01:17.190> some<00:01:17.370> nice<00:01:17.580> games

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450

one time

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.380 
one time
as<00:01:29.650> they<00:01:29.770> can<00:01:29.920> throw<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.370> end<00:01:30.610> zone<00:01:30.850> or<00:01:31.300> they

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
as they can throw the end zone or they

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.650 
as they can throw the end zone or they
can<00:01:31.540> come<00:01:31.750> underneath<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:34.060> use<00:01:34.270> their<00:01:34.480> last

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
can come underneath they use their last

timeout<00:01:35.230> I<00:01:35.290> thought<00:01:35.590> there<00:01:35.770> would<00:01:35.890> get<00:01:36.010> one

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
timeout I thought there would get one

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.360 
timeout I thought there would get one
more<00:01:36.400> playoff

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
more playoff

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.100 
more playoff
then<00:01:37.760> they<00:01:37.940> could<00:01:38.180> keep<00:01:38.360> throwing<00:01:38.660> anywhere

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
then they could keep throwing anywhere

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.990 
then they could keep throwing anywhere
they<00:01:39.260> wanted<00:01:39.740> knowing<00:01:40.160> they<00:01:40.250> had<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.430> timeout

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
they wanted knowing they had a timeout

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.060 
they wanted knowing they had a timeout
in<00:01:41.300> their<00:01:41.390> pocket<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.110> if<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.560> clock<00:01:42.800> was

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
in their pocket and if the clock was

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.960 
in their pocket and if the clock was
running<00:01:43.100> they<00:01:43.850> could<00:01:44.060> then<00:01:44.270> use<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.750> timeout

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
running they could then use the timeout

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.060 
running they could then use the timeout
