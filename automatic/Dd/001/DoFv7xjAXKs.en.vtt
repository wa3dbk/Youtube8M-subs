Chipotle Southwest sauce yet which I've
heard<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.420> amazing<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.469> yeah<00:01:34.649> though<00:01:35.310> it's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
heard is amazing but yeah though it's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.310 
heard is amazing but yeah though it's
not<00:01:35.579> too<00:01:35.729> bad<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.119> got<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.539> meal<00:01:36.810> deal<00:01:37.079> so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
not too bad I got it in the meal deal so

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.200 
not too bad I got it in the meal deal so
it's<00:01:37.469> three<00:01:37.890> pounds<00:01:38.429> for<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.969> drink

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
which i think is pretty reasonable for a

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.630 
which i think is pretty reasonable for a
good<00:01:41.369> lunch

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
good lunch

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.670
