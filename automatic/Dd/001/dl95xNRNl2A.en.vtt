up<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.659> system<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.799> already<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.460> tree<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
up the system we already have tree and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.039 
up the system we already have tree and
tripperz<00:01:58.560> set<00:01:59.280> up<00:01:59.490> along<00:01:59.850> our<00:02:00.180> five<00:02:00.840> meter

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
tripperz set up along our five meter

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.359 
tripperz set up along our five meter
long<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.729> holes<00:02:02.729> here<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.920> what<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.219> do

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
long and holes here so what you can do

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.119 
long and holes here so what you can do
really<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.210> set<00:02:06.450> your<00:02:06.810> papers<00:02:07.799> to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
really is you can set your papers to

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.919 
really is you can set your papers to
whatever<00:02:08.369> distance<00:02:08.970> apart<00:02:09.270> as<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.479> require

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
whatever distance apart as you require

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.809 
whatever distance apart as you require
depending<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.160> types<00:02:11.459> of

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
depending on the types of

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.780 
depending on the types of
you<00:02:11.999> want<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> water<00:02:12.359> are<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.700> spacing<00:02:14.700> out

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
you want the water are the spacing out

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.449 
you want the water are the spacing out
of<00:02:15.030> your<00:02:15.180> greenhouse<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.159> look<00:02:17.340> down

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
of your greenhouse so if you look down

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.190 
of your greenhouse so if you look down
here<00:02:17.519> on<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.969> ground<00:02:17.999> then<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.780> treated

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
here on the ground then we have treated

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.750 
here on the ground then we have treated
for<00:02:19.499> the<00:02:19.560> plant<00:02:19.799> parts<00:02:20.129> that<00:02:20.280> we're<00:02:20.400> hoping<00:02:20.700> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
for the plant parts that we're hoping to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.610 
for the plant parts that we're hoping to
you<00:02:20.969> and<00:02:21.359> water<00:02:21.749> with<00:02:22.109> the<00:02:22.290> big<00:02:22.469> dripper

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
you and water with the big dripper

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.699 
you and water with the big dripper
system<00:02:23.150> okay<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.299> we're<00:02:25.139> just<00:02:25.170> going<00:02:25.469> to<00:02:25.499> show

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
system okay so we're just going to show

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.619 
system okay so we're just going to show
you<00:02:25.739> now<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.639> put<00:02:26.939> them<00:02:27.120> into<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.719> ground<00:02:27.930> I

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
you now if I put them into the ground I

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.479 
you now if I put them into the ground I
can<00:02:30.629> basically<00:02:31.049> put<00:02:31.439> them<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.859> down<00:02:32.010> into<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
can basically put them it down into the

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.209 
can basically put them it down into the
plant<00:02:32.700> wash<00:02:33.060> okay<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.739> see<00:02:37.889> here<00:02:38.099> in

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
plant wash okay and you can see here in

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.220 
plant wash okay and you can see here in
the<00:02:38.370> middle<00:02:38.639> that<00:02:38.819> all<00:02:39.389> you<00:02:39.569> need<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.870> do<00:02:40.019> is

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
the middle that all you need to do is

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.949 
the middle that all you need to do is
take<00:02:40.439> the<00:02:40.969> adjusted<00:02:41.969> tap<00:02:42.329> and<00:02:42.599> then<00:02:42.749> just

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
take the adjusted tap and then just

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.619 
take the adjusted tap and then just
place<00:02:43.169> it<00:02:43.200> down<00:02:43.379> into<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.250> plant<00:02:44.459> wash<00:02:44.760> and

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
place it down into the plant wash and

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.099 
place it down into the plant wash and
then<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.859> can<00:02:47.010> continue<00:02:47.430> along<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.079> next

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
then you can continue along to the next

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.199 
then you can continue along to the next
plant<00:02:49.590> part<00:02:49.859> and<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.099> can<00:02:50.129> see<00:02:50.400> here<00:02:50.669> I'm<00:02:51.150> just

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
plant part and you can see here I'm just

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.059 
plant part and you can see here I'm just
going<00:02:51.449> to<00:02:51.540> put<00:02:51.719> the<00:02:51.900> adjusting<00:02:52.469> nozzle<00:02:52.829> down

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
going to put the adjusting nozzle down

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.089 
going to put the adjusting nozzle down
into<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.579> plant<00:02:53.730> wash<00:02:54.109> now<00:02:55.109> imagine<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.709> wanted

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
into the plant wash now imagine I wanted

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.170 
into the plant wash now imagine I wanted
to<00:02:56.609> water<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:57.689> other<00:02:57.930> plant<00:02:58.290> pot<00:02:58.500> over<00:02:58.709> here

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
to water this other plant pot over here

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.030 
to water this other plant pot over here
what<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.209> would<00:03:00.449> require<00:03:00.840> then<00:03:01.230> would<00:03:01.769> be<00:03:01.919> an

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
what I would require then would be an

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.119 
what I would require then would be an
additional<00:03:03.230> adjuster<00:03:04.230> around<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.829> point

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
additional adjuster around this point

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.520 
additional adjuster around this point
here<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.659> that's<00:03:06.659> what<00:03:06.840> I'm<00:03:06.930> going<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.169> do<00:03:07.349> now

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
here so that's what I'm going to do now

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
is to show you the method involved in

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.409 
is to show you the method involved in
attaching<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.409> adjuster<00:03:11.280> dripper<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
attaching the adjuster dripper to the

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.129 
attaching the adjuster dripper to the
holes<00:03:12.599> okay<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:15.060> now<00:03:15.180> I've<00:03:15.359> held<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.750> pointer

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
holes okay so now I've held the pointer

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.129 
holes okay so now I've held the pointer
which<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.620> require<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:17.939> dripper<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:18.930> what<00:03:19.109> I

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
which I require the dripper so what I

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.009 
which I require the dripper so what I
Carolyn<00:03:19.709> scissors<00:03:20.069> just<00:03:20.340> simply<00:03:21.060> make<00:03:21.659> cut

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.080 
Carolyn scissors just simply make cut
into<00:03:22.409> the<00:03:22.500> holes<00:03:23.930> at<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.079> point<00:03:25.819> okay<00:03:26.819> so<00:03:26.849> we

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
into the holes at the point okay so we

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.089 
into the holes at the point okay so we
cut<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.449> holes<00:03:27.629> now<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.049> half<00:03:28.229> you<00:03:28.769> simply

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
cut the holes now in half you simply

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.379 
cut the holes now in half you simply
just<00:03:29.250> take<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.790> adjusting<00:03:30.750> dripper<00:03:31.229> and<00:03:32.389> push

sure you get it all the way into the

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.520 
sure you get it all the way into the
center<00:03:46.970> okay<00:03:47.970> they're<00:03:48.150> not<00:03:48.239> simply<00:03:48.599> done<00:03:48.840> now

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530

do is take it down and look at the
actual<00:05:01.480> adjusting<00:05:02.480> muscles<00:05:02.900> themselves<00:05:03.050> so

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
actual adjusting muscles themselves so

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.440 
actual adjusting muscles themselves so
if<00:05:04.100> we<00:05:04.190> just<00:05:04.340> take<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:04.580> look<00:05:04.730> at<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:04.940> second<00:05:05.300> one

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
if we just take a look at the second one

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.840 
if we just take a look at the second one
here<00:05:05.860> which<00:05:06.860> is<00:05:06.890> currently<00:05:07.340> in<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.700> off

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
here which is currently in the off

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.780 
here which is currently in the off
position<00:05:09.190> you<00:05:10.190> can<00:05:10.340> twist<00:05:10.580> this<00:05:11.290> then<00:05:12.790> set

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
position you can twist this then set

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.580 
position you can twist this then set
this<00:05:14.090> duration<00:05:14.600> which<00:05:14.960> you<00:05:15.110> want<00:05:15.290> to<00:05:15.410> water

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
this duration which you want to water

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.550 
this duration which you want to water
the<00:05:15.860> porridge<00:05:16.540> so<00:05:17.540> I<00:05:17.570> thought<00:05:17.900> to<00:05:18.080> be<00:05:18.200> there

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
the porridge so I thought to be there

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.030 
the porridge so I thought to be there
it's<00:05:18.740> pouring<00:05:19.130> out<00:05:19.220> quite<00:05:19.460> fast<00:05:19.700> okay<00:05:20.920> now<00:05:21.920> I'm

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
it's pouring out quite fast okay now I'm

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.510 
it's pouring out quite fast okay now I'm
just<00:05:22.100> going<00:05:22.370> to<00:05:22.490> slow<00:05:22.700> it<00:05:22.820> down

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.999 

and<00:05:26.610> ideally<00:05:27.300> you<00:05:27.599> want<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:28.080> water<00:05:28.349> flow<00:05:28.770> at

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
and ideally you want a water flow at

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.240 
and ideally you want a water flow at
about<00:05:29.250> that<00:05:29.460> right<00:05:29.729> there<00:05:30.590> or<00:05:31.590> even<00:05:32.039> a<00:05:32.099> little

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
about that right there or even a little

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:41.490 
about that right there or even a little
bit<00:05:32.430> slower

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.040 

just<00:05:42.160> like<00:05:42.310> that<00:05:42.490> there<00:05:42.760> a<00:05:42.970> little<00:05:43.300> drip<00:05:43.720> drip

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
just like that there a little drip drip

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.170 
just like that there a little drip drip
flow<00:05:44.350> of<00:05:44.500> water<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:45.460> that<00:05:45.610> would<00:05:45.760> be<00:05:45.910> enough

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
flow of water and that would be enough

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.510 
flow of water and that would be enough
to<00:05:46.210> water<00:05:46.600> this<00:05:46.840> plant<00:05:46.900> but<00:05:47.440> give<00:05:48.310> it<00:05:48.340> a

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
to water this plant but give it a

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.220 
to water this plant but give it a
continuous<00:05:49.120> and<00:05:49.270> sufficient<00:05:49.810> amount<00:05:50.110> of

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
continuous and sufficient amount of

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.970 
continuous and sufficient amount of
water<00:05:50.760> on<00:05:51.760> a<00:05:51.820> regular<00:05:52.360> basis<00:05:52.780> so<00:05:53.710> what<00:05:53.860> you

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
water on a regular basis so what you

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.470 
water on a regular basis so what you
will<00:05:54.070> do<00:05:54.250> then<00:05:54.490> once<00:05:54.670> you<00:05:54.790> have<00:05:55.000> that<00:05:55.210> nice

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
will do then once you have that nice

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.260 
will do then once you have that nice
drip<00:05:55.840> is<00:05:56.530> this<00:05:56.800> place<00:05:57.040> it<00:05:57.310> didn't<00:05:57.700> also<00:05:57.820> down

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
drip is this place it didn't also down

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.780 
drip is this place it didn't also down
into<00:05:58.570> your<00:05:58.810> bath<00:05:58.990> wash<00:05:59.260> and<00:05:59.980> secured<00:06:00.400> into

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
place then continue along and position

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.090 
place then continue along and position
your<00:06:05.470> next<00:06:05.800> a<00:06:07.260> stopper<00:06:08.260> so<00:06:08.620> I'm<00:06:08.740> going<00:06:08.890> to<00:06:08.950> just

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
then place that down into the pot once

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.150 
then place that down into the pot once
you<00:06:15.610> have<00:06:15.760> it<00:06:15.880> set<00:06:19.560> I'm<00:06:20.560> just<00:06:20.770> going<00:06:20.890> to<00:06:20.919> set
