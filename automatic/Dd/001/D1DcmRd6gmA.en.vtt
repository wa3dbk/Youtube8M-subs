00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
by increasing the scale of ignition and

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.310 
by increasing the scale of ignition and
releasing<00:00:46.060> a<00:00:46.150> lot<00:00:46.390> of<00:00:46.420> accumulated<00:00:47.140> energy

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
releasing a lot of accumulated energy

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.979 
releasing a lot of accumulated energy
once<00:00:47.890> we<00:00:48.580> comply<00:00:48.970> more<00:00:49.300> than<00:00:49.450> twice<00:00:49.720> our

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
once we comply more than twice our

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.930 
once we comply more than twice our
normal<00:00:50.260> speed<00:00:50.500> I've<00:00:51.190> named<00:00:51.550> this<00:00:51.700> new

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
normal speed I've named this new

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.160 
normal speed I've named this new
function<00:00:52.360> of<00:00:52.450> the<00:00:52.570> charms<00:00:52.989> drive

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.200 

with<00:00:56.470> this<00:00:56.710> we<00:00:57.250> can<00:00:57.460> catch<00:00:57.640> up<00:00:57.790> with<00:00:57.940> curry<00:00:58.120> up

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
with this we can catch up with curry up

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.780 
with this we can catch up with curry up
some<00:00:58.360> no<00:00:58.510> time<00:00:58.750> at<00:00:58.930> all<00:00:59.050> I<00:00:59.489> think<00:01:00.489> we<00:01:00.610> should

some no time at all I think we should

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.240 
some no time at all I think we should
give<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.090> trial<00:01:01.360> run<00:01:01.450> right<00:01:01.870> now<00:01:02.250> alright

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250

altitude it looks like we used up all

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.350 
altitude it looks like we used up all
the<00:01:29.550> fuel<00:01:29.730> in<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.120> drive<00:01:30.680> what<00:01:32.030> rope<00:01:33.030> there's

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
to the coordinates it looks like we're

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.420 
to the coordinates it looks like we're
on<00:01:46.050> ceelo<00:01:46.530> silent

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
I think the charge drive spent too much

I think the charge drive spent too much
