 perches of small huts 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:11.130
 that's it if we give them food 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.490

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.490

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.850
 quinine and who commits husband when I 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.860
 have given a long time these are 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.610
 very small, small animals 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.470
 ouessant sheep of the world but very 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.150
 affectionate very very affectionate 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.070
 males are barely and singer goes there 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.540
 from time to time but females 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.540
 have no problem 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.950
 there are several races of whites of 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:07.550
 blacks of gray or beige 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.110
 gold here they already have substantively 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.260
 devour do not you I would have it 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:17.290
 given but they are so pot of 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.290
 glue that the moment not drinking 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.340
 normally our females are full 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.340
 for early February 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.370
 their singing is very big it takes little 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.310
 near 1000 m for two sheep and I 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.450
 believe very big and I have 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.450
 more than enough 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.189
 but they protect themselves under our trees 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:59.269
 because it rains a lot and even created their 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:02.359
 wool he does not like rain so they 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.349
 are hiding now I'm going to go to you 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:09.200
 show their sheepfold 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.870
 and so that's largely where a year ago 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.680
 Loire where I give them bread and 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.959
 shaved who reached their tank at 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:26.959
 hay here it's they eat it twice 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:32.060
 here is an alley to the dead are a big 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:34.069
