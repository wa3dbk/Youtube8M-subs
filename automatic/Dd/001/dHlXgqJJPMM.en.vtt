00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.029 
the idea of doing an inlay on the drum
set<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:02.050> what<00:01:02.199> we<00:01:02.320> did<00:01:02.469> is<00:01:02.620> we<00:01:02.649> actually

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
set so what we did is we actually

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.969 
set so what we did is we actually
located<00:01:03.609> a<00:01:03.820> craftsman<00:01:04.420> artisan<00:01:04.929> in<00:01:05.080> Egypt

that<00:01:11.289> was<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.500> true<00:01:11.710> inspiration<00:01:12.280> for<00:01:12.429> this

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
that was the true inspiration for this

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.789 
that was the true inspiration for this
snare

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.560 

we've<00:01:16.490> actually<00:01:16.700> been<00:01:16.970> working<00:01:17.030> on<00:01:17.450> this

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
we've actually been working on this

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.649 
we've actually been working on this
snare<00:01:17.810> for<00:01:17.990> almost<00:01:18.229> three<00:01:18.560> years<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.659> the

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
snare for almost three years and the

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.679 
snare for almost three years and the
reason<00:01:20.899> it<00:01:21.020> took<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:21.259> long<00:01:21.439> to<00:01:21.979> complete

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
reason it took so long to complete

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.480 
reason it took so long to complete
because<00:01:23.689> first<00:01:24.290> of<00:01:24.409> all<00:01:24.500> I'm<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:25.100> little<00:01:25.310> bit<00:01:25.399> of

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
because first of all I'm a little bit of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.710 
because first of all I'm a little bit of
a<00:01:25.520> perfectionist<00:01:25.729> when<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.330> comes<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.630> this

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
a perfectionist when it comes to this

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.929 
a perfectionist when it comes to this
kind<00:01:26.899> of<00:01:26.990> stuff<00:01:27.259> I<00:01:27.530> wanted<00:01:28.399> to<00:01:28.460> make<00:01:28.670> something

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
kind of stuff I wanted to make something

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.270 
kind of stuff I wanted to make something
that<00:01:29.360> was<00:01:29.990> not<00:01:30.229> only<00:01:30.259> good<00:01:30.619> for<00:01:30.649> collectors<00:01:31.220> of

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
inspired by things we did with System of

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.790 
inspired by things we did with System of
a<00:02:46.390> Down<00:02:46.420> as<00:02:46.810> well<00:02:46.990> as<00:02:47.080> things<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.470> did<00:02:47.710> in

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
my personal life that I enjoy for

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.230 
my personal life that I enjoy for
example<00:02:50.740> you<00:02:50.890> if<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.370> get<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.550> close-up<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:52.090> the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
example you if you get a close-up of the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.270 
example you if you get a close-up of the
lugs<00:02:52.660> you'll<00:02:53.050> see<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.290> there's<00:02:53.530> sort<00:02:54.130> of

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
lugs you'll see that there's sort of

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.460 
lugs you'll see that there's sort of
like<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.460> Kaos<00:02:54.880> symbol<00:02:55.270> on<00:02:55.390> there<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:55.750> don't<00:02:56.290> see

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
like a Kaos symbol on there I don't see

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.590 
like a Kaos symbol on there I don't see
it<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:57.070> much<00:02:57.130> as<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> cast<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.880> will<00:02:58.090> but<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.450> a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
it so much as a cast and will but it a

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.510 
it so much as a cast and will but it a
symbol<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.410> there<00:02:59.590> are<00:02:59.770> no<00:02:59.920> limits<00:03:00.250> no

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
symbol that there are no limits no

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.970 
symbol that there are no limits no
boundaries<00:03:01.270> you<00:03:01.990> can<00:03:02.020> go<00:03:02.230> anywhere<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.770> want

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
boundaries you can go anywhere you want

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.740 
boundaries you can go anywhere you want

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
in my drumming and that's what we try to

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.670 
in my drumming and that's what we try to
