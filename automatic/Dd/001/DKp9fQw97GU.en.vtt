00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.899 
which is kind of what light weight is
known<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.530> will<00:01:13.650> also<00:01:13.920> take<00:01:14.490> no

really good perk hot the no damage from
falling<00:01:22.110> thing<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.560> think<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> actually

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.870 
falling thing I think that is actually
more<00:01:24.240> beneficial<00:01:24.540> than<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.830> actual<00:01:25.979> moving

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
more beneficial than the actual moving

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.630 
more beneficial than the actual moving
faster<00:01:27.360> than<00:01:27.509> normal<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:28.640> lightweight

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
faster than normal but lightweight

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.600 
faster than normal but lightweight
really<00:01:30.329> strong<00:01:30.720> solid<00:01:31.409> choice<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.950> perk<00:01:32.460> slot

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
to tweak this game in progress so if it

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.450 
to tweak this game in progress so if it
looks<00:04:56.200> like<00:04:56.290> ghosts<00:04:56.830> may<00:04:57.130> be<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.280> little

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
looks like ghosts may be a little

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.790 
looks like ghosts may be a little
overpowered<00:04:58.090> he<00:04:58.750> could<00:04:58.960> tweak<00:04:59.200> it<00:04:59.380> some<00:04:59.590> more

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
overpowered he could tweak it some more

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.590 
overpowered he could tweak it some more
if<00:04:59.890> it's<00:05:00.040> underpowered<00:05:00.610> he<00:05:01.000> can<00:05:01.180> tweak<00:05:01.420> it

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
if it's underpowered he can tweak it

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.080 
if it's underpowered he can tweak it
some<00:05:01.810> that's<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:03.010> advantage<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.520> having<00:05:03.910> a

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
some that's the advantage to having a

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.630 
some that's the advantage to having a
developer<00:05:04.660> like<00:05:05.110> treyarch<00:05:05.620> that<00:05:05.980> is<00:05:06.280> willing

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
developer like treyarch that is willing

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.090 
developer like treyarch that is willing
to<00:05:06.670> work<00:05:07.030> with<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.690> community<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:08.740> make<00:05:08.920> the

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
to work with the community to make the

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.000 
to work with the community to make the
game<00:05:09.280> better<00:05:09.310> so<00:05:09.970> ghost<00:05:10.750> is<00:05:10.990> back<00:05:11.200> but<00:05:11.590> I<00:05:11.620> don't

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
game better so ghost is back but I don't

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.340 
game better so ghost is back but I don't
think<00:05:12.280> it's<00:05:12.400> going<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:12.670> be<00:05:12.730> as<00:05:13.030> bad<00:05:13.840> of<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.110> perk

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
think it's going to be as bad of a perk

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.560 
think it's going to be as bad of a perk
as<00:05:14.530> a<00:05:14.560> lot<00:05:14.680> of<00:05:14.800> people<00:05:15.010> think<00:05:15.160> it<00:05:15.340> is<00:05:15.370> I<00:05:15.700> could

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
as a lot of people think it is I could

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.600 
as a lot of people think it is I could
see<00:05:16.720> myself<00:05:16.900> using<00:05:17.350> ghost<00:05:17.740> possibly<00:05:18.370> in<00:05:18.520> a

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
see myself using ghost possibly in a

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.880 
see myself using ghost possibly in a
team<00:05:18.850> deathmatch<00:05:19.330> where<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:20.020> might<00:05:20.590> not<00:05:20.740> be

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
team deathmatch where I might not be

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.500 
team deathmatch where I might not be
prone<00:05:21.190> to<00:05:21.370> getting<00:05:21.460> hit<00:05:21.790> with<00:05:21.940> all<00:05:22.090> kinds<00:05:22.450> of
