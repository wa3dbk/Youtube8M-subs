way that I can make my images default to
jpg<00:01:42.630> JPEG<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> don't<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.799> how<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:44.040> that

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.389 
jpg JPEG but I don't know how to do that
anyhow<00:01:45.509> I'm<00:01:46.020> having<00:01:46.320> more<00:01:46.439> fun<00:01:46.500> than<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.070> am<00:01:47.220> on

anyhow I'm having more fun than I am on

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.510 
anyhow I'm having more fun than I am on
the<00:01:47.490> technical<00:01:47.880> side<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:49.070> when<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.369> this

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the technical side but when you do this

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.190 
the technical side but when you do this
as<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> PNG<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.689> PNG<00:01:52.670> image<00:01:53.670> format<00:01:54.360> does<00:01:55.020> not

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
as a PNG and PNG image format does not

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.660 
as a PNG and PNG image format does not
show<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.829> every<00:01:56.130> browser

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
show up on every browser

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.370 
show up on every browser
I<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:56.880> Internet<00:01:57.390> Explorer<00:01:57.840> doesn't<00:01:58.079> pick<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
I know Internet Explorer doesn't pick it

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.880 
I know Internet Explorer doesn't pick it
up<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.659> always<00:02:00.930> tell<00:02:01.200> people<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.500> use<00:02:01.649> JPEG

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
up so I always tell people to use JPEG

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.370 
up so I always tell people to use JPEG
so<00:02:02.369> what<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.420> take<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.990> image

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
so what I do is I just take the image

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.889 
so what I do is I just take the image
that<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:04.680> made<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.360> save<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:09.450> JPEG

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that I just made and I save it as a JPEG

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.199 
that I just made and I save it as a JPEG
so<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.619> right<00:02:10.770> here<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.009> save<00:02:11.340> it

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
so I just go right here and save it

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:22.190 
so I just go right here and save it
and<00:02:12.299> I<00:02:18.049> just<00:02:19.049> named<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.939> and<00:02:20.939> so<00:02:21.689> there<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.079> is

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
and I just named it and so there it is

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.349 
and I just named it and so there it is
set<00:02:22.950> up<00:02:22.980> right<00:02:23.250> there<00:02:24.200> okay<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.560> now<00:02:26.359> if

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
set up right there okay and so now if

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.379 
set up right there okay and so now if
you<00:02:27.569> look<00:02:27.750> here<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.859> is<00:02:29.159> a<00:02:29.189> it's<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.120> JPEG
