00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.109
 oleic acid also called omega 9 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.760
 is a monounsaturated fatty acid 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.139
 essential to guarantee our 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.840
 cardiovascular health is the best ally 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.630
 against myocardial 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.700
 the food with the most acid content 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.330
 oleic is as its own name indicates 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:28.160
 the olive oil whose content is 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.279
 between 55 and 80% 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.620
 but what would be the second food with 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.820
 more content in this healthy 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.020
 component 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.840
 welcome to the reef 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.660
 many of you are thinking about 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.360
 the avocado as the second food with 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.980
 more oleic acid 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.720
 and if not another type of fruit or vegetable 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.060
 but surprisingly it's not a 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.970
 vegetable is not a vegetable is not a 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:04.250
 fruit the second food with more acid 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.490
 oleic is a meat specifically that of 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.350
 Iberian ham 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.750
 every time we talk about food 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.689
 healthy we cite fruits vegetables 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.360
 vegetables but this does not have to 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.720
 always be that way since unlike 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.149
 what many people believe there are meats 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.390
 healthy and the ham is one of the 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.460
 few when we talk about ham we 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.179
 we refer obviously to cured ham 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.240
 since the cooked ham ham york loses 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:37.509
 many of its properties during its 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.759
 elaboration in which you will also be 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:44.620
 add a product among other additives 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.780
 as unwise as phosphates 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.660
 so the indications of the tied to 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.540
 below refer to ham 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.300
 cured 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.640
 inside the ham of two varieties the 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.690
 Serrano ham from the common pig 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.560
 and the Iberian ham also known as 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.649
 black leg 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.770
 inside the hams the Iberian 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.649
 the one with the most beneficial properties 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.849
 input 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.819
 this is so because of the breed of the animal 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:21.609
 the type of upbringing and its feeding 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.939
 the Iberian pig is an animal that comes 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:27.639
 of the crossing of the Iberian boar and the pig 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.889
 introduced common in Spain therefore 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:34.060
 unlike the white pig this one has 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:35.469
 part of pork and part of boar this is 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.290
 very easy to see if you realize 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:40.870
 look at the leg of a normal ham and 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.120
 of an Iberian ham you will notice that the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.939
 Iberian ham is more elongated and 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.939
 stylized than the common ham that has 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.240
 shorter round legs and more 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.640
 fat 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.040
 another of the characteristics of ham 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.830
 Iberian acorn is your diet 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.410
 this is outdoors in large 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.110
 dehesas where their usual diet are 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.740
 fruits like acorns and similar 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.980
 notwithstanding Iberian or Serrano ham 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.350
 if it is cured naturally 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.530
 will present to a greater or lesser extent the 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.290
 properties that I give you below 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.920
 that eating meat lowers cholesterol is the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.750
 first surprise of this food as 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.180
 the one mentioned at the beginning the ham is 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.380
 rich in oleic acid where you can get 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.360
 to 55% of its content 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.580
 this means that eating this meat does not 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.600
 only cholesterol will not rise 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.120
 that will also lower it, remove the 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.920
 depression you obviously take a plate 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.920
 of black leg removes the depression 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.170
 anyone but not for its taste 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.890
 the ham contains a high amount of 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.560
 vitamin b1 that fights stress 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.040
 anxiety and depression 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.260
 raise the body's defenses this is 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.870
 because in addition to the b1 the ham 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.380
 contains vitamins B6 and in the case of 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.130
 Iberian b12 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.010
 good source of proteins to these 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.660
 heights no one denies the need for a 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.690
 good protein intake in our 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.600
 diet what is discussed is the source already 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.910
 that if many vegetables provide protein 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.390
 the bioavailability of the protein of 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.710
 animal origin is greater but with 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.320
 drawbacks of meat 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.140
 in this case and unlike the 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.500
 Red meats we will obtain a good contribution 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.030
 of bioavailable proteins without damaging the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.510
 colon or arteries 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.970
 folic acid the kings of folic acid 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.810
 are the vegetables being their presence in 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.720
 meats 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.849
 - except in the case of Iberian ham 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:57.119
 has a good supply of folic acid 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.459
 intellectual development aid this is 

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:02.749
 simple is due to its high content in 

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:06.479
 zinc for those who suffer from arthritis 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:08.490
 or want to prevent Alzheimer's disease can 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.669
 include stand out in their feeding already 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.240
 that their vitamin E content prevents 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.240
 these ailments 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.759
 plus all the posts so far 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:21.159
 must be added as nutrients 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:23.949
 exceptional as vitamins and 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:29.019
 proteins you have to bind the iron the 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:31.539
 potassium calcium phosphorus or magnesium if os 

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:32.469
 if you are talking about ham 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:37.780
 cured in general 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:41.380
 in some specific Iberian moments 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:45.010
 this has a reason the ham serrano 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.470
 common does not have the same nutrients that 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:51.930
 the Iberian ham although its process of 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.930
 healing is similar 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.330
 as you see a varied diet we always 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:02.319
 gives solutions to our problems 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:05.889
 nutritional many times when 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:08.110
 criticized the hamburgers the cocacola the 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.289
 Processed food or bottled water 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.440
 Cheap plastic there are some who me 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.470
 leave the typical comment then you 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.810
 what are you eating 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.440
 Well, for those who ask me 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:26.220
 that as I can only tell you one thing 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.030
 continue to comeback donuts that I will continue with 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.520
 my Iberian 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.590
 I hope this video is yours 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:37.020
 utility and I encourage you to subscribe
