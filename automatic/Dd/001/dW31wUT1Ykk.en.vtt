00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.010 

so<00:01:01.429> I<00:01:01.460> cut<00:01:02.000> everything<00:01:02.510> together

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
so I cut everything together

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.850 
so I cut everything together
this<00:01:03.320> is<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.090> boost<00:01:05.090> converter<00:01:05.660> because<00:01:06.650> this

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
this is the boost converter because this

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.690 
this is the boost converter because this
solar<00:01:07.310> panel<00:01:07.760> is<00:01:08.510> only<00:01:08.660> about<00:01:09.080> five<00:01:09.470> or<00:01:10.400> six

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
solar panel is only about five or six

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.470 
solar panel is only about five or six
volt<00:01:11.060> open<00:01:11.510> voltage<00:01:12.460> but<00:01:13.460> I<00:01:13.550> do<00:01:13.610> have<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.030> diode

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
volt open voltage but I do have a diode

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.190 
volt open voltage but I do have a diode
here<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.290> that<00:01:15.530> would<00:01:15.800> drop<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.310> voltage<00:01:16.490> and

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
here so that would drop the voltage and

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.230 
here so that would drop the voltage and
I<00:01:18.200> need<00:01:18.410> to<00:01:18.590> charge<00:01:18.950> this<00:01:19.340> battery<00:01:19.610> pack<00:01:20.210> here

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
I need to charge this battery pack here

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.080 
I need to charge this battery pack here
it's<00:01:23.240> about<00:01:23.470> five<00:01:24.470> point<00:01:25.010> I<00:01:25.400> need<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.820> charge

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
it's about five point I need to charge

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.640 
it's about five point I need to charge
it<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.390> about<00:01:26.570> 5.5<00:01:27.440> volt<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.610> I'm<00:01:28.940> gonna<00:01:29.180> set

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
it to about 5.5 volt so I'm gonna set

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.160 
it to about 5.5 volt so I'm gonna set
the<00:01:30.650> charging<00:01:31.640> at<00:01:32.330> about<00:01:32.920> 5.8<00:01:33.920> volt<00:01:35.170> so

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
the charging at about 5.8 volt so

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.170 
the charging at about 5.8 volt so
there's<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.650> little<00:01:36.950> pot<00:01:37.190> here<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.700> can<00:01:37.910> do

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
there's a little pot here you can do

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:51.670 
there's a little pot here you can do
that<00:01:45.399> so<00:01:46.399> is<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:47.229> 5.4<00:01:48.229> now<00:01:48.500> actually<00:01:50.290> so<00:01:51.290> as<00:01:51.470> I

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
that so is that 5.4 now actually so as I

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.570 
that so is that 5.4 now actually so as I
turn<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:52.250> will<00:01:52.490> go<00:01:52.729> up<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:57.220> now<00:01:58.220> it's<00:01:58.460> about

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
turn this will go up so now it's about

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.770 
turn this will go up so now it's about
five<00:01:59.210> point<00:01:59.509> eight<00:01:59.660> five<00:02:00.130> so<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:01.550> will<00:02:02.090> leave<00:02:02.600> it

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
five point eight five so I will leave it

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.350 
five point eight five so I will leave it
at<00:02:02.930> that

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
at that

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.400 
at that
that's<00:02:05.360> five<00:02:05.930> point<00:02:06.259> eight<00:02:06.410> so<00:02:07.130> when<00:02:08.000> the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
that's five point eight so when the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.309 
that's five point eight so when the
charging<00:02:09.410> goes<00:02:09.590> up<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.220> voltage<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:10.910> will

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
charging goes up to that voltage it will

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.650 
charging goes up to that voltage it will
stop<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:15.350> won't<00:02:15.620> go<00:02:16.310> beyond<00:02:17.000> five<00:02:17.330> point

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
stop and it won't go beyond five point

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.030 
stop and it won't go beyond five point
eight<00:02:17.810> four<00:02:18.290> five<00:02:19.010> point<00:02:19.340> eight<00:02:19.459> five<00:02:21.040> so

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
eight four five point eight five so

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.190 
eight four five point eight five so
that's<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:23.860> that's<00:02:24.860> how<00:02:25.069> it<00:02:25.280> looks<00:02:25.490> like<00:02:26.200> this

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
that's it that's how it looks like this

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.860 
that's it that's how it looks like this
is<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.620> light<00:02:27.800> itself<00:02:28.310> I'm<00:02:29.150> gonna<00:02:29.420> try<00:02:29.810> and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
is the light itself I'm gonna try and

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.600 
is the light itself I'm gonna try and
see<00:02:30.230> if<00:02:30.319> I<00:02:30.410> can<00:02:30.590> fit<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:30.980> in<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.250> bottle<00:02:33.610> this

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
see if I can fit it in the bottle this

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.170 
see if I can fit it in the bottle this
is<00:02:34.790> how<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.000> setup<00:02:35.540> looks<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:36.730> five<00:02:37.730> volt

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
is how the setup looks like five volt

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.510 
is how the setup looks like five volt
solar<00:02:38.660> panel<00:02:39.310> with<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.400> voltage<00:02:40.790> boosted<00:02:41.540> to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
solar panel with the voltage boosted to

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.880 
solar panel with the voltage boosted to
maybe<00:02:43.520> five<00:02:43.970> point<00:02:44.240> eight<00:02:44.450> five<00:02:45.140> volt<00:02:45.560> to

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
maybe five point eight five volt to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.100 
maybe five point eight five volt to
charge<00:02:46.390> for<00:02:47.390> any<00:02:47.920> loop<00:02:48.920> batteries<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:49.849> want<00:02:50.840> it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
charge for any loop batteries I want it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.410 
charge for any loop batteries I want it
to<00:02:51.410> charge<00:02:51.709> up<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.130> one<00:02:52.340> point<00:02:52.640> four<00:02:53.180> five

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
to charge up to one point four five

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.690 
to charge up to one point four five
volts<00:02:53.990> so<00:02:54.410> that's<00:02:54.770> why<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:54.920> said<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.340> at<00:02:55.490> that

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
volts so that's why I said it at that

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.650 
volts so that's why I said it at that
rate<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.620> then<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:58.239> battery<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.420> connected

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
rate and then the battery is connected

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.620 
rate and then the battery is connected
to<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.590> solar<00:03:00.830> light<00:03:01.220> that's<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.360> diode<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:04.630> on

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
to the solar light that's a diode so on

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.330 
to the solar light that's a diode so on
a<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:06.349> know<00:03:06.910> at<00:03:07.910> this<00:03:08.270> point<00:03:08.630> here<00:03:08.900> so<00:03:09.340> the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
a you know at this point here so the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.660 
a you know at this point here so the
battery<00:03:10.910> won't<00:03:11.360> back<00:03:11.900> feed<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.770> solar<00:03:13.730> panel

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
battery won't back feed the solar panel

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.780 
battery won't back feed the solar panel
it<00:03:15.360> might<00:03:15.630> not<00:03:15.780> even<00:03:15.810> need<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.650> diode<00:03:17.580> he

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
it might not even need the diode he

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.080 
it might not even need the diode he
because<00:03:18.270> of<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:19.530> sport<00:03:19.920> here<00:03:20.190> but<00:03:20.459> anyway<00:03:20.849> I

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
because of the sport here but anyway I

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.690 
because of the sport here but anyway I
put<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.540> diode<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:23.239> I<00:03:25.010> put<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.160> thing<00:03:26.459> in

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
put the diode in and I put this thing in

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.300 
put the diode in and I put this thing in
a<00:03:26.819> semi<00:03:27.150> dark<00:03:27.599> area<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:29.599> it<00:03:30.599> is<00:03:30.630> not<00:03:31.020> on<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:32.130> if

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
a semi dark area and it is not on but if

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.559 
a semi dark area and it is not on but if
I<00:03:32.520> put<00:03:33.090> my<00:03:33.300> hand<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.980> shave<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:38.000> solar<00:03:39.000> cell<00:03:39.360> or

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
I put my hand to shave the solar cell or

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.900 
I put my hand to shave the solar cell or
the<00:03:40.760> photo<00:03:41.760> resistor<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.860> light<00:03:44.130> would<00:03:44.880> come

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
the photo resistor the light would come

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.890 
the photo resistor the light would come
on<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.540> as<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.840> shirt<00:03:46.410> at<00:03:46.890> night<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:48.330> then<00:03:48.720> in

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
on it as a shirt at night and then in

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.340 
on it as a shirt at night and then in
the<00:03:49.019> daytime<00:03:49.470> they<00:03:49.739> will<00:03:49.920> go<00:03:50.069> off<00:03:54.049> so<00:03:55.049> now<00:03:55.319> I

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
the daytime they will go off so now I

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.470 
the daytime they will go off so now I
just<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:55.920> fit<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.489> into<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> container

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
just have to fit this into a container

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.800 
just have to fit this into a container
and<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.750> will<00:04:01.049> have<00:04:01.260> my<00:04:01.470> working<00:04:02.040> solar

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
and I will have my working solar

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.620 
and I will have my working solar
rechargeable<00:04:04.100> dark<00:04:05.100> sensing<00:04:06.890> light<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.630> put

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
rechargeable dark sensing light I put

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.990 
rechargeable dark sensing light I put

all the electronics inside this glass
bottle<00:04:12.600> here<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:15.000> can<00:04:15.180> see<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:16.410> is

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
bottle here and you can see that it is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.590 
bottle here and you can see that it is
charging<00:04:17.040> right<00:04:17.430> now<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:19.789> put<00:04:20.789> a<00:04:20.820> bit<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.269> hot

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
charging right now I put a bit of hot

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.529 
charging right now I put a bit of hot
glue<00:04:21.680> where<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.919> wiring<00:04:23.310> goes<00:04:23.669> into<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.240> jar

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
glue where the wiring goes into the jar

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.029 
glue where the wiring goes into the jar
hopefully<00:04:25.440> it<00:04:25.950> will<00:04:26.130> hold<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:28.229> solar<00:04:28.590> panel

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
hopefully it will hold the solar panel

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.719 
hopefully it will hold the solar panel
generate<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.610> lot<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:29.910> heat<00:04:30.419> so<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:31.350> lot<00:04:32.310> of<00:04:32.340> times

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
generate a lot of heat so a lot of times

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.590 
generate a lot of heat so a lot of times
the<00:04:33.030> hot<00:04:33.690> glue<00:04:33.960> would<00:04:34.200> not<00:04:34.440> hold<00:04:35.390> would<00:04:36.390> not

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
the hot glue would not hold would not

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.380 
the hot glue would not hold would not
stick<00:04:37.410> that<00:04:37.620> well<00:04:37.950> I<00:04:38.220> might<00:04:38.729> have<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.060> put<00:04:39.270> in

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
stick that well I might have to put in

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.210 
stick that well I might have to put in
some<00:04:39.690> epoxy<00:04:40.140> later<00:04:40.940> but<00:04:42.020> right<00:04:43.020> now<00:04:43.080> it<00:04:44.010> is

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
some epoxy later but right now it is

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.460 
some epoxy later but right now it is
working<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:46.460> these<00:04:47.460> are<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:47.910> LEDs<00:04:48.600> that<00:04:49.289> will

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
working and these are the LEDs that will

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.610 
working and these are the LEDs that will
light<00:04:49.650> up<00:04:49.860> when<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:52.169> post-doc

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
light up when the post-doc

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.940 
light up when the post-doc
basically<00:04:55.460> just<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:59.110> the<00:05:00.110> OED

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
basically just the the OED

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.000 
basically just the the OED
on<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.870> perp<00:05:02.870> board<00:05:03.230> here<00:05:03.440> with<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.740> light

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
on the perp board here with a light

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.030 
on the perp board here with a light
sensor<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:06.590> have<00:05:06.800> a<00:05:07.130> battery<00:05:07.700> pack<00:05:08.240> here

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
sensor and you have a battery pack here

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.330 
sensor and you have a battery pack here
and<00:05:10.690> then<00:05:11.690> I<00:05:11.960> have<00:05:12.200> this<00:05:12.380> circuit<00:05:12.860> court<00:05:13.160> that

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
and then I have this circuit court that

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.390 
and then I have this circuit court that
controls<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.120> charging<00:05:14.750> I<00:05:14.990> set<00:05:15.650> it<00:05:15.770> to<00:05:16.010> 5

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
controls the charging I set it to 5

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.960 
controls the charging I set it to 5
point<00:05:16.760> 8<00:05:16.910> 5<00:05:17.660> volt<00:05:18.110> that<00:05:19.010> means<00:05:19.070> the<00:05:19.580> battery

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
point 8 5 volt that means the battery

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.800 
point 8 5 volt that means the battery
would<00:05:20.389> only<00:05:20.630> go<00:05:20.870> up<00:05:20.900> to<00:05:21.290> one<00:05:21.800> point<00:05:22.070> four<00:05:22.400> five

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
would only go up to one point four five

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.830 
would only go up to one point four five
and<00:05:23.810> it<00:05:24.350> is<00:05:24.470> adjustable<00:05:26.350> and<00:05:28.180> this<00:05:29.180> is<00:05:29.360> it<00:05:29.570> now

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
and it is adjustable and this is it now

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.430 
and it is adjustable and this is it now
is<00:05:30.110> in<00:05:30.380> the<00:05:30.590> afternoon<00:05:31.100> Sun<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:31.790> I<00:05:32.330> tested<00:05:33.139> it

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
is in the afternoon Sun and I tested it

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.170 
is in the afternoon Sun and I tested it
it<00:05:34.040> works<00:05:34.700> in<00:05:34.940> the<00:05:35.030> dark<00:05:36.580> I'm<00:05:37.580> going<00:05:37.850> to<00:05:37.940> leave

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
it works in the dark I'm going to leave

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.590 
it works in the dark I'm going to leave
it<00:05:38.389> and<00:05:39.310> should<00:05:40.310> this<00:05:41.060> should<00:05:41.270> come<00:05:41.450> on

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
it and should this should come on

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.750 
it and should this should come on
tonight
