00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590 
in to charge it went to sleep woke up to
smoke<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.549> bit<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.729> Bernie<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
smoke and on a little bit of Bernie and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.950 
smoke and on a little bit of Bernie and
yeah<00:01:28.220> um<00:01:29.220> thank<00:01:30.000> god<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> battery<00:01:30.630> didn't<00:01:30.840> go

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
yeah um thank god the battery didn't go

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.510 
yeah um thank god the battery didn't go
because<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.380> anyone<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.189> knows<00:01:32.310> these

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
because as anyone that knows these

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.480 
because as anyone that knows these
batteries<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.240> blow<00:01:34.400> especially<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
batteries when they blow especially the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.020 
batteries when they blow especially the
lithium<00:01:36.000> ions<00:01:36.450> they<00:01:37.100> they'll<00:01:38.100> expand<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
lithium ions they they'll expand and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.480 
lithium ions they they'll expand and
then<00:01:39.479> they<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.840> explode<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.920> when<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.430> do

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
then they just explode and when they do

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580 
then they just explode and when they do
is<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:42.000> multiplier<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.439> least

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
is just like multiplier so at least

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.679 
is just like multiplier so at least
something<00:01:44.009> kicked<00:01:44.189> over<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> phone<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.390> it's

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
something kicked over the phone but it's

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.270 
something kicked over the phone but it's
the<00:01:45.810> fact<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.409> charging<00:01:46.799> port<00:01:47.009> caught

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the fact that the charging port caught

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.609 
the fact that the charging port caught
fire<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.060> really<00:01:48.420> really<00:01:48.540> freaky

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
fire which is really really freaky

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.819 
fire which is really really freaky
because<00:01:50.070> batteries<00:01:50.759> only<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.119> close

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
because batteries only that close

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.280 
because batteries only that close
anyways<00:01:53.149> Samsung<00:01:54.149> wanted<00:01:54.479> proof<00:01:54.720> there's

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
anyways Samsung wanted proof there's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.410 
anyways Samsung wanted proof there's
your<00:01:55.530> proof<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.759> anyone<00:01:56.909> else<00:01:57.119> that's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
your proof and for anyone else that's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.969 
your proof and for anyone else that's
wondering<00:01:57.810> if<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> big<00:01:58.740> issue<00:01:58.860> with

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
wondering if this is a big issue with
