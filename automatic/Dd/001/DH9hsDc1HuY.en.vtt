00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
kind of a trick that I use with the sea

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.009 
kind of a trick that I use with the sea
and<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.099> minor<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.670> my<00:02:42.299> thumb<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.749> just<00:02:42.930> a

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
and the a minor is my thumb is just a

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.780 
and the a minor is my thumb is just a
little<00:02:43.260> bit<00:02:43.349> over<00:02:43.499> the<00:02:43.590> top<00:02:43.650> he's<00:02:44.430> just<00:02:44.549> barely

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
touching this this bottom string so I'd

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.770 
touching this this bottom string so I'd
only<00:02:46.650> want<00:02:46.829> five<00:02:46.950> ring<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.489> c5<00:02:48.359> really

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
minor so it really doesn't matter I

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.199 
minor so it really doesn't matter I
might<00:02:52.019> hit<00:02:52.170> all<00:02:52.290> six<00:02:52.530> or<00:02:52.769> if<00:02:52.799> I<00:02:52.950> hit<00:02:53.129> five<00:02:53.370> if<00:02:54.090> I

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209
