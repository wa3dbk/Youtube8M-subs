it's all cast-iron really heavy and if

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.290 
it's all cast-iron really heavy and if
you<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> look<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.340> balances<00:00:33.149> out

you like the look and it balances out
the<00:00:33.480> center<00:00:33.750> area<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:36.930> pots<00:00:37.200> or

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the center area so that your pots or

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.200 
the center area so that your pots or
pans<00:00:38.300> can<00:00:39.300> slide<00:00:39.719> across<00:00:40.050> evenly<00:00:41.210> generally

pans can slide across evenly generally
when<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> buy<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.660> range<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:44.070> will<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.430> be

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
when you buy this range this will not be

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.049 
when you buy this range this will not be
included<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.579> this<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.730> how<00:00:47.850> your

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
included so this is this is how your

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.560 
included so this is this is how your
range<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> look<00:00:50.149> which<00:00:51.149> looks<00:00:51.390> great

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
range is going to look which looks great

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.619 
range is going to look which looks great
too

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.229 

secondly<00:00:58.180> just<00:00:59.180> see<00:00:59.390> that<00:01:00.730> these<00:01:01.730> are<00:01:02.059> also

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
secondly just see that these are also

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.850 
secondly just see that these are also
heavy<00:01:03.170> cast<00:01:03.559> iron<00:01:05.350> one<00:01:06.350> piece<00:01:06.560> on<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.800> left

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
heavy cast iron one piece on the left

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:25.219 
heavy cast iron one piece on the left
one<00:01:07.340> piece<00:01:07.550> on<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:07.850> right

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.319 

thirdly<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:30.420> base<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:32.320> stovetop<00:01:32.890> is

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
thirdly the base of the stovetop is

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.450 
thirdly the base of the stovetop is
actually<00:01:34.329> multiple<00:01:34.840> pieces<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.590> not<00:01:35.979> one

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
actually multiple pieces it is not one

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.690 
actually multiple pieces it is not one
single<00:01:37.000> pressed<00:01:37.869> piece<00:01:38.770> of<00:01:39.070> stainless<00:01:39.490> steel

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
single pressed piece of stainless steel

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.789 
single pressed piece of stainless steel
so<00:01:42.179> this<00:01:43.179> piece<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:46.140> an<00:01:47.140> individual<00:01:47.590> piece

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
so this piece is an individual piece

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.179 
so this piece is an individual piece
just<00:01:48.340> like<00:01:48.579> this<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:49.270> this<00:01:50.079> actually<00:01:51.069> the

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
just like this and this actually the

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.969 
just like this and this actually the
side<00:01:51.369> ones<00:01:51.640> as<00:01:51.819> well<00:01:52.200> what<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.380> means<00:01:53.679> is

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
side ones as well what that means is

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.789 
side ones as well what that means is
you're<00:01:54.159> going<00:01:54.189> to<00:01:54.310> have<00:01:54.520> seams<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.799> little

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
you're going to have seams and little

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.380 
you're going to have seams and little
nooks<00:01:57.069> and<00:01:57.220> crannies<00:01:57.759> where<00:01:58.560> dirt<00:01:59.560> and<00:02:00.390> food

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
nooks and crannies where dirt and food

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:30.959 
nooks and crannies where dirt and food
grime<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:03.159> build<00:02:03.490> up

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.849 

unfortunately<00:02:31.969> or<00:02:32.239> fortunately<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.620> can't

unfortunately or fortunately you can't

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.380 
unfortunately or fortunately you can't
remove<00:02:34.129> these<00:02:34.280> pieces<00:02:34.519> unless<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:35.090> take<00:02:35.239> the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
we'll take a look at the design of the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.140 
we'll take a look at the design of the
actual<00:02:48.680> burners<00:02:49.129> these<00:02:49.430> are<00:02:49.639> sealed<00:02:49.969> burners

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
actual burners these are sealed burners

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.959 
actual burners these are sealed burners
and<00:02:50.599> from<00:02:51.500> what<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:51.739> heard<00:02:52.010> they're<00:02:52.280> similar<00:02:52.790> or

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:52.969 
and from what I heard they're similar or

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.119 
and from what I heard they're similar or

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
the same as some of the burners that the

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.780 
the same as some of the burners that the
wolf<00:02:55.430> range<00:02:55.730> stoves<00:02:56.269> use<00:02:56.840> but<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.790> cannot

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
wolf range stoves use but I cannot

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.929 
wolf range stoves use but I cannot
personally<00:02:59.359> verify<00:02:59.989> that<00:03:00.439> all<00:03:01.310> four<00:03:01.670> are<00:03:01.819> the

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
personally verify that all four are the

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.649 
personally verify that all four are the
same<00:03:02.180> all<00:03:02.450> four<00:03:03.230> are<00:03:03.560> believed<00:03:04.030> 15,000<00:03:05.030> BTU

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
same all four are believed 15,000 BTU

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:14.500 
same all four are believed 15,000 BTU
and<00:03:07.299> let's<00:03:08.299> take<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.510> look<00:03:08.659> at<00:03:08.750> them<00:03:13.299> so<00:03:14.299> as<00:03:14.389> you

and let's take a look at them so as you

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.369 
and let's take a look at them so as you
can<00:03:14.599> see<00:03:15.730> we'll<00:03:16.730> turn<00:03:16.879> it<00:03:17.030> on<00:03:17.120> later<00:03:17.780> in<00:03:18.139> this

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
can see we'll turn it on later in this
