00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 now in this opportunity we are going to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.600
 learn the point called honeycomb 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.860
 bee 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.290
 this point is made first weave three 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.620
 right racing the right that's called 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.550
 sweater 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.550
 and in the fourth point 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:29.910
 tg 123 points and the fourth point you 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.180
 slide it 1 2 3 times and there just 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.220
 weave this point, try to make it a 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.079
 little bit loose so it's better 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.940
 they knit again 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.199
 two 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.990
 three points already and the fourth slides it 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:51.800
 one two three times 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:56.500
 they grab the point and do not weave everything 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.500
 the right 1 2 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.080
 see like this is 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.070
 three times slide 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.870
 resumes 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.230
 leave again 3 to 2 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.970
 and the fourth point is where we do the 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:21.110
 slip 1-2-3 into account 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.630
 who take the point 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.990
 I'm already knitting the next row is 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.990
 upside down 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.380
 and then we have to weave two rows 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.740
 more and in the fourth row that is at 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.770
 right we make that point again 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.640
 slipped 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.409
 I'm finishing the third row at 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.899
 reverse 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.499
 and now let's keep doing the 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.329
 point but there is a small variant 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:56.780
 you remember that in this row 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.630
 we started 1 2 3 and just in the fourth 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.350
 row the slip point now not now 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.679
 let's knit a row one point and in 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.830
 the second point we make the slip to 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:13.950
 that is alternated 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.000
 so let's grab a point 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.000
 and we slide 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.940
 23 repeat exactly what I have 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.190
 taught but the important thing is this 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:32.340
 variant of the beginning 1 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:37.040
 23 in account let's stay right in the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.040
 center of the two previous slip 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.210
 two 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:49.440
 we return to slide we weave the three 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.360
 points right and we always return the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.550
 only variant is the beginning but all 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.220
 is based on three rights points and the 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.960
 sliding room 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.440
 as well 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.440
 a 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.250
 3 and so repeat until the row is finished 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.930
 to touch and now point 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.050
 all right 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.390
 here is alternating we make three 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.760
 rows upside down right upside down and on the 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.060
 fourth we go back to do the slip point 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.280
 but starting in the fourth point here 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.409
 it's my turn again to start with three 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.239
 you clearly see that in the 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.250
 previous we have started with one and the 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.010
 point slip now I'm going to do three 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.230
 points and the slip point so that it is 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:49.170
 in the center of the row 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:49.170
 previous one two three and slide 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.850
 they take the point again 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.800
 123 to 40 that all this is always done 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.800
 to the right 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:10.090
 23 they are already doing and repeating 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.930
 these variants first begin with 3 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.329
 points and then in the second row 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.079
 that they get the slip start in the 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.259
 second point 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.569
 here so that they remember the first 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:27.530
 row that this point is made becomes the 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:30.650
 slip 1 2 3 points and in the fourth 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.560
 slide you weave your third your three 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.759
 rows of jersey and go back to making the 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.469
 slip but this time it would be the second 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.900
 remember that this edge point does not 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:44.560
 we tell him then one in the second 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.960
 they make the slip and so they alternate 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.710
 second and fourth so that it is of this 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.190
 way they see how it is alternated 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.520
 here and here and here's nest is formed 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.520
 bee
