do<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.540> original<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.200> that's<00:01:43.649> finding

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
do in the original and that's finding

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.190 
do in the original and that's finding
huge<00:01:44.369> jumps<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> sending<00:01:45.329> your<00:01:45.479> car<00:01:45.720> hurtling

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
huge jumps and sending your car hurtling

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.859 
huge jumps and sending your car hurtling
through<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> air<00:01:47.390> perhaps<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.659> biggest

through the air perhaps the biggest

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.660 
through the air perhaps the biggest
improvement<00:01:49.560> for<00:01:49.619> me<00:01:49.680> personally<00:01:50.009> though<00:01:50.399> was

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
improvement for me personally though was

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.819 
improvement for me personally though was
in<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> games<00:01:51.119> handling<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.869> mentioned<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.799> my

there<00:02:16.010> was<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.130> huge<00:02:16.430> amount<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.850> exploration

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210

and<00:02:17.810> at<00:02:18.230> times<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.710> did<00:02:18.890> feel<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.520> racing

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
and at times it did feel that the racing

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.430 
and at times it did feel that the racing
itself<00:02:20.000> was<00:02:20.480> secondary

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440

this time around though the racing

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.780 
this time around though the racing
itself<00:02:23.480> has<00:02:23.870> been<00:02:23.990> finely<00:02:24.470> tuned<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.640> if

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
itself has been finely tuned and so if

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.700 
itself has been finely tuned and so if

original this though did cause quite a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
time some felt that the tracks had been

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.570 
time some felt that the tracks had been
dumbed<00:02:51.200> down<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:51.709> younger<00:02:52.070> gamers<00:02:52.280> could

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
dumbed down so that younger gamers could

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.790 
dumbed down so that younger gamers could
still<00:02:52.820> enjoy<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.330> game<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.840> others<00:02:54.380> felt<00:02:54.650> not

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
still enjoy the game and others felt not

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.650 
still enjoy the game and others felt not
the<00:02:54.920> track<00:02:55.160> designs<00:02:55.520> were<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:55.880> fact<00:02:56.090> better<00:02:56.420> in

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
the track designs were in fact better in

the track designs were in fact better in
the<00:02:56.780> original<00:02:57.459> personally<00:02:58.459> though<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.640> sit

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
the original personally though I sit

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.790 
the original personally though I sit
somewhere<00:02:59.270> in<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.450> middle<00:02:59.720> sure<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.590> game's

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
somewhere in the middle sure the game's

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.830 
somewhere in the middle sure the game's
more<00:03:01.070> forgiving<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.760> easier<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.300> pick<00:03:02.510> up<00:03:02.660> and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
more forgiving and easier to pick up and

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.170 
more forgiving and easier to pick up and
play<00:03:02.959> but<00:03:03.620> part<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.070> fun<00:03:04.280> was<00:03:04.550> finding<00:03:05.000> all

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
play but part of the fun was finding all

play but part of the fun was finding all
of<00:03:05.209> these<00:03:05.450> secret<00:03:05.900> routes<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.920> way

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
of these secret routes and in the way

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.800 
of these secret routes and in the way
the<00:03:07.280> game<00:03:07.430> just<00:03:07.640> didn't<00:03:07.910> feel<00:03:08.090> as<00:03:08.270> open<00:03:08.600> as<00:03:08.690> the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
the game just didn't feel as open as the

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
realized that errors they made and

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.100 
realized that errors they made and
instead<00:03:43.910> we're<00:03:44.180> now<00:03:44.299> left<00:03:44.570> with<00:03:44.720> some<00:03:44.900> much

more fitting music music this time

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.259 
more fitting music music this time
around<00:03:48.410> is<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.680> faster<00:03:49.130> pace<00:03:49.400> techno<00:03:49.850> inspired

affair<00:03:50.600> and<00:03:50.840> I<00:03:51.230> can<00:03:51.380> see<00:03:51.560> why<00:03:51.709> they<00:03:51.860> did<00:03:52.040> that

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
affair and I can see why they did that

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.130 
affair and I can see why they did that
as<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.400> genre<00:03:52.730> was<00:03:52.970> popular<00:03:53.450> at<00:03:53.570> the<00:03:53.630> time<00:03:53.660> and

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
as a genre was popular at the time and

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.310 
as a genre was popular at the time and
it<00:03:54.470> matches<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.920> intense<00:03:55.250> speed<00:03:55.549> of<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.910> game

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
it matches the intense speed of the game

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.020 
it matches the intense speed of the game
last<00:03:57.320> time<00:03:57.440> around<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:57.920> also<00:03:58.100> stated<00:03:58.580> how<00:03:58.880> much

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
last time around it also stated how much

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.970 
last time around it also stated how much
I<00:03:59.180> like<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.570> sound<00:03:59.810> effects<00:04:00.170> in<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.590> game<00:04:00.739> and

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
I like the sound effects in the game and

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.160 
I like the sound effects in the game and
to<00:04:01.010> my<00:04:01.519> surprise<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:01.970> seems<00:04:02.390> that<00:04:02.480> Atari<00:04:02.840> 2

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
to my surprise it seems that Atari 2

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.690 
to my surprise it seems that Atari 2
were<00:04:03.320> also<00:04:03.650> quite<00:04:03.890> happy<00:04:04.220> with<00:04:04.370> them<00:04:04.549> because

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
were also quite happy with them because

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.850 
were also quite happy with them because
they<00:04:05.330> use<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.690> exact<00:04:06.019> same<00:04:06.230> set<00:04:06.590> for<00:04:06.769> this

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
they use the exact same set for this

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.670 
they use the exact same set for this
game<00:04:07.070> too<00:04:07.450> there<00:04:08.450> are<00:04:08.570> some<00:04:08.780> new<00:04:08.930> noises<00:04:09.530> and

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
game too there are some new noises and

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.530 
game too there are some new noises and
it<00:04:10.010> does<00:04:10.190> change<00:04:10.220> depending<00:04:10.940> on<00:04:11.030> your<00:04:11.209> engine

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
it does change depending on your engine

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.150 
it does change depending on your engine
that<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.810> choose<00:04:12.079> to<00:04:12.230> put<00:04:12.440> in<00:04:12.530> your<00:04:12.680> car<00:04:12.860> and

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
that you choose to put in your car and

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.979 
that you choose to put in your car and
so<00:04:13.519> when<00:04:13.670> combined<00:04:14.060> with<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.269> new<00:04:14.450> music<00:04:14.840> this

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
so when combined with the new music this

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.750 
so when combined with the new music this
is<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.200> game<00:04:15.470> which<00:04:15.620> has<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.829> huge<00:04:16.160> improvement

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
is a game which has a huge improvement

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.400 
is a game which has a huge improvement
in<00:04:16.850> this<00:04:17.000> area

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
in this area

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.620 
in this area
when<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.250> look<00:04:19.459> back<00:04:19.489> at<00:04:19.670> rush<00:04:19.970> two<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.270> wasn't

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
when I look back at rush two I wasn't

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.660 
when I look back at rush two I wasn't
blown<00:04:20.900> away<00:04:21.170> as<00:04:21.230> that<00:04:21.410> hopes<00:04:21.620> have<00:04:21.830> been<00:04:21.860> but

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
blown away as that hopes have been but

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.520 
blown away as that hopes have been but
