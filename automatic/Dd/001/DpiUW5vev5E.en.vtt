00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.390
 welcome to my first video contest 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.770
 of this channel 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.320
 how the idea of ​​this contest was born 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.570
 since I finally managed to 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.940
 have the first money taiwo tub ho 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.529
 decided to spend it entirely for 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.910
 buy this gift to put on 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.350
 prize in this competition 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.970
 I do this to thank everyone 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.220
 those who continue to follow me 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.199
 follow and maybe this will follow me 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.490
 moment on my channel 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.050
 I thank all those who have put 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.599
 I like all those who have 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.920
 commented that in the framework that opinion 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.250
 they told me maybe it's better if you do 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.770
 so 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.120
 in short, all all of them none 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.559
 even those who remain a 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.059
 put I don't like because it's always a 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.950
 vote more but I have to see what 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.230
 consists the competition here I tell you also 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 the priest indeed does not see the prize as the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.590
 award is a tablet 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.379
 mediacom smartpad 700 15 and together with 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.530
 event tone tablet can be taken to 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.670
 home also a customized case for the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.710
 tablet with integrated physical keyboard 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.049
 how to participate in the contest is a lot 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.380
 simple enough if the video these two 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.810
 simple directions 1 be written to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.939
 second channel what leaves up to a 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.310
 maximum of three comments under this 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.680
 video not on facebook not on google plus 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.030
 unwritten but under and within this 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.979
 video in which you write what 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.600
 it seems to you that comments are welcome from 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.640
 like because now if you win this prize 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.590
 because I need a few tablets 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.810
 advice on what I do is that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.579
 you think I should do it in short 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.360
 ask, however, if you make comments 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.040
 more consistent 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.600
 better that way so when I link them or 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.119
 maybe or some more ideas 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.090
 obviously only three comments because then 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.770
 will have to check if you have more facts then 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.780
 if you are not registered then look good 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.020
 these stations and the winner go 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.030
 obviously extracted with one of those trusts 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.670
 now type random.org 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.909
 this is really all I hope 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.330
 participate in so many and win the 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.659
 best 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.659
 Hello
