00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:19.039
 McDuck we start with baking buns 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:23.859
 for that we need all of us now 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:29.810
 it mix and put the microwave 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:33.260
 the easiest recipe buns 2 canteens 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:39.760
 spoons of oat bran and hammers can 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:43.610
 They can optionally half a spoon 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.710
 wheat bran to make it 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:52.399
 half I rate added 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:55.359
 about half a teaspoon further 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.670
 baking powder 1 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:05.510
 i can't be there too much 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:18.880
 get too little spoons 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:18.880
 baking powder 1 egg and a little city 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.009
 better to take some mold in 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.619
 I do not know this more like a bun 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.530
 like McDuck to make it all sleep 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.869
 it could be cut in half added 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:40.310
 roads and now the whole thing 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:44.079
 mix forgiveness for us not to beat 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.079
 Mixer Mix 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.470
 start forget to add here some 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:07.420
 seasoning the fact that the bun was more 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.369
 flavored i add salt and add 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.369
 mix of different peppers 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:21.880
 in the background i have homemade beef 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.130
 minced minced meat over dukan very much 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.190
 buy because there is very big 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.620
 fat content yes there add in general all that 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.270
 only possible but led par here 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.750
 accordingly I want to make a salute 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.940
 at home I would do help 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.600
 blender 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.790
 even in the bowl and properly knocked down 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.750
 here it turned out so very good 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:50.890
 straight there hands turned mince I did 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:58.150
 a little more than a meter roll means 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:03.340
 we have such a mixture for a bun 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.980
 we are now putting it in the microwave for 4 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.840
 minutes i'm good we need her will 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.150
 then flip in order to bun 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.860
 baked on all sides I have this 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.900
 microns at least you can in 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:21.730
 the oven at 15 until it is in the back 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.450
 the background noise microwave I'll cut 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.090
 Tomatoes to 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.410
 rather tomato and in order for us 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.860
 add it our hamburger year enough for me 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:38.209
 spirit pieces are not expensive 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:42.200
 Further the best for combo pen is 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.970
 iceberg lettuce I don't have it today 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.849
 a miracle it did not find the nearest store and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:53.140
 so I will just be green myself 200 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.140
 r green salad with mobile cheese 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.360
 solid now i will get a sharp knife and 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.620
 cut off 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:07.420
 cut off a piece of cheese I will be he 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.420
 turned out to be more crumbly 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.900
 cut into pieces 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.000
 I mean there sacivi years sauce 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.250
 which will be ketchup 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.010
 place of soap curd 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:32.630
 my neighbors and right i prepared as 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:35.410
 branch serving him there such a beef 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.520
 burgers naturally look that way 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.810
 which life is on without oil from me 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:45.160
 got ready on the background there I hear 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.160
 microwave cooked a bun 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:54.200
 we get a bun she is such a form 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:59.560
 she came out now she is a little bit under 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:04.640
 i'm getting cold i'll cut and start collecting our 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.520
 our hamburger or not even our cheeseburger 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.400
 well, that'll be just a little cool I 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.350
 I can basically take the development 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:20.390
 in half yet the reason you are still for me 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:25.250
 a personal cut dad very much 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:28.730
 depends on the shape of your sculptors 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.490
 brother who will you make a bun 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:35.620
 those. i will get a job she bottom search i 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:40.100
 so here and on top a little bit convex 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:44.300
 from above you can cover he lived there by 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:48.430
 desire does not necessarily mean that we 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.500
 Now we will do collect it in layers 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.419
 as far as I remember from the bottom always 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.430
 lies 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.040
 I'll make a salad just like that 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.380
 I am Kamenets 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.419
 the bottom is always a pretty salad 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.419
 so now we are semi 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:16.740
 Next you need to put the cutlet itself . 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:22.280
 generally straight arm light pure light home 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.280
 which means we add a little bit of medic 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:32.720
 don't regret our you mayonnaise 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:41.460
 we are at it a little bit 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.280
 our little bird with you a little left in such 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.190
 liquid so you need to be in this plan 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:51.930
 be careful waist 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:54.960
 send us tomato cheese I 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.880
 still add 1 while I baked a bun 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.310
 not exactly until it got cold i found 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.040
 I have a sugar free gunner 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.970
 Bonded refrigerator 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:08.360
 they without save a sugar substitute here 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.400
 all that I wanted I added and now 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:15.600
 I cover this case 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:20.590
 lid that I got in 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:23.970
 cut like that 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.930
 such a sandwich now and how do I 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:31.080
 posimpatichnee scho Takeo pile for 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:31.080
 so he was flatter here 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.820
 he is still warm due to the fact that 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.960
 bun warm sam starts to melt 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:46.090
 salad as it should be cold 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:50.770
 Tomato is also cold and salted cucumber 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:56.650
 I also don't want a cold 

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:59.920
