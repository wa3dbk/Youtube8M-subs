is the seven foot six medium heavy and I

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.970 
is the seven foot six medium heavy and I
got<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> revo<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> stacks<00:00:12.929> on<00:00:13.080> there<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.410> spooled

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
got a revo I stacks on there and spooled

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.880 
got a revo I stacks on there and spooled
up<00:00:14.099> with<00:00:14.250> 50<00:00:14.490> pound<00:00:14.700> braid<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.619> broad

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
up with 50 pound braid and on this broad

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.260 
up with 50 pound braid and on this broad
is<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.100> medium<00:00:17.609> heavy<00:00:17.789> but<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.180> actually

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
is a medium heavy but it's actually

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.939 
is a medium heavy but it's actually
pretty<00:00:18.600> stiff<00:00:18.990> i<00:00:19.140> would<00:00:19.320> say<00:00:19.619> it's<00:00:19.800> probably

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
pretty stiff i would say it's probably

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.349 
pretty stiff i would say it's probably
just<00:00:20.490> as<00:00:20.760> stiff<00:00:21.689> if<00:00:21.900> not<00:00:22.080> more<00:00:22.289> stiff<00:00:22.590> than<00:00:22.619> my

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
just as stiff if not more stiff than my

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.439 
just as stiff if not more stiff than my

and um this sort of actually cast pretty
dang<00:00:40.920> good<00:00:40.950> i<00:00:41.190> mean<00:00:41.399> if<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.760> look<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
dang good i mean if you look at that the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.619 
dang good i mean if you look at that the
really<00:00:42.890> long<00:00:43.890> forecast<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.030> i<00:00:45.180> didn't<00:00:45.510> have

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
really long forecast and i didn't have

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.029 
really long forecast and i didn't have
to<00:00:45.750> swing<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.079> out<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.379> hard<00:00:47.930> but<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.440> mean<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
to swing it out that hard but I mean the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.040 
to swing it out that hard but I mean the
rod<00:00:50.219> handles<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> well<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.270> doesn't<00:00:51.899> seem<00:00:52.020> like

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
rod handles it well it doesn't seem like

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.479 
rod handles it well it doesn't seem like
it's<00:00:52.320> putting<00:00:52.469> too<00:00:52.649> much<00:00:52.770> stress<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> tip

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
it's putting too much stress on the tip

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.549 
it's putting too much stress on the tip
you<00:00:54.329> know<00:00:54.449> or<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> rod<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.110> thread<00:00:55.379> has<00:00:55.410> a

but this broad you know pretty much

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.570 
but this broad you know pretty much
thing<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.199> perfect<00:01:04.589> i<00:01:04.619> don't<00:01:04.830> necessarily

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
thing is perfect i don't necessarily

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
thing is perfect i don't necessarily
need<00:01:05.729> my<00:01:05.939> swim<00:01:06.210> bait<00:01:06.360> stick<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> as

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.530 
and just so i can show you guys some
more<00:01:14.130> Cass<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.880> burn<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.330> in

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
more Cass I'm just going to burn this in

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.520 
more Cass I'm just going to burn this in
here

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.590 

and<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> set<00:01:20.790> point<00:01:20.940> one<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.390> gear

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
and this is a set point one to one gear

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.120 
and this is a set point one to one gear
ratio<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.080> cranking<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.619> fast<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.070> can

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
ratio and I'm cranking as fast as I can

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
ratio and I'm cranking as fast as I can
right<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.110> still

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
right now and as you can see it still

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440 
right now and as you can see it still
takes<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.680> while<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.010> get<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.280> thing<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.640> just

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
takes a while to get this thing in just

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.870 
takes a while to get this thing in just
cast<00:01:27.690> really<00:01:28.110> well<00:01:28.280> test<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.580> far

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.910 

and<00:01:35.180> I<00:01:35.719> think<00:01:35.960> I'm<00:01:36.049> probably<00:01:36.229> going<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.649> use

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
and I think I'm probably going to use

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.740 
and I think I'm probably going to use
this<00:01:37.100> as<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.369> this<00:01:37.909> might<00:01:38.090> even<00:01:38.240> be<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.420> swimbait

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
this as a this might even be a swimbait

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.649 
this as a this might even be a swimbait
stick<00:01:39.140> for<00:01:39.380> my<00:01:39.590> baits<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.520> aren't<00:01:41.000> super<00:01:41.450> big

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
stick for my baits that aren't super big

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.539 
stick for my baits that aren't super big
I<00:01:41.930> probably<00:01:42.530> won't<00:01:42.710> throw<00:01:42.950> Huddleston's<00:01:43.399> on

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
I probably won't throw Huddleston's on

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.690 
I probably won't throw Huddleston's on
this<00:01:43.729> but<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.509> know<00:01:44.630> swim<00:01:45.020> jigs<00:01:45.700> smaller

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
this but you know swim jigs smaller

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.520 
this but you know swim jigs smaller
swimbaits<00:01:47.149> 56<00:01:47.600> inches<00:01:47.840> I'll<00:01:47.990> probably<00:01:48.170> will

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
swimbaits 56 inches I'll probably will
