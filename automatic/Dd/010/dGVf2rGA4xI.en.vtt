00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.970
 he did not settle for the few technological resources his car has 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.940
 expertise 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.279
 and decided to create 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.080
 himself a mix of computer 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.449
 in the car 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.449
 the result you know now 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:21.599
 if you considered yourself a great and thought you did not detach from the computer 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:22.630
 not a second 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.859
 it's not because you do not know this guy here denilson 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.960
 he is so fond of technology that he has developed a mini-course 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.750
 his car because it's a joke if it works 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.450
 we do not know if by disclosure 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.900
 by equipment because it believes that it affects ten functions inside a car 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.570
 so use this big difference 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.670
 in the case of kart I decide denilson the story works like this 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.799
 he bought a cabinet specially made for this purpose 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:58.439
 the device is connected directly to the car battery a victory both 

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:02.849
 suffer and thus it was possible to eliminate mouse and keyboard that the processor is a 

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:05.849
 legal action for this type of application 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.470
 the forum actor 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.540
 but with the three three points 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.420
 we have none adds very little 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.280
 It's great to leave it in the car. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.600
 the second is the price 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.910
 hehehe and the third is that he is he is a legend 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.980
 on the fiction portal did not train 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.840
 the processor 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.860
 are like any other how can I get in the car and 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.480
 the car fell over 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.060
 the board of the learn robust and understood I never had any problem 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.750
 theses, Denilson himself developed the entire project as the only 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.439
 needed assistance was that of an electrician to avoid any 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.610
 problem with the operation of the registry during the process other care 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 also had to be taken 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.810
 I have today 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.050
 the cabinet 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.220
 special square to 4 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.370
 one day he has a butt like mules a thick rubber guiding 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.790
 with him were little the vocal preparation 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.990
 so I have this either just the role of the cabinet the computer is 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.180
 equipped with this program that has lived and all kart applications to be 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.539
 in one place 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.529
 ps must dictate the internet 3g and network tv and fm radio and also with the voter 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.849
 and up to the iphone and 100% integrated system 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.849
 before the acid is scattered around the car and so it is easy to play any 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.900
 selling new music and films, it's because it was installed in the back 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.709
 of the car and engaging the reverse gear is automatically activated 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.889
 it is easier to hit the beacon acronym and even the motorcycle information of the car 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.989
 since speed temperature are shown on the screen is that a censor was 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.809
 installed an electronic injection system and the information is 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.809
 sent directly to the computer 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.809
 the initial idea would be to buy a dvd 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:52.989
 with bluetooth integrated with the consular link 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.989
 and with television 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.029
 so what I have all functionalities in the bbb 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:05.269
 but fought for the decision 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.389
 eternal 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.920
 on a computer well has numbers advantages i can play 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.299
 there is much to be done yet. 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.299
 Much cheaper proof 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.569
 with an eye on this lode some companies have begun to think about the possibility 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.890
 to develop the equipment right here in Brazil 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.920
 while Canadians still do not go straight from the factory. 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.310
 inventing fashion and already have in the head a lot of system upgrade 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:33.509
 led here 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.499
 tire pressure sensors 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.149
 the back sensor 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:39.780
 everything inside the computer there are other things 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.099
 which can be made as 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.909
 Control life, she's fucked right on the computer, but that's still true. 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.909
 much to the fact that it is not a little bit 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.569
 if you want to have a computer in your car like that 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.219
 so now go digital look point with br br and here in that matter in 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.909
 highlight in our will we give the line that separates discussion forums 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.989
 where you meet people like Denilson and if you are interested in 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.690
 crazy there are digital elements you will also find in our 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.389
 site another matter of a guy so passionate about aviation that he set up his 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.849
 own flight simulator or inside a room 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.289
 the project is so cool that real pilots go there to train 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.580
 and since we were talking about 29, there was another date for this musician who 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.020
 create musical instruments with a child's toy all this you 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.220
 just see in the digital look point with dot br picture
