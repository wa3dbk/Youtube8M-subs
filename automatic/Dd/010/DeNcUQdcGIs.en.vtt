00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello everyone boys were cannucci 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.250
 welcome to a new video 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.590
 today for the editing of sea â€‹â€‹doo we have 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.630
 tested a fantastic new service 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.089
 offered by the different make ie 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.970
 an all- Italian company that more than 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.310
 ten years works in favor of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.109
 consumer in favor of users has 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.380
 in fact recently launched a new one 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.050
 service that provides for the revaluation of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.080
 used for iphone and ipad 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.130
 in addition to the resale of these 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.250
 products 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.649
 obviously this is an excellent device 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.620
 it was good in this case we have 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.950
 wanted to try this order service 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.820
 have a white iphone 5 16gb al 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.190
 price of 485 euros 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.520
 obviously it's not bruscolini 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.489
 so much true that the service is true 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.199
 is born for this reason to offer to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.859
 all the people who decided to 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.040
 buy a used product something 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.470
 reliable rather than maybe going 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.229
 to look for the first seller on various 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.180
 e-commerce sites online or why not 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.610
 the various ad sites 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.020
 let's face it we never know if there is 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.960
 person we are starting with 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.090
 a negotiation is reliable or not 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.100
 so we can make the best purchase 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.369
 of our life maybe a compressed 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.270
 less like no how could we receive a 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.939
 pack full of paper ok so the price 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.329
 of buydifferent will not be very low 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.700
 but certainly it is safe to say two 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.799
 my words starting from the confirmation 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.469
 continued as you see is very 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.460
 refined is completely branded is 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.659
 already here 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.750
 already here we realize how much 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.850
 the company is serious in the sense that like 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.740
 my good father said and as he says 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.240
 still because luck for him luck 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.850
 for me he is still alive practically when 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.240
 a company besides treating the product 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.329
 inside, of course, pay attention 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.020
 to the storage box and in any case to the 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.869
 product presentation e 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.819
 probably because the product is worth if 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.010
 it is a company that trims 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.610
 attacks rip off things of this type 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.040
 surely you will definitely not take it 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.420
 the trouble of making a nice package 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.920
 like this 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.470
 very well then what I had 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.860
 another the interior is a product in 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.870
 very good state of full attention 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.380
 all the accessories so we are 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.010
 speaking of normal charger 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.230
 of the boss still incellophanata e 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.709
 this really means a lot e 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.630
 finally lightning cable and pardon pardon 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.410
 pardon we obviously forgot 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.230
 of our indispensable dropout 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.139
 when we have to go and get the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.359
 our sim to replace it if this is the 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:00.870
 phone as you see it apparently 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.410
 it is really in excellent condition 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.010
 except for who they want to be 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.390
 we want to be sincere sayers 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.140
 because when it comes to products 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.960
 apple 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.050
 our editing in particular is 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.170
 very very picky I am very fussy 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.240
 the editorial very very fussy 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.520
 so although it is a 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.280
 really in excellent condition 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.140
 so i guess you will be hard pressed to 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.830
 find products with me like this here 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.080
 we can say that there is a small one 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.480
 spalling 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.000
 according to me why phone we say is 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.660
 fell from the hands of the previous one 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.570
 owner 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:45.670
 there is a chipping on a corner in 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:49.090
 high near the mute button and in 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.040
 more everything came back we find other small ones 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.750
 chipping other small rulers 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.840
 maybe even some signs of wear 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.880
 maybe given by a protective cover 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.580
 because unfortunately this is one of many 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.680
 problems you may have in the 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.440
 use certain types of covers 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.790
 plastics which we say with 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.890
 time and let's say so to speak 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.780
 the star of the cement taste of the 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.850
 device there is one when you give 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.570
 puts in his pocket and his beautiful cover 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.250
 there is the cover too tight the iphone nel 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.930
 movements perhaps that our can do 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.780
 phone on the pocket or on the table a 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.600
 very light friction movement of 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.170
 bottleneck this way here could 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.419
 tend to wear down the edges of the phone 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.510
 as you know the generation of the iPhone 5 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.480
 no matter how beautiful she always looks 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.419
 had this huge little big one 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.300
 problem or trying not to 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.640
 ruin the edges around obviously here 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.460
 we have chosen the white model it has 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.180
 certainly less problems than the black one 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:02.110
 slate was really a mess 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.270
 we could keep my ex slate in 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.670
 an optimal state important thing 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.020
 about this device 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:14.440
 it came on and unloaded of course 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.710
 it is unloaded but it has already come on with 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.460
 isles 7 the latest version installed 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.770
 so if you are lucky you can already tell 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.820
 as soon as the device arrives 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.350
 turn it on and clear as you can 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.470
 see even from here I don't know if you see it 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.060
 however, it is truly accounting 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.950
 not even to have had to go under 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.920
 the device is loaded anyway 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.390
 it arrived with a little charge then 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.150
 this means that as soon as it arrives 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.910
 you can immediately start having fun with 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.670
 your device that comes about 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.010
 of shipping times arrived in a 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.910
 day and a half so it's not really there 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.680
 nothing to say the times really are 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.890
 fast what a very important thing we have 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.750
 appreciated the fact that every single one 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:05.380
 product is inside the box 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:08.830
 both outside were covered with a packaging 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.660
 that prevented bumps and this is 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.090
 really very important because you know 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.250
 as it is in sorting centers maybe 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.260
 of couriers for a bit salty 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.810
 these devices can take 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.860
 accidentally beatings and we do not 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.470
 we want it to happen 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.060
 for this buydifferent puts let's say 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.770
 these layers of protective film 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.919
 who settle 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.470
 first thing very important even if the 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:35.169
 device that you buy maybe 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.759
 from the old owner was lacking 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:40.360
 of guarantee 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:42.159
 different bari guarantees 12 months of 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.139
 product purchase guarantee 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:47.020
 so when you buy from buy 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:49.690
 difference you are absolutely autonomous 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.370
 independent and above all safe because 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.300
 if something should happen in a year 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.699
 you are second while 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.960
 non-wear technical malfunctions 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:00.190
 regarding the malfunctions 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.990
 technicians 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:06.430
 you can refer to buy 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:09.550
 different and you have 12 months warranty 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.530
 well what about this service there 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.889
 looks particularly good 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:17.020
 particularly reliable for which i 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:19.419
 prices are not very low, however 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.729
 service is convenient because you are in between 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:25.599

 half 8 depends on how manic you are 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:33.190
