00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
sharp edges another thing that I found

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.149 
sharp edges another thing that I found
is<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.240> course<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.320> want<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> take<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> labels

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
is of course you want to take the labels

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.850 
is of course you want to take the labels
off<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.670> these<00:01:53.790> cans<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.590> gets

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
off of these cans because if this gets

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.350 
off of these cans because if this gets
really<00:01:56.040> hot<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.579> catch<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.939> label<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
really hot it can catch the label of the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.569 
really hot it can catch the label of the
paper<00:01:57.600> labels<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.170> them<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.710> fire<00:01:58.950> but

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
paper labels on them on fire but

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.399 
paper labels on them on fire but
something<00:02:00.090> else<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.390> had<00:02:00.630> thought<00:02:00.840> about<00:02:01.020> is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
something else I had thought about is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.929 
something else I had thought about is
that<00:02:03.259> this<00:02:04.259> glue<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.310> holds<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.640> label

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
that this glue here that holds a label

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.499 
that this glue here that holds a label
on<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.689> get<00:02:06.840> quite<00:02:07.259> hot<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.190> becomes<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.209> don't

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
on can get quite hot and becomes I don't

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.440 
on can get quite hot and becomes I don't
know<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.170> sticky<00:02:11.180> okay<00:02:12.180> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
know if you can see that sticky okay and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.880 
know if you can see that sticky okay and
if<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.110> becomes<00:02:13.290> stick

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
if it becomes stick

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.010 
if it becomes stick
again<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.100> sticks<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.940> then<00:02:15.600> you're<00:02:15.900> going

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
again it sticks to you then you're going

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.780 
again it sticks to you then you're going
to<00:02:16.080> get<00:02:16.230> burned<00:02:16.560> fortunately<00:02:17.460> I<00:02:17.490> haven't<00:02:17.640> been

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
to get burned fortunately I haven't been

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.309 
to get burned fortunately I haven't been
gettin<00:02:17.970> burned<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.600> did<00:02:18.810> notice<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.170> it's

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
gettin burned but I did notice that it's

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.820 
gettin burned but I did notice that it's
sticky<00:02:19.590> now<00:02:20.459> this<00:02:20.700> has<00:02:20.850> been<00:02:21.030> out<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.870> rocket

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
sticky now this has been out this rocket

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.690 
sticky now this has been out this rocket
stove<00:02:22.980> has<00:02:23.160> been<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.890> hasn't<00:02:26.220> been<00:02:26.280> burning

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
stove has been it hasn't been burning

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.420 
stove has been it hasn't been burning
for<00:02:26.730> probably<00:02:27.690> 10<00:02:28.260> minutes<00:02:28.650> or<00:02:29.010> 15<00:02:29.400> minutes

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
for probably 10 minutes or 15 minutes

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.050 
for probably 10 minutes or 15 minutes
but<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.690> still<00:02:30.990> hot<00:02:31.380> here<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.850> can

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
but this is still hot here so if you can

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.600 
but this is still hot here so if you can
get<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.200> off<00:02:34.260> somehow<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.160> nobody

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
get that off somehow so nobody

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.949 
get that off somehow so nobody
accidentally<00:02:36.030> touches<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.780> gets

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
accidentally touches that and gets

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.000 
accidentally touches that and gets
burned<00:02:37.230> would<00:02:37.830> be<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> good<00:02:38.190> idea<00:02:39.709> it's<00:02:40.709> nice

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
burned would be a good idea it's nice

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.940 
burned would be a good idea it's nice
and<00:02:41.250> wide<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.760> low<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:42.660> got<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> solid<00:02:43.319> base

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
and wide it's low it's got a solid base

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.340 
and wide it's low it's got a solid base
I<00:02:43.980> imagine<00:02:44.940> put<00:02:45.120> any<00:02:45.330> kind<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.810> regular

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
I imagine put any kind of regular

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.199 
I imagine put any kind of regular
cooking<00:02:46.800> pan<00:02:47.340> pot<00:02:49.130> on<00:02:50.130> top<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.670> here<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.060> it'd

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
cooking pan pot on top of here and it'd

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.290 
cooking pan pot on top of here and it'd
be<00:02:51.239> very<00:02:51.360> safe<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.100> highly<00:02:53.760> recommend<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
be very safe so I highly recommend the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.479 
be very safe so I highly recommend the
rocket<00:02:54.630> stove<00:02:54.840> again<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.739> design<00:02:56.130> came<00:02:56.459> from
