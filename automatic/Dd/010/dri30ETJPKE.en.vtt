00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.470 

oh<00:00:03.650> say<00:00:04.650> go<00:00:04.799> do<00:00:04.859> this<00:00:05.000> alright<00:00:06.000> so<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.240> says

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
oh say go do this alright so this says

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.909 
oh say go do this alright so this says
what<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.870> another<00:00:07.109> way<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.379> writing<00:00:07.529> two

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
what is another way of writing two

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.600 
what is another way of writing two
nights<00:00:10.190> so<00:00:11.190> we<00:00:12.120> should<00:00:12.360> remember<00:00:12.599> how<00:00:12.870> to

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
nights so we should remember how to

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.450 
nights so we should remember how to
change<00:00:15.320> fractions<00:00:16.320> into<00:00:16.500> decimals<00:00:16.529> remember

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
change fractions into decimals remember

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.510 
change fractions into decimals remember
we<00:00:17.730> put<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> 9<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.330> outside<00:00:18.980> too<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.430> you

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
we put the 9 on the outside too and you

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.460 
we put the 9 on the outside too and you
bring<00:00:20.670> down<00:00:20.850> investment<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:22.199> got<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.410> ask

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
bring down investment you got to ask

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.140 
bring down investment you got to ask
yourself<00:00:22.590> obvious<00:00:23.189> eyes<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.460> 9<00:00:23.609> points<00:00:24.029> you

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
yourself obvious eyes is 9 points you

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.349 
yourself obvious eyes is 9 points you
ex-wife<00:00:27.470> 92<00:00:28.470> point<00:00:28.740> again

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:32.359 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:34.119 

right<00:00:32.929> now<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:33.199> should<00:00:33.379> see<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.559> pattern<00:00:33.769> every

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
right now you should see a pattern every

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.739 
right now you should see a pattern every
time<00:00:34.309> bring<00:00:34.609> that<00:00:34.730> up<00:00:34.909> so<00:00:35.149> this<00:00:35.300> is<00:00:35.449> just<00:00:35.659> going

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:35.749 
time bring that up so this is just going

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:41.459 
time bring that up so this is just going
to<00:00:35.809> be<00:00:35.960> point<00:00:36.679> to<00:00:36.890> repeating<00:00:37.399> on<00:00:37.519> forever

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.810 

let's<00:00:42.469> take<00:00:42.589> a<00:00:42.649> look<00:00:42.769> at<00:00:42.859> those<00:00:42.920> new<00:00:43.070> stuff<00:00:43.309> we

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
let's take a look at those new stuff we

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.000 
let's take a look at those new stuff we
got<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.030> rational<00:00:44.449> numbers<00:00:45.010> irrational

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
got the rational numbers irrational

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.979 
got the rational numbers irrational
numbers<00:00:46.280> are<00:00:46.399> numbers<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:47.000> cannot<00:00:47.600> be

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
numbers are numbers that cannot be

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.200 
numbers are numbers that cannot be
written<00:00:48.739> as<00:00:48.890> a<00:00:48.920> ratio<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:49.579> you<00:00:49.640> cannot<00:00:49.939> write<00:00:50.180> a

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
written as a ratio so you cannot write a

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.000 
written as a ratio so you cannot write a
rational<00:00:50.780> an<00:00:50.989> irrational<00:00:51.289> number<00:00:51.530> as<00:00:51.979> a

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
rational an irrational number as a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.639 
rational an irrational number as a
fraction<00:00:52.549> so<00:00:52.850> all<00:00:53.689> non-repeating

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
fraction so all non-repeating

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.340 
fraction so all non-repeating
nonterminating<00:00:55.449> decimals<00:00:56.449> are<00:00:57.049> all

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
nonterminating decimals are all

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.929 
nonterminating decimals are all
irrational<00:00:58.339> numbers

00:00:58.929 --> 00:00:58.939 
irrational numbers

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:01.179 
irrational numbers
so<00:00:59.269> all<00:00:59.449> that<00:00:59.629> basically<00:01:00.049> means<00:01:00.379> is<00:01:00.859> any

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:01.189 
so all that basically means is any

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:03.520 
so all that basically means is any
number<00:01:01.369> that<00:01:01.670> goes<00:01:01.850> on<00:01:02.119> forever<00:01:02.359> and<00:01:03.109> doesn't

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
number that goes on forever and doesn't

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.779 
number that goes on forever and doesn't
have<00:01:03.619> a<00:01:03.679> pattern<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.339> we<00:01:04.429> already<00:01:04.610> talked

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
have a pattern so we already talked

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:06.700 
have a pattern so we already talked
about<00:01:04.819> that<00:01:05.059> one<00:01:05.360> in<00:01:05.509> our<00:01:05.600> last<00:01:05.780> example<00:01:05.929> that

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
about that one in our last example that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.710 
about that one in our last example that
wasn't<00:01:07.009> rational<00:01:07.220> because<00:01:08.149> it<00:01:08.360> didn't<00:01:08.569> have<00:01:08.690> a

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
wasn't rational because it didn't have a

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.770 
wasn't rational because it didn't have a
pattern<00:01:09.190> okay<00:01:10.190> same<00:01:10.549> thing<00:01:10.759> here<00:01:11.000> doesn't

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
pattern okay same thing here doesn't

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.680 
pattern okay same thing here doesn't
that<00:01:11.869> like<00:01:11.990> that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.539 

also<00:01:17.690> if<00:01:17.899> we<00:01:18.020> take<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.229> look<00:01:18.440> at<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:18.770> we<00:01:19.340> should

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
also if we take a look at this we should

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.469 
also if we take a look at this we should
know<00:01:19.729> that<00:01:20.450> high<00:01:21.729> that's<00:01:22.729> our<00:01:22.880> symbol<00:01:23.060> for<00:01:23.299> pi

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
know that high that's our symbol for pi

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.809 
know that high that's our symbol for pi
is<00:01:24.289> an<00:01:24.530> irrational<00:01:24.590> number<00:01:25.039> because<00:01:25.549> that's<00:01:25.729> a

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
is an irrational number because that's a

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.449 
is an irrational number because that's a
decimal<00:01:26.270> that<00:01:26.509> goes<00:01:26.990> on<00:01:27.229> forever<00:01:27.440> and<00:01:27.860> it

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:28.459 
decimal that goes on forever and it

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:34.460 
decimal that goes on forever and it
never<00:01:28.490> repeats<00:01:28.850> itself

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.830 

because<00:01:34.980> that<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> decimal<00:01:35.610> pi<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.840> equal<00:01:37.050> to

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.980 

3.14159265<00:01:43.070> 4<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.750> we<00:01:45.840> should

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
3.14159265 4 and so on so we should

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.930 
3.14159265 4 and so on so we should
always<00:01:46.110> know<00:01:46.230> if<00:01:46.440> we<00:01:46.530> ever<00:01:46.620> see<00:01:46.860> pi<00:01:47.190> we<00:01:47.910> know

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
always know if we ever see pi we know

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.290 
always know if we ever see pi we know
that<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:48.390> an<00:01:48.630> irrational<00:01:48.960> number<00:01:50.300> all

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
that that's an irrational number all

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.090 
that that's an irrational number all
right<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.690> determining<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.650> following

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
right so determining the following

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.970 
right so determining the following
number<00:01:53.400> is<00:01:53.550> rational<00:01:53.790> or<00:01:54.300> irrational<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.890> you

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
number is rational or irrational so you

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.890 
number is rational or irrational so you
gotta<00:01:56.100> look<00:01:56.220> at<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.910> got<00:01:57.030> six<00:01:57.300> seven<00:01:57.690> six

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
gotta look at this you got six seven six

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.020 
gotta look at this you got six seven six
six<00:01:58.050> seven<00:01:58.260> six<00:01:58.950> six<00:01:59.130> six<00:01:59.370> seven

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
six seven six six six seven

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.270 
six seven six six six seven
so<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.990> order<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.620> a<00:02:01.710> pattern<00:02:02.010> it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
so in order for this to be a pattern it

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.860 
so in order for this to be a pattern it
would<00:02:02.370> have<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.580> go<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.730> six<00:02:03.000> seven<00:02:03.450> six<00:02:03.660> seven

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
would have to go to six seven six seven

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.750 
would have to go to six seven six seven
six<00:02:04.050> seven<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.650> does<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> pattern

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
six seven this does not have a pattern

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.919 
six seven this does not have a pattern
to<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.690> it<00:02:06.810> would<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.080> irrational<00:02:08.929> all

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to it so it would be irrational all

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.000 
to it so it would be irrational all
right<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.200> one's<00:02:10.380> asking<00:02:10.679> which<00:02:10.830> one<00:02:10.860> of

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
right this one's asking which one of

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.490 
right this one's asking which one of
these<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.520> rational<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:15.020> this<00:02:16.020> one<00:02:16.230> looks<00:02:16.410> like

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
these is rational so this one looks like

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.100 
these is rational so this one looks like
it<00:02:16.710> repeats<00:02:17.130> four<00:02:17.760> five<00:02:18.030> four<00:02:18.270> five<00:02:18.300> four<00:02:18.540> five

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.740 

we<00:02:22.110> have<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> square<00:02:22.680> root<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.890> 35<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:26.750> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
we have a square root of 35 and the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.740 
we have a square root of 35 and the
square<00:02:28.020> root<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.230> 200<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:30.390> we<00:02:30.480> can<00:02:30.630> eliminate

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
square root of 200 and we can eliminate

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.090 
square root of 200 and we can eliminate
this<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:31.290> right<00:02:31.380> here<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:31.710> go<00:02:31.830> one<00:02:32.070> two

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
this one right here here we go one two

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.070 
this one right here here we go one two
one<00:02:32.520> two<00:02:32.550> one<00:02:32.730> two<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.830> we<00:02:35.460> should<00:02:35.700> know<00:02:39.080> that

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
one two one two so we should know that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.199 
one two one two so we should know that
the<00:02:40.230> square<00:02:40.410> root<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.800> 35<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:42.120> equal<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:43.550> 5.9

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the square root of 35 is equal to 5.9

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.860 
the square root of 35 is equal to 5.9
six<00:02:45.629> zero<00:02:46.459> seven<00:02:47.459> nine<00:02:47.489> seven<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.480> we're<00:02:48.750> not

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
six zero seven nine seven so we're not

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.009 
six zero seven nine seven so we're not
sure<00:02:49.109> if<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.230> piece<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.790> we<00:02:51.000> should<00:02:51.239> know<00:02:51.480> at

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
sure if that piece and we should know at

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.240 
sure if that piece and we should know at
the<00:02:52.200> square<00:02:52.500> root<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.709> 200<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:55.340> 14<00:02:56.340> 21<00:02:57.150> 4<00:02:57.870> 2<00:02:58.799> 1<00:02:59.099> 3

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
the square root of 200 is 14 21 4 2 1 3

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.589 
the square root of 200 is 14 21 4 2 1 3
5

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.399 

I<00:03:04.629> so<00:03:05.379> since<00:03:05.920> both<00:03:06.189> of<00:03:06.219> these<00:03:06.700> are<00:03:07.409> decimals

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
I so since both of these are decimals

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.500 
I so since both of these are decimals
that<00:03:08.500> go<00:03:08.709> on<00:03:08.859> forever<00:03:09.099> and<00:03:09.400> don't<00:03:09.579> repeat<00:03:09.730> they

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
that go on forever and don't repeat they

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.170 
that go on forever and don't repeat they
were<00:03:10.629> both<00:03:10.959> being<00:03:11.760> irrational<00:03:12.760> numbers<00:03:15.180> next

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
were both being irrational numbers next

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.880 
were both being irrational numbers next
one<00:03:16.329> says<00:03:16.480> which<00:03:16.750> number<00:03:17.109> where<00:03:17.290> numbers<00:03:17.590> are

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
one says which number where numbers are

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.140 
one says which number where numbers are
rational<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:19.209> these<00:03:19.390> are<00:03:19.569> ones<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:21.760> a

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
rational so these are ones that have a

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.089 
rational so these are ones that have a
decimal<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.930> can<00:03:23.170> stop<00:03:23.500> or<00:03:25.739> go<00:03:26.739> on<00:03:26.890> forever

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
decimal that can stop or go on forever

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.890 
decimal that can stop or go on forever
and<00:03:27.340> repeat<00:03:27.609> so<00:03:28.450> zero<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:29.439> know<00:03:29.530> that

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
and repeat so zero you know that

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.449 
and repeat so zero you know that
negative<00:03:31.900> 13<00:03:32.290> because<00:03:32.470> that's<00:03:32.680> an<00:03:32.799> integer<00:03:33.010> we

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
negative 13 because that's an integer we

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.729 
negative 13 because that's an integer we
know<00:03:33.549> all<00:03:33.730> integers<00:03:34.120> rational<00:03:34.530> five<00:03:35.530> nine

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
know all integers rational five nine

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.129 
know all integers rational five nine
five<00:03:35.950> nine<00:03:36.010> five<00:03:36.340> nine<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:36.909> that<00:03:36.939> repeats<00:03:37.329> we

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
five nine five nine so that repeats we

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.589 
five nine five nine so that repeats we
got<00:03:38.319> square<00:03:38.650> root<00:03:38.799> of<00:03:38.889> one<00:03:39.389> remember<00:03:40.389> square

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
got square root of one remember square

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.830 
got square root of one remember square
root<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:41.049> just<00:03:41.200> means<00:03:41.439> what<00:03:42.280> time's<00:03:42.579> itself

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
root it just means what time's itself

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.360 
root it just means what time's itself
people<00:03:43.840> once<00:03:44.079> if<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.349> was<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.560> Dropbox

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
people once if I was to Dropbox

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.629 
people once if I was to Dropbox
it<00:03:45.519> has<00:03:45.909> one<00:03:46.299> unit<00:03:46.780> okay<00:03:47.739> so<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:48.069> is<00:03:48.220> one<00:03:48.430> down

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
it has one unit okay so this is one down

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.330 
it has one unit okay so this is one down
went<00:03:49.419> across<00:03:49.709> spending<00:03:50.709> square<00:03:50.980> root<00:03:51.099> of<00:03:51.159> one

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
went across spending square root of one

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.500 
went across spending square root of one
is<00:03:51.519> one<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:55.049> so<00:03:56.049> since<00:03:56.470> one<00:03:56.919> is<00:03:57.510> rational

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
is one and so since one is rational

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.840 
is one and so since one is rational
because<00:03:58.599> that's<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:59.370> natural

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.190 

violently<00:04:07.850> get<00:04:08.030> over<00:04:08.240> here<00:04:09.370> since<00:04:10.370> an

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
violently get over here since an

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.920 
violently get over here since an
irrational<00:04:12.200> number<00:04:12.590> is<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:14.420> opposite<00:04:14.870> of

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
irrational number is the opposite of

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.500 
irrational number is the opposite of
irrational<00:04:15.790> we're<00:04:16.790> gonna<00:04:16.910> have<00:04:17.060> to<00:04:17.120> put<00:04:17.330> that

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
irrational we're gonna have to put that

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.920 
irrational we're gonna have to put that
all<00:04:17.900> by<00:04:18.170> itself<00:04:18.470> over<00:04:18.769> here<00:04:19.360> so<00:04:20.360> irrational

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
all by itself over here so irrational

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.150 
all by itself over here so irrational
numbers<00:04:21.140> so<00:04:21.230> rational<00:04:21.470> numbers<00:04:21.830> are<00:04:21.920> all<00:04:22.010> by

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
numbers so rational numbers are all by

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.060 
numbers so rational numbers are all by
itself<00:04:22.370> so<00:04:22.460> if<00:04:22.610> something's<00:04:22.970> irrational<00:04:24.070> it's

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
itself so if something's irrational it's

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.550 
itself so if something's irrational it's
not<00:04:25.370> rational<00:04:25.910> for<00:04:26.540> an<00:04:26.630> injured<00:04:26.930> pole<00:04:27.260> or

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
not rational for an injured pole or

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.500 
not rational for an injured pole or
natural<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:29.570> finally<00:04:29.990> our<00:04:30.320> last<00:04:30.350> one<00:04:30.770> here

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
natural and finally our last one here

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.210 
natural and finally our last one here
was<00:04:32.510> gonna<00:04:32.630> be<00:04:32.750> real<00:04:32.930> number<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.680> real<00:04:33.890> number

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
was gonna be real number the real number

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.950 
was gonna be real number the real number
contains<00:04:34.640> all<00:04:35.030> rational<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.900> irrational

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
contains all rational and irrational

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.010 
contains all rational and irrational
numbers<00:04:36.350> so<00:04:37.220> basically<00:04:37.820> in<00:04:38.240> regular<00:04:38.570> turn<00:04:38.750> all

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
numbers so basically in regular turn all

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.780 
numbers so basically in regular turn all
that<00:04:39.200> means<00:04:39.410> it's<00:04:39.800> all<00:04:40.040> positive<00:04:40.640> or<00:04:40.730> all

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
that means it's all positive or all

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.090 
that means it's all positive or all
negative<00:04:40.820> numbers<00:04:41.540> that<00:04:42.050> terminate<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.980> go

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
negative numbers that terminate and go

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.630 
negative numbers that terminate and go
out<00:04:43.190> forever

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
out forever

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.150 
out forever
so<00:04:44.390> that<00:04:44.720> would<00:04:44.870> be<00:04:45.050> pretty<00:04:45.230> easy<00:04:45.380> if<00:04:45.800> you<00:04:45.950> ever

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
so that would be pretty easy if you ever

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.430 
so that would be pretty easy if you ever
see<00:04:46.520> any<00:04:46.790> number<00:04:48.880> okay<00:04:49.910> it's<00:04:50.270> everything<00:04:50.930> and

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
see any number okay it's everything and

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.010 
see any number okay it's everything and
so<00:04:52.040> it's<00:04:52.220> a<00:04:52.280> real<00:04:52.430> number<00:04:52.730> so<00:04:52.970> every<00:04:53.570> single

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
so it's a real number so every single

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.500 
so it's a real number so every single
number<00:04:54.200> no<00:04:54.650> matter<00:04:54.890> what<00:04:55.400> it<00:04:55.490> is<00:04:55.640> is<00:04:55.940> a<00:04:56.090> real

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
number no matter what it is is a real

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
number no matter what it is is a real
number

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.490 

all<00:05:00.530> right<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:00.860> it's<00:05:00.950> like<00:05:00.980> this<00:05:02.050> so<00:05:03.050> now<00:05:03.170> what

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
all right so it's like this so now what

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.830 
all right so it's like this so now what
we<00:05:03.590> want<00:05:03.710> to<00:05:03.860> do<00:05:03.980> here<00:05:04.250> is<00:05:04.460> we<00:05:05.030> want<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:05.360> grip

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
we want to do here is we want to grip

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.909 
we want to do here is we want to grip
these<00:05:06.110> things<00:05:06.970> where<00:05:07.970> they<00:05:08.150> best<00:05:08.419> go<00:05:08.800> so<00:05:09.800> they

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
these things where they best go so they

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.770 
these things where they best go so they
can<00:05:10.100> go<00:05:10.220> in<00:05:10.370> more<00:05:10.610> than<00:05:10.760> one<00:05:10.910> place<00:05:11.090> so

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
can go in more than one place so

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.980 
can go in more than one place so
negative<00:05:12.200> eight<00:05:12.410> point<00:05:12.740> two<00:05:13.180> we<00:05:14.180> know<00:05:14.360> that's

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
negative eight point two we know that's

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.950 
negative eight point two we know that's
a<00:05:15.110> real<00:05:15.260> number<00:05:15.470> because<00:05:16.340> that's<00:05:16.550> another<00:05:17.210> so

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
a real number because that's another so

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.560 
a real number because that's another so
every<00:05:18.380> single<00:05:18.560> thing<00:05:18.710> up<00:05:18.980> here<00:05:19.190> would<00:05:20.000> be<00:05:20.180> a

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
every single thing up here would be a

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.780 
every single thing up here would be a
real<00:05:21.200> limit<00:05:21.530> when<00:05:22.040> negative<00:05:22.400> eight<00:05:22.460> point<00:05:22.730> two

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
real limit when negative eight point two

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.950 
real limit when negative eight point two
can<00:05:23.240> also<00:05:23.510> be<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.260> rational<00:05:25.190> number<00:05:25.960> because

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
can also be a rational number because

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.260 
can also be a rational number because
it's<00:05:27.140> a<00:05:27.200> decimal<00:05:27.710> that<00:05:27.919> stops<00:05:28.900> okay<00:05:29.900> 22<00:05:30.500> over<00:05:30.710> 7

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
it's a decimal that stops okay 22 over 7

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.490 
it's a decimal that stops okay 22 over 7
that's<00:05:32.599> a<00:05:32.690> fraction<00:05:32.870> so<00:05:33.530> both<00:05:33.770> of<00:05:33.800> those<00:05:34.099> are

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
that's a fraction so both of those are

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.920 
that's a fraction so both of those are
integers<00:05:36.500> so<00:05:36.800> we<00:05:36.919> know<00:05:37.039> that<00:05:37.190> this<00:05:37.310> direction

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
integers so we know that this direction

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.939 
integers so we know that this direction
it's<00:05:38.930> a<00:05:39.050> number<00:05:39.349> so<00:05:40.009> it's<00:05:40.190> a<00:05:40.340> real<00:05:41.169> okay<00:05:42.169> number

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
it's a number so it's a real okay number

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:51.339 
it's a number so it's a real okay number
a<00:05:43.160> decimal<00:05:43.370> that<00:05:43.669> terminates<00:05:48.849> eight<00:05:50.229> it's<00:05:51.229> a

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
a decimal that terminates eight it's a

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:55.280 
a decimal that terminates eight it's a
counting<00:05:51.680> number

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.620 

but<00:05:55.770> you<00:05:55.920> should<00:05:56.130> know<00:05:56.280> it's<00:05:57.180> a<00:05:57.270> national

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
but you should know it's a national

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:05.270 
but you should know it's a national
number<00:05:57.860> everything<00:06:00.170> but<00:06:02.630> the<00:06:03.710> rationale<00:06:04.710> is

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
number everything but the rationale is

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:19.960 
number everything but the rationale is
all<00:06:07.370> got<00:06:08.370> thousand

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.120 

so<00:06:20.480> you<00:06:20.600> guys<00:06:20.690> I'm<00:06:20.960> in<00:06:21.110> the<00:06:21.170> first<00:06:21.380> five<00:06:21.590> so

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
so you guys I'm in the first five so

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.530 
so you guys I'm in the first five so
what<00:06:22.250> you're<00:06:22.430> go<00:06:22.580> ahead<00:06:22.760> and<00:06:22.880> pause<00:06:23.090> the<00:06:23.450> video

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
what you're go ahead and pause the video

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.920 
what you're go ahead and pause the video
think<00:06:24.700> to<00:06:25.700> yourself<00:06:26.060> where<00:06:26.420> would<00:06:26.630> the<00:06:26.750> rest

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
think to yourself where would the rest

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.850 
think to yourself where would the rest
of<00:06:27.140> these<00:06:27.260> go

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
of these go

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.860 
of these go
so<00:06:28.460> when<00:06:28.610> after<00:06:28.850> you<00:06:28.970> finish<00:06:29.270> that<00:06:29.300> go<00:06:29.810> ahead

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
so when after you finish that go ahead

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.830 
so when after you finish that go ahead
and<00:06:29.960> come<00:06:30.170> back<00:06:33.610> alright<00:06:34.610> welcome<00:06:34.850> back<00:06:35.000> so<00:06:35.660> we

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
and come back alright welcome back so we

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.780 
and come back alright welcome back so we
got<00:06:35.960> two<00:06:36.200> point<00:06:36.440> one<00:06:36.620> four<00:06:36.860> five<00:06:37.040> three<00:06:37.310> so

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
got two point one four five three so

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.490 
got two point one four five three so
that's<00:06:37.940> something<00:06:38.210> that<00:06:38.420> goes<00:06:38.600> on<00:06:38.810> forever

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
that's something that goes on forever

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.070 
that's something that goes on forever
does<00:06:39.830> it<00:06:40.010> repeat<00:06:40.460> so<00:06:41.120> we<00:06:41.240> know<00:06:41.390> that's<00:06:41.720> an

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
does it repeat so we know that's an

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.960 
does it repeat so we know that's an
irrational<00:06:42.320> number<00:06:48.370> we<00:06:49.370> got<00:06:49.460> four<00:06:49.730> over<00:06:49.940> three

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
irrational number we got four over three

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.570 
irrational number we got four over three
or<00:06:50.810> is<00:06:50.930> it<00:06:51.050> that's<00:06:51.200> a<00:06:51.260> fraction<00:06:51.490> both<00:06:52.490> over

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
or is it that's a fraction both over

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.790 
or is it that's a fraction both over
those<00:06:52.730> are<00:06:52.880> integers<00:06:53.240> so<00:06:54.050> we<00:06:54.170> know<00:06:54.320> that<00:06:54.620> that

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
those are integers so we know that that

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:03.680 
those are integers so we know that that
is<00:06:55.130> a<00:06:56.230> number

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.750 

I'm<00:07:04.230> going<00:07:04.470> 97.1<00:07:05.750> okay<00:07:06.780> decimal<00:07:07.260> that<00:07:07.410> sucks

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
I'm going 97.1 okay decimal that sucks

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.820 
I'm going 97.1 okay decimal that sucks
so<00:07:08.760> we<00:07:08.850> know<00:07:08.940> that<00:07:08.970> it's<00:07:09.180> rational

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.470 

all<00:07:13.830> right<00:07:13.920> square<00:07:14.280> root<00:07:14.490> of<00:07:14.550> 200<00:07:14.910> we<00:07:15.210> had<00:07:15.330> done

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.480 
all right square root of 200 we had done

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.450 
all right square root of 200 we had done
that<00:07:15.630> one<00:07:15.750> over<00:07:16.080> earlier<00:07:16.290> and<00:07:16.860> we<00:07:16.950> found<00:07:17.190> out

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
that one over earlier and we found out

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.990 
that one over earlier and we found out
that<00:07:17.490> that<00:07:17.820> was<00:07:18.090> an<00:07:18.630> irrational<00:07:19.050> number

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 
that that was an irrational number

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.450 
that that was an irrational number
we're<00:07:21.000> going<00:07:21.120> to<00:07:21.180> stick<00:07:21.360> that<00:07:21.390> down<00:07:21.570> here<00:07:22.460> all

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
we're going to stick that down here all

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.010 
we're going to stick that down here all
right<00:07:23.520> and<00:07:23.610> this<00:07:23.850> one<00:07:24.060> we<00:07:24.180> got<00:07:24.330> something<00:07:24.870> that

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
right and this one we got something that

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.159 
right and this one we got something that
goes<00:07:25.170> on<00:07:25.350> forever<00:07:25.680> doesn't<00:07:26.670> repeat<00:07:27.770> so<00:07:28.770> it's

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:29.169 
goes on forever doesn't repeat so it's

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:32.550 
goes on forever doesn't repeat so it's
irrational<00:07:29.830> number<00:07:30.720> so<00:07:31.720> awesome<00:07:32.110> stay<00:07:32.289> right

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 
irrational number so awesome stay right

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.620 
irrational number so awesome stay right
there
