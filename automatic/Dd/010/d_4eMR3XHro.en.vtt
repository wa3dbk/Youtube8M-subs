00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
cups that we have that's right they just

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.680 
cups that we have that's right they just
might<00:00:45.170> stop<00:00:45.530> eating<00:00:45.920> me<00:00:46.070> so<00:00:46.850> then<00:00:47.390> you<00:00:47.540> will

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
have to find someone else to be in love

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.660 
have to find someone else to be in love
with<00:00:50.059> I<00:00:50.450> can't<00:00:51.380> believe<00:00:51.590> that<00:00:51.770> your<00:00:52.309> love<00:00:52.520> is

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
with I can't believe that your love is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.840 
with I can't believe that your love is
defined<00:00:53.120> by<00:00:53.390> fat<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.559> what<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:55.309> are<00:00:55.340> trying<00:00:55.610> to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
defined by fat so what you are trying to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.549 
defined by fat so what you are trying to
say<00:00:55.969> is<00:00:56.360> that<00:00:56.420> because<00:00:56.809> that<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.230> are<00:00:57.379> fact

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
say is that because that you are fact

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.369 
say is that because that you are fact
that<00:00:57.829> I<00:00:57.860> can't<00:00:58.160> be<00:00:58.430> in<00:00:58.640> love<00:00:58.670> with<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.379> that's

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
that I can't be in love with you that's

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.100 
that I can't be in love with you that's
right<00:01:00.710> i<00:01:01.239> guess<00:01:02.239> that<00:01:02.450> they<00:01:02.600> will<00:01:02.780> have<00:01:02.960> to

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
right i guess that they will have to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.049 
right i guess that they will have to
teach<00:01:03.320> us<00:01:03.590> a<00:01:03.710> better<00:01:03.920> way<00:01:04.219> of<00:01:04.250> cooking<00:01:04.699> and

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
teach us a better way of cooking and

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.680 
teach us a better way of cooking and
preparing<00:01:05.269> foods<00:01:06.049> with<00:01:06.350> less<00:01:06.619> fat<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:06.979> cups

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
preparing foods with less fat and cups

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.590 
preparing foods with less fat and cups
yeah<00:01:08.690> that<00:01:09.170> would<00:01:09.380> be<00:01:09.409> a<00:01:09.560> good<00:01:09.770> idea<00:01:10.090> but<00:01:11.090> less

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
yeah that would be a good idea but less

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.359 
yeah that would be a good idea but less
fat<00:01:11.900> means<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.470> they<00:01:12.619> will<00:01:12.830> add<00:01:12.979> more<00:01:13.310> sugar

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
fat means that they will add more sugar

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.180 
fat means that they will add more sugar
and<00:01:13.909> salt<00:01:14.150> why<00:01:15.049> can't<00:01:15.380> they<00:01:15.530> just<00:01:15.560> get<00:01:16.040> it

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
and salt why can't they just get it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.870 
and salt why can't they just get it
right<00:01:16.630> sugar<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:17.930> salt<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:19.010> makes<00:01:19.400> you<00:01:19.640> fat

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
right sugar and salt that makes you fat

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.660 
right sugar and salt that makes you fat
too<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:21.080> makes<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.560> retain<00:01:22.010> water<00:01:22.040> and

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
too so it makes you retain water and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.789 
too so it makes you retain water and
that<00:01:22.850> makes<00:01:23.119> your<00:01:23.360> heart<00:01:23.600> work<00:01:23.960> harder<00:01:24.049> I

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
that makes your heart work harder I

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.520 
that makes your heart work harder I
guess<00:01:25.700> that<00:01:25.729> we<00:01:26.180> should<00:01:26.390> just<00:01:26.659> pour<00:01:26.930> gravy<00:01:27.229> on

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
guess that we should just pour gravy on

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.210 
guess that we should just pour gravy on
our<00:01:27.830> fries<00:01:28.070> just<00:01:28.850> like<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.270> Canadians<00:01:30.220> gravy

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
our fries just like the Canadians gravy

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.300 
our fries just like the Canadians gravy
that's<00:01:32.119> awful<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:32.990> guess<00:01:33.650> that<00:01:33.680> all<00:01:34.070> the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
that's awful I guess that all the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.280 
that's awful I guess that all the
Canadians<00:01:34.850> have<00:01:35.180> good<00:01:35.390> health<00:01:35.600> insurance

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
Canadians have good health insurance

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.670 
Canadians have good health insurance
unlike<00:01:37.070> us<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:38.150> they<00:01:38.630> can<00:01:38.840> put<00:01:39.049> whatever<00:01:39.259> they

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
unlike us so they can put whatever they

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.070 
unlike us so they can put whatever they
want<00:01:39.920> on<00:01:40.009> their<00:01:40.070> food<00:01:40.520> our<00:01:41.479> health<00:01:41.930> insurance

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
want on their food our health insurance

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.130 
want on their food our health insurance
has<00:01:42.770> been<00:01:42.979> depleted<00:01:43.310> by<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.670> Democrats<00:01:44.329> but

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
has been depleted by the Democrats but

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.200 
has been depleted by the Democrats but
we<00:01:45.590> have<00:01:45.799> bridge<00:01:46.009> cards<00:01:46.369> instead<00:01:46.759> of<00:01:47.000> good

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
we have bridge cards instead of good

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.020 
we have bridge cards instead of good
health<00:01:47.450> insurance<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:48.979> we<00:01:49.520> can<00:01:49.729> eat<00:01:49.909> as

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
health insurance so we can eat as

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.499 
health insurance so we can eat as
unhealthy<00:01:50.420> as<00:01:50.570> we<00:01:50.930> want<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.700> bridge<00:01:52.700> cards<00:01:53.299> I

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
unhealthy as we want to bridge cards I

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.050 
unhealthy as we want to bridge cards I
know<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.200> can<00:01:54.470> buy<00:01:54.619> as<00:01:54.829> much<00:01:55.040> candy<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.850> chips

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
know you can buy as much candy and chips

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.840 
know you can buy as much candy and chips
as<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.600> want<00:01:56.869> would<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:57.649> make<00:01:57.950> more<00:01:58.310> sense<00:01:58.369> if

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
as you want would it make more sense if

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.789 
as you want would it make more sense if
we<00:01:59.119> had<00:01:59.270> good<00:01:59.479> health<00:01:59.750> insurance<00:02:00.350> than<00:02:00.560> bridge

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799
