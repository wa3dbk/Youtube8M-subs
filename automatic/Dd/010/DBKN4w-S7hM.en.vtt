quickly and I'm getting anywhere between

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.999 
quickly and I'm getting anywhere between
half<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.049> level<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:23.900> level<00:01:24.900> each<00:01:25.140> run<00:01:28.009> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
of course doesn't really very much but

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
of course doesn't really very much but
the<00:01:33.960> overall<00:01:34.320> experience<00:01:34.530> /<00:01:35.159> mob<00:01:35.430> isn't<00:01:35.790> that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the overall experience / mob isn't that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.999 
the overall experience / mob isn't that

account<00:04:11.620> levels<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.280> that<00:04:12.459> character<00:04:12.910> can

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
account levels and that character can

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.360 
account levels and that character can
then<00:04:13.180> grow<00:04:13.359> up<00:04:13.419> my<00:04:13.599> first<00:04:13.840> count<00:04:14.169> levels<00:04:14.379> so<00:04:15.340> I

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
then grow up my first count levels so I

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.589
