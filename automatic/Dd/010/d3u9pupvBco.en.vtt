00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
just gonna wait for the platform's to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.850 
just gonna wait for the platform's to
appear<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.570> second<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.170> easy<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
appear and the second one is easy to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.459 
appear and the second one is easy to
just<00:00:56.280> another<00:00:56.789> jump<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:57.840> all<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.170> need<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> do

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
just another jump but all you need to do

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.529 
just another jump but all you need to do
is<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:58.859> dash<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.640> between<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.300> time

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
is do a little dash in between this time

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.880 
is do a little dash in between this time
so<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.840> land<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.199> platform<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
so you land on the platform like that

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.219 
so you land on the platform like that
and<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> same<00:01:02.879> again<00:01:03.239> double<00:01:03.629> jump<00:01:03.780> bash

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
and do the same again double jump bash

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.289 
and do the same again double jump bash
land<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> platform<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.909> there<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.180> go

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
land on the platform so there you go

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.660 
land on the platform so there you go
that's<00:01:06.450> number<00:01:06.720> two<00:01:06.960> now<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.890> number<00:01:08.130> three

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that's number two now on to number three

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.550 
that's number two now on to number three
the<00:01:09.479> third<00:01:09.510> jump<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> little<00:01:10.470> more

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the third jump is a little more

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.630 
the third jump is a little more
difficult<00:01:10.979> than<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> others<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
difficult than all the others and

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.450 
difficult than all the others and
requires<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.930> slide<00:01:13.470> double<00:01:14.159> jump

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
requires you to do a slide double jump

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.850 
requires you to do a slide double jump
and<00:01:14.640> two<00:01:15.330> boosts<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> air<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.590> order<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
and two boosts in the air in order to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
and two boosts in the air in order to
reach<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> platform<00:01:17.490> now<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.780> fooled

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990

-<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.970> -<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.900> end<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.200> gives<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.530> just

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
- and - in the end it gives you just

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.410 
- and - in the end it gives you just
enough<00:01:31.979> time<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.579> reach<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.759> second<00:01:33.240> platform

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
enough time to reach the second platform

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.510 
enough time to reach the second platform
okay<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.619> want<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.799> show<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.189> more<00:01:35.220> time

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
okay so I want to show you one more time

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.859 
okay so I want to show you one more time
and<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.700> want<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.970> slow<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> down<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.360> little<00:01:36.659> bit

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and I want to slow it down a little bit

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.960 
and I want to slow it down a little bit
further<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.520> closer

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
further just so you can have a closer

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.539 
further just so you can have a closer
look<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.930> I'm<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> platform<00:01:40.650> step<00:01:41.280> back<00:01:41.430> as

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
look so I'm on the platform step back as

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.910 
look so I'm on the platform step back as
far<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.150> slide<00:01:42.869> make<00:01:43.439> sure<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.740> jump

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
far as I can slide make sure you jump

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.710 
far as I can slide make sure you jump
before<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> hit<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.030> end<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> platform

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
before you hit the end of the platform

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.569 
before you hit the end of the platform
because<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.320> fall<00:01:46.590> off<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.130> will<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.430> be

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
because if you fall off you will not be

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.010 
because if you fall off you will not be
able<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.820> make<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.149> then<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.750> need<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.930> do

that you'll be senpai down at the bottom

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.880 
that you'll be senpai down at the bottom
easy<00:02:22.819> as<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.420> number<00:02:23.989> six<00:02:24.230> requires<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.830> to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
easy as that number six requires you to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.710 
easy as that number six requires you to
pull<00:02:25.220> back<00:02:25.250> on<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.760> stick<00:02:25.940> as<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.300> are<00:02:26.390> doing

this steps or jump up pull backwards and
then<00:02:29.330> dash<00:02:29.540> forward<00:02:29.840> onto<00:02:30.140> each<00:02:30.410> platform

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
then dash forward onto each platform

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.640 
then dash forward onto each platform
like<00:02:31.550> so<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.180> then<00:02:32.599> once<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.930> reach<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.319> last

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
one you will look up and just jump on

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.630 
one you will look up and just jump on
top<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.599> it<00:02:35.810> run<00:02:36.319> forward<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:36.769> then<00:02:37.400> do

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
top of it run forward and then do

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.400 
top of it run forward and then do
yourself<00:02:38.209> a<00:02:38.330> nice<00:02:38.569> little<00:02:38.720> double<00:02:39.080> jump<00:02:39.319> and

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
yourself a nice little double jump and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.170 
yourself a nice little double jump and
then<00:02:39.920> boost<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.310> couple<00:02:40.549> of<00:02:40.610> times<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:41.030> make

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
then boost a couple of times to make

then boost a couple of times to make
sure<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.420> hit<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> end<00:02:41.870> number<00:02:42.650> seven

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
sure you hit the end number seven

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.860 
sure you hit the end number seven
requires<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.519> same<00:02:43.730> movement<00:02:44.150> as<00:02:44.299> in<00:02:44.599> number

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
requires the same movement as in number

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.539 
requires the same movement as in number
three<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.470> what<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:45.620> need<00:02:45.769> is<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.099> your<00:02:46.190> slide

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
three and what you need is in your slide

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.120 
three and what you need is in your slide
boost<00:02:47.120> -<00:02:47.390> all<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.870> way<00:02:47.959> through<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.260> now<00:02:48.650> again

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
boost - all the way through it now again

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.100 
boost - all the way through it now again
don't<00:02:49.370> be<00:02:49.519> fooled<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.120> be<00:02:50.239> freaking<00:02:50.630> ages

don't be fooled this to be freaking ages
to<00:02:51.230> get<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.650> little<00:02:52.069> tip<00:02:52.310> once<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.239> are<00:02:53.480> on<00:02:53.900> the
