00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:19.419
 you can enter here is the studio madalena 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.189
 exactly the cultural producer 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.109
 we even projects like 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.320
 paraty in focus the Latin American forum 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:32.050
 with the cultural itaÃº 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.050
 The reflection of thought along with this 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:45.170
 the studio madalena began with another 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.330
 name is called photo clinic in 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.000
 1991 as Magdalene as studio 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.740
 since 2002 and was hard as any business 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.450
 of entrepreneurship 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.130
 But Brazil has a great experience. 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.150
 in this small and micro enterprise thing 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.100
 huh 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.840
 we grew up together with this movement 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.240
 everything in brazil 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.850
 we are pioneers in photography in this 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.490
 sense when we started to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.840
 there were no cultural producers 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.950
 specialized in photography but still 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.950
 very few right? 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.710
 here this is our patio 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.300
 here we sometimes have chairs at 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.979
 Sometimes people stand up sometimes. 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.830
 have chairs with small tables depends on the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.910
 activity is a multipurpose space of the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.890
 institution of the company which is 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.890
 directly into the two classrooms of the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.410
 school that happened at a certain moment to 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.899
 have already felt the need to 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.820
 several process tips then we 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.649
 we have the cultural producer 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.149
 the school a bookstore drift away 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.310
 by a small publisher a seal 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.780
 editorial right 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.149
 We are researching in the production area. 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.090
 audiovisual linked to photography 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.280
 in fact al beginning with TA al 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.869
 camera then how to 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.080
 studio she had a long process of 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.370
 pure intuition a lot of intuition but 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.540
 in the last two years 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.940
 we are doing a job of 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.690
 planning that the emergence of this 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.940
 publisher's bookstore 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.400
 and one from a photography company 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.530
 within the cultural producer is that I 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.580
 is a producer of content that 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.830
 exists today is planning within the 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.260
 that it is possible chan was called 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.840
 planning why did not you hire 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.730
 consulting if nothing else has happened 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.570
 simply organized themselves on top of the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.140
 acquired knowledge and the practice of 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.140
 day by day 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.460
 What proof is it to do what people 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.850
 likes to work because we like and 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.610
 help to develop this in the country 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.020
 yes coolest we can not change the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.250
 world of photography will not change the 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.420
 world 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.000
 none of the people who study 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.870
 Portuguese can help in this world to be 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.960
 seen in a more beautiful way but it is 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.000
 different can be personally created 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.730
 a different view of the world one 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.520
 possibility of a different world 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.790
 through artistic expressions and 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.260
 cons is like many areas and the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.820
 instability but to live forever 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.800
 without knowing if in that month you 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.180
 close the accounts that year you leave 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.670
 red or not but overall it is an area 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.220
 absolutely interesting fascinating 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.820
 I would not know what to do if the army I 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.820
 I do it today
