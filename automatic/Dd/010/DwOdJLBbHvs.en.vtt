00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 it's true that I'm not good at the margin 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.750
 of what the players of what 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.090
 accomplished 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.620
 after 10 years in my juventus 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.570
 last two experiences were in a 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.900
 somehow they had been negative that 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.330
 Spain and that are Arab emirates 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.550
 not then for me this was a start 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.840
 not only to a new adventure but that 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.940
 was 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.550
 a little green not in the situation that I 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.080
 I found I really wanted but it's 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.850
 true that with the desire many times not 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.400
 achieves 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.820
 I needed to do a preseason 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.910
 important there were many expectations of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.860
 part also of the people of the press 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.199
 about my conditions but well this does not 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.540
 no I was not worried I was very 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.180
 concentrated on about the same thing for me 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.980
 the most important thing was to get the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.460
 my colleagues' confidence as 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.590
 were giving with time 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.930
 and well then things went away 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.710
 they were giving a lot of work with 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.300
 being aware of my qualities and 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.450
 good the little also the affection of the 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.119
 people make you feel each 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.100
 stronger time and that one feels the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.500
 I'm really happy about this 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.690
 experience this is in a way this 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.090
 new new life that I am making and 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.619
 that gave me the chance to laugh 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.680
 that opened its doors to me and this for me 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.680
 it was unique the level of good 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.620
 championship I found it the truth that very 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.550
 very important very high because what 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.170
 more I like is that 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.850
 especially the four teams that 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.270
 we are up that are institutes 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.340
 central us yes and quilmes the four 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.620
 with different characteristics but the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.000
 true that the four with a certain 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.100
 quality and quality of players 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.710
 important the truth that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.680
 that the truth is important that what 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.150
 instituto no it is not that it surprises me but 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.540
 I appreciate it I appreciate it because it 's a 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.520
 team that out there did not have big 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.210
 names but the truth that practices a 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.710
 very interesting football afterwards it's true 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.009
 that at the central historical level is a 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.470
 team is a team of first 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.050
 and quilmes it's true that there was good 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.580
 change of coach but to me always 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.960
 I liked the quilmes game because it's 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.120
 a very game 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.510
 very direct with individuals 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.520
 important and good apart from talking about 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.380
 these four that are the classic four 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.630
 that is always spoken is true that I have 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.480
 had the chance to play against 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.970
 defense and justice the truth is that a 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.490
 great team spoke to me very well of mouth 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.680
 in the mouth united or each one with their 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.610
 qualities know the effect but I've 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.250
 found a level 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.980
 I can afford to say what was more 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.600
 important that the one I've met in 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.380
 Italy 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:55.850
 speaking national insurance - the series 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.090
 because it is true that there was a level 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.090
 football 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.550
 saddest not if we can say the 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.190
 just word is not true that at the same 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.490
 many times they ask me to compare 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.400
 what is river to what was the juventus 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.329
 it is not true that the juventus had 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.409
 five pillars that were camoranesi jester 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.420
 of the piero and good to quote me myself 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.430
 with remarkable experience but those 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.489
 second-line players who were saying 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.189
 They were Zevina Christian Zanetti players 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.920
 that they came from Rome and eliminated that is 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:35.360
 it was a much more armed team than 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.250
 out there the reality of river 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.930
 It is different from the same six players 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.720
 experience like the case of fernando 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.330
 cavenaghi and the chori and ponzio but it 's 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.820
 true that at the same time there are many 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.440
 many young people in the press is a lot 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.870
 higher because I think football 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.530
 in South America we live completely from 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.410
 European football European football is more 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.420
 theatrical 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.440
 South American football is much more 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.960
 passionate and the passion that is in river is 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.150
 a very strong passion very important that 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.310
 at the same time he creates 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.620
 creates its drawbacks as well as what 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.329
 we watched match against gymnastics in 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.419
 which already to the public 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.150
 patience is less is less less 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.769
 important but this is part of the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.320
 river is part of its history makes 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.820
 part of their football and we are 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.970
 pressure we have to transform it into 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.979
 way in a positive way 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.660
 I always said I enjoy every each 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.870
 match each training or that 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.700
 when I go to the court the murmur no no 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.770
 It does not affect me, it makes me want to 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.360
 to win makes me want to win like the 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.050
 rest of my classmates because it 's true 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.050
 what 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.310
 the monumental trembles in a certain way 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.199
 and the people the truth that is with 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.349
 us and this for us in this 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.340
 moment is decisive we know that we 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.449
 there are six final 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.449
 that are going to be difficult 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.400
 because there are many of your colleagues 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.910
 I was asking right now that there 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.760
 the technical and colorful soccer of river 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.200
 I saw less than can be but in this 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.940
 moment I think it is 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.940
 fundamental the three points
