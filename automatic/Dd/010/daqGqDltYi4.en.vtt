and<00:02:12.040> they're<00:02:12.160> going<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.370> get<00:02:12.430> hungry<00:02:12.700> quick

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and they're going to get hungry quick

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.540 
and they're going to get hungry quick
remember<00:02:14.260> most<00:02:14.800> people<00:02:15.070> only<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.340> enough

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
remember most people only have enough

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.280 
remember most people only have enough
food<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.760> last<00:02:15.880> less<00:02:16.330> than<00:02:16.360> one<00:02:16.810> week<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.390> was

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
food to last less than one week so I was

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.960 
food to last less than one week so I was
thinking<00:02:20.440> rabbits<00:02:21.250> yeah<00:02:21.520> they're<00:02:21.700> cheap

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970

anybody<00:02:24.310> has<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.430> problem<00:02:24.520> with<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:25.030> but<00:02:25.330> I

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
anybody has a problem with that but I

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.910 
anybody has a problem with that but I
got<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.010> eat<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:29.340> rabbits<00:02:30.360> there<00:02:31.360> are<00:02:31.570> some

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
got to eat and rabbits there are some

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.710 
got to eat and rabbits there are some
decent<00:02:32.920> breeds<00:02:33.490> there's<00:02:33.790> actually<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.240> lot<00:02:34.330> of

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
decent breeds there's actually a lot of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.420 
decent breeds there's actually a lot of
decent<00:02:34.930> breeds<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.650> rabbits<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.130> can<00:02:36.340> be

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
decent breeds of rabbits that can be

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.660 
decent breeds of rabbits that can be
raised<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:36.850> me<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:41.080> that's<00:02:41.230> an<00:02:41.380> option

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
raised for me and so that's an option

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.240 
raised for me and so that's an option
other<00:02:42.670> options<00:02:43.180> are<00:02:43.300> poultry<00:02:43.720> chickens<00:02:44.709> geese

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
other options are poultry chickens geese

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.670 
other options are poultry chickens geese
ducks<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:46.750> kind<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:46.989> thing<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:49.470> if<00:02:50.470> you've

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
ducks that kind of thing so if you've

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.220 
ducks that kind of thing so if you've
been<00:02:50.920> gardening<00:02:51.430> I'm<00:02:52.150> just<00:02:52.420> throwing<00:02:52.930> out<00:02:53.110> the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
been gardening I'm just throwing out the

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.699 
been gardening I'm just throwing out the
possibility<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.800> if<00:02:54.430> you've<00:02:55.030> thought<00:02:55.709> that

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
possibility that if you've thought that

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.330 
possibility that if you've thought that
you<00:02:56.920> can't<00:02:57.280> make<00:02:57.459> provision<00:02:58.030> for<00:02:58.060> me<00:02:59.340> maybe

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
you can't make provision for me maybe

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.770 
you can't make provision for me maybe
rethink<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.000> because<00:03:01.060> there<00:03:01.510> are<00:03:01.540> some

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
rethink that because there are some

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.540 
rethink that because there are some
small<00:03:02.080> animals<00:03:02.530> again<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.130> rabbits<00:03:03.430> are<00:03:03.489> a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
small animals again the rabbits are a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.870 
small animals again the rabbits are a
great<00:03:03.730> example<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.140> can<00:03:05.410> raise

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
great example that you can raise

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.680 
great example that you can raise
successfully<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:08.130> oh<00:03:09.270> that<00:03:10.270> will<00:03:10.360> provide

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
successfully and oh that will provide

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.390 
successfully and oh that will provide
plenty<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:11.110> eat<00:03:11.230> now<00:03:11.410> what<00:03:11.800> I'm<00:03:11.890> trying<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.220> do

plenty of eat now what I'm trying to do

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.370 
plenty of eat now what I'm trying to do

longer term sustainability where
genetics<00:03:28.150> are<00:03:28.239> concerned<00:03:28.920> if<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:30.160> only<00:03:30.310> have

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
genetics are concerned if I only have

one breeding pair and and that's that's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.370 
one breeding pair and and that's that's
it<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.700> provide<00:03:33.880> food<00:03:34.209> certainly<00:03:35.140> one

breeding pair of rabbits you can quickly

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.400 
breeding pair of rabbits you can quickly
get<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.209> point<00:03:37.390> where<00:03:37.630> you're<00:03:37.959> providing

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
get to the point where you're providing

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.570 
get to the point where you're providing
a<00:03:38.970> fairly<00:03:39.970> decent<00:03:40.000> run<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.989> meat<00:03:41.260> for<00:03:41.580> group

different<00:04:06.100> genetic<00:04:06.610> stock<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:07.150> could<00:04:07.750> then

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
different genetic stock I could then

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.640 
different genetic stock I could then
perpetuate<00:04:08.440> my<00:04:08.590> line<00:04:08.769> again<00:04:08.799> so<00:04:10.650> just

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
perpetuate my line again so just

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.890 
perpetuate my line again so just
something<00:04:11.799> to<00:04:11.890> think<00:04:11.980> about<00:04:12.160> in<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.660> urban

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
something to think about in the urban

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.199 
something to think about in the urban
environment<00:04:14.610> there<00:04:15.610> are<00:04:15.760> some<00:04:15.910> things<00:04:16.090> that

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
environment there are some things that

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.530 
environment there are some things that
you<00:04:16.419> can<00:04:16.570> raise<00:04:16.750> another<00:04:16.989> thing<00:04:17.260> that

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
you can raise another thing that

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.130 
you can raise another thing that
really<00:04:17.720> considering<00:04:18.230> as<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.380> pigeon<00:04:18.740> coop<00:04:20.140> it's

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
really considering as a pigeon coop it's

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.480 
really considering as a pigeon coop it's
something<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:21.650> can<00:04:21.830> put<00:04:21.980> up<00:04:22.010> on<00:04:22.190> my<00:04:22.310> back

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
something that I can put up on my back

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.570 
something that I can put up on my back
roof<00:04:22.730> that<00:04:23.770> requires<00:04:26.110> fairly<00:04:27.110> little

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
roof that requires fairly little

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.780 
roof that requires fairly little
maintenance<00:04:29.500> relative<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:30.710> other<00:04:31.370> animals

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
maintenance relative to other animals

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.190 
maintenance relative to other animals
that<00:04:31.850> can<00:04:32.030> be<00:04:32.120> raised<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:34.750> largely<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:36.050> can

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
that can be raised and largely you can

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.150 
that can be raised and largely you can
let<00:04:36.380> them<00:04:36.530> free<00:04:36.830> run<00:04:37.100> until<00:04:39.100> until<00:04:40.100> a

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
let them free run until until a

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.980 
let them free run until until a
breakdown<00:04:40.610> happens<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.390> then<00:04:41.510> of<00:04:41.690> course<00:04:41.900> you

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
breakdown happens and then of course you

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.050 
breakdown happens and then of course you
want<00:04:42.140> to<00:04:42.230> lock<00:04:42.350> them<00:04:42.530> in<00:04:42.650> because<00:04:42.970> people<00:04:43.970> are

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
want to lock them in because people are

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.110 
want to lock them in because people are
going<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.270> be<00:04:44.360> even<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.780> pigeons<00:04:45.140> man<00:04:46.120> but

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
going to be even the pigeons man but

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.410 
going to be even the pigeons man but
again<00:04:47.390> each<00:04:48.050> each<00:04:50.860> pair<00:04:52.030> mating<00:04:53.030> pair<00:04:53.270> of

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
again each each pair mating pair of

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.910 
again each each pair mating pair of
pigeons<00:04:53.810> is<00:04:54.080> going<00:04:54.290> to<00:04:54.350> produce<00:04:54.470> a<00:04:54.740> certain

pigeons is going to produce a certain
amount<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:55.220> offspring<00:04:55.550> in<00:04:55.730> a<00:04:55.790> year<00:04:55.820> you<00:04:56.720> can

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
amount of offspring in a year you can

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.930 
amount of offspring in a year you can
google<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.290> stuffing<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:58.520> pretty<00:04:58.820> quickly

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
google the stuffing and pretty quickly

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.710 
google the stuffing and pretty quickly
come<00:04:59.300> up<00:04:59.420> with<00:04:59.600> with<00:05:00.020> answers<00:05:00.320> on<00:05:00.470> this<00:05:01.720> I've

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
come up with with answers on this I've

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.110 
come up with with answers on this I've
been<00:05:03.680> trying<00:05:03.950> to<00:05:04.160> think<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.430> quiet<00:05:04.730> things<00:05:05.030> I

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
been trying to think of quiet things I

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.680 
been trying to think of quiet things I
know<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.240> pigeon<00:05:05.630> coop<00:05:05.780> isn't<00:05:06.110> exactly<00:05:06.500> quiet

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
know a pigeon coop isn't exactly quiet

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.170 
know a pigeon coop isn't exactly quiet
but<00:05:08.690> pigeons<00:05:09.560> in<00:05:10.040> Philadelphia<00:05:10.640> are<00:05:10.790> also<00:05:11.030> a

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
but pigeons in Philadelphia are also a

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.660 
but pigeons in Philadelphia are also a
very<00:05:11.360> common<00:05:11.840> sound<00:05:12.080> so<00:05:12.620> I<00:05:12.950> don't<00:05:13.400> think<00:05:13.550> it's

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
very common sound so I don't think it's

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.830 
very common sound so I don't think it's
something<00:05:13.850> that<00:05:14.060> will<00:05:14.150> stand<00:05:14.360> out<00:05:14.540> at<00:05:14.660> least

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
something that will stand out at least

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.460 
something that will stand out at least
not<00:05:14.960> at<00:05:15.110> first<00:05:15.140> and<00:05:16.780> time<00:05:17.780> it<00:05:17.960> would<00:05:18.140> stand

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
not at first and time it would stand

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.410 
not at first and time it would stand
down<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:18.860> anticipate<00:05:19.820> having<00:05:20.000> a<00:05:20.180> safe<00:05:20.390> zone

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
down I anticipate having a safe zone

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.500 
down I anticipate having a safe zone
already<00:05:20.810> established<00:05:21.320> so<00:05:21.620> there's<00:05:22.220> that<00:05:22.510> so

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
already established so there's that so

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.900 
already established so there's that so
for<00:05:24.380> me<00:05:24.470> bunnies<00:05:24.860> and<00:05:25.010> pigeons<00:05:25.340> what's<00:05:25.640> it<00:05:25.760> for

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
for me bunnies and pigeons what's it for

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.630 
for me bunnies and pigeons what's it for

just live off plant matter there's a

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.600 
just live off plant matter there's a
reason<00:06:07.700> vegetarians<00:06:08.600> don't<00:06:09.070> heal<00:06:10.070> certain

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
needs both meat and vegetation so just

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.440 
needs both meat and vegetation so just
something<00:06:18.800> to<00:06:18.890> consider<00:06:18.980> if<00:06:19.430> you<00:06:20.150> haven't

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
something to consider if you haven't

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.600 
something to consider if you haven't
thought<00:06:20.480> about<00:06:20.690> it<00:06:21.010> if<00:06:22.010> you<00:06:22.190> guys<00:06:22.310> have<00:06:22.580> a
