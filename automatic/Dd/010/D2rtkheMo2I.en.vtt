that hilt and number two is I had him

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.029 
that hilt and number two is I had him
add<00:01:01.250> a<00:01:01.850> couple<00:01:02.450> rows<00:01:02.750> of<00:01:03.050> jimping<00:01:03.469> now<00:01:03.920> the

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:04.039 
add a couple rows of jimping now the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.040 
add a couple rows of jimping now the
jimping<00:01:04.640> contrary<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.690> what<00:01:05.840> some<00:01:05.869> people

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
jimping contrary to what some people

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.740 
jimping contrary to what some people
might<00:01:06.440> believe<00:01:06.560> is<00:01:07.009> not<00:01:07.369> for<00:01:07.940> my<00:01:08.210> thumb<00:01:08.479> I

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
might believe is not for my thumb I

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.770 
might believe is not for my thumb I
would<00:01:08.990> actually<00:01:09.440> never<00:01:09.619> use<00:01:09.950> this<00:01:10.190> knife<00:01:10.780> by

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
would actually never use this knife by

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.480 
would actually never use this knife by
applying<00:01:12.110> thumb<00:01:12.500> pressure<00:01:12.770> I<00:01:12.950> just<00:01:13.190> wouldn't

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
applying thumb pressure I just wouldn't

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.130 
applying thumb pressure I just wouldn't
I<00:01:13.580> feel<00:01:13.759> it's<00:01:13.910> a<00:01:13.970> little<00:01:14.180> bit<00:01:14.300> unwieldy<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.869> do

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
I feel it's a little bit unwieldy to do

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.080 
I feel it's a little bit unwieldy to do
that<00:01:15.350> what<00:01:15.860> I<00:01:15.890> do<00:01:16.009> use<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.520> jimping<00:01:16.880> for

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
that what I do use the jimping for

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.200 
that what I do use the jimping for
rather<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.690> as<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.440> striking<00:01:19.340> surface<00:01:20.000> for<00:01:20.180> a

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
rather is as a striking surface for a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.390 
rather is as a striking surface for a
fire<00:01:20.479> steel<00:01:20.899> I<00:01:21.140> suppose<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.860> could<00:01:22.010> use<00:01:22.040> it<00:01:22.280> to

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
fire steel I suppose you could use it to

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.710 
fire steel I suppose you could use it to
grind<00:01:22.640> some<00:01:22.729> wood<00:01:23.030> if<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:23.180> needed<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.540> make

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
grind some wood if you needed to make

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.330 
grind some wood if you needed to make
shavings<00:01:24.140> but<00:01:24.290> I<00:01:24.320> probably<00:01:24.619> wouldn't<00:01:25.010> do<00:01:25.159> that

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
shavings but I probably wouldn't do that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.070 
shavings but I probably wouldn't do that
I<00:01:25.580> would<00:01:26.000> really<00:01:26.180> just<00:01:26.270> use<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:26.720> for<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:26.900> fire

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
I would really just use it for a fire

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.780 
I would really just use it for a fire
steel<00:01:27.409> but<00:01:27.799> it<00:01:27.890> is<00:01:28.010> very<00:01:28.189> useful<00:01:28.640> in<00:01:28.700> that

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
steel but it is very useful in that

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.550 
steel but it is very useful in that
capacity<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.479> make<00:01:29.570> some<00:01:29.780> very<00:01:29.960> nice<00:01:30.110> sparks

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
capacity and make some very nice sparks

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.850 
capacity and make some very nice sparks
I<00:01:31.159> do<00:01:31.520> like<00:01:32.060> however<00:01:32.450> not<00:01:33.049> having<00:01:33.439> that<00:01:33.560> hilt

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
I do like however not having that hilt

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.429 
I do like however not having that hilt
because<00:01:34.700> I<00:01:34.790> can<00:01:34.939> really<00:01:35.180> choke<00:01:35.570> up<00:01:35.750> on<00:01:35.900> on<00:01:36.290> the

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
because I can really choke up on on the

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.899 
because I can really choke up on on the
knife<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.799> don't<00:01:37.070> have<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.430> worry<00:01:37.580> about<00:01:37.729> this

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
knife I don't have to worry about this

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.310 
knife I don't have to worry about this
hilt<00:01:38.150> getting<00:01:38.479> in<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.600> way<00:01:38.689> of<00:01:38.720> my<00:01:38.930> fingers

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
hilt getting in the way of my fingers

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.890 
hilt getting in the way of my fingers
and<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.950> allows<00:01:40.220> me<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.580> really<00:01:40.820> use<00:01:41.270> the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
and that allows me to really use the

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.660 
and that allows me to really use the
first<00:01:42.170> third<00:01:42.439> of<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.680> edge<00:01:42.920> for<00:01:43.250> close-in

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
first third of that edge for close-in

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.550 
first third of that edge for close-in
bushcraft<00:01:44.420> work<00:01:44.659> I<00:01:44.930> know<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:45.320> might<00:01:45.530> think

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
bushcraft work I know you might think

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.679 
bushcraft work I know you might think
this<00:01:45.860> knife<00:01:46.070> is<00:01:46.250> too<00:01:46.430> large<00:01:46.670> but<00:01:47.000> trust<00:01:47.299> me<00:01:47.479> I

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
this knife is too large but trust me I

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.590 
this knife is too large but trust me I
have<00:01:48.110> used<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:48.619> for<00:01:48.650> small<00:01:48.920> work<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.570> it<00:01:50.570> is

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
have used it for small work and it is

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.300 
have used it for small work and it is
weighted<00:01:51.259> properly<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:51.979> can<00:01:52.130> really

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
weighted properly that I can really

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.100 
weighted properly that I can really
control<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:52.820> also<00:01:53.450> if<00:01:53.540> you're<00:01:53.659> just<00:01:53.840> used<00:01:54.049> to

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
control it also if you're just used to

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.840 
control it also if you're just used to
the<00:01:54.259> knife<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.680> enjoy<00:01:54.890> using<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.430> then

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
the knife and you enjoy using it then

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.359 
the knife and you enjoy using it then
there's<00:01:56.060> really<00:01:56.210> no<00:01:56.450> reason<00:01:56.689> why<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.439> nine<00:01:58.159> inch

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
there's really no reason why a nine inch

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.210 
there's really no reason why a nine inch
blade<00:01:58.640> can't<00:01:59.000> be<00:01:59.090> used<00:01:59.270> for<00:01:59.479> small<00:01:59.570> work

finally<00:02:01.220> when<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:01.729> are<00:02:01.759> batoning<00:02:02.540> not<00:02:03.170> having

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
finally when you are batoning not having

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.620 
finally when you are batoning not having
that<00:02:03.680> top<00:02:03.950> Hill<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.430> actually<00:02:05.180> really<00:02:05.479> useful

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
that top Hill is actually really useful

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.090 
that top Hill is actually really useful
because<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.110> gives<00:02:06.229> me<00:02:06.320> an<00:02:06.470> extra<00:02:06.649> couple<00:02:06.920> of

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
because it gives me an extra couple of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.740 
because it gives me an extra couple of
inches<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.549> I<00:02:07.610> can<00:02:07.790> pound<00:02:08.030> on<00:02:08.209> with<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> baton

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
inches that I can pound on with a baton

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.259 
inches that I can pound on with a baton
but<00:02:09.410> just<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.489> give<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.790> word<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.120> caution

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
but just to give you a word of caution

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.870 
but just to give you a word of caution
if<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:12.110> do<00:02:12.320> that<00:02:12.560> on<00:02:12.890> any<00:02:13.040> regular<00:02:13.250> basis

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
if you do that on any regular basis

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.970 
if you do that on any regular basis
you'll<00:02:14.480> see<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.840> I've<00:02:14.959> actually<00:02:15.140> really

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
you'll see that I've actually really

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.590 
you'll see that I've actually really
damaged<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.489> kraton<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.269> actually

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
damaged the kraton it's actually

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.900 
damaged the kraton it's actually
splitting<00:02:18.049> there<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.370> don't<00:02:19.459> think<00:02:19.790> that

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
splitting there so I don't think that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.340 
splitting there so I don't think that
that's<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.150> shortcoming<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.870> knife<00:02:21.079> that's

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
that's a shortcoming of the knife that's

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.770 
that's a shortcoming of the knife that's
really<00:02:21.709> just<00:02:21.920> basically<00:02:22.579> my<00:02:22.850> abuse<00:02:23.269> of<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.570> and

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
really just basically my abuse of it and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.350 
really just basically my abuse of it and
I<00:02:24.590> will<00:02:24.860> have<00:02:25.129> this<00:02:25.400> knife<00:02:25.610> we<00:02:25.940> handled

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
as horizontal as possible I'm just gonna

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.099 
as horizontal as possible I'm just gonna
pound<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.180> down<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:45.489> you'll<00:03:45.639> see<00:03:45.930> without<00:03:46.930> a

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
pound it down and you'll see without a

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.530 
pound it down and you'll see without a
lot<00:03:47.379> of<00:03:47.560> effort<00:03:47.919> I<00:03:48.159> go<00:03:49.120> through<00:03:49.329> some<00:03:49.510> very

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
lot of effort I go through some very

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.990 
lot of effort I go through some very
very<00:03:49.900> hard<00:03:50.139> wood<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:50.829> that's<00:03:51.219> actually<00:03:51.489> for

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
very hard wood and that's actually for

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.879 
very hard wood and that's actually for
two<00:03:52.120> reasons<00:03:52.479> one<00:03:52.540> being<00:03:53.139> such<00:03:53.409> a<00:03:53.439> hard<00:03:53.709> wood

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
two reasons one being such a hard wood

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.339 
two reasons one being such a hard wood
it<00:03:54.099> is<00:03:54.129> rather<00:03:54.489> brittle<00:03:54.879> but<00:03:55.569> also<00:03:55.780> looking<00:03:56.229> at

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
it is rather brittle but also looking at
