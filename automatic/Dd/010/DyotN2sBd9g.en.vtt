 occupy all we will occupy as the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.750
 half of each one simply because 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.740

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.680
 we are going to add the balls that we made 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.470
 that we form with ground meat 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.310
 and we're going to leave them there while 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.310
 sew ok 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:41.140
 with our vegetable what we will do 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:45.520
 is we're going to chop it ok whether the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.039
 apply in small squares or in 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.189
 slices in what you want to chop 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.259
 ok and also the tomato and the onion 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.420
 we are going to sting you, we are going to occupy 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.640
 a lot now I'm going to show you what 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.189
 quantities of tomato and onion we are going to 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.990
 occupy or that cilantro we are not going to 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.959
 chop that we're going to throw at the end 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.989
 well in the twigs ok girls here 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:10.569
 our flesh will now start as 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:13.120
 boil well fine well 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.920
 but I'm going to give you a guy a tip 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.469
 or rather I'll show you what I 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.150
 I do that for me, you know, these things that are here 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.129
 what comes to the meat when it's going to 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.129
 start to boil that if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.859
 I think it's the blood and this to me I do not 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:30.189
 like to leave it there then what I 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:32.920
 I do, I'm going to remove it with a spoon 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:37.379
 all this foam and I'm going to put it in 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.379
 a small dish to be able to throw it out ok 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.060
 in a pot or pan we will put a 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.799
 little bit of oil and remember the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.780
 tomato and onion that I showed you 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.540
 well we are going to apply it like that and I 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.330
 also chop a little garlic if 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.190
 you have tomatillo that is green or 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.590
 green tomato do not know what name 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.019
 you know you can also chop a little and 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.299
 add it here I did not have then no 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.640
 I put it, we're going to leave it here in the 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.810
 fire to it if you have a little bit that 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.790
 the onion the tomato soften and a 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.640
 Once it is already citron, we are going to 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.310
 put some of the water juice where 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.989
 We met the meat or if you do not want 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.849
 Put on water because you see it very 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.400
 greasy or something good then you can 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:27.870
 add normal water just be 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.120
 hot and we're going to put it there 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.299
 to stir the well with what is 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.980
 we were frying on this side all 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.970
 the vegetables that I told them I was going 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.220
 to put and chop this the las the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.049
 candles and that I made them as well as 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.209
 trying to make cubes you can 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.000
 explain in slices in cubes in what 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.610
 that you want to explain this area 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.829
 real to a little bit like that in round 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.989
 because I was very skinny so 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.810
 I thought it was the best option 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.849
 let's put the mayor of this one here 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.849
 we are going to put them all 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.510
 taking care that we do not go to 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.830
 burn and good once we put 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.370
 all the vegetables here in the caldito 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.859
 let's put the meat the meat the 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.470
 you can completely disrupt the can 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.290
 leave well in big pieces other 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.820
 this is going to be your decision 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.520
 What I'm going to do is try to disrupt 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:33.740
 a little bit the balls this right here in 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.600
 the in the pot the joke is that to me 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.550
 I like it to be in pieces of meat 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.100
 so some other big ones that 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.630
 obviously when shaking the 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.340
 vegetables and all the meat is going to 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.850
 derail a bit but if we have 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.060
 be careful because we managed to get 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.639
 the flesh is so finite but 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.610
 this is going to be your decision that here we go 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.270
 to try so that everything mixes and 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.270
 be well 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:09.350
 once you started wanting to boil 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.350
 this is good moment 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.940
 I'm not going to put salt because remember 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.170
 that we already knew the meat with talent is 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.350
 what I'm going to put on is going to be a 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.450
 little chicken powder consommÃ© and 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.510
 as the chicken consommÃ© is already salty 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.030
 well then this is no no need 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.220
 to put so much salt but if you 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.830
 try it you feel that you lack salt 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.020
 then you can add a little bit already 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.220
 be of normal salt or a little bit more 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.290
 consume this is going to be your decision ok the 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.770
 coriander twigs are going to put 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.600
 here they go at the end and it's just 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.160
 so that it gives a little bit of flavor if 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.200
 you like cilantro a lot you can 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.750
 add more if you do not like it then do not 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.460
 put me I like cilantro 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.830
 they love the meals so I do 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.080
 I put it this is the chicken consomm of 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.720
 this we put a little bit if you do not 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.610
 you like it too you can skip ok one 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.310
 time you are and nothing else remains 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.380
 cover it wait for the vegetable to be sewn 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.380
 and you're ready
