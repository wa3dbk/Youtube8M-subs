00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
gives you good security now if I just

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.790 
gives you good security now if I just
flip<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.639> lever<00:00:15.109> for<00:00:16.430> iron<00:00:17.430> block<00:00:17.880> doors

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
flip this lever for iron block doors

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.599 
flip this lever for iron block doors
will<00:00:19.800> close<00:00:20.300> over<00:00:21.300> my<00:00:21.449> house<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.039> people

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
will close over my house so that people

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.790 
will close over my house so that people
can't<00:00:23.789> get<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.199> also<00:00:25.350> good<00:00:25.619> for

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
can't get in and this is also good for

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.769 
can't get in and this is also good for
like<00:00:25.949> luring<00:00:26.519> mobs<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:27.330> pulling<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
like luring mobs in and then pulling the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.990 
like luring mobs in and then pulling the
lever<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.920> kill<00:00:29.429> them<00:00:30.199> all<00:00:31.219> right<00:00:32.219> so

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
lever so you can kill them all right so

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.700 
lever so you can kill them all right so
yeah<00:00:33.660> that's<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.590> when

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
yeah that's what it's going to do when

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.490 
yeah that's what it's going to do when
it's<00:00:34.860> done<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.719> I'm<00:00:36.719> using<00:00:36.930> single<00:00:37.260> player

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it's done and I'm using single player

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.910 
it's done and I'm using single player
commands<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.540> because<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:40.410> know<00:00:40.530> just

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
commands for this because you know just

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.590 
commands for this because you know just
to<00:00:41.010> get<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.280> faster<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> sake<00:00:42.570> of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
to get it faster for the sake of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.440 
to get it faster for the sake of
tutorial<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> first<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.030> you're<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.390> to

and I'll put these iron blocks in the
bottom<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.380> mark<00:01:13.650> where<00:01:13.950> everything<00:01:14.369> is

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
bottom just to mark where everything is

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and now we are going to dig these little

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.830 
and now we are going to dig these little
grooves<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:19.159> that's<00:01:20.159> where<00:01:20.400> we'll<00:01:20.580> put

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
grooves here and that's where we'll put

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.510 
grooves here and that's where we'll put
the<00:01:21.840> Pistons<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.680> where<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> doors<00:01:23.310> will

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the Pistons and where the doors will

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.100 
the Pistons and where the doors will
come<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.960> okay<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.460> carve<00:01:27.240> those<00:01:27.450> grooves<00:01:27.810> on

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
come out okay so carve those grooves on

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.460 
come out okay so carve those grooves on
both<00:01:28.320> sides<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:32.479> place<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.780> sticky<00:01:34.049> pistons

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
both sides and place the sticky pistons

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.789 
both sides and place the sticky pistons
in<00:01:37.640> mess<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.180> bit<00:01:39.290> whoo<00:01:40.290> doo<00:01:40.530> doo<00:01:40.650> doo

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
in mess that up a bit whoo doo doo doo

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.990 
in mess that up a bit whoo doo doo doo
doo<00:01:40.979> to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.740 

so<00:01:47.000> now<00:01:47.180> we've<00:01:47.360> got<00:01:47.540> those<00:01:47.750> in<00:01:48.460> now<00:01:49.460> on<00:01:49.820> both

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
so now we've got those in now on both

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.830 
so now we've got those in now on both
sides<00:01:51.490> you're<00:01:52.490> going<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:52.970> need<00:01:53.150> two<00:01:53.510> blocks

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
sides you're going to need two blocks

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.010 
sides you're going to need two blocks
away<00:01:53.990> from<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.500> whole<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:55.900> three<00:01:56.900> by<00:01:57.320> two<00:01:58.310> hole

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
away from the whole a three by two hole

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.480 
away from the whole a three by two hole
all<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.100> way<00:02:01.100> down<00:02:01.840> these<00:02:02.840> Pistons<00:02:06.070> all<00:02:07.070> the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
all the way down these Pistons all the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:16.290 
all the way down these Pistons all the
way<00:02:07.610> down<00:02:08.260> because<00:02:09.260> I<00:02:09.500> uncovered<00:02:10.210> three<00:02:14.680> and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
way down because I uncovered three and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.660 
way down because I uncovered three and
then<00:02:17.300> after<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.960> just<00:02:18.320> like<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.650> do<00:02:18.770> three

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
then after that I just like to do three

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.700 
then after that I just like to do three
extra<00:02:20.060> blocks<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.570> space<00:02:20.840> for<00:02:21.970> wiggle<00:02:22.970> room<00:02:23.710> so

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
extra blocks of space for wiggle room so

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.450 
extra blocks of space for wiggle room so
now<00:02:24.980> you're<00:02:25.220> going<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.610> build<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.300> rack<00:02:27.460> this

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
now you're going to build the rack this

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.230 
now you're going to build the rack this
is<00:02:28.820> what<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.840> redstone<00:02:30.410> will<00:02:30.650> hold<00:02:30.890> on<00:02:31.240> just

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
is what the redstone will hold on just

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.090 
is what the redstone will hold on just
do<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.480> like<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:33.970> then<00:02:35.140> place<00:02:36.140> redstone<00:02:36.500> on

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
do it like this then place redstone on

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.950 
do it like this then place redstone on
top<00:02:37.460> of<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.640> rack<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.820> power<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.420> top<00:02:38.660> pistons

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
top of the rack to power the top pistons

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.460 
top of the rack to power the top pistons
and<00:02:41.530> go<00:02:42.530> back<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.360> place<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.600> on<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.870> bottom

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
and go back and place it on the bottom

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.700 
and go back and place it on the bottom
of<00:02:45.710> the<00:02:45.770> wrecked<00:02:45.980> power<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.210> bottom<00:02:48.080> pistons

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
of the wrecked power the bottom pistons

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.449 
of the wrecked power the bottom pistons
and<00:02:50.110> let's<00:02:51.110> just<00:02:51.320> test<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.739> place<00:02:52.430> a

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
and let's just test this place a

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.300 
and let's just test this place a
redstone<00:02:52.670> torch<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:55.570> huh<00:02:56.570> that's<00:02:57.050> weird<00:02:57.310> that

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
redstone torch and huh that's weird that

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.770 
redstone torch and huh that's weird that
one's<00:02:58.489> not<00:02:58.640> coming<00:02:59.150> out

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.240 

hmm

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.540 

perhaps<00:03:11.240> it's<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.600> glitch<00:03:12.110> oh<00:03:12.530> there<00:03:13.400> we<00:03:13.520> go

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
perhaps it's a glitch oh there we go

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.440 
perhaps it's a glitch oh there we go
yeah<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.300> was<00:03:14.570> just<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.990> glitch<00:03:16.060> now<00:03:17.060> it's<00:03:17.300> all

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
yeah it was just a glitch now it's all

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.370 
yeah it was just a glitch now it's all
good<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:18.460> so<00:03:19.480> make<00:03:20.480> another<00:03:20.750> one<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.020> these<00:03:21.170> on

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
good and so make another one of these on

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:44.110 
good and so make another one of these on
the<00:03:21.500> other<00:03:21.620> side<00:03:40.180> three<00:03:42.370> okay<00:03:43.370> so<00:03:43.430> now<00:03:43.820> we<00:03:43.880> have

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
the other side three okay so now we have

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.270 
the other side three okay so now we have
another<00:03:45.670> another<00:03:46.670> hole<00:03:47.270> for<00:03:47.989> us<00:03:48.050> to<00:03:48.230> use<00:03:48.350> and

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.570 

make<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.520> exact<00:03:52.940> same<00:03:53.180> rack<00:03:53.980> cover<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:55.190> in<00:03:55.340> red

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
make the exact same rack cover it in red

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.340 
make the exact same rack cover it in red
stone<00:03:56.060> for<00:03:56.930> those<00:03:57.050> Pistons<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.959> then<00:03:59.959> we'll

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
stone for those Pistons and then we'll

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.210 
stone for those Pistons and then we'll
cover<00:04:00.680> it<00:04:00.830> in<00:04:00.950> red<00:04:01.160> stone<00:04:01.459> all<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.760> way<00:04:01.970> back

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
cover it in red stone all the way back

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.780 
cover it in red stone all the way back
and<00:04:05.050> redstone<00:04:06.050> torch<00:04:06.440> for<00:04:06.680> testing<00:04:09.640> see<00:04:10.640> these

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
and redstone torch for testing see these

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.490 
and redstone torch for testing see these
ones<00:04:11.030> are<00:04:11.180> all<00:04:11.239> pushed<00:04:11.480> out

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
ones are all pushed out

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.090 
ones are all pushed out
and<00:04:13.780> now<00:04:14.780> we<00:04:14.840> need<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.350> connect<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.710> current

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
and now we need to connect the current

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.640 
and now we need to connect the current
so<00:04:16.310> when<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:16.549> pull<00:04:16.790> one<00:04:17.060> lever<00:04:17.390> it's<00:04:18.170> just

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
so when you pull one lever it's just

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.830 
so when you pull one lever it's just
going<00:04:18.920> to<00:04:19.040> activate<00:04:19.510> everything<00:04:22.660> you<00:04:23.660> can

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
going to activate everything you can

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.970 
going to activate everything you can
easily<00:04:24.080> hide<00:04:24.470> this<00:04:25.070> redstone<00:04:25.640> underground

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
easily hide this redstone underground

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.430 
easily hide this redstone underground
but<00:04:27.980> I'm<00:04:28.280> just<00:04:28.610> doing<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.120> above<00:04:29.690> ground<00:04:29.720> for<00:04:30.410> a

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
but I'm just doing it above ground for a

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.480 
but I'm just doing it above ground for a
sake<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.770> time<00:04:31.220> in<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.520> tutorial<00:04:33.280> place<00:04:34.280> my

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
sake of time in the tutorial place my

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.950 
sake of time in the tutorial place my
lever<00:04:34.730> here<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:36.790> see<00:04:37.790> pull<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.510> lever<00:04:38.720> and

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
lever here and see pull the lever and

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.310 
lever here and see pull the lever and
they're<00:04:39.830> all<00:04:40.220> sticking<00:04:40.640> out<00:04:41.080> except<00:04:42.080> for<00:04:42.230> this

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
they're all sticking out except for this

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.500 
they're all sticking out except for this
one<00:04:42.380> again<00:04:42.620> this<00:04:42.860> one's<00:04:43.070> like<00:04:43.220> somehow<00:04:43.510> messed

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
one again this one's like somehow messed

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.150 
one again this one's like somehow messed
up<00:04:45.070> not<00:04:46.070> quite<00:04:46.310> sure<00:04:46.340> wrong<00:04:47.180> with<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:48.160> I'll

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
up not quite sure wrong with it I'll

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.909 
up not quite sure wrong with it I'll
just<00:04:49.310> replace<00:04:49.790> those<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:53.169> yeah<00:04:54.169> so<00:04:54.710> now<00:04:54.860> you

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
just replace those and yeah so now you

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.950 
just replace those and yeah so now you
can<00:04:55.190> place<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.610> blocks<00:04:55.910> in<00:04:56.240> that<00:04:56.510> you<00:04:56.630> want

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
can place the blocks in that you want

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.290 
can place the blocks in that you want
needs<00:04:57.710> to<00:04:57.860> push<00:04:58.040> out<00:04:58.250> bricks<00:04:58.850> are<00:04:59.150> the

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
needs to push out bricks are the

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.150 
needs to push out bricks are the
strongest<00:04:59.720> but<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.260> like<00:05:00.500> using<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:02.919> just<00:05:03.919> iron

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
strongest but I like using the just iron

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.830 
strongest but I like using the just iron
blocks<00:05:04.430> because<00:05:04.610> they<00:05:04.820> look<00:05:05.030> modern<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.540> cool

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
blocks because they look modern and cool

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.380 
blocks because they look modern and cool
and<00:05:06.290> when<00:05:07.040> you<00:05:07.130> pull<00:05:07.340> this<00:05:07.490> they<00:05:07.880> should<00:05:08.180> all

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
and when you pull this they should all

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.840 
and when you pull this they should all
stick<00:05:08.720> out<00:05:08.900> so<00:05:09.169> let's<00:05:10.100> go<00:05:10.280> to<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.460> other<00:05:10.550> side

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
stick out so let's go to the other side

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.360 
stick out so let's go to the other side
now<00:05:12.010> this<00:05:13.010> one<00:05:13.220> that's<00:05:13.400> got<00:05:13.850> some<00:05:14.150> problems<00:05:14.780> I

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
now this one that's got some problems I

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.350 
now this one that's got some problems I
really<00:05:16.370> don't<00:05:16.550> know<00:05:16.700> what's<00:05:16.910> wrong<00:05:17.060> with<00:05:17.270> that

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
really don't know what's wrong with that

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.200 
really don't know what's wrong with that
piston<00:05:20.350> anyway<00:05:21.520> that<00:05:22.520> probably<00:05:22.940> won't<00:05:23.090> happen

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
piston anyway that probably won't happen

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.210 
piston anyway that probably won't happen
when<00:05:23.570> you<00:05:23.660> try<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:23.870> build<00:05:24.110> it<00:05:24.290> but<00:05:24.860> what<00:05:25.100> you're

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
when you try to build it but what you're

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.610 
when you try to build it but what you're
going<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.430> do<00:05:25.550> is<00:05:25.669> just<00:05:25.700> fill<00:05:26.150> these<00:05:26.330> in<00:05:26.390> now<00:05:26.840> so
