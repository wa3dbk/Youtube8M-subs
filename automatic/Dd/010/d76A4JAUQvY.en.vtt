00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.270 
yeah I think he was heavier in this
fight<00:05:07.170> and<00:05:07.320> it<00:05:07.410> was<00:05:07.500> in<00:05:07.620> his<00:05:07.680> previous<00:05:07.890> fight

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
so he's hovering around the 250 255

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.340 
so he's hovering around the 250 255
pound<00:05:11.520> mark<00:05:11.730> at<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:11.940> moment<00:05:12.270> need<00:05:12.690> to<00:05:12.840> get<00:05:12.990> way
