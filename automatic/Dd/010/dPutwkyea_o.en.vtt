by the time I got up for the semi-final
I<00:03:28.960> was<00:03:29.080> quite<00:03:29.260> dizzy<00:03:29.470> by<00:03:29.710> that<00:03:29.860> point<00:03:30.100> but<00:03:30.700> like

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
I was quite dizzy by that point but like

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.310 
I was quite dizzy by that point but like
I<00:03:30.940> was<00:03:31.060> going<00:03:31.210> to<00:03:31.270> puke<00:03:31.510> just<00:03:31.840> getting<00:03:32.080> waves

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
I was going to puke just getting waves

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.510 
I was going to puke just getting waves
of<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.680> heat

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
of that heat

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.040 
of that heat
I<00:03:33.550> think<00:03:34.000> shock<00:03:34.240> was<00:03:34.390> starting<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.720> set<00:03:34.900> in

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
I think shock was starting to set in

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.640 
I think shock was starting to set in
then<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:35.560> no<00:03:36.280> on<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:37.600> gate<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:37.930> semi<00:03:38.140> final<00:03:38.560> I

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
then so no on the gate and semi final I

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.050 
then so no on the gate and semi final I
