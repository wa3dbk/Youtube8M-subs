00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
conservative university so they really

conservative university so they really
teach<00:00:44.860> you<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.519> basics<00:00:46.030> of<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.379> fundamentals

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
of painting and so I got a really strong

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.610 
of painting and so I got a really strong
background<00:00:52.719> with<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:52.899> and<00:00:53.260> from<00:00:53.440> there<00:00:53.590> I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
background with that and from there I

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.010 
background with that and from there I
was<00:00:53.770> able<00:00:53.860> just<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.370> develop<00:00:55.149> my<00:00:55.270> own<00:00:55.300> style<00:00:55.420> I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
was able just to develop my own style I

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.979 
was able just to develop my own style I
using<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.620> palette<00:00:57.219> knife<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:58.390> paint<00:00:58.840> with

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
using a palette knife to paint with

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.110 
using a palette knife to paint with
really<00:00:59.739> thick<00:00:59.770> textures<00:01:00.399> in<00:01:00.609> certain<00:01:00.879> parts

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
really thick textures in certain parts

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.889 
really thick textures in certain parts
of<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.239> canvas

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
of the canvas

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.969 
of the canvas
I<00:01:01.930> call<00:01:02.620> it<00:01:03.360> textures<00:01:04.360> of<00:01:04.509> life<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.229> certain

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
I call it textures of life so certain

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.170 
I call it textures of life so certain
parts<00:01:06.160> of<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.310> canvas<00:01:06.490> for<00:01:06.759> instance<00:01:07.030> like

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
parts of the canvas for instance like

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.260 
parts of the canvas for instance like
the<00:01:07.300> mountains<00:01:07.750> or<00:01:08.110> water<00:01:09.070> or<00:01:09.220> or<00:01:09.940> that

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
the mountains or water or or that

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.300 
the mountains or water or or that
distant<00:01:10.660> fields<00:01:11.080> would<00:01:11.170> be<00:01:11.320> smooth<00:01:11.680> as<00:01:12.009> as

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
distant fields would be smooth as as

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.609 
distant fields would be smooth as as
they<00:01:12.880> would<00:01:13.030> be<00:01:13.179> in<00:01:13.270> nature<00:01:13.690> and<00:01:13.929> then<00:01:14.500> the

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
they would be in nature and then the

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.740 
they would be in nature and then the
other<00:01:14.740> parts<00:01:15.100> like<00:01:15.429> the<00:01:15.550> foreground<00:01:15.910> of<00:01:16.270> a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
other parts like the foreground of a

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.200 
other parts like the foreground of a
meadow<00:01:16.990> or<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.590> chunky<00:01:18.070> thickness<00:01:18.460> of<00:01:18.700> trees

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
meadow or the chunky thickness of trees

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.539 
meadow or the chunky thickness of trees
I<00:01:19.570> would<00:01:20.049> build<00:01:20.200> up<00:01:20.439> with<00:01:20.680> very<00:01:20.920> lots<00:01:21.460> of

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
I would build up with very lots of

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.310 
I would build up with very lots of
layers<00:01:21.790> of<00:01:21.909> thick<00:01:22.210> texture<00:01:22.720> it's<00:01:23.080> kind<00:01:23.290> of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
layers of thick texture it's kind of

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.130 
layers of thick texture it's kind of
like<00:01:23.530> sculpture<00:01:24.040> really<00:01:24.939> I<00:01:25.150> think<00:01:25.720> every<00:01:25.900> year

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
like sculpture really I think every year

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
I get a little thicker and thicker as

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.890 
I get a little thicker and thicker as
soon<00:01:27.640> it's<00:01:27.759> gonna<00:01:27.820> be<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:28.150> sculpture<00:01:28.600> coming

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
soon it's gonna be the sculpture coming

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
the bark of the trees could really feel

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.330 
the bark of the trees could really feel
like<00:02:09.610> real<00:02:10.090> bark<00:02:10.360> or<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.690> petals<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.769> a<00:02:11.829> poppy

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
to feel like an actual flower that you

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.340 
to feel like an actual flower that you
can<00:02:14.829> pick<00:02:15.160> for<00:02:15.970> me<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.750> see<00:02:16.989> with<00:02:17.200> my

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
can pick for me I have to see with my

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.620 
can pick for me I have to see with my
own<00:02:17.380> eyes<00:02:17.799> that<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.730> landscapes<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.600> I

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
own eyes that the landscapes that I

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.360 
own eyes that the landscapes that I
paint<00:02:19.989> I<00:02:20.670> for<00:02:21.670> instance<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:22.859> tried<00:02:23.859> to<00:02:24.010> paint<00:02:24.190> a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
paint I for instance I tried to paint a

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.200 
paint I for instance I tried to paint a
lavender<00:02:24.699> field<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.389> I<00:02:25.570> didn't<00:02:26.169> understand

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
lavender field and I didn't understand

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.480 
lavender field and I didn't understand
how<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.990> clumps<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.470> lavender<00:02:28.770> were<00:02:29.010> formed

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
how the clumps of lavender were formed

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.240 
how the clumps of lavender were formed
and<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.960> painting<00:02:31.200> turned<00:02:31.620> out<00:02:31.740> flat<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
and so the painting turned out flat and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.160 
and so the painting turned out flat and
I<00:02:32.580> wasn't<00:02:32.760> really<00:02:32.970> happy<00:02:33.270> with<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:34.140> I

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
I wasn't really happy with it so I

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.620 
I wasn't really happy with it so I
decided<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.620> go<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.830> France<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:36.060> found<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
decided to go to France and I found the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.870 
decided to go to France and I found the
region<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.140> France<00:02:37.470> outside<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.370> Avignon

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
region of France outside of Avignon

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.630 
region of France outside of Avignon
where<00:02:39.720> they<00:02:39.930> supply<00:02:40.290> 60%<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> world's

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
where they supply 60% of the world's

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.580 
where they supply 60% of the world's
lavender<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.200> drive<00:02:43.350> for

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
lavender and so you can just drive for

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.470 
lavender and so you can just drive for
miles<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:43.980> see<00:02:44.160> purple<00:02:44.580> field<00:02:44.850> after<00:02:45.060> purple

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
miles and see purple field after purple

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.340 
miles and see purple field after purple
fields<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.710> stood<00:02:47.220> there<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.350> studied

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
fields and I stood there and I studied

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.510 
fields and I stood there and I studied
how<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.890> lavender<00:02:50.280> grew<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:53.160> scent

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
how the lavender grew and and the scent

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.170 
how the lavender grew and and the scent
and<00:02:54.000> every<00:02:54.630> little<00:02:54.810> part<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.350> herb<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:56.180> I

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
and every little part of that herb and I

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.870 
and every little part of that herb and I
took<00:02:57.480> thousands<00:02:57.990> of<00:02:58.110> pictures<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.920> sketches

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
took thousands of pictures and sketches

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.000 
took thousands of pictures and sketches
and<00:03:00.120> when<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.300> brought<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:00.960> back<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.920> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
and when I brought it all back to the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.510 
and when I brought it all back to the
studio<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.700> had<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.450> much<00:03:03.840> better<00:03:04.050> grasp<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.740> how

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
studio I had a much better grasp of how

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.490 
studio I had a much better grasp of how
I<00:03:06.000> wanted<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.660> paint<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.930> lavender<00:03:07.260> field

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
I wanted to paint a lavender field

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.040 
I wanted to paint a lavender field
because<00:03:08.130> with<00:03:08.220> my<00:03:08.340> texture<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:09.060> sculpted<00:03:09.900> on

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
because with my texture I sculpted on

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.140 
because with my texture I sculpted on
how<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.740> would<00:03:10.860> grow<00:03:11.100> in<00:03:11.310> nature<00:03:11.460> so<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
how it would grow in nature so the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.510 
how it would grow in nature so the
different<00:03:12.480> clumps<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.650> lavender<00:03:13.860> became

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
different clumps of the lavender became

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.970 
different clumps of the lavender became
like<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.700> real<00:03:15.030> life<00:03:15.390> field<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.560> was<00:03:16.710> a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
like a real life field and it was a

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.220 
like a real life field and it was a
hundred<00:03:17.400> times<00:03:17.580> better<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.210> so<00:03:18.660> for<00:03:18.840> me

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
hundred times better and so for me

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.920 
hundred times better and so for me
I<00:03:19.260> get<00:03:19.590> inspiration<00:03:19.890> from<00:03:20.490> my<00:03:20.790> travels<00:03:21.270> from

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
I get inspiration from my travels from

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.350 
I get inspiration from my travels from
the<00:03:22.050> places<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.740> I<00:03:23.100> visit<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.700> really<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.240> to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
the places that I visit I really like to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.990 
the places that I visit I really like to
experience<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:25.080> firsthand<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.550> makes<00:03:26.760> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
experience it firsthand and it makes a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.600 
experience it firsthand and it makes a
much<00:03:27.210> better<00:03:27.270> painting<00:03:28.020> when<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.440> do<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
much better painting when I do that the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.120 
much better painting when I do that the
best<00:03:29.820> compliment<00:03:30.390> I've<00:03:30.480> ever<00:03:30.510> received<00:03:31.130> and

best compliment I've ever received and

best compliment I've ever received and
it's<00:03:32.550> actually<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.940> most<00:03:32.970> frequent<00:03:33.660> one<00:03:33.870> is

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
it's actually the most frequent one is

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.340 
it's actually the most frequent one is
that<00:03:34.800> my<00:03:34.920> paintings<00:03:35.340> make<00:03:35.940> people<00:03:36.270> happy<00:03:36.630> and
