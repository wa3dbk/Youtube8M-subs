00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
do a bit of accelerate in it it's still

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.380 
do a bit of accelerate in it it's still
a<00:00:41.360> little<00:00:41.660> bit<00:00:41.750> too<00:00:41.930> much<00:00:42.110> for<00:00:42.410> her<00:00:43.360> so<00:00:44.360> I

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
a little bit too much for her so I

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.630 
a little bit too much for her so I
thought<00:00:44.630> right<00:00:44.980> that<00:00:45.980> didn't<00:00:46.280> want<00:00:46.400> to<00:00:46.489> go

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
thought right that didn't want to go

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.250 
thought right that didn't want to go
down<00:00:46.670> this<00:00:47.030> route<00:00:48.790> but<00:00:49.790> maybe<00:00:49.970> a<00:00:50.090> top<00:00:50.360> box<00:00:50.629> of

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
down this route but maybe a top box of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.590 
down this route but maybe a top box of
some<00:00:52.010> description<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:52.790> you<00:00:52.940> can<00:00:52.970> lean<00:00:53.239> against

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
some description so you can lean against

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.180 
some description so you can lean against
it<00:00:55.900> so<00:00:56.900> I<00:00:56.930> was<00:00:57.080> happen<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.350> look<00:00:57.410> online<00:00:57.620> and

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
it so I was happen to look online and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.900 
it so I was happen to look online and
they<00:01:00.550> give<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:01.640> do<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.150> nice<00:01:02.330> ones<00:01:02.570> by<00:01:02.780> far<00:01:03.080> I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.249 

don't<00:01:07.910> care<00:01:08.149> what<00:01:08.300> you<00:01:08.390> say<00:01:09.820> but<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.970> rats<00:01:11.259> the

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
don't care what you say but the rats the

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:19.440 
don't care what you say but the rats the
racks<00:01:12.470> they've<00:01:12.710> got<00:01:12.979> her<00:01:15.100> just<00:01:16.100> monstrosity

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.620 

so<00:01:20.450> I<00:01:20.479> did<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:21.080> got<00:01:23.110> it's<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.259> CBF<00:01:24.740> thousand<00:01:25.630> rack

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
so I did I got it's a CBF thousand rack

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.609 
so I did I got it's a CBF thousand rack
under<00:01:27.619> one<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:30.080> there's<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.259> look<00:01:30.350> whatever

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
under one and there's a look whatever

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.960 
under one and there's a look whatever
the<00:01:31.100> back<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.490> fixing<00:01:31.850> screws<00:01:33.580> are<00:01:34.580> virtually

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
the back to fixing screws are virtually

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.770 
the back to fixing screws are virtually
identical<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.570> where<00:01:35.720> my<00:01:35.979> Rockies<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.910> the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
identical to where my Rockies and the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.109 
identical to where my Rockies and the
front<00:01:38.990> bits<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:40.399> front<00:01:40.640> holes

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
front bits the front holes

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.699 
front bits the front holes
I<00:01:41.149> just<00:01:41.780> made<00:01:41.929> some<00:01:41.990> little<00:01:42.170> aluminium

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
I just made some little aluminium

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:47.699 
I just made some little aluminium
brackets<00:01:44.860> no<00:01:45.860> ball<00:01:46.069> onto<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.310> subframe<00:01:46.670> so

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
brackets no ball onto the subframe so

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.650 
brackets no ball onto the subframe so
it's<00:01:48.709> not<00:01:48.890> going<00:01:49.160> anywhere

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.150 

so<00:01:53.660> then<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.899> was<00:01:53.990> ever<00:01:54.140> look<00:01:54.289> for<00:01:54.319> a<00:01:54.649> top<00:01:54.920> box

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
so then it was ever look for a top box

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.169 
so then it was ever look for a top box
so<00:01:56.030> much<00:01:56.179> she<00:01:56.360> can't<00:01:56.899> fall<00:01:57.170> against<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:59.060> I've

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
so much she can't fall against so I've

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:06.249 
so much she can't fall against so I've
got<00:01:59.300> a<00:01:59.330> give<00:01:59.599> me<00:02:00.399> maxia<00:02:02.709> 8055<00:02:03.709> it's<00:02:03.950> cold<00:02:05.259> and

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
got a give me maxia 8055 it's cold and

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.219 
got a give me maxia 8055 it's cold and
it's<00:02:06.530> it's<00:02:07.490> great

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
it's it's great

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.510 
it's it's great
not<00:02:09.229> if<00:02:09.470> I'm<00:02:09.560> carrying

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.740 

if<00:02:14.520> I'm<00:02:14.670> checking<00:02:14.880> out<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.330> back<00:02:15.480> quite<00:02:15.720> a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
if I'm checking out on the back quite a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.110 
if I'm checking out on the back quite a
bit<00:02:15.840> then<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.490> got<00:02:17.490> was<00:02:17.610> just<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.850> vault<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
bit then I got was just a vault in the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.850 
bit then I got was just a vault in the
films<00:02:18.420> beach<00:02:21.170> yeah<00:02:22.170> if<00:02:22.320> I'm<00:02:22.440> taking<00:02:22.740> her<00:02:22.830> on

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
films beach yeah if I'm taking her on

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.620 
films beach yeah if I'm taking her on
the<00:02:23.010> back<00:02:23.160> quite<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> bit<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.360> go<00:02:24.480> out

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
the back quite a bit and and we go out

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.740 
the back quite a bit and and we go out
and<00:02:24.750> have<00:02:24.840> outs<00:02:25.050> like<00:02:25.260> we<00:02:25.410> do<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:27.510> would<00:02:27.630> be<00:02:27.720> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
and have outs like we do it would be a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.950 
and have outs like we do it would be a
good<00:02:27.870> idea<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:29.070> get<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> box<00:02:29.460> that<00:02:29.730> holds<00:02:29.960> two

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
good idea to to get a box that holds two

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.170 
good idea to to get a box that holds two
helmets<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:34.230> that's<00:02:34.410> what<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.560> did
