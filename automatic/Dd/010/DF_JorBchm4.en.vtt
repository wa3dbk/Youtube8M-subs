00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:16.879 
so as we said this is all rumor at the

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.029 
so as we said this is all rumor at the
moment<00:06:17.300> but<00:06:17.930> the<00:06:18.139> source<00:06:18.499> is<00:06:18.800> good<00:06:19.339> and

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
moment but the source is good and

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.409 
moment but the source is good and
Vinylmation<00:06:22.039> had<00:06:22.219> a<00:06:22.249> video<00:06:22.580> about<00:06:22.909> all<00:06:23.210> of

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
Vinylmation had a video about all of

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.209 
Vinylmation had a video about all of
this<00:06:23.539> stuff<00:06:23.869> on<00:06:24.110> YouTube<00:06:24.649> which<00:06:24.830> has<00:06:25.009> since

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:25.219 
this stuff on YouTube which has since

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.999 
this stuff on YouTube which has since
been<00:06:25.430> pulled<00:06:25.729> down<00:06:25.819> so<00:06:26.719> I<00:06:26.960> again<00:06:27.589> I<00:06:27.649> think<00:06:27.830> that

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009 
been pulled down so I again I think that

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:30.010 
been pulled down so I again I think that
lends<00:06:28.339> credence<00:06:28.639> the<00:06:29.059> fact<00:06:29.300> that<00:06:29.569> this

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
lends credence the fact that this

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.730 
lends credence the fact that this
information<00:06:30.259> is<00:06:31.659> probably<00:06:32.659> legit<00:06:33.319> but

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
information is probably legit but

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.320 
information is probably legit but
hopefully<00:06:34.159> we'll<00:06:34.309> get<00:06:34.430> confirmation<00:06:34.819> at<00:06:35.180> e3
