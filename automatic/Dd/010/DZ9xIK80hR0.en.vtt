00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
get dinged up by hail some of the pros

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.860 
get dinged up by hail some of the pros
of<00:01:00.280> it<00:01:00.520> is<00:01:00.610> that<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:00.820> never<00:01:01.030> has<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.329> be<00:01:01.480> painted

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
of it is that it never has to be painted

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.630 
of it is that it never has to be painted
the<00:01:01.960> color<00:01:02.140> is<00:01:02.410> melted<00:01:02.829> all<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.220> way<00:01:03.340> through

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
the color is melted all the way through

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.179 
the color is melted all the way through
so<00:01:04.210> you<00:01:04.809> could<00:01:04.960> chip<00:01:05.170> at<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.470> scratch<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:05.950> with

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
so you could chip at it scratch it with

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.210 
so you could chip at it scratch it with
a<00:01:06.220> rock<00:01:06.430> whatever<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.270> color<00:01:07.900> is<00:01:08.140> deep<00:01:08.800> inside

a rock whatever the color is deep inside
the<00:01:09.370> actual<00:01:09.610> product<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:11.229> of<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.440> downsides

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
the actual product one of the downsides

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.100 
the actual product one of the downsides
to<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.550> is<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:12.940> after<00:01:13.060> 10-15<00:01:13.750> years<00:01:13.780> they

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
to that is that after 10-15 years they

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.890 
to that is that after 10-15 years they
can<00:01:14.229> start<00:01:14.440> to<00:01:14.590> fade<00:01:14.830> it's<00:01:15.820> really<00:01:16.210> almost

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
can start to fade it's really almost

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.750 
can start to fade it's really almost
impossible<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.680> touch<00:01:17.860> it<00:01:18.040> up<00:01:18.130> so<00:01:18.370> once<00:01:18.580> it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
impossible to touch it up so once it

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.280 
impossible to touch it up so once it
starts<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.090> fade<00:01:19.360> it's<00:01:19.810> never<00:01:20.049> really<00:01:20.170> going

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
starts to fade it's never really going

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
starts to fade it's never really going
to<00:01:20.409> look<00:01:20.560> like<00:01:20.710> new<00:01:20.890> again

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
to look like new again

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.399 
to look like new again
but<00:01:21.490> they<00:01:22.330> pick<00:01:22.540> colors<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:22.930> don't<00:01:23.229> fade

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
but they pick colors that don't fade

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.020 
but they pick colors that don't fade
that<00:01:23.590> much<00:01:23.860> you're<00:01:24.340> not<00:01:24.430> going<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.700> notice<00:01:24.820> a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
that much you're not going to notice a

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.760 
that much you're not going to notice a
huge<00:01:25.180> amount<00:01:25.510> of<00:01:25.570> fading<00:01:25.930> over<00:01:26.140> 10<00:01:26.440> 20<00:01:26.620> years

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
huge amount of fading over 10 20 years

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.100

and<00:01:27.190> again<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:28.210> never<00:01:28.390> ever<00:01:28.630> have<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:28.840> paint

it's a little more cost effective it's a

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.710 
it's a little more cost effective it's a

it's on the wall
it's<00:02:46.040> basically<00:02:46.430> concrete<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.450> biggest<00:02:47.810> pro

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
it's going to look exactly like real

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.679 
it's going to look exactly like real
wood<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:52.310> doesn't<00:02:52.639> expand<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.150> contract<00:02:53.209> like

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
wood it doesn't expand and contract like

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.599 
wood it doesn't expand and contract like
wood<00:02:53.930> though<00:02:54.169> or<00:02:54.439> vinyl<00:02:55.189> for<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.430> matter

wood though or vinyl for that matter

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.979 
wood though or vinyl for that matter
that's<00:02:55.849> another<00:02:55.970> downside<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.419> vinyl<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:56.870> it

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
that's another downside of vinyl is it

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.569 
that's another downside of vinyl is it
expands<00:02:57.409> contracts<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:58.069> over<00:02:58.220> time<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.519> can

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
expands contracts and over time it can

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.270 
expands contracts and over time it can
kind<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.930> not<00:02:59.930> look<00:03:00.109> as<00:03:00.230> fresh<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:00.620> clean<00:03:00.829> this

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
kind of not look as fresh and clean this

installed improperly this stuff is

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.349 
installed improperly this stuff is
actually<00:04:18.859> a<00:04:19.070> nightmare<00:04:19.250> installed<00:04:19.909> properly

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
actually a nightmare installed properly

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.089 
actually a nightmare installed properly
I<00:04:20.840> think<00:04:21.019> it's<00:04:21.380> probably<00:04:21.590> one<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.949> best

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
I think it's probably one of the best

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.350 
I think it's probably one of the best
products<00:04:22.520> out<00:04:22.610> there<00:04:22.849> without

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360
