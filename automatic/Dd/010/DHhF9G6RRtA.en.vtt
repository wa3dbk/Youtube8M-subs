00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:14.450
 half-stand 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.000
 to his point of view if I stand 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.180
 I'm grown up then I really want 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.630
 developed stands 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.630
 I have to work hard 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.079
 that was the halfway i like his 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.110
 voice lends 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.920
 that's clear jerry could you 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.960
 please stop 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:42.790
 I have a full ass

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.210
 in the office, jane fonda gets on very easily 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.770
 a small push unfortunately not yours 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.150
 cock interested club tail 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.530
 is not interested in you either 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.530
 do you only have it now we wee you 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 is this triangle complementary or is 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.360
 it's one of those supplements 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.060
 honoring a triangle is never 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.620
 complementary or only supplement him 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.690
 angle from which there is no such 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.190
 to be named 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.690
 really good well exactly the triangle 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.270
 that you have drawn though not 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.950
 especially good is equal-Lich what 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.380
 means that at least two of his 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.610
 pages the same length have exactly 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.570
 So for example, which angle would be 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.330
 Complementary to a 45 degree angle 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.050
 if it has to be 90 degrees together 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.159
 one with 45 degrees correct and now for 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.090
 supplement your way 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.439

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.730
 tear off quickly 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.380
 Both of us have hoped our lives 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.120

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.420
 allowed 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.500
 and getting out of the way is natural 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.500

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.880

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:28.409
