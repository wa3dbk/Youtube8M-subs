00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:08.540
 street ovens can be of different systems and 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.730
 difficulties the main thing in her opportunity 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.889
 cook on fire and outdoors 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.170
 Sergey Repin decided to go standard 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.980
 by Sergey, this is how I understand it will be 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.130
 outdoor bbq stove before committed long ago 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.460
 already had an idea to make a stove under 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.640
 canopy because it very often happens 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.820
 rain is especially in spring and autumn 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:38.260
 singles are not interested at all 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:42.100
 that's why seeing what people do 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.990
 the Internet is such an option we have chosen 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.100
 cheap penny however foundation 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:51.260
 Sergey took seriously he domain 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.600
 given that the soil is clay and all 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.160
 sticks and had to dig deep to 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.560
 subway 10 meters 20 to a depth 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.840
 freezing masonry of half-brick goes and 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.200
 inside 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.619
 where will be what evil burns yes there 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.990
 lined with my fireclay bricks well there 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.619
 generally worth not even fell into a quarter he 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.450
 on the edge is a feature of laying such 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.609
 that between the foreign key and chamotte 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.979
 bricked 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:25.219
 there should be a small distance of 5 10 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.490
 millimeters is easily achieved 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.060
 if at laying we put the usual 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.069
 carton 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.030
 in order to smoothly go to the pipe 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:39.259
 needs to be done for narrowing here 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.689
 here is just what the back row is with us 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.590
 stays in place that is the pipe will have 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.420
 us go exactly on the back near the front 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.440
 and the two side goes narrowing 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.240
 I want my back on the floor of the brick load 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.560
 and on the side by one third about one 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.120
 third 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:05.920
 we put about one third here and 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.890
 Eventually we reach the pipe size and 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.100
 Already go further on even pipe 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.150
 many question and how to lay out 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:21.730
 just such an arochka is basically easy for 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:25.890
 I need to start this profile 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.630
 how did you take the jigsaw sawn 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.240
 semicircle here he took two boards to 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.500
 it was easier for them 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.440
 Shiva has placed and pulled on top 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.590
 ordinary plywood here turned out such as 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.140
 would the profile be semi-circular and when we 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.650
 we reach a certain brick 10 i 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.900
 while there are 73 cookies turned out here 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.470
 set this profile and support 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.550
 something let's say some 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:05.290
 bricks thin boards here prop 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:10.650
 bottom your prom carpenters got up here 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:16.270
 back and you can already slowly in tanks 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:19.360
 to put a brick with a mortar 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.100
 the main thing that our archet oozing 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.400
 converged to one brick 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.910
 he will be like a castle well and when 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:32.380
 the solution dries out . easy to clean 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:34.480
 everything remains for those who want something 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.459
 unusual and make for example a stove under 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.769
 kazan useful advice from an experienced 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.630
 stove man valentine shooting to home 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.980
 the mistake of many who do things under 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:48.030
 cauldron is when the flue gases exit 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.120
 from under the cauldron satisfied in one direction 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.100
 equals pipe here so in this case 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.770
 all products from the side 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.170
 gas that goes out the pipe burns a 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.430
 on the other hand 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.810
 do evenly more less 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.600
 warmed uniformly cauldron 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.239
 This is the device we have a pipe 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.760
 goes there from both sides 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:13.770
 exit into the chimney flue gas and fire 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.880
 rises vertically washes 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:22.500
 the cauldron from two sides falls down 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.710
 a little bit and the pipe goes here 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.010
 It is closer to the article side than here 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.610
 thought the gases go here more than there 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.040
 to somehow align between the output 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.650
 flue gas in both of these channels in the pipe 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.750
 I'm here from arranged a little bit 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.500
 small delay for this other 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.380
 sides and these cuts that is 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.889
 distance between cauldron and fireclay 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.950
 bricked 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:53.250
 here you are less than here and in 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.410
 the farthest part of this spell is even more so 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.470
 I myself tried to make a profit at home 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:04.740
 which comes here here to them closer but to them 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:07.410
 harder let us take this huge plate 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:13.400
 which is under big cauldrons 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.400
 there up to 25 liters it will stand 10 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.850
 on the solution is clear and here we see that 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:28.050
 here's the gap where flue gases go 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:31.230
 between the pipe between the stove and the common here 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.890
 this barrier washing the walls towards the wife with 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.850
 this side 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:39.420
 significantly more than here we have 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.000
 it turns out that she benefits here with 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.690
 these sides washes the cauldron and leaves 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.780
 further in the circle 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.410
 As a result, the cauldron heats evenly in 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.590
 this furnace 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:54.390
 chamotte made to the core that is chamotte 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:56.670
 brick on the edge is placed inside such 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.970
 well from the usual full red 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:02.010
 bricks between themselves two layers separated 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.980
 thermo suture through 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.460
 basalt cardboard here it is video here 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.280
 is there a mod on the core of fire 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.680
 expands but russia it goes all 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.050
 stirs and resembles basalt 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.630
 cardboard but not reaching the outer layer 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.670
 brick and by doing so we never outside 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.890
 Do not have pimple stove options for 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.650
 the streets are great many everyone can 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.190
 pick up your gastronomic 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.410
 aesthetic tastes 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.890
 the main thing is to find those who are willing to share 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.890
 experience
