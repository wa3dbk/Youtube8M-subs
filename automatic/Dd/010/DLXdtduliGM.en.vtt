00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.180 
before you buy anything new I'm gonna
breathe<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.639> stamp<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:40.440> I'm<00:03:40.919> just<00:03:41.040> gonna

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
breathe on the stamp and I'm just gonna

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.369 
breathe on the stamp and I'm just gonna
press<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.609> down<00:03:41.909> on<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.329> paper<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.900> have<00:03:43.260> no

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
press it down on the paper I have no

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:44.479 
press it down on the paper I have no
idea<00:03:43.680> if<00:03:43.769> it's<00:03:43.859> right<00:03:44.010> side<00:03:44.190> up<00:03:44.340> or<00:03:44.430> upside

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
idea if it's right side up or upside

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.770 
idea if it's right side up or upside
down<00:03:44.909> but<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.150> doesn't<00:03:45.419> really<00:03:45.540> matter

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
down but it doesn't really matter

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.599 
down but it doesn't really matter
because<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.650> can<00:03:46.799> die-cut<00:03:46.919> it<00:03:47.250> later<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:50.280> look

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
because I can die-cut it later and look

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.149 
because I can die-cut it later and look
at<00:03:50.699> that<00:03:50.849> isn't<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.419> cool<00:03:51.720> I'm<00:03:52.709> gonna<00:03:52.919> bring

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
at that isn't that cool I'm gonna bring

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.839 
at that isn't that cool I'm gonna bring
it<00:03:53.310> up<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.549> little<00:03:53.669> bit<00:03:53.909> closer<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.419> show<00:03:54.659> you<00:03:55.849> it

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
it up a little bit closer to show you it

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.699 
it up a little bit closer to show you it
just<00:03:57.030> gives<00:03:57.359> it<00:03:57.659> a<00:03:57.750> whole<00:03:57.959> different<00:03:58.019> look

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
just gives it a whole different look

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.920 
just gives it a whole different look
it's<00:03:58.979> much<00:03:59.159> more<00:03:59.310> vivid<00:03:59.609> than<00:04:00.329> if<00:04:00.479> we<00:04:00.599> stamped

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
it's much more vivid than if we stamped

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.710 
it's much more vivid than if we stamped
it<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.109> matte<00:04:01.979> cardstock<00:04:02.579> you<00:04:03.090> can<00:04:03.389> do<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.629> on

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
it on matte cardstock you can do it on

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.839 
it on matte cardstock you can do it on
plain<00:04:03.959> cardstock<00:04:04.290> but<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.829> does<00:04:05.040> look<00:04:05.760> a

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
plain cardstock but it does look a

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.759 
plain cardstock but it does look a
little<00:04:05.970> bit<00:04:06.090> better<00:04:06.329> on<00:04:06.689> the<00:04:06.959> glossy<00:04:07.379> I<00:04:07.409> think

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
little bit better on the glossy I think

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.289 
little bit better on the glossy I think
it<00:04:07.889> helps<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.250> colors<00:04:08.549> float<00:04:08.879> around<00:04:09.000> a

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
it helps the colors float around a

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.319 
it helps the colors float around a
little<00:04:09.419> bit<00:04:09.659> and<00:04:10.019> then<00:04:10.650> what<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.069> did<00:04:11.430> when<00:04:12.269> I

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
little bit and then what I did when I

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.789 
little bit and then what I did when I
was<00:04:12.479> ready<00:04:12.659> to<00:04:12.689> die<00:04:12.930> cut<00:04:13.199> it<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.379> borrowed<00:04:13.680> these

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
was ready to die cut it I borrowed these

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.909 
was ready to die cut it I borrowed these
nest<00:04:14.040> abilities<00:04:14.430> from<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.699> friend<00:04:14.909> of<00:04:15.030> mine<00:04:15.919> you

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
nest abilities from a friend of mine you

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.349 
nest abilities from a friend of mine you
just<00:04:17.099> kind<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.340> lay<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.820> way<00:04:17.909> you<00:04:17.970> want<00:04:18.269> it

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
just kind of lay it the way you want it

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.969 
just kind of lay it the way you want it
and<00:04:18.539> then<00:04:18.599> I<00:04:18.780> use<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> little<00:04:19.229> bit<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.409> painters

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
and then I use a little bit of painters

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.339 
and then I use a little bit of painters
tape<00:04:20.159> to<00:04:20.220> tape<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.729> in<00:04:20.849> place<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.329> that<00:04:21.389> way<00:04:22.079> it

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
tape to tape it in place and that way it

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.680 
tape to tape it in place and that way it
keeps<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.889> together<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.180> doesn't<00:04:24.360> pop<00:04:24.510> out

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
keeps it together so it doesn't pop out

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.200 
keeps it together so it doesn't pop out
before<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.110> emboss<00:04:25.440> it

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
before I emboss it

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.760 
before I emboss it
so<00:04:26.270> that<00:04:26.419> way<00:04:26.569> I<00:04:26.600> can<00:04:26.990> just<00:04:27.020> kind<00:04:27.350> of<00:04:27.410> tape<00:04:27.620> it

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
so that way I can just kind of tape it

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.580 
so that way I can just kind of tape it
on<00:04:28.060> die<00:04:29.060> cut<00:04:29.389> it<00:04:29.509> and<00:04:29.690> Boston<00:04:30.139> it's<00:04:30.289> not<00:04:30.440> gonna

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
on die cut it and Boston it's not gonna

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.529 
on die cut it and Boston it's not gonna
be<00:04:30.740> glue<00:04:30.889> on<00:04:31.009> me<00:04:31.130> so<00:04:31.669> there<00:04:31.850> you<00:04:31.970> go<00:04:32.150> it's<00:04:32.479> a

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
be glue on me so there you go it's a

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:33.969 
be glue on me so there you go it's a
very<00:04:32.750> easy<00:04:33.050> technique<00:04:33.199> I<00:04:33.470> hope<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:33.740> try<00:04:33.949> it

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
very easy technique I hope you try it

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.670 
very easy technique I hope you try it
and<00:04:34.479> I'm<00:04:35.479> destroying<00:04:35.930> all<00:04:36.080> my<00:04:36.199> new<00:04:36.319> stamp

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.020

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
techniques before I forget what they are

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.430 
techniques before I forget what they are
since<00:04:38.449> I<00:04:38.509> just<00:04:38.690> came<00:04:38.780> back<00:04:38.930> for<00:04:39.139> the<00:04:39.199> stamp

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440
