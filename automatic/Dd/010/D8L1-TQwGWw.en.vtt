00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.830
 the first step in the construction of our invitation 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.120
 is to cut a small amount of hair this servant 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.709
 and with the help of a technician 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.469
 remove lint from its base 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:13.879
 once cleaned 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.159
 we introduce them into the hair aligner 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.519
 after seeing them ordered with the help of this tool 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:23.269
 we remove them 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.009
 i ride on the ground 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.169
 to form 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.689
 the tail we show 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.990
 we secure the material with several turns of igloo 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.360
 and we cut the surplus 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.140
 we select ujat the coffee color 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.350
 of lamb size only that we are using 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.880
 we removed some figures from their base 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.880
 and we're on the rebarbadora doing it 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.510
 for the abdomen of this fly 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.100
 we will use yellow davín 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.040
 which we must apply 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.040
 in Beijing exhibitions on it 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.540
 once this is done 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.950
 we start rolling the material forward 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.370
 to cover points thirds of the affected party not be 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.170
 then we leave our bovine exhibition rest 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.880
 we take the jaclyn 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 lohan roll masters forward 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.610
 and once we reach the end of the python min 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.460
 we secure the check with several ports of ilo and cut the excess 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.020
 for the wing we show that we are not going to use deer hairs 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.430
 and in the same indiscriminate tail 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.350
 this one must be cut 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.350
 created and placed on the computer 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.850
 after this 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.079
 we take the bunch of hairs we position it on the back of the floors 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.360
 we insure with several laps vehicle 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.360
 and we cut everything on the front 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.840
 we select some calf tail hairs 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.369
 that are the same length of the year 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.959
 and latam or about this 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.370
 the goal of these hairs is that they do not serve as an indicator of tiquina the hour 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.319
 to test 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.379
 but I must clarify that it is an optional step and not necessarily 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.379
 include those in your show 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.409
 we choose a good quality grizzly jacal 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.409
 and we tie it in the way I show you here 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:38.929
 For the thorax of our fly we will use orange-colored davín 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.489
 keep in mind that 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.810
 the proportion matches that of our show 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.859
 and it is that all 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.789
 and is pointer but the length of the people 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:51.280
 which we must completely cover contamination before 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.589
 leaving only a small space behind the eye 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.589
 for the terminations 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.689
 the next step that is to take the check and cris min 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.729
 roll it forward 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.729
 and once we reach that passive behind the eye 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.729
 we secure it with some lumps of ilo 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.729
 and cut the excess 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:21.049
 the final step in the process is wet is to make some knots 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:25.079
 cut the thread 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.419
 also 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:30.949
 It is advisable to apply some layers of cement cola will cancel the head 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.299
 I insist we inverco
