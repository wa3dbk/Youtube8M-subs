there's<00:02:22.280> one<00:02:22.489> more<00:02:22.640> benefit<00:02:23.030> I'd<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:23.329> to

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
there's one more benefit I'd like to

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.920 
there's one more benefit I'd like to
mention<00:02:24.610> storing<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.730> racks<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.269> a<00:02:26.450> shop<00:02:26.689> is

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
mention storing the racks in a shop is

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.170 
mention storing the racks in a shop is
no<00:02:27.170> problem<00:02:27.620> they<00:02:28.040> all<00:02:28.250> interlock<00:02:28.670> with<00:02:29.030> each

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
no problem they all interlock with each

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.210 
no problem they all interlock with each
other<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.629> therefore<00:02:29.930> even<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.560> large<00:02:30.829> amount

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
other and therefore even a large amount

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.339 
other and therefore even a large amount
of<00:02:31.310> storage<00:02:31.670> racks<00:02:31.939> will<00:02:32.480> take<00:02:32.720> up<00:02:32.959> very

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
of storage racks will take up very

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:40.580 
of storage racks will take up very
little<00:02:33.500> space

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.910 

the<00:02:41.069> concept<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.880> racks<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.270> simple<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
the concept of the racks is simple the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.339 
the concept of the racks is simple the
door<00:02:44.160> barely<00:02:44.670> touches<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.150> edge<00:02:45.390> on<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.200> rack

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
door barely touches the edge on the rack

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.120 
door barely touches the edge on the rack
holders

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
holders

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.060 
holders
therefore<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.450> newly<00:02:49.750> painted<00:02:49.960> area<00:02:50.620> has

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
therefore the newly painted area has

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.510 
therefore the newly painted area has
practically<00:02:51.790> no<00:02:51.850> contact<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.520> stays

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
practically no contact and stays

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.910 
practically no contact and stays
undisturbed<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:58.090> works<00:02:58.360> like<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.600> charm<00:03:01.920> or

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
undisturbed this works like a charm or

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.890 
undisturbed this works like a charm or
do<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.280> direct<00:03:03.490> painter<00:03:04.030> set<00:03:04.270> from<00:03:04.450> us<00:03:04.660> and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
do you direct painter set from us and

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.140 
do you direct painter set from us and
you<00:03:05.170> will<00:03:05.320> be<00:03:05.380> amazed<00:03:05.920> at<00:03:06.190> how<00:03:06.250> much<00:03:06.550> time<00:03:06.880> you

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
you will be amazed at how much time you
