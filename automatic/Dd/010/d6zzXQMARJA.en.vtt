pushing it in the right direction just

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.050 
pushing it in the right direction just
making<00:01:39.830> sure<00:01:39.980> he<00:01:40.100> enhanced<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:40.790> skill

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
rather than pushing to the point where

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.210 
rather than pushing to the point where
he<00:01:43.520> has<00:01:43.610> a<00:01:43.640> spin<00:01:44.090> or<00:01:44.950> potentially<00:01:45.950> has<00:01:46.100> an

incident mining for Moreno this year he

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.120 
incident mining for Moreno this year he
hasn't<00:01:49.790> been<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.570> greatest<00:01:50.600> as<00:01:51.260> is<00:01:51.530> just<00:01:51.980> a
