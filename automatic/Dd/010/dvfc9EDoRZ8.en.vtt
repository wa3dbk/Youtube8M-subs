00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.560

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.060
 I'll leave in the description of the video 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.060
 we download everything 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.290
 and we will see 17 files which 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.290
 we will have to extract 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.850
 already extracted this folder will appear 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.150
 with the name of 'the flight 2 we do 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.700
 click 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.620
 and as you will see, no other 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.660
 program to put it to work as 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.000
 the one of amÃ³n tools for example only you enter 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.000
 to the file folder loud would play x 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.800
 of good there are some problems with this 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.050
 game and sometimes you have to delete and return 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.450
 to install 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.560
 well i do this they just go to the folder 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.840
 know and copy everything 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.899
 and save it in another folder that is not 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.300
 that or on the desk they return it to 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.700
 extract 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.710

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.620
