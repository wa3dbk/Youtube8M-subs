00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
there just right there which is going to

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.800 
there just right there which is going to
level<00:03:47.010> your<00:03:47.190> board<00:03:47.220> up<00:03:47.639> better<00:03:47.940> then<00:03:48.660> you'll

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
level your board up better then you'll

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.240 
level your board up better then you'll
be<00:03:48.930> able<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.169> catch<00:03:49.349> it<00:03:49.530> with<00:03:49.590> your<00:03:49.650> back<00:03:49.950> foot

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
be able to catch it with your back foot

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.030 
be able to catch it with your back foot
and<00:03:50.280> land<00:03:50.900> if<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:51.959> notice<00:03:52.440> when<00:03:52.590> your<00:03:52.799> board

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
and land if you notice when your board

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.689 
and land if you notice when your board
is<00:03:53.190> spinning<00:03:53.579> in<00:03:53.669> the<00:03:53.790> air<00:03:53.819> it's<00:03:54.479> kind<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.900> at<00:03:55.169> a

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
is spinning in the air it's kind of at a

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.640 
is spinning in the air it's kind of at a
45<00:03:56.699> degree<00:03:56.880> angle<00:03:57.320> which<00:03:58.320> shows<00:03:58.560> me<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.949> your

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
45 degree angle which shows me that your

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.259 
45 degree angle which shows me that your
foot<00:03:59.799> is<00:03:59.920> not<00:04:00.099> flicking<00:04:00.489> out<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.939> front

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
foot is not flicking out the front

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.119 
foot is not flicking out the front
enough<00:04:01.599> which<00:04:01.989> is<00:04:02.140> gonna<00:04:02.260> cause<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:02.890> level

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
enough which is gonna cause it to level

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.990 
enough which is gonna cause it to level
out<00:04:03.370> better

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
out better

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.929 
out better
so<00:04:04.569> it's<00:04:04.720> this<00:04:04.900> motion<00:04:05.409> right<00:04:05.670> there

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
so it's this motion right there

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.000 
so it's this motion right there
that<00:04:07.659> levels<00:04:07.989> out<00:04:08.079> my<00:04:08.260> board<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:08.709> see<00:04:08.739> how

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
that levels out my board you see how

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.699 
that levels out my board you see how
it's<00:04:09.159> nice<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.579> flat<00:04:09.959> then<00:04:10.959> my<00:04:11.110> back<00:04:11.319> foot<00:04:11.590> is

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
it's nice and flat then my back foot is

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:12.479 
it's nice and flat then my back foot is
right<00:04:11.980> there

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
right there

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.229 
right there
so<00:04:13.180> yeah<00:04:13.689> that<00:04:13.930> one<00:04:14.110> that<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.409> landed<00:04:14.799> on

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
so yeah that one that you landed on
