battlefield<00:00:04.830> 4<00:00:05.310> surround<00:00:05.759> video<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.210> usually

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
battlefield 4 surround video I usually

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.270 
battlefield 4 surround video I usually
don't<00:00:06.810> do<00:00:06.990> more<00:00:07.319> than<00:00:07.470> one<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.740> these<00:00:07.890> but<00:00:08.250> I

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
don't do more than one of these but I

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.160 
don't do more than one of these but I
decided<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.880> do<00:00:09.000> another<00:00:09.210> one<00:00:09.420> where<00:00:10.050> I'm

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
decided to do another one where I'm

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.600 
decided to do another one where I'm
actually<00:00:10.380> playing<00:00:10.679> on<00:00:10.830> ultra<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.490> I'm

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
actually playing on ultra and I'm

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.640 
actually playing on ultra and I'm
getting<00:00:12.120> an<00:00:12.240> average<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.960> thirty<00:00:13.349> eight

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
getting an average of thirty eight

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.250 
getting an average of thirty eight
frames<00:00:14.040> per<00:00:14.429> second<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.780> guys<00:00:15.929> may<00:00:16.139> have

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
frames per second you guys may have

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.680 
frames per second you guys may have
remembered<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:17.550> my<00:00:17.699> last<00:00:17.910> video<00:00:18.180> I

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
remembered that in my last video I

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
remembered that in my last video I
mentioned<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.529> was<00:00:19.590> getting<00:00:20.010> frame<00:00:20.820> rates

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
mentioned that I was getting frame rates

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.509 
mentioned that I was getting frame rates
as<00:00:21.210> low<00:00:21.240> as<00:00:21.539> 20<00:00:21.930> frames<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.350> second<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:22.920> average

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
as low as 20 frames a second on average

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.700 
as low as 20 frames a second on average
at<00:00:23.699> Ultra<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.510> think<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.080> was<00:00:25.140> even<00:00:25.320> lower<00:00:25.560> than

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
at Ultra I think it was even lower than

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.679 
at Ultra I think it was even lower than
that<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.279> some<00:00:26.730> points<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.359> different

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that at some points in different

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.050 
that at some points in different
benchmarks<00:00:27.869> I've<00:00:28.349> done<00:00:28.609> and<00:00:29.609> someone

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
benchmarks I've done and someone

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.380 
benchmarks I've done and someone
commented<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.900> he<00:00:31.349> mentioned<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.390> should

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
commented and he mentioned that I should

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.360 
commented and he mentioned that I should
be<00:00:33.510> updated<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> latest<00:00:34.350> driver<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.340> I

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
be updated to the latest driver so I

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.160 
be updated to the latest driver so I
took<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.790> time<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.450> go<00:00:36.570> ahead<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.989> update

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
took the time out to go ahead and update

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
took the time out to go ahead and update
to<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> latest<00:00:37.620> driver<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:39.120> hate<00:00:39.300> frame

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
to the latest driver and my hate frame

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.310 
to the latest driver and my hate frame
rate<00:00:39.840> actually<00:00:40.050> dropped<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.510> dropped<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
rate actually dropped it dropped and the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.850 
rate actually dropped it dropped and the
reason<00:00:43.680> why<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.890> dropped<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.850> mainly<00:00:45.450> because

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
reason why it dropped is mainly because

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.160 
reason why it dropped is mainly because
of<00:00:46.860> something<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.550> do<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> fact<00:00:48.600> that

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
of something to do with the fact that

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.150 
of something to do with the fact that
the<00:00:49.649> latest<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.579> greatest<00:00:51.180> beta<00:00:52.140> drivers<00:00:52.829> are

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the latest and greatest beta drivers are

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.600 
the latest and greatest beta drivers are
optimized<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.719> game<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.129> latest

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
optimized for this game but the latest

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.139 
optimized for this game but the latest
drivers<00:00:57.210> from<00:00:57.989> nvidia<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.859> worse<00:00:59.670> for<00:01:00.030> this

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
drivers from nvidia are worse for this

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.180 
drivers from nvidia are worse for this
game<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> don't<00:01:00.660> know<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.739> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
game I don't know what it is but I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.789 
game I don't know what it is but I
basically<00:01:02.789> draw<00:01:03.229> basically<00:01:04.229> updated<00:01:04.680> my

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
basically draw basically updated my

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.700 
basically draw basically updated my
drivers<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> beta<00:01:06.200> drivers<00:01:07.200> which<00:01:07.439> are

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
drivers to the beta drivers which are

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.570 
drivers to the beta drivers which are
called<00:01:08.159> V<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.650> one<00:01:10.650> second<00:01:11.100> i'm<00:01:11.189> trying<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
called V on one second i'm trying to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.320 
called V on one second i'm trying to
find<00:01:11.820> them<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.570> 30<00:01:12.990> 31<00:01:13.799> their<00:01:14.490> 331

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
guys were having problems like I was

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.999 
guys were having problems like I was
with<00:01:21.420> your<00:01:21.509> frame<00:01:21.750> rate<00:01:21.780> go<00:01:22.470> ahead<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.890> update

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
with your frame rate go ahead and update

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.399 
with your frame rate go ahead and update
to<00:01:23.310> these<00:01:23.460> latest<00:01:23.790> beta<00:01:24.030> drivers<00:01:24.630> you're

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to these latest beta drivers you're

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
to these latest beta drivers you're
going<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.740> any<00:01:25.890> significant<00:01:26.520> bump<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.090> I

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
going to see any significant bump so I

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.670 
going to see any significant bump so I
got<00:01:27.450> some<00:01:27.600> specs<00:01:27.930> here<00:01:28.020> you're<00:01:28.320> watching<00:01:28.590> me

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
got some specs here you're watching me

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.469 
got some specs here you're watching me
play<00:01:28.799> an<00:01:28.890> ultra<00:01:29.220> right<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:29.520> you'll<00:01:30.060> see<00:01:30.270> some

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
play an ultra right now you'll see some

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.969 
play an ultra right now you'll see some
weird<00:01:30.689> jittering<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.350> stuttering<00:01:31.770> it's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
weird jittering and stuttering it's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.700 
weird jittering and stuttering it's
mainly<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.960> two<00:01:33.960> things<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.560> it's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
mainly because of two things one it's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.289 
mainly because of two things one it's
because<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.100> graphics<00:01:35.729> cards<00:01:36.090> weren't

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
because my graphics cards weren't

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.789 
because my graphics cards weren't
configured<00:01:36.869> perfectly<00:01:37.409> i<00:01:37.439> should<00:01:37.710> have

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
configured perfectly i should have

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.730 
configured perfectly i should have
overclocked<00:01:38.340> them<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.960> varied<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.560> their

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
overclocked them and and varied up their

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.020 
overclocked them and and varied up their
speeds<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.159> bit<00:01:41.400> better<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.939> they

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
speeds a little bit better so they

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.510 
speeds a little bit better so they
wouldn't<00:01:42.240> micro<00:01:42.750> stutter<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.229> much<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
wouldn't micro stutter as much and the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
wouldn't micro stutter as much and the
other<00:01:44.729> thing<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.439> course<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
other thing is that this is of course a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
other thing is that this is of course a
beta<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.549> not<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.000> perfect<00:01:48.200> but

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
beta so it's not going to be perfect but

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.020 
beta so it's not going to be perfect but
consistently<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.280> ultra<00:01:51.060> i<00:01:51.270> am<00:01:51.450> getting<00:01:51.659> a

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
consistently on ultra i am getting a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.080 
consistently on ultra i am getting a
maximum<00:01:54.030> frames<00:01:54.270> per<00:01:54.509> second<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.960> 51<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.850> feels

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
maximum frames per second of 51 it feels

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.950 
maximum frames per second of 51 it feels
more<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.420> 45<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> average<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.520> 38<00:02:00.210> so

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
more like 45 but the average is 38 so

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.420 
more like 45 but the average is 38 so
obviously<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.829> frame<00:02:02.009> rates<00:02:02.189> are<00:02:02.310> extremely

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
obviously the frame rates are extremely

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.580 
obviously the frame rates are extremely
good<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.600> lowest<00:02:03.930> frame<00:02:04.140> rate<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.409> going<00:02:04.469> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
good the lowest frame rate is going to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.410 
good the lowest frame rate is going to
be<00:02:04.680> quite<00:02:04.920> shocking<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:05.729> i<00:02:05.790> believe<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.270> is

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
be quite shocking but i believe this is

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
be quite shocking but i believe this is
probably<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.899> hiccup<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.409> system<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:08.039> says

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
probably a hiccup in the system it says

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.699 
probably a hiccup in the system it says
the<00:02:08.489> lowest<00:02:08.789> frame<00:02:09.030> rate<00:02:09.209> was<00:02:09.360> 14<00:02:09.929> which<00:02:10.590> is

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
the lowest frame rate was 14 which is

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.470 
the lowest frame rate was 14 which is
inconsistent<00:02:11.489> with<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> rest<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.970> my<00:02:12.060> results

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
inconsistent with the rest of my results

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.970 
inconsistent with the rest of my results
I<00:02:12.599> think<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.959> lowest<00:02:13.230> frame<00:02:13.530> rate<00:02:13.680> was

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
I think the lowest frame rate was

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.600 
I think the lowest frame rate was
around<00:02:14.310> 25<00:02:14.940> frames<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.450> second<00:02:15.810> consistently

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
around 25 frames a second consistently

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.649 
around 25 frames a second consistently
there's<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.670> lot<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.819> micro<00:02:18.150> study<00:02:18.390> though

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
there's a lot of micro study though

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.630 
there's a lot of micro study though
you'll<00:02:19.230> notice<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:19.950> gameplay<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.519> you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
you'll notice in this gameplay as you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.330 
you'll notice in this gameplay as you
watch<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:21.030> actually<00:02:21.769> by<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.830> way<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.190> guys

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
watch it actually by the way if you guys

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.720 
watch it actually by the way if you guys
like<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:23.640> setup<00:02:24.450> for<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.780> surround

with this type of setup you probably

I'm<00:03:41.700> doing<00:03:41.940> right<00:03:41.970> now<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.540> last<00:03:43.349> but<00:03:43.530> not

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
I'm doing right now and last but not

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.909 
I'm doing right now and last but not
least<00:03:44.389> the<00:03:45.389> low<00:03:45.780> settings<00:03:46.319> well<00:03:46.650> you're<00:03:46.829> not

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
least the low settings well you're not

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.890 
least the low settings well you're not
going<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:47.160> benefit<00:03:47.459> too<00:03:47.669> much<00:03:47.849> you<00:03:48.060> get<00:03:48.209> 50<00:03:48.720> on

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
going to benefit too much you get 50 on

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.089 
going to benefit too much you get 50 on
average<00:03:49.290> 64<00:03:50.040> high<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.579> 39<00:03:51.419> low<00:03:51.950> basically<00:03:52.950> you

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
average 64 high and 39 low basically you

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.940 
average 64 high and 39 low basically you
get<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.280> higher<00:03:53.579> low<00:03:54.079> rates<00:03:55.079> so<00:03:55.560> if<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:55.859> don't

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
get a higher low rates so if you don't

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.650 
get a higher low rates so if you don't
want<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.190> drop<00:03:56.370> down<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.760> 30<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.269> often

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
want to drop down the 30 that often

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.930 
want to drop down the 30 that often
which<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:57.959> really<00:03:58.560> stupid<00:03:58.980> because<00:03:59.310> 30<00:03:59.639> isn't

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
which is really stupid because 30 isn't

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.330 
which is really stupid because 30 isn't
that<00:04:00.030> bad<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.359> a<00:04:00.419> drop<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:01.680> can<00:04:01.799> drop<00:04:01.980> down<00:04:02.190> to

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
that bad of a drop you can drop down to

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.789 
that bad of a drop you can drop down to
40<00:04:02.700> instead<00:04:02.819> if<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.750> go<00:04:03.840> down<00:04:03.900> below<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
40 instead if you go down below and the

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.470 
40 instead if you go down below and the
average<00:04:05.190> is<00:04:05.340> about<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.730> same<00:04:05.910> it's<00:04:06.120> about<00:04:06.239> 50

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
average is about the same it's about 50

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.379 
average is about the same it's about 50
so<00:04:07.290> my<00:04:08.099> conclusion<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.790> if<00:04:09.120> you're<00:04:09.269> going

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
so my conclusion is that if you're going

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.059 
so my conclusion is that if you're going
to<00:04:09.450> ever<00:04:09.750> just<00:04:10.199> you<00:04:10.319> know<00:04:10.410> have<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.650> good<00:04:10.889> time

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
to ever just you know have a good time

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.280 
to ever just you know have a good time
with<00:04:11.310> dual<00:04:11.459> six<00:04:11.730> 70s<00:04:12.150> or<00:04:12.269> higher<00:04:12.419> and<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:13.169> just

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
with dual six 70s or higher and you just

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.860 
with dual six 70s or higher and you just
want<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.620> sit<00:04:14.250> back<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.489> enjoy<00:04:14.669> surround<00:04:15.269> go

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
want to sit back and enjoy surround go

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.420 
want to sit back and enjoy surround go
with<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.199> ultra<00:04:16.709> settings<00:04:16.919> you're<00:04:17.250> going<00:04:17.370> to
