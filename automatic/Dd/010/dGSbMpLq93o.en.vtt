effects<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.800> it's<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
effects and all that and it's going to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.970 
effects and all that and it's going to
look<00:00:44.250> weird<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.480> james<00:00:46.320> marsters<00:00:46.620> is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
look weird because james marsters is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.150 
look weird because james marsters is
probably<00:00:47.700> about<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.180> height<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:49.160> 510

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
probably about my height you know 510

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.990 
probably about my height you know 510
511<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.770> think<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.760> gonna<00:00:53.940> be

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
511 and so I don't think it's gonna be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.869 
511 and so I don't think it's gonna be
great<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.899> he<00:00:55.410> watches<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.129> show<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.670> he

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
great but he watches the show and he

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.910 
great but he watches the show and he
reads<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.149> mind<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.600> he's<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> huge<00:00:58.350> fan<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
reads the mind get he's a huge fan of it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.700 
reads the mind get he's a huge fan of it
so<00:00:59.489> that's<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.850> only<00:00:59.940> hope<00:01:00.449> i<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.840> because
