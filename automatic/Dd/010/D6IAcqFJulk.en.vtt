00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.560
 hello friends writers in this case 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.740
 delivered as prisoners because then for 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.259
 Acp for our iphone ipod or ipad in 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.409
 what is ours killed the great amount 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:22.210
 in which person is this a very important 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:24.909
 we will need it if there are three things that 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.480
 they are extremely important but 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:31.869
 you are berduc that's what I'm going to leave here 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.130
 the download link that this downloads 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.410
 decompress now 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.440
 the third is 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.660
 observe having those three directions that 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.940
 I is for iphone / ipod why will 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.640
 fall into the description so that those who 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.329
 come from the mega link here 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.019
 they are and this is what they download 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.969
 and the others now we will need is a 13 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.170
 we would do it 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.170
 let's hope he finishes loading 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.980
 we give you to search and we search open ssh you 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.990
 We give to install 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.060
 this would be the three steps we will need 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.350
 since we proceed to edit our logo 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.060
 as always in photoshop we can open 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.000
 let's laugh we look for what it is to be 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.440
 bilingual with each of the children as 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.370
 this as ok and let's go to put our 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.150
 then place 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.030
 and also on the desktop in PNG we 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.620
 we approach for you to see that there is a 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.580
 little pixelated we chip away 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.580
 we leave it out there 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.150
 Carlos Center 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.320
 if we are going to overcome all we keep as 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.320
 in png 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.850
 let's save 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.420
 okay 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.720
 we'll see 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.060
 cyclist people with the other two 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.060
 directions we do the same 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.890
 this to not be the same step of 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.740
 place them we put them 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.910
 place we take the first one that already 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.569
 We did like this 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.569
 let's save 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.340
 saves does not want to know how to be the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.410
 next ok 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.410
 we repeat the same placed 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.740
 so that we have ours 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.290
 8 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.510
 do not 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.510
 we are going to be hard for 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.639
 connect via ftp our connection 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:08.440
 wifi that we have here 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:14.500

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.640
 we are going to connect we will open type 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.299
 we go to the first one and look for what 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.299
 that the book 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.620

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.960
