within<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> map<00:01:27.509> pack<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> first<00:01:28.200> one

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
within the map pack so the first one

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.620 
within the map pack so the first one
hears<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.799> crossfire<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
hears of crossfire this is one of the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
hears of crossfire this is one of the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
original called for maps of course and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760 
original called for maps of course and
now<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.840> trying<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.560> had

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
now I was trying to think if this had

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.109 
now I was trying to think if this had
been<00:01:34.799> faked<00:01:35.310> how<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.820> they<00:01:35.939> go<00:01:36.090> about

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
been faked how would they go about

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
been faked how would they go about
taking<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.900> images<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.439> either<00:01:37.619> they<00:01:37.829> would

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
taking the images now either they would

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560 
taking the images now either they would
have<00:01:38.040> made<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> images<00:01:39.060> completely

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
have made up the images completely

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.530 
have made up the images completely
themselves<00:01:40.079> from<00:01:40.229> some<00:01:40.650> sort<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> 3d<00:01:41.540> package

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
themselves from some sort of 3d package

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.179 
themselves from some sort of 3d package
that<00:01:42.869> where<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.079> could<00:01:43.229> bring<00:01:43.799> all<00:01:44.040> the

that where they could bring all the
items<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> create<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.570> image<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:46.380> there

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
items in and create this image up there

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
items in and create this image up there
like<00:01:46.799> themselves<00:01:46.979> completely<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:48.360> they've

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
like themselves completely all they've

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.690 
like themselves completely all they've
gone<00:01:48.750> into<00:01:49.229> game<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.860> actually<00:01:50.100> screenshot

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
gone into game and actually screenshot

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.940 
gone into game and actually screenshot
of<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.659> went<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> cod<00:01:52.530> 4<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
of it so I went on to cod 4 on the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.740 
of it so I went on to cod 4 on the
console<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.700> images<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.299> didn't<00:01:54.600> match

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
console and the images just didn't match

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.240 
console and the images just didn't match
up<00:01:54.780> properly<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.380> i<00:01:55.560> assume<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.070> took

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
up properly so i assume that they took

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.209 
up properly so i assume that they took
the<00:01:56.430> images<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.479> pc<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:58.619> I'm<00:01:58.740> PC<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.159> can

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the images on pc because I'm PC you can

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.889 
the images on pc because I'm PC you can
then<00:01:59.490> adjust<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.210> look<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.450> little<00:02:00.540> bit<00:02:00.659> more

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
then adjust to look a little bit more

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.569 
then adjust to look a little bit more
you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.049> zoom<00:02:01.649> out<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.890> little<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.310> more<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
you can zoom out a little bit more of

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.859 
you can zoom out a little bit more of
your<00:02:02.640> field<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.060> view<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.420> what<00:02:03.509> I've<00:02:03.689> done<00:02:03.719> is

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
your field of view so what I've done is

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.770 
your field of view so what I've done is
I've<00:02:04.049> jumped<00:02:04.320> into<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> pc<00:02:05.159> version<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.600> what

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
I've jumped into the pc version and what

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.440 
I've jumped into the pc version and what
you<00:02:06.869> Mabel<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.259> here<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.469> flick<00:02:07.740> between<00:02:08.450> /

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
you Mabel to do here is flick between /

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.809 
you Mabel to do here is flick between /
timing<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> video<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:11.400> compare<00:02:11.790> it

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
timing on the video so can compare it

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.250 
timing on the video so can compare it
for<00:02:11.970> yourself<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.720> then<00:02:12.900> go<00:02:13.110> into

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
for yourself but if we then go into

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.900 
for yourself but if we then go into
image<00:02:13.500> I've

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
image I've

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.180 
image I've
taken<00:02:14.300> from<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.140> pc<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.530> almost<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:15.980> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
taken from the pc and almost like the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.360 
taken from the pc and almost like the
identical<00:02:16.970> position<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:18.020> image<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.590> pretty

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
identical position the image is pretty

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.070 
identical position the image is pretty
much<00:02:19.640> exactly<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.630> same<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.930> only

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
much exactly the same the only

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.170 
much exactly the same the only
difference<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.920> could<00:02:22.100> spot<00:02:22.310> was<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.520> bomb<00:02:22.850> the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
difference I could spot was a bomb the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.480 
difference I could spot was a bomb the
term<00:02:23.450> with<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> bomb<00:02:24.320> plant<00:02:24.590> area<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:25.100> next<00:02:25.400> to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
term with a bomb plant area just next to

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.040 
term with a bomb plant area just next to
the<00:02:25.520> bus<00:02:25.760> on<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:25.970> left<00:02:26.180> hand<00:02:26.390> side<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.960> the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
the bus on the left hand side and the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.810 
the bus on the left hand side and the
fact<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.350> my<00:02:27.530> camera<00:02:27.980> angles<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.340> little<00:02:28.700> off

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
fact that my camera angles a little off

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.910 
fact that my camera angles a little off
compared<00:02:29.210> to<00:02:29.330> theirs<00:02:29.540> but<00:02:30.140> apart<00:02:30.560> from<00:02:30.740> that

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
compared to theirs but apart from that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.580 
compared to theirs but apart from that
the<00:02:31.280> images<00:02:31.640> are<00:02:31.850> pretty<00:02:32.270> much<00:02:32.570> identical<00:02:32.870> so

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
the images are pretty much identical so

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.130 
the images are pretty much identical so
it<00:02:33.680> looks<00:02:33.890> like<00:02:34.240> at<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.420> moment<00:02:35.840> from<00:02:35.990> what

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
it looks like at the moment from what

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.230 
it looks like at the moment from what
I've<00:02:36.290> gotten<00:02:36.770> information<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.460> it<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.790> kind

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
I've gotten information that it is kind

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.550 
I've gotten information that it is kind
of<00:02:38.300> fake<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.750> someone<00:02:38.990> just<00:02:39.050> put<00:02:39.380> this

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
of fake and someone just put this

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.800 
of fake and someone just put this
together<00:02:39.850> but<00:02:40.850> that's<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.180> first<00:02:41.420> image<00:02:41.690> we

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
together but that's the first image we

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.050 
together but that's the first image we
have<00:02:41.990> here<00:02:42.230> from<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.040> room<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.340> map<00:02:43.490> pack<00:02:43.700> and

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
have here from the room and map pack and

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.880 
have here from the room and map pack and
then<00:02:44.240> we<00:02:44.330> go<00:02:44.390> on<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.540> shipment<00:02:44.930> now<00:02:45.740> this<00:02:45.830> is

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
then we go on to shipment now this is

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.910 
then we go on to shipment now this is
again<00:02:46.250> an<00:02:46.400> interesting<00:02:47.260> because<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.530> images

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
again an interesting because the images

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.860 
again an interesting because the images
with<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.700> image<00:02:49.880> reviews<00:02:50.210> for<00:02:50.420> shipment<00:02:50.720> here

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
with the image reviews for shipment here

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.360 
with the image reviews for shipment here
cannot<00:02:51.320> be<00:02:51.500> found<00:02:51.710> within<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.190> original

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
cannot be found within the original

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.740 
cannot be found within the original
shipment<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:52.970> then<00:02:53.090> again<00:02:53.300> I've<00:02:53.390> gone<00:02:53.480> on<00:02:53.600> to

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
shipment and then again I've gone on to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.770 
shipment and then again I've gone on to
pc<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.230> try<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.500> take<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:55.070> screenshot<00:02:55.880> from<00:02:56.540> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
pc and try to take a screenshot from the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.930 
pc and try to take a screenshot from the
game<00:02:56.960> in<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.770> similar<00:02:58.070> position<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.760> just

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
game in a similar position and you just

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.910 
game in a similar position and you just
you<00:02:59.120> can't<00:02:59.150> physically<00:02:59.870> find<00:03:00.170> this<00:03:00.440> spot<00:03:00.770> on

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
you can't physically find this spot on

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.770 
you can't physically find this spot on
the<00:03:01.040> map<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:02.000> what<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.180> reckon<00:03:02.540> they've<00:03:02.630> done

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
the map and what I reckon they've done

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.830 
the map and what I reckon they've done
here<00:03:03.020> is<00:03:03.080> they've<00:03:03.230> built<00:03:03.500> up<00:03:03.710> this<00:03:03.980> from<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:05.150> 3d

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
here is they've built up this from a 3d

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.990 
here is they've built up this from a 3d
software<00:03:06.290> package<00:03:07.010> or<00:03:07.160> taking<00:03:07.490> images<00:03:07.640> from

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
software package or taking images from

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.490 
software package or taking images from
cod4<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.600> throwing<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:08.960> together<00:03:09.080> somehow

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
cod4 and throwing it together somehow

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.500 
cod4 and throwing it together somehow
very<00:03:10.250> well<00:03:10.400> done<00:03:10.550> i'm<00:03:10.700> not<00:03:10.910> going<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.060> lie<00:03:11.210> and

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
very well done i'm not going to lie and

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.290 
very well done i'm not going to lie and
you<00:03:12.320> can<00:03:12.440> see<00:03:12.590> they've<00:03:12.770> got<00:03:12.980> 1337<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.120> left

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
you can see they've got 1337 on the left

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.920 
you can see they've got 1337 on the left
hand<00:03:14.510> side<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.880> just<00:03:17.240> doesn't<00:03:17.510> add<00:03:17.600> up<00:03:17.660> and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
hand side and it just doesn't add up and

hand side and it just doesn't add up and
if<00:03:18.020> we<00:03:18.110> jump<00:03:18.380> then<00:03:18.560> into<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:18.860> photos<00:03:19.280> that

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
if we jump then into the photos that

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.210 
if we jump then into the photos that
I've<00:03:19.640> put<00:03:20.240> together<00:03:20.390> here<00:03:20.780> with<00:03:21.020> two<00:03:21.320> possible

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
I've put together here with two possible

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.580 
I've put together here with two possible
spots<00:03:22.550> it<00:03:22.700> could<00:03:22.850> have<00:03:22.940> been<00:03:23.000> taken<00:03:23.209> from<00:03:23.690> in

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
spots it could have been taken from in

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.740 
spots it could have been taken from in
the<00:03:24.890> pc<00:03:25.370> version<00:03:25.400> if<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:25.970> had<00:03:26.150> been<00:03:26.180> faked<00:03:26.570> you

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
the pc version if it had been faked you

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.560 
the pc version if it had been faked you
just<00:03:26.930> can't<00:03:27.170> find<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.300> which<00:03:29.300> could<00:03:29.540> then

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
just can't find it and which could then

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.000 
just can't find it and which could then
suggest<00:03:30.050> that<00:03:30.110> this<00:03:30.200> is<00:03:30.350> real<00:03:30.530> when<00:03:30.740> this<00:03:30.830> is<00:03:30.980> a

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
suggest that this is real when this is a

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.460 
suggest that this is real when this is a
sort<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.400> revamped<00:03:31.910> version<00:03:32.090> of<00:03:32.570> shipment<00:03:32.959> who

sort of revamped version of shipment who

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.220 
sort of revamped version of shipment who

it<00:04:11.270> was<00:04:11.390> physically<00:04:11.810> impossible<00:04:11.840> for<00:04:12.380> me<00:04:12.590> to

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
it was physically impossible for me to

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.620 
it was physically impossible for me to

Pro crossing with this with the leaked

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.920 
Pro crossing with this with the leaked
image<00:04:18.380> so<00:04:19.280> this<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:19.940> definitely<00:04:20.209> either<00:04:20.690> been

and this one here was fairly easy to

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.780
