00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
angled in the same direction about 45

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.439 
angled in the same direction about 45
degrees<00:00:15.900> or<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.500> like<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:17.300> so<00:00:18.300> when

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
you're going to jump up on the obstacle

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.220 
you're going to jump up on the obstacle
or<00:00:20.400> whatever<00:00:20.640> you're<00:00:20.910> jumping<00:00:21.180> up<00:00:21.270> onto<00:00:21.600> your

or whatever you're jumping up onto your

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.870 
or whatever you're jumping up onto your
feet<00:00:22.500> want<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.220> position<00:00:23.460> in

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
feet want to be in this position in

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.179 
feet want to be in this position in
midair<00:00:24.119> not<00:00:24.630> after<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.350> land<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
midair not after you land on the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.519 
midair not after you land on the
obstacle<00:00:26.720> make<00:00:27.720> sure<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> nice

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
obstacle make sure you have a nice

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.040 
obstacle make sure you have a nice
groove<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.250> your<00:00:29.400> skates<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> place

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
groove on your skates it's just a place

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.139 
groove on your skates it's just a place
where<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.380> worn<00:00:31.619> down<00:00:31.969> where<00:00:32.969> you're

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
where it's worn down where you're

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.860 
where it's worn down where you're
grinding<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.410> frame<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> sole

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
grinding on the frame and on the sole

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.029 
grinding on the frame and on the sole
like<00:00:36.870> that

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.039 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.110 

when<00:00:41.039> you<00:00:41.129> first<00:00:41.309> start<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.730> should

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
when you first start out you should

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.600 
when you first start out you should
probably<00:00:42.360> try<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.870> come<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.800> obstacle<00:00:44.399> at

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
probably try to come at the obstacle at

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.350 
probably try to come at the obstacle at
a<00:00:44.670> 45<00:00:45.600> degree<00:00:45.780> angle<00:00:46.430> this<00:00:47.430> makes<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> easier

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
a 45 degree angle this makes it easier

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.139 
a 45 degree angle this makes it easier
see<00:00:49.050> you're<00:00:49.230> turning<00:00:49.620> less<00:00:50.219> than<00:00:50.550> coming<00:00:51.030> at

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
see you're turning less than coming at

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.899 
see you're turning less than coming at
it<00:00:51.180> parallel<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.410> easier<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.760> your

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
it parallel it's just easier so your

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.729 
it parallel it's just easier so your
weight<00:00:57.120> should<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:58.050> between<00:00:58.409> your<00:00:58.589> two

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
weight should be right between your two

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.389 
weight should be right between your two
skates

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
skates

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.149 
skates
that's<00:01:00.110> easiest<00:01:01.110> way<00:01:01.229> to<00:01:01.290> balance<00:01:01.559> make<00:01:02.010> sure

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
that's easiest way to balance make sure

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.539 
that's easiest way to balance make sure
you<00:01:02.250> don't<00:01:02.339> slip<00:01:02.729> out<00:01:04.009> between<00:01:05.009> your<00:01:05.280> skates

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
you don't slip out between your skates

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.980 
you don't slip out between your skates
you're<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:05.940> to<00:01:06.000> want<00:01:06.210> about<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> foot<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
you're going to want about a foot and a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.630 
you're going to want about a foot and a
half<00:01:07.020> space<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.799> don't<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.190> give<00:01:08.399> or<00:01:08.430> take

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
half space I don't know give or take

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.600 
half space I don't know give or take
this<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:09.690> happens<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.860> they're<00:01:11.460> too

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
this is what happens when they're too

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.390 
this is what happens when they're too
close<00:01:13.130> sucks

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.200 

same<00:01:21.330> goes<00:01:21.540> when<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:21.870> too<00:01:21.990> far<00:01:22.200> apart<00:01:23.210> you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
same goes when you're too far apart you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.640 
same goes when you're too far apart you
fall<00:01:25.880> there's<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.180> big<00:01:27.630> trick<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.200> doing<00:01:28.500> this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
fall there's one big trick to doing this

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.640 
fall there's one big trick to doing this
and<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.760> do<00:01:30.300> that<00:01:30.510> don't<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.440> that

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and that is to not do that don't do that

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.980 
and that is to not do that don't do that
don't<00:01:32.280> bend<00:01:32.520> at<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.670> ankles<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.300> hurts<00:01:33.540> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
don't bend at the ankles it hurts you

that's that's the big secret that's all
you<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:47.090> that's<00:01:48.090> about<00:01:48.270> all<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.570> need

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you have to do that's about all you need

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.680 
you have to do that's about all you need
to<00:01:48.900> know<00:01:49.050> for<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:50.220> mechanics<00:01:50.760> of<00:01:50.910> it<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.330> not

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
to know for the mechanics of it it's not

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.350 
to know for the mechanics of it it's not
that<00:01:51.900> hard<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.830> takes<00:01:53.190> practice<00:01:53.369> it's

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that hard it just takes practice it's

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.910 
that hard it just takes practice it's
the<00:01:54.450> basis<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.080> lot<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.320> other<00:01:55.410> tricks<00:01:55.770> you

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
the basis for a lot of other tricks you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.490 
the basis for a lot of other tricks you
can<00:01:55.950> throw<00:01:56.220> spins<00:01:56.550> on<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.940> whatever<00:01:57.440> try<00:01:58.440> it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
can throw spins on it whatever try it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:12.610 
can throw spins on it whatever try it
out

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620
