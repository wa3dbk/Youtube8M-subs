extended amount of time with very low

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.690 
extended amount of time with very low
temperatures<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.440> natural<00:03:12.950> progression<00:03:13.160> is

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
temperatures the natural progression is

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.120 
temperatures the natural progression is
to<00:03:13.850> move<00:03:14.030> south<00:03:14.390> because<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.590> body<00:03:15.830> will

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
to move south because the body will

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.390 
to move south because the body will
tolerate<00:03:17.050> your<00:03:18.050> body<00:03:18.350> will<00:03:18.620> adjust<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:19.130> heat

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
tolerate your body will adjust a heat

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.880 
tolerate your body will adjust a heat
it's<00:03:20.180> easy<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.660> strip<00:03:20.930> down<00:03:20.959> than<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.709> to

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
it's easy to strip down than it is to

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.150 
it's easy to strip down than it is to
get<00:03:22.040> warm<00:03:22.340> yeah<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:23.269> that<00:03:23.330> yeah<00:03:23.870> um<00:03:24.160> what's

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
get warm yeah is that yeah um what's

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.150 
get warm yeah is that yeah um what's
third<00:03:25.459> things<00:03:26.140> now<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.560> third<00:03:27.890> thing

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
third things now that is a third thing

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.449 
third things now that is a third thing
no<00:03:28.519> storm<00:03:29.230> yeah<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.560> third<00:03:30.800> thing<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.070> the

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
no storm yeah the third thing is the

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.710 
no storm yeah the third thing is the
climate<00:03:31.940> but<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:33.019> that's<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.620> caveat<00:03:34.070> is

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
climate but that that's the caveat is

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.720 
climate but that that's the caveat is
even<00:03:35.720> though<00:03:35.870> that's<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.410> probe<00:03:36.890> it's<00:03:37.250> also<00:03:37.549> a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
even though that's a probe it's also a

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.660 
even though that's a probe it's also a
con<00:03:38.120> because<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.170> temperatures<00:03:39.680> here<00:03:40.370> in<00:03:40.400> the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
con because the temperatures here in the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.240 
con because the temperatures here in the
valley<00:03:40.880> get<00:03:41.450> as<00:03:41.840> as<00:03:42.470> hot<00:03:42.890> as<00:03:43.100> 118<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.910> 120

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250
