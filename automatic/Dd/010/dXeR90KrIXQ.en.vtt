 Vorarlberg a big throw in Israel 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.380
 egypt by georg friedrich handel a 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.270
 work in which it is not about individual 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.670
 but it's about a whole thing 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:28.040
 folk and that predominate in the factory 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.390
 the choir passages as strong as never before 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.400
 in the history of music 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.110
 in heavy the fly and lice the 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.100
 The gentleman as one of the complaints about 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.100
 brought to Egypt 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.320
 Another suit hail 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.739
 No matter how the weather has been since 2008 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.780
 founding of the choir academy annually 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.660
 a project stands on its feet 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.879
 markus landerer at the lectern 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.739
 at the wiener stephansdom all 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.869
 different the moods of the 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.530
 double choir the orchestra in the ears 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.050
 and hearts of listeners lay one 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.540
 darkness even filled 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.540
 could it be said here in the oratorio text 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.810
 so terrified of the Egyptians the 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.890
 Finally, they are happy that the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.890
 take off Israelites 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.520
 the gentleman threatens the reeds more it becomes 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.520
 laid dry 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.270
 the second part of the oratory is a 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.270
 great song of praise to the power of the Lord 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.450
 sometimes a song of praise sounds whole 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.550
 logically maria erlacher and kathrin 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.830
 auzinger in one of the few you could have 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.830
 The Lord is my strength a song 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.820
 the vorarlberger broker kisters de la 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.850
 Martina also at home in the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.920
 world trade and always work precisely 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.920
 partially contact with historical 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.690
 the great finale of the oratorio the lord 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.159
 shall prevail forever and ever 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.159
 He has triumphed ulreich 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.840
 We enjoyed it very much 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.850
 in the rehearsal phase there were many 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.069
 intensive rehearsals as many as ever 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.709
 so far for this very very large plant 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.230
 and it was an experience for us as 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.180
 choir academy to perform this here 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.569
 Volunteerism of the singers 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.250
 and singer is immense for me so 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.010
 The dog prepares first level 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.560
 get and actually have to do that 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.680
 have already rehearsed themselves 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.739
 and there begins the real work 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.360
 it serves to make music and there it is 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.970
 especially in this work on the 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.290
 very much value 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.510
 the conductor has the language for us 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.140
 really affects the smallest 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.120
 in here partly worked out and 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.400
 but that has also paid off 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.330
 for me as a choir single most beautiful 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.120
 instruments people get together 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.430
 with enthusiasm in a matter of throwing in 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.100
 work and then really in the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.560
 moment of performance give it all 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.840
 and that's why I work so crazy 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.160
 like to do this with this choir and therefore 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.459
 Again and again our audience like that 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.459
 to inspire 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.659
 learn
