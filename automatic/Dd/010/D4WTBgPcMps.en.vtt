00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.859
 friends hi in touch dmitri shablya and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.389
 Today we talk on the topic of habits 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.590
 many people think that they live 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.269
 habits that they manage them they 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.940
 can do it or can not some 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.220
 the action is really just not it 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.010
 so to be precise, the habit lives 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 human habit 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.789
 man governs the habit says that 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.600
 do the person do or do 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.430
 the other is all command habits and what 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.870
 it was a little clearer I will tell one 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.870
 story once one sage 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.120
 Eastern he gathered his pilgrimage 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.640
 caravan and and decided for a year to get away from 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.800
 daily some routine just 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.730
 do some business of your own 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.920
 he was approached by a very famous thief 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.320
 known in his region his city 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.080
 it was a professional in his field and he 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.350
 approached this sage and said take it 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.110
 please tell me yourself that he is well 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.350
 how are you a thief I can not take you 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.259
 knowing what you do and what you do 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.130
 a thief to tell him i just promise you i 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.430
 I will not steal for a whole year 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.009
 just promise to be cultural i promise 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.200
 you just change and do and will 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.460
 do what you tell me who 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.600
 speaks well 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.000
 We go and on the third day there were 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.460
 some difficulties and changes in this 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.070
 caravans and people wake up not seen 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.500
 missing things people woke up others 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.830
 they saw the same missing things only 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.320
 not their own were missing ie they are 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.940
 wake up watching whose flask it is not 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.030
 my flask and those dagger 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.190
 not my dagger and sage immediately understood 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.160
 Generally what's the matter he caused this thief to 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.100
 yourself on the carpet and speaks on land but you 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.280
 promised me you won't do it 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.520
 what I am doing is essentially large 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.890
 I don't do anything like that 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.380
 I shift some to others right away 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.440
 so terrible there is no and by and large 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.570
 I do not break anything 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.490
 First year, it will pass me your skills 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.390
 I don't want to lose, and secondly it's the same 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:37.890
 my bread is my job and I just 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.960
 I do not do anything bad, that is, a habit 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.690
 tell the person what to do 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.640
 if a person smokes that floor habit 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.130
 rules if you smoke habit you 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.650
 rules she just dictates get 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.720
 smoke a cigarette and you have nothing 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.700
 you can do you just obey 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.310
 this habit you pockets get this 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.950
 a cigarette 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.400
 it concerns any action to which 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.489
 a man is used if you eat a lot and you 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.190
 don't need so much just a habit 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.980
 dictates you go in the fridge take 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.260
 what you need and maybe not 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.180
 your graphics of your food and can 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.800
 be it not at all in the plans and maybe 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.019
 this something extra may not be the most 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.000
 useful the less you do it because 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.950
 that habit dictates you to do it 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.690
 and it can be considered any areas 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.570
 life 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.390
