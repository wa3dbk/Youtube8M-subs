00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
or the map or actually know anyone can

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.540 
or the map or actually know anyone can
use<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.889> map<00:04:41.070> because<00:04:41.250> we<00:04:41.340> have<00:04:41.430> like<00:04:41.520> a

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
use the map because we have like a

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.070 
use the map because we have like a
dynamap<00:04:41.970> which<00:04:42.150> I've<00:04:42.270> never<00:04:42.300> used<00:04:42.660> which<00:04:42.930> I've

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
dynamap which I've never used which I've

used<00:04:43.259> after<00:04:44.039> using<00:04:44.190> dynamap<00:04:44.639> it's<00:04:44.820> really

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
used after using dynamap it's really

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.450 
used after using dynamap it's really
cool<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.539> mean<00:04:46.020> it's<00:04:46.199> like<00:04:46.320> google<00:04:46.919> maps<00:04:47.130> for

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460
