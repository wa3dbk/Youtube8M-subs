00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
basically grinding to a halt which lost

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.649 
basically grinding to a halt which lost
flow<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.770> tank<00:01:08.070> aw<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.909> particular<00:01:09.090> one

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
flow the tank aw in this particular one

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.170 
flow the tank aw in this particular one
of<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.619> 75<00:01:11.070> gallons<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.610> kind<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.970> went<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
of my 75 gallons just kind of went to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.929 
of my 75 gallons just kind of went to
pot<00:01:12.420> very<00:01:12.689> quickly<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.310> suggestion<00:01:14.760> was

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
pot very quickly so the suggestion was

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.730 
pot very quickly so the suggestion was
is<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.570> know<00:01:15.689> correct<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.619> get

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
is you know correct it and get

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530 
is you know correct it and get
everything<00:01:16.950> back<00:01:17.189> underway<00:01:17.700> or<00:01:18.030> make<00:01:18.420> an

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
everything back underway or make an

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.600 
everything back underway or make an
experiment<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.530> at<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.770> point<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.369> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
experiment out of it at this point so I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.649 
experiment out of it at this point so I
decided<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.720> time<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.049> experiment<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.659> got

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
decided it's time to experiment so got

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.660 
decided it's time to experiment so got

I'm going to kill the lights in the room
for<00:03:43.950> three<00:03:44.040> days<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:45.230> then<00:03:46.230> I'll<00:03:46.380> turn<00:03:46.410> the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650

as<00:05:35.080> far<00:05:35.680> as<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.889> phosphate<00:05:36.400> goes<00:05:36.639> our<00:05:36.940> next

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
as far as the phosphate goes our next

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.100 
as far as the phosphate goes our next
step<00:05:37.449> is<00:05:37.720> probably<00:05:38.199> to<00:05:38.440> add<00:05:38.590> some<00:05:39.659> gfo<00:05:40.659> back<00:05:40.870> in

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
step is probably to add some gfo back in

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.170 
step is probably to add some gfo back in
and<00:05:41.380> carbon<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:41.860> get<00:05:41.979> this<00:05:42.159> tank<00:05:42.430> fixed<00:05:42.669> thank
