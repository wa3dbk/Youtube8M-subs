00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.710
 hello people we find ourselves on the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.070
 map krine bang a strip like a 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.480
 gang 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.040
 I do not know I'll stop saying the 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.900
 emma's name because that's where it becomes 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.780
 catastrophic I'm trying to 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.100
 destroy all the map names from to w 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.030
 so it's a little tutorial to go 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.100
 under the map in question 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.450
 frankly it's a very simple glitch 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.090
 to achieve but really very very 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.940
 simple it takes the exoplanet and 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.469
 Overclocking is very important so 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.449
 you go up on the fence as I 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.609
 just done at the moment and this is 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.149
 a little more complicated you let yourself 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.940
 fall 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.339
 but go easy and you use 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.540
 the exoplanet as I do to make 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:08.060
 the moment here and we ask ourselves here 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.190
 especially you ask yourself on the wall 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.480
 you see above the grass on 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.780
 the kind of invisible walls above the 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.520
 grass otherwise you fall and then you 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.290
 walk quietly until you 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.020
 get stuck here I do not know 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.520
 go further 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.570
 so we are going to watch together 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:30.710
 if the balls pass through there that does not 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.070
 apparently do not pass there either no 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.240
 more but here on that side the bullets 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.200
 pass perfectly 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.450
 it's beautiful excellent 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.640
 so here are the panels going without worries 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.439
 and you can get out of the glitch without 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.789
 having to jump in the hole so I'm going 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.049
 show you right away how 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.719
 quite quite quite 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.310
 completely completely stupid even for 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.009
 get out his first made a double jump 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.189
 and so that's a little glitch 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.770
 friendly will w if this one has you 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.990
 please leave a comment a 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.629
 sharing is always a pleasure 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.629
 come on ciao and have a good day good evening
