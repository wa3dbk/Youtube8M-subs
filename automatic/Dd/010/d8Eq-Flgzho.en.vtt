00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
we'll get to in a moment and it comes

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.280 
we'll get to in a moment and it comes
with<00:01:45.939> a<00:01:46.030> plastic<00:01:46.180> coffee<00:01:46.600> scoop<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.170> was

with a plastic coffee scoop that was

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.170 
with a plastic coffee scoop that was

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
tablespoon normal copy scoop so I think

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.710 
tablespoon normal copy scoop so I think
I<00:01:51.159> threw<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.369> away

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
I threw it away

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.410 
I threw it away
and<00:01:52.720> that's<00:01:52.960> what<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.260> get<00:01:53.409> and<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:55.119> way<00:01:55.270> that

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
and that's what you get and the way that

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.929 
and that's what you get and the way that
you<00:01:55.540> use<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.229> actually<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.369> subject<00:01:57.729> of

there are a number of people who have

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.149 
there are a number of people who have

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
honest that's not really the way I've

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.970 
honest that's not really the way I've
done<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.430> last<00:02:26.610> eight<00:02:26.850> or<00:02:26.970> nine<00:02:27.120> years

seven or eight years I should say and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.860 
seven or eight years I should say and
and<00:02:32.700> there's<00:02:32.880> some<00:02:33.000> reasons<00:02:33.390> for<00:02:33.510> doing<00:02:33.810> it

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
and there's some reasons for doing it

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.230 
and there's some reasons for doing it
that<00:02:34.020> way<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.800> allows<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:35.100> devolve<00:02:35.730> time<00:02:35.970> or<00:02:36.210> a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
that way it allows a devolve time or a

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.400 
that way it allows a devolve time or a
steeping<00:02:36.600> time<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.140> original

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
steeping time that the original

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.920 
steeping time that the original
instructions<00:02:37.590> didn't<00:02:38.010> call<00:02:38.160> for<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:39.570> other

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
instructions didn't call for the other

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.030 
instructions didn't call for the other
argument<00:02:40.260> I've<00:02:40.320> read<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.770> there's<00:02:40.980> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
argument I've read is that there's a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.910 
argument I've read is that there's a
bloom<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.090> coffee<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.590> don't<00:02:43.800> do

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
bloom of the coffee that if you don't do

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.850 
bloom of the coffee that if you don't do
it<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.040> way<00:02:44.190> you're<00:02:44.730> going<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.990> not<00:02:46.200> to

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
it that way you're going to to not to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.650 
it that way you're going to to not to
not<00:02:47.220> get<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.490> benefit<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:47.850> or<00:02:48.150> or<00:02:48.270> miss<00:02:48.510> some

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
not get the benefit of or or miss some

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.350 
not get the benefit of or or miss some
of<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.810> extraction<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:50.730> be<00:02:50.820> honest<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.270> have

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
of that extraction to be honest I have

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.140 
of that extraction to be honest I have
not<00:02:51.510> found<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.960> to<00:02:52.080> be<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.620> big<00:02:53.310> problem<00:02:53.850> for<00:02:53.880> me

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
not found it to be a big problem for me

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.840 
not found it to be a big problem for me
so<00:02:54.959> I'm<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.380> do<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.700> quick<00:02:56.700> demonstration

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
so I'm going to do a quick demonstration

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.350 
so I'm going to do a quick demonstration
showing<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:58.310> traditional<00:02:59.310> or<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.550> the<00:03:00.120> by

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
showing the traditional or the the by

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.550 
showing the traditional or the the by
the<00:03:00.420> instruction<00:03:00.870> book<00:03:00.990> way<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.230> doing<00:03:01.440> this

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
the instruction book way of doing this

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.220 
the instruction book way of doing this
and<00:03:01.740> I'll<00:03:02.400> talk<00:03:02.550> about<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.820> other<00:03:02.850> all<00:03:03.840> right

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
and I'll talk about the other all right

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.930 
and I'll talk about the other all right
the<00:03:04.560> original<00:03:05.160> way<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.280> making<00:03:05.610> coffee<00:03:05.790> with

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
the original way of making coffee with

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.300 
the original way of making coffee with
the<00:03:06.060> Aeropress<00:03:06.360> would<00:03:07.260> be<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.709> take<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the Aeropress would be to take the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.530 
the Aeropress would be to take the
cylinder<00:03:08.930> put<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> filter<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.950> end<00:03:11.100> cap

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
cylinder put a filter in the end cap

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.199 
cylinder put a filter in the end cap
twist<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.690> on<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.020> bottom<00:03:14.090> put<00:03:15.090> your

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
twist that on to the bottom put your

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.220 
twist that on to the bottom put your
coffee<00:03:15.420> directly<00:03:16.080> into<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.410> cylinder<00:03:16.830> and

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
coffee directly into the cylinder and

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.790 
coffee directly into the cylinder and
I'm<00:03:19.230> going<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.440> do<00:03:20.150> two<00:03:21.260> servings<00:03:22.260> or<00:03:22.410> two<00:03:22.590> cups

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
off the boil to the cylinder so as with

somewhere between a hundred and ninety
hundred<00:03:46.350> ninety<00:03:46.500> five<00:03:46.620> degrees<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:47.760> just<00:03:48.000> a

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
hundred ninety five degrees so just a

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.720 
hundred ninety five degrees so just a
little<00:03:49.440> bit<00:03:49.680> off<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.890> boil<00:03:50.130> thirty<00:03:50.400> seconds

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
little bit off the boil thirty seconds

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.000 
little bit off the boil thirty seconds
off<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.910> boil<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:52.080> pour<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.620> until<00:03:52.950> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
off the boil and you pour this until the

off the boil and you pour this until the
water<00:03:53.220> level<00:03:53.670> is<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:54.750> about<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.620> two<00:03:55.860> mark<00:03:56.190> and

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
water level is it about the two mark and

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.270 
water level is it about the two mark and
then<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.660> start<00:03:57.959> stirring<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.800> stir<00:03:59.070> for

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.830 

and<00:04:10.740> then<00:04:11.740> if<00:04:12.520> you<00:04:12.700> want<00:04:12.880> some<00:04:13.000> dwell<00:04:13.300> time<00:04:13.630> or

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
and then if you want some dwell time or

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.050 
and then if you want some dwell time or
some<00:04:13.960> steeping<00:04:14.410> on<00:04:14.500> this<00:04:14.710> you<00:04:15.670> can<00:04:15.820> go<00:04:15.970> ahead

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
some steeping on this you can go ahead

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.610 
some steeping on this you can go ahead
and<00:04:16.299> put<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:17.470> piston<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.489> and<00:04:19.200> let<00:04:20.200> it<00:04:20.230> seal

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
and put the piston in and let it seal

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.610 
and put the piston in and let it seal
and<00:04:21.400> you'll<00:04:22.000> see<00:04:22.210> that<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:23.050> water<00:04:23.290> really

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
and you'll see that the water really

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.510 
and you'll see that the water really
stops<00:04:24.130> coming<00:04:24.700> through<00:04:25.560> so<00:04:26.560> it'll<00:04:27.040> just<00:04:27.070> sit

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
stops coming through so it'll just sit

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.370 
stops coming through so it'll just sit

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
not seeing any real cream of formation

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.580 
not seeing any real cream of formation
down<00:05:36.910> here<00:05:37.270> either<00:05:37.780> as<00:05:38.050> you'd<00:05:38.169> expect<00:05:38.500> with

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
down here either as you'd expect with

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.520 
down here either as you'd expect with
espresso<00:05:38.910> what<00:05:39.910> it<00:05:40.000> makes<00:05:40.240> is<00:05:40.720> a<00:05:40.930> really

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
espresso what it makes is a really

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.430 
espresso what it makes is a really
strong<00:05:42.360> coffee<00:05:43.360> which<00:05:43.750> is<00:05:43.870> very<00:05:44.110> similar<00:05:44.320> to

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
strong coffee which is very similar to

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.490 
strong coffee which is very similar to
filter<00:05:44.860> coffee<00:05:45.100> in<00:05:45.490> its<00:05:46.060> qualities<00:05:46.570> it's<00:05:47.440> a

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
filter coffee in its qualities it's a

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.570 
filter coffee in its qualities it's a
very<00:05:47.680> clean<00:05:48.010> Cup

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
very clean Cup

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.340 
very clean Cup
it's<00:05:49.120> not<00:05:49.270> a<00:05:49.300> muddy<00:05:49.570> cup<00:05:49.840> like<00:05:50.020> you<00:05:50.110> might<00:05:50.260> get

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
it's not a muddy cup like you might get

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.900 
it's not a muddy cup like you might get
with<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.500> French<00:05:50.800> press<00:05:51.070> or<00:05:51.400> sometimes<00:05:51.850> a

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
with a French press or sometimes a

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.640 
with a French press or sometimes a
Turkish<00:05:52.240> coffee<00:05:52.450> or<00:05:52.870> even<00:05:53.140> with<00:05:53.290> the<00:05:53.380> Moka<00:05:53.620> pot

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
Turkish coffee or even with the Moka pot

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.030 
Turkish coffee or even with the Moka pot
so<00:05:54.550> it's<00:05:54.760> a<00:05:54.850> very<00:05:55.030> very<00:05:55.330> clean<00:05:55.800> the<00:05:56.800> paper

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
so it's a very very clean the paper

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.890 
so it's a very very clean the paper
filter<00:05:57.280> helps<00:05:57.729> to<00:05:57.970> remove<00:05:58.360> some<00:05:58.600> of<00:05:58.660> the

cylinder in you put the coffee in as
it's<00:07:07.180> sitting<00:07:07.450> here<00:07:07.780> right<00:07:07.900> now<00:07:08.110> and<00:07:08.580> then<00:07:09.580> you

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730 
it's sitting here right now and then you

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.930 
it's sitting here right now and then you
fill<00:07:10.000> this<00:07:10.150> with<00:07:10.300> water<00:07:10.740> stir<00:07:11.740> let<00:07:12.460> it<00:07:12.580> steep

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
fill this with water stir let it steep

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.420 
fill this with water stir let it steep
and<00:07:13.270> then<00:07:13.840> put<00:07:14.050> the<00:07:14.170> wet<00:07:14.440> N'Dour<00:07:14.890> moistened

and then put the wet N'Dour moistened

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.800 
and then put the wet N'Dour moistened
filter<00:07:16.060> on<00:07:16.210> and<00:07:16.420> that's<00:07:16.540> kind<00:07:16.690> of<00:07:16.720> an

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
filter on and that's kind of an

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.940 
filter on and that's kind of an
important<00:07:17.170> thing<00:07:17.230> because<00:07:17.440> that<00:07:17.650> gets<00:07:17.770> it<00:07:17.860> to

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:17.950 
important thing because that gets it to

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.920 
important thing because that gets it to
stick<00:07:18.190> to<00:07:18.220> the<00:07:18.400> cap<00:07:18.610> then<00:07:19.300> that<00:07:19.540> would<00:07:19.720> go<00:07:19.900> on

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:19.930 
stick to the cap then that would go on
