in this movie and Patrick and Vera were
very<00:02:19.030> instrumental<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.690> wanting<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.970> be<00:02:22.970> as

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
respectful to the real people as they

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.640 
respectful to the real people as they
could<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.000> same<00:02:26.540> with<00:02:26.569> Ron<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:26.930> Lily<00:02:27.260> as<00:02:27.440> well

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
but I think you know I think it was a

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.650 
but I think you know I think it was a
bit<00:02:33.079> trickier<00:02:33.799> with<00:02:33.980> them<00:02:34.310> with<00:02:34.700> for<00:02:35.299> Patrick

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
bit trickier with them with for Patrick

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.050 
bit trickier with them with for Patrick
and<00:02:35.720> Vera<00:02:35.930> just<00:02:36.139> because<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.859> Warrens<00:02:37.310> have

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060
