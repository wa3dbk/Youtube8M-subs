this disk and the photo transistor will

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.530 
this disk and the photo transistor will
be<00:01:10.090> activated<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:11.650> when<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.530> dark<00:01:14.830> area<00:01:15.540> will

be activated but when the dark area will
be<00:01:16.690> below<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.290> circuit<00:01:18.130> there<00:01:18.970> is<00:01:19.000> no

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
be below the circuit there is no

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.130 
be below the circuit there is no
reflection<00:01:19.540> because<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:23.370> dark<00:01:24.370> color

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
reflection because the the dark color

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.400 
reflection because the the dark color
absorbed<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.290> light<00:01:27.480> okay<00:01:28.480> here<00:01:28.900> I<00:01:28.930> will<00:01:29.380> show

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
absorbed the light okay here I will show

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.090 
absorbed the light okay here I will show
you<00:01:29.620> how<00:01:30.610> it's<00:01:30.790> work<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:32.200> i<00:01:32.230> plug<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.980> STM<00:01:33.550> f4

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
you how it's work can i plug the STM f4

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:44.330 
you how it's work can i plug the STM f4
ok<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:36.760> open<00:01:37.659> this<00:01:39.780> I'm<00:01:40.780> gonna

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.200 

and<00:01:45.340> test<00:01:45.640> this<00:01:45.880> stuff<00:01:47.729> little<00:01:48.729> voltage<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and test this stuff little voltage and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:08.330 
and test this stuff little voltage and
here<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.869> voltage<00:01:56.369> okay<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:59.439> clearly

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.600 

okay<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:11.730> use<00:02:11.970> also<00:02:12.209> for<00:02:13.010> power<00:02:14.010> supply<00:02:14.370> I

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
okay and I use also for power supply I

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.650 
okay and I use also for power supply I
use<00:02:14.900> computer<00:02:15.900> power<00:02:16.140> supply<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.970> let<00:02:18.630> me

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
use computer power supply that let me

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.930 
use computer power supply that let me
have<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.670> ground<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:22.160> twelve<00:02:23.160> voltage<00:02:23.700> and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
have the ground and twelve voltage and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.330 
have the ground and twelve voltage and
five<00:02:24.660> voltage<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:26.310> now<00:02:27.380> let's<00:02:28.380> see<00:02:28.800> how<00:02:29.310> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
five voltage and now let's see how it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.630 
five voltage and now let's see how it
work<00:02:29.640> okay<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:32.989> now<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.650> will<00:02:34.800> try<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.010> run<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
work okay so now we will try to run the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.850 
work okay so now we will try to run the
HDD<00:02:35.940> module<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.410> know<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.739> speed<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
HDD module so to know the speed of the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.640 
HDD module so to know the speed of the
brushless<00:02:40.860> motor<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:42.330> need<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.690> use<00:02:42.900> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
brushless motor and I need to use the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.050 
brushless motor and I need to use the
STM<00:02:44.299> studio<00:02:45.299> is<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.950> real<00:02:47.130> time<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.430> bugger<00:02:47.610> is

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
STM studio is a real time to bugger is

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.620 
STM studio is a real time to bugger is
good<00:02:48.269> one

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
good one

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.120 
good one
designed<00:02:49.019> for<00:02:49.190> STM<00:02:50.720> microcontroller<00:02:51.860> so<00:02:52.860> here

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
designed for STM microcontroller so here

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.729 
designed for STM microcontroller so here
we<00:02:53.250> have<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:54.330> speed<00:02:54.840> rpm<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:57.560> here<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
we have the the speed rpm and here the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.360 
we have the the speed rpm and here the
graph<00:02:59.599> ok<00:03:02.269> now<00:03:03.269> we<00:03:03.390> open<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:04.769> switch<00:03:05.010> off

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
graph ok now we open the switch off

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.809 
graph ok now we open the switch off
switch<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.360> power<00:03:07.260> supply<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.860> now<00:03:08.459> plug

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
switch on the power supply and now plug

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.560 
switch on the power supply and now plug
the<00:03:09.000> USB<00:03:09.450> for<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.560> STM<00:03:11.989> f4<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:14.299> now<00:03:15.299> let's

the USB for the STM f4 and now let's

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.949 
the USB for the STM f4 and now let's
check

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:42.100 

and<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.680> speed

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:53.220 

good<00:03:43.110> thousand<00:03:43.940> fifty<00:03:45.380> now<00:03:46.970> 3,000

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
five hundred hit the graph okay see the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:21.220 
five hundred hit the graph okay see the
speed<00:04:14.810> riding<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.870> him<00:04:18.870> he<00:04:19.380> has<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.890> driver

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
speed riding you and him he has a driver

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:39.180 
speed riding you and him he has a driver
hey<00:04:22.230> didi<00:04:22.620> much<00:04:23.520> brushes<00:04:24.240> matter

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.940 

now<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.820> brushless<00:04:40.480> motor<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:41.230> running<00:04:41.590> at

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
now the brushless motor is running at

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.940 
now the brushless motor is running at
the<00:04:42.400> maximum<00:04:42.910> speed<00:04:44.910> okay<00:04:46.710> now<00:04:47.710> we'll<00:04:47.860> switch

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
the maximum speed okay now we'll switch

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:58.110 
the maximum speed okay now we'll switch
12<00:04:48.250> D<00:04:51.960> we<00:04:52.960> see<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.290> speed<00:04:53.530> is<00:04:54.270> down<00:04:57.120> okay

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
12 D we see the speed is down okay

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.040 
12 D we see the speed is down okay
that's<00:04:58.510> all<00:04:58.750> next<00:04:59.560> time<00:04:59.920> and<00:05:00.130> we<00:05:00.220> try<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:01.050> put

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
that's all next time and we try to put

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.810 
that's all next time and we try to put
this<00:05:02.290> problem<00:05:02.830> I<00:05:04.290> will<00:05:05.290> try<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.650> put<00:05:05.950> in<00:05:06.100> the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
this problem I will try to put in the

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.410 
this problem I will try to put in the
hey<00:05:06.970> GD<00:05:07.210> mother<00:05:07.420> and<00:05:08.290> I<00:05:08.470> will<00:05:08.620> see<00:05:08.890> if<00:05:09.420> the
