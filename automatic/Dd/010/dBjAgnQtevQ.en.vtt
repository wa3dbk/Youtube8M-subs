00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.500 
basically i don't know just talked about
a<00:00:34.380> little<00:00:34.469> conflict<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.219> I'm<00:00:35.280> having<00:00:35.510> for

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
a little conflict that I'm having for

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.110 
a little conflict that I'm having for
when<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.809> at<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> top<00:00:37.230> place<00:00:37.610> for<00:00:38.610> two<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.940> have

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
when we at the top place for two we have

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.660 
when we at the top place for two we have
the<00:00:39.270> name<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> name<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.100> important<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the name and the name is so important to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.450 
the name and the name is so important to
me<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.420> your<00:00:43.079> name<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.320> your<00:00:43.620> identity<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
me because your name is your identity it

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.610 
me because your name is your identity it
matters<00:00:45.030> okay<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.660> matters<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.320> don't<00:00:46.350> just

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
matters okay it matters you don't just

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920 
matters okay it matters you don't just
go<00:00:46.800> around<00:00:46.890> with<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> crap<00:00:47.579> name<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.570> don't<00:00:48.750> do

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
go around with a crap name you don't do

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.510 
go around with a crap name you don't do
that<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.500> name<00:00:49.680> matters<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.160> me<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
that so the name matters to me and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.860 
that so the name matters to me and
what's<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> team<00:00:51.570> right<00:00:51.840> now

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
what's going on with the team right now

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.040 
what's going on with the team right now
is<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.860> initially<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.730> i'm<00:00:54.210> pretty<00:00:54.510> sure<00:00:54.719> was

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
is that initially in i'm pretty sure was

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.010 
is that initially in i'm pretty sure was
representing<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.739> suffix<00:00:56.360> but<00:00:57.360> now<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:57.719> have

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
representing a suffix but now we have

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.569 
representing a suffix but now we have
people<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.410> team<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.160> wouldn't<00:00:59.489> make

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
people on the team that it wouldn't make

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.639 
people on the team that it wouldn't make
much<00:00:59.640> sense<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.359> n<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> be<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.960> suffix<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.500> I

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
much sense for n to be the suffix like I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.799 
much sense for n to be the suffix like I
Scott<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.100> makes<00:01:02.340> no<00:01:02.489> sense<00:01:02.760> cough<00:01:03.210> being<00:01:03.570> that

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
Scott it makes no sense cough being that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.479 
Scott it makes no sense cough being that
name<00:01:03.960> makes<00:01:04.110> no<00:01:04.379> sense<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.769> max<00:01:04.979> Austin<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
name makes no sense of max Austin that

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.840 
name makes no sense of max Austin that
makes<00:01:05.670> no<00:01:06.060> sense<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.229> figured<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:08.640> got<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
makes no sense so I figured we got to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.310 
makes no sense so I figured we got to
replace<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.479> an<00:01:09.570> acronym<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.080> can't<00:01:10.229> be

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
replace and with an acronym it can't be

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
replace and with an acronym it can't be
a<00:01:10.350> suffix<00:01:10.710> anymore<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.280> our<00:01:11.490> team<00:01:11.760> name<00:01:12.000> is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
a suffix anymore and our team name is

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.499 
a suffix anymore and our team name is
the<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.450> factor<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.290> has<00:01:13.530> no<00:01:13.740> meaning<00:01:13.979> so

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
the in factor but in has no meaning so

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.850 
the in factor but in has no meaning so
like<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.780> were<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> ask<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.710> have

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
like if I were to ask you do you have

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.710 
like if I were to ask you do you have
the<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.310> factor<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.939> would<00:01:18.090> never<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.450> able<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the in factor you would never be able to

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.510 
the in factor you would never be able to
answer<00:01:18.780> me<00:01:19.080> because<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.100> factor

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
answer me because what is the in factor

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.510 
answer me because what is the in factor
so<00:01:21.180> that's<00:01:21.420> that's<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:22.220> this<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.400> what

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
so that's that's just what this is what

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
so that's that's just what this is what
this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.850> awful<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.330> need<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> new<00:01:24.689> name<00:01:24.840> I've
