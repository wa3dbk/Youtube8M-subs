generation kindle i can definitely see

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.999 
generation kindle i can definitely see
the<00:05:05.610> difference<00:05:05.879> there<00:05:06.560> obviously<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.650> is<00:05:07.830> e

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
the difference there obviously this is e

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.570 
the difference there obviously this is e
ink<00:05:08.189> this<00:05:08.669> uses<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.120> IPS<00:05:09.569> backlit<00:05:10.110> display<00:05:10.580> go

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
ink this uses the IPS backlit display go

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.770 
ink this uses the IPS backlit display go
and<00:05:11.729> stack<00:05:11.969> these<00:05:12.150> two<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.479> can<00:05:12.629> certainly

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
and stack these two you can certainly

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.010 
and stack these two you can certainly
see<00:05:13.169> there's<00:05:13.409> a<00:05:13.560> within<00:05:14.009> this<00:05:14.159> difference

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
see there's a within this difference

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.809 
see there's a within this difference
it's<00:05:16.020> a<00:05:16.080> whole<00:05:16.229> kindle<00:05:16.650> family<00:05:17.009> here<00:05:17.189> and<00:05:17.310> if

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
it's a whole kindle family here and if

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.700 
it's a whole kindle family here and if
we<00:05:17.939> bring<00:05:18.150> in<00:05:18.300> something<00:05:18.539> like<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.050> ipad<00:05:19.469> 2

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
we bring in something like the ipad 2

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.249 
we bring in something like the ipad 2
for<00:05:19.949> example<00:05:20.389> stack<00:05:21.389> these<00:05:21.599> guys<00:05:21.780> on<00:05:21.960> top<00:05:22.110> of

for example stack these guys on top of
each<00:05:22.319> other<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:23.219> can<00:05:23.460> see<00:05:24.319> what<00:05:25.319> screen
