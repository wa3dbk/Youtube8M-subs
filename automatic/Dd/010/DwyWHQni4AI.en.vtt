the elites and vault of the assassin in

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.029 
the elites and vault of the assassin in
under<00:00:14.370> four<00:00:14.639> minutes<00:00:15.320> so<00:00:16.320> as<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.800> see

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
under four minutes so as you can see

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.820 
under four minutes so as you can see
there<00:00:17.250> my<00:00:17.460> average<00:00:17.699> runtime<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.720> four<00:00:19.439> minutes

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
there my average runtime is four minutes

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.040 
there my average runtime is four minutes
to<00:00:19.949> 4<00:00:20.520> 30<00:00:20.880> seconds<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:23.189> unfortunately<00:00:23.939> i<00:00:24.390> am

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
to 4 30 seconds so unfortunately i am

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.330 
to 4 30 seconds so unfortunately i am
just<00:00:25.859> above<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.449> run<00:00:27.720> i<00:00:27.990> got<00:00:28.380> three

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
just above that but this run i got three

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.889 
just above that but this run i got three
minutes<00:00:29.490> 30<00:00:29.939> seconds<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.800> wasn't<00:00:32.600> it<00:00:33.600> was

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
minutes 30 seconds but it wasn't it was

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.440 
minutes 30 seconds but it wasn't it was
a<00:00:33.930> full<00:00:34.350> clear<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:35.070> somehow<00:00:35.700> i<00:00:35.880> only<00:00:36.270> found

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
a full clear but somehow i only found

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.950 
a full clear but somehow i only found
five<00:00:36.870> elites<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:38.510> unfortunately<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.600> think

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
five elites so unfortunately I think

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.319 
five elites so unfortunately I think
this<00:00:40.079> doesn't<00:00:40.469> count<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.489> should<00:00:42.180> have

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
this doesn't count because I should have

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.299 
this doesn't count because I should have
killed<00:00:42.600> at<00:00:42.809> least<00:00:42.960> three<00:00:43.260> elites<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
killed at least three elites like the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.319 
killed at least three elites like the
original<00:00:44.820> post<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:46.170> diablo<00:00:46.649> 3<00:00:46.920> forums<00:00:47.340> so

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
original post in the diablo 3 forums so

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.180 
original post in the diablo 3 forums so
because<00:00:48.780> i<00:00:48.930> got<00:00:49.079> five<00:00:49.379> kills<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.920> still

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
because i got five kills it still

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
because i got five kills it still
doesn't<00:00:50.550> count<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.120> still<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.989> my

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
doesn't count but still one of my

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.770 
doesn't count but still one of my
fastest<00:00:52.620> front<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.160> whatever<00:00:53.550> i'm<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
fastest front so whatever i'm going to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.650 
fastest front so whatever i'm going to
upload<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.260> anyways<00:00:55.760> just<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.940> share<00:00:57.149> my<00:00:57.360> spec

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
upload it anyways just to share my spec

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.340 
upload it anyways just to share my spec
and<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:59.010> guess<00:00:59.730> kind<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.180> show<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.899> guys<00:01:01.079> what

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and I guess kind of show you guys what

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.729 
and I guess kind of show you guys what
I'm<00:01:01.469> doing<00:01:02.359> of<00:01:03.359> course<00:01:03.660> i'm<00:01:03.870> using<00:01:04.170> spike<00:01:04.470> trap

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
I'm doing of course i'm using spike trap

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.859 
I'm doing of course i'm using spike trap
because<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.250> basically<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> best<00:01:06.570> hands

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
because it's basically the best hands

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.710 
because it's basically the best hands
down<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.439> higher<00:01:07.619> end<00:01:07.950> piece<00:01:08.510> there's<00:01:09.510> really

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
down for higher end piece there's really

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.280 
down for higher end piece there's really
nothing<00:01:09.869> better<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.770> replace<00:01:10.920> spike<00:01:11.580> traps

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
nothing better to replace spike traps

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.289 
nothing better to replace spike traps
but<00:01:13.290> most<00:01:13.560> people<00:01:13.950> actually<00:01:14.130> use<00:01:14.430> bola<00:01:14.909> for

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
but most people actually use bola for

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.300 
but most people actually use bola for
their<00:01:15.420> primary<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.500> reason<00:01:16.860> why<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.009> use

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
their primary the reason why i use

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.289 
their primary the reason why i use
hungry<00:01:17.759> arrows<00:01:18.180> because<00:01:18.479> i'm<00:01:18.930> using<00:01:20.299> shadow

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
hungry arrows because i'm using shadow

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.560 
hungry arrows because i'm using shadow
glide<00:01:21.960> i<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:24.030> shadow<00:01:24.270> power

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
glide i think it is the shadow power

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.870 
glide i think it is the shadow power
wound<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.140> gives<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.650> thirty<00:01:26.250> percent<00:01:26.640> move

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
wound that gives you thirty percent move

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.899 
wound that gives you thirty percent move
speed<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.650> reason<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.100> i<00:01:29.130> need<00:01:29.460> hungry

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
speed and the reason why i need hungry

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.240 
speed and the reason why i need hungry
instead<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.390> bola<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.470> i<00:01:31.500> take<00:01:31.890> way

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
instead of bola is because i take way

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.210 
instead of bola is because i take way
more<00:01:32.280> damage<00:01:33.000> without<00:01:33.180> glue<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.100> since<00:01:35.100> I

more damage without glue and since I

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
most of the three second molar and I did

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
most of the three second molar and I did
try<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.770> three<00:01:56.130> second<00:01:56.550> molar<00:01:56.730> and<00:01:56.940> I<00:01:57.030> got

try the three second molar and I got
owned<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.750> lot<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.150> is<00:02:00.360> kind<00:02:00.690> of<00:02:00.750> like

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
owned a lot so so this is kind of like

if you have better ehb than me bola is

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.760 
if you have better ehb than me bola is
probably<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.820> better<00:02:06.000> way<00:02:06.120> to<00:02:06.300> go<00:02:06.770> speaking

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
probably the better way to go speaking
