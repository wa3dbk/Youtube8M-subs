and if you take a look at the bathroom
you<00:04:20.400> can<00:04:20.670> see<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:22.220> shower<00:04:23.220> is<00:04:24.140> directly

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
you can see that the shower is directly

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.030 
you can see that the shower is directly
connected<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.640> sink<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.710> which<00:04:28.710> means

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
connected to the sink and which means

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.040 
connected to the sink and which means
when<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.430> travel<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:30.030> water<00:04:30.270> will<00:04:30.570> go<00:04:30.780> in

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
when you travel the water will go in

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
when you travel the water will go in
here<00:04:31.410> so<00:04:31.710> there's<00:04:31.920> no<00:04:32.630> separate<00:04:33.630> shower<00:04:34.380> booth

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
here so there's no separate shower booth

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.500 
here so there's no separate shower booth
or<00:04:35.640> something<00:04:36.150> like<00:04:36.270> that

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
or something like that

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.750 
or something like that
so<00:04:37.230> there<00:04:37.500> you<00:04:37.530> have<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:38.400> toilet<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:40.670> even<00:04:41.670> a

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
so there you have the toilet and even a

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.020 
so there you have the toilet and even a
washing<00:04:42.060> machine<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.300> pretty<00:04:42.630> big<00:04:42.810> one<00:04:43.020> so

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
washing machine a pretty big one so

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.420

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.379 
I think that's it so the chairs were
also<00:05:54.240> not<00:05:54.600> here<00:05:55.169> when<00:05:55.650> we<00:05:56.010> moved<00:05:56.520> in<00:05:56.789> so<00:05:57.120> we
