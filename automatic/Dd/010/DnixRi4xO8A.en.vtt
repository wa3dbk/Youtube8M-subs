computers that are just for language
learning<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:47.360> think<00:01:48.360> most<00:01:48.900> students<00:01:49.200> really

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
learning I think most students really

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.260 
learning I think most students really
enjoy<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.159> experience<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.760> homes<00:01:50.970> day

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
enjoy the experience at the homes day

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.469 
enjoy the experience at the homes day
which<00:01:51.900> are<00:01:52.280> families<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.310> live<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> area

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
which are families that live in the area

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.030 
which are families that live in the area
and<00:01:54.900> I<00:01:55.890> think<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.670> homestay<00:01:57.060> really<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:58.409> lot

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and I think the homestay really is a lot

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.980 
and I think the homestay really is a lot
more<00:01:59.070> fun<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.850> students<00:02:00.330> as<00:02:00.479> they're<00:02:00.659> getting

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
more fun for students as they're getting

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.560 
more fun for students as they're getting
to<00:02:01.380> hang<00:02:02.159> out<00:02:02.310> with<00:02:02.369> these<00:02:02.610> American<00:02:03.090> families

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
to hang out with these American families

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.960 
to hang out with these American families
it<00:02:03.990> allows<00:02:04.409> them<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.400> an<00:02:05.520> intensive

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
it allows them to be in an intensive

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
it allows them to be in an intensive
English<00:02:06.570> learning<00:02:06.840> environments

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
English learning environments

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.589 
English learning environments
I<00:02:08.050> think<00:02:08.649> that's<00:02:08.800> an<00:02:09.190> exceptional<00:02:09.970> choice<00:02:10.209> for

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
I think that's an exceptional choice for

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.479 
I think that's an exceptional choice for
students<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.440> that's<00:02:11.560> why<00:02:11.709> they<00:02:11.860> choose<00:02:12.130> home

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
students and that's why they choose home

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.240 
students and that's why they choose home
