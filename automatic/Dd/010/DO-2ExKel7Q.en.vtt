00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 well then welcome to the first one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.850
 channel boxing the old product that 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.070
 had is he who is 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:14.620
 I do not know if it's going to be like 23 hours 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.930
 to render each drawing at the end 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.699
 will end one makes a video practically 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.950
 a whole day has not seen him yet 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:24.200
 I just pulled out 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.090
 the box of the components to the 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.090
 components the box of each component 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.750
 and I was assembled installed and then 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.420
 that 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.280
 The only thing he has not seen is the box 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.610
 good kind component is the great one that 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.790
 also and super fast why 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.310
 because I asked one Friday Friday 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.370
 Saturday afternoon and then today that is 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.750
 Wednesday is here so it's 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.500
 practically two good days with 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.510
 little papers here do not need good 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.930
 sometimes indicating what that is 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.850
 been tested and is not being 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.630
 fully assembled and living and that 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.630
 it works perfectly 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.130
 at the expense of their own 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.960
 it's a good raven knox house 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.750
 it's supposed to be good enough 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.810
 well it 's cheap it's pretty either in the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.590
 another world 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.469
 comes with enough shares 3.0 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.740
 It has enough holes for many things 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.840
 as you see 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.880
 and that more so I also came as a gift 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.880
 with an extra fan so 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.620
 at a glance the computer and now 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.990
 let's see it a little bit more inside 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.680
 well then that would be the case for 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 inside 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.050
 and as the lid said open and we're going to 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.050
 see the components that have more 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.530
 carefully the first thing you see is not 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.830
 can appreciate well of intel puts there the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.500
 mark of interest the motherboard 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.080
 intel of 65 m plus of asus as you see 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.480
 This is the case here 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.280
 OK 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.519
 the next thing that we found to the 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.330
 right is a ram of 8 GB 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:26.000
 of a good g.skill slot in the box 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.990
 us came because it's simply a 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.570
 plastic 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.340
 what else here on the left as 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.090
 fan that comes free with the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.420
 box is the cidh blaster of nox the same 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.970
 mark that the box 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.380
 as a power source we see that the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.090
 have placed us have placed the part 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.250
 higher 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.129
 a cooler master power supply 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.610
 of 600 watts we live the brand cooler 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.430
 master 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.670
 We have the box here 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.159
 then you see here on the right this is a 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.689
 lg reader-recorder but good we do not have 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.689
 box simply because it is the reader 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.819
 recorder because sometimes I buy the 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.739
 discs the games in physicists so 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.700
 I would also need what you see here in 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.099
 great how to focus is the graph 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.200
 As you can see, it's mounted by saffir and it's 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:22.060
 a radio r 9 270 x of 2 gb 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.709
 here 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.140
 in this series the box also 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.599
 picked up the edition that comes with a 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.350
 toilet fill 4 a copy of 3.004 is 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.320
 digital 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.960
 good finally the processor is going to 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.180
 teach I do not know I do not know exactly until 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.110
 here 16 digital you bring it is not even 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:46.160
 idea but it is this intel core i5 3.570 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.730
 here to 3 with 4 gigahertz speed and 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.400
 finally if I do not forget anything 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.329
 we have here 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.900
 the hard disk can not focus well 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:04.120
 seagate barracuda seems to me seagate 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.580
 barracuda of a terabyte of memory 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.090
 because this would be all the pieces that 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.200
 has my computer and at the moment it does not have 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.030
 nothing more and the only thing like in my house 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.690
 I can have the cable hooked to this 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.590
 so I bought a usb wifi antenna for 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.780
 can connect to connect to amd wifi 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.690
 from my house at level one 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.030
 so up here would be the unboxing 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.670
 as you see tried to teach a little 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.910
 technical all parts 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.630
 and I hope you liked it, nothing more 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.250
 for the moment I will bring you soon a 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.870
 gameplay so you can see how you can 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.970
 see what the battlefield 4 looks like and 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.280
 performance on the sides and I hope that you 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.580
 have liked and until next time 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.580
 goodbye
