00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
projects that were just really hard for

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.380 
projects that were just really hard for
us<00:00:41.629> to<00:00:41.660> develop<00:00:41.989> in-house<00:00:43.120> partly<00:00:44.120> because<00:00:44.269> of

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
us to develop in-house partly because of

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.420 
us to develop in-house partly because of
time<00:00:44.690> probably<00:00:45.170> because<00:00:45.379> of<00:00:45.410> resources<00:00:46.160> and

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
time probably because of resources and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.270 
time probably because of resources and
we<00:00:47.269> stumbled<00:00:47.690> across<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:48.110> doer<00:00:48.350> Center<00:00:48.800> here

we stumbled across the doer Center here
at<00:00:49.309> Grand<00:00:49.730> Valley<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:51.290> was<00:00:51.440> perfect<00:00:51.649> match

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
at Grand Valley and it was perfect match

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.920 
at Grand Valley and it was perfect match
they<00:00:52.460> they<00:00:52.760> have<00:00:52.909> all<00:00:53.089> the<00:00:53.210> capabilities<00:00:53.420> to

they they have all the capabilities to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.430 
they they have all the capabilities to
prototype<00:00:54.739> small<00:00:55.190> parts<00:00:55.579> that<00:00:56.199> we<00:00:57.199> can't

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
prototype small parts that we can't

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.740 
prototype small parts that we can't
necessarily<00:00:57.589> do<00:00:58.100> in-house<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:59.510> first

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
rear axle we brought that idea to the

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.280

doer center here at gvsu and within two
or<00:01:15.320> three<00:01:15.470> days<00:01:15.950> they<00:01:16.460> had<00:01:16.840> prototype

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
or three days they had prototype

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.770 
or three days they had prototype
dropouts<00:01:18.860> cut<00:01:19.280> out<00:01:19.400> for<00:01:19.640> us<00:01:19.670> on<00:01:19.909> a<00:01:19.939> CNC<00:01:20.420> machine

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
dropouts cut out for us on a CNC machine

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.160 
dropouts cut out for us on a CNC machine
and<00:01:21.140> hid<00:01:21.350> SolidWorks<00:01:21.979> files<00:01:22.280> for<00:01:22.610> us<00:01:23.170> we

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
and hid SolidWorks files for us we

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.289 
and hid SolidWorks files for us we
tested<00:01:24.590> them<00:01:24.680> they<00:01:25.040> worked<00:01:25.340> like<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.729> charm<00:01:26.030> on

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
tested them they worked like a charm on

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.600 
tested them they worked like a charm on
the<00:01:26.329> first<00:01:26.570> try<00:01:26.900> which<00:01:27.170> was<00:01:27.380> wonderful<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:28.040> we

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
the first try which was wonderful and we

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.950 
the first try which was wonderful and we
were<00:01:28.729> able<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:28.970> send<00:01:29.210> those<00:01:29.329> to<00:01:29.390> our<00:01:29.570> regular

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
were able to send those to our regular

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.560 
were able to send those to our regular
manufacturer<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.149> we<00:01:32.149> now<00:01:32.270> have<00:01:32.450> that

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
manufacturer and we now have that

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.940 
manufacturer and we now have that
product<00:01:32.869> on<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.009> market<00:01:35.530> well<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.650> students

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
product on the market well the students

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.070 
product on the market well the students
really<00:01:37.070> liked<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.430> project<00:01:37.880> it's<00:01:38.659> exciting

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
really liked the project it's exciting

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.870 
really liked the project it's exciting
it's<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.830> chance<00:01:40.040> for<00:01:40.159> them<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.370> get<00:01:40.670> something

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
it's a chance for them to get something

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.260 
it's a chance for them to get something
into<00:01:41.060> production<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:43.460> know<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.030> got<00:01:44.240> a

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
into production you know and it's got a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.960 
into production you know and it's got a
lot<00:01:44.540> of<00:01:44.600> opportunity<00:01:45.409> in<00:01:45.560> there<00:01:45.950> from<00:01:46.850> the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
lot of opportunity in there from the

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.430 
lot of opportunity in there from the
academic<00:01:47.090> point<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:47.659> view<00:01:47.780> I<00:01:47.810> really<00:01:48.170> like<00:01:48.320> the

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
academic point of view I really like the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.080 
academic point of view I really like the
project<00:01:48.590> because<00:01:48.979> there's<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.220> lot<00:01:49.460> of<00:01:49.490> solid

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
project because there's a lot of solid

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.300 
project because there's a lot of solid
engineering<00:01:50.690> that's<00:01:51.140> embodied<00:01:51.620> in<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
engineering that's embodied in the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.080 
engineering that's embodied in the
product

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
product

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.179 
product
to<00:01:55.079> work<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> actual<00:01:55.590> products<00:01:56.039> been

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
to work on the actual products been

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.179 
to work on the actual products been
fantastic<00:01:56.789> we've<00:01:57.240> been<00:01:57.390> able<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:58.009> use<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
fantastic we've been able to use the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.219 
fantastic we've been able to use the
territory<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.060> swap<00:02:00.390> out<00:02:00.570> components

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
territory of the swap out components

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.370 
territory of the swap out components
it's<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.979> real<00:02:02.189> world<00:02:02.399> application<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.569> we're

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
it's a real world application that we're

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.429 
it's a real world application that we're
getting<00:02:04.920> understanding<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.939> what<00:02:06.659> engineers

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
getting understanding for what engineers

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.740 
getting understanding for what engineers
go<00:02:07.710> through<00:02:07.979> an<00:02:08.099> industry<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.599> been

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
go through an industry it's just been

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.259 
go through an industry it's just been
explosive<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.500> us<00:02:10.590> even<00:02:11.310> as<00:02:11.430> as<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.000> economy

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
explosive for us even as as the economy

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.750 
explosive for us even as as the economy
has<00:02:12.540> been<00:02:12.870> very<00:02:13.140> poor<00:02:13.410> lately<00:02:13.769> we<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.640> came

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
has been very poor lately we just came

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.850 
has been very poor lately we just came
