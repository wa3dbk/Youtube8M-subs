00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.060 
either today I'm going to teach you how

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.780 
either today I'm going to teach you how
to<00:00:04.090> draw<00:00:04.390> a<00:00:04.420> dusty<00:00:04.990> from<00:00:05.290> the<00:00:05.470> movie<00:00:05.710> planes<00:00:06.009> so

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
to draw a dusty from the movie planes so

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.920 
to draw a dusty from the movie planes so
what<00:00:06.910> I'm<00:00:06.970> going<00:00:07.089> to<00:00:07.120> do<00:00:07.210> is<00:00:07.270> I'm<00:00:07.419> start<00:00:07.779> from

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930 
what I'm going to do is I'm start from

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.350 
what I'm going to do is I'm start from
the<00:00:08.020> nose<00:00:08.260> and<00:00:08.620> work<00:00:08.889> my<00:00:09.040> way<00:00:09.219> to<00:00:09.280> the<00:00:09.430> back<00:00:09.639> so

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
the nose and work my way to the back so

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.680 
the nose and work my way to the back so
let's<00:00:10.539> start<00:00:10.780> with<00:00:10.930> the<00:00:11.020> propeller<00:00:11.350> tip<00:00:11.680> now

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
let's start with the propeller tip now

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.090 
let's start with the propeller tip now
let's<00:00:13.690> start<00:00:13.959> with<00:00:14.080> one<00:00:14.379> propeller<00:00:14.770> here

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
let's start with one propeller here

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.230 
let's start with one propeller here
because<00:00:15.580> this<00:00:15.699> is<00:00:15.850> sort<00:00:16.059> of<00:00:16.090> in<00:00:16.209> the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
because this is sort of in the

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.370 
because this is sort of in the
foreground<00:00:16.539> so<00:00:16.720> I<00:00:16.779> start<00:00:17.050> with<00:00:17.109> one<00:00:17.289> little

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
foreground so I start with one little

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.839 
foreground so I start with one little
line<00:00:17.710> I<00:00:18.029> come<00:00:19.029> out<00:00:19.300> on<00:00:19.779> one<00:00:20.400> side<00:00:21.400> of<00:00:21.429> the<00:00:21.550> curve

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
line I come out on one side of the curve

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.730 
line I come out on one side of the curve
and<00:00:22.269> I'll<00:00:22.480> come<00:00:22.720> around<00:00:22.929> the<00:00:23.080> other<00:00:23.169> side<00:00:23.349> with

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
and I'll come around the other side with

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.829 
and I'll come around the other side with
another<00:00:23.800> curve<00:00:24.310> and<00:00:24.970> I'll<00:00:25.150> cap<00:00:25.359> that<00:00:25.509> off<00:00:25.630> with

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
another curve and I'll cap that off with

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.480 
another curve and I'll cap that off with
a<00:00:25.900> straight<00:00:26.169> line<00:00:26.349> okay<00:00:26.859> so<00:00:26.919> there's<00:00:27.220> our<00:00:27.279> one

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
a straight line okay so there's our one

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.489 
a straight line okay so there's our one
propeller<00:00:27.849> in<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.269> front<00:00:28.570> and<00:00:29.140> then<00:00:29.439> I'm

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:29.499 
propeller in the front and then I'm

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.569 
propeller in the front and then I'm
going<00:00:29.619> to<00:00:29.650> draw<00:00:29.769> something<00:00:30.070> that<00:00:30.220> looks<00:00:30.400> like

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
going to draw something that looks like

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.930 
going to draw something that looks like
a<00:00:30.900> circle<00:00:31.900> but<00:00:32.079> it's<00:00:32.320> got<00:00:32.500> a<00:00:32.529> little<00:00:32.770> bit<00:00:33.070> of<00:00:33.310> a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
a circle but it's got a little bit of a

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.140 
a circle but it's got a little bit of a
strip<00:00:34.810> so<00:00:35.050> it's<00:00:35.170> a<00:00:35.230> little<00:00:35.320> bit<00:00:35.500> longer<00:00:36.150> okay

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
strip so it's a little bit longer okay

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.660 
strip so it's a little bit longer okay
this<00:00:37.750> way<00:00:37.930> and<00:00:38.230> then<00:00:38.890> draw<00:00:39.040> another<00:00:39.280> propeller

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
this way and then draw another propeller

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.390 
this way and then draw another propeller
that's<00:00:39.880> tucked<00:00:40.090> behind<00:00:40.240> that<00:00:40.660> nose

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
that's tucked behind that nose

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.190 
that's tucked behind that nose
let's<00:00:42.400> go<00:00:42.610> off<00:00:42.850> on<00:00:43.030> one<00:00:43.180> side<00:00:43.210> just<00:00:43.810> like<00:00:43.930> I<00:00:44.020> did

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
let's go off on one side just like I did

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.730 
let's go off on one side just like I did
over<00:00:44.290> here

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
over here

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.190 
over here
curr<00:00:45.610> another<00:00:45.880> line<00:00:46.090> on<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.360> other<00:00:46.480> side<00:00:46.780> and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
curr another line on the other side and

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.960 
curr another line on the other side and
I'll<00:00:47.680> cap<00:00:47.890> it<00:00:48.040> up<00:00:48.160> with<00:00:48.460> another<00:00:48.730> straight

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
I'll cap it up with another straight

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:49.380 
I'll cap it up with another straight
line

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
line

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.480 
line
and<00:00:50.050> now<00:00:50.170> I'm<00:00:50.410> going<00:00:50.560> to<00:00:50.650> try<00:00:50.860> to<00:00:50.920> find<00:00:51.130> a<00:00:51.250> point

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
and now I'm going to try to find a point

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.460 
and now I'm going to try to find a point
that's<00:00:51.820> sort<00:00:52.030> of<00:00:52.090> halfway<00:00:52.390> between<00:00:52.690> these<00:00:53.260> two

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
that's sort of halfway between these two

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.400 
that's sort of halfway between these two
around<00:00:53.890> here<00:00:54.250> and<00:00:54.750> draw<00:00:55.750> another<00:00:55.930> curved<00:00:56.380> line

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
around here and draw another curved line

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.700 
around here and draw another curved line
so<00:00:56.890> there's<00:00:57.160> three<00:00:57.430> propellers<00:00:58.530> there's<00:00:59.530> two

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
so there's three propellers there's two

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.770 
so there's three propellers there's two
curved<00:01:00.430> lines<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:00.970> then<00:01:01.060> cap<00:01:01.270> it<00:01:01.300> off<00:01:01.540> at<00:01:01.690> the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
curved lines and then cap it off at the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.950 
curved lines and then cap it off at the
tip<00:01:01.990> okay<00:01:02.800> now<00:01:03.790> let's<00:01:03.970> work<00:01:04.119> our<00:01:04.299> way<00:01:04.449> towards

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
tip okay now let's work our way towards

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.690 
tip okay now let's work our way towards
the<00:01:05.049> cabin<00:01:05.560> so<00:01:05.590> this<00:01:05.859> is<00:01:05.979> where<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.219> faces<00:01:06.670> of

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
the cabin so this is where the faces of

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.190 
the cabin so this is where the faces of
dusty<00:01:07.179> so<00:01:07.840> I<00:01:07.899> do<00:01:08.109> a<00:01:08.140> curved<00:01:08.499> line<00:01:08.759> it<00:01:09.759> sort<00:01:10.030> of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
dusty so I do a curved line it sort of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.859 
dusty so I do a curved line it sort of
points<00:01:11.200> towards<00:01:11.679> that<00:01:11.829> nose<00:01:12.039> okay<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.450> it

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
points towards that nose okay and it

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.910 
points towards that nose okay and it
comes<00:01:14.079> straight<00:01:14.200> up<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:16.600> for<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.679> face

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
comes straight up like so for the face

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.279 
comes straight up like so for the face
and<00:01:18.159> then<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.460> top<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.999> cabin<00:01:19.359> is<00:01:19.960> sort<00:01:20.229> of

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
and then the top of the cabin is sort of

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.340 
and then the top of the cabin is sort of
curved<00:01:20.619> like<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.270> okay<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:23.020> then<00:01:23.140> I<00:01:23.170> don't

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
curved like that okay and then I don't

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.190 
curved like that okay and then I don't
come<00:01:23.530> down<00:01:23.710> on<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.009> back<00:01:24.249> at<00:01:24.789> an<00:01:24.999> angle<00:01:25.200> all

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
come down on the back at an angle all

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.469 
come down on the back at an angle all
right<00:01:26.319> so<00:01:26.469> there's<00:01:26.649> a<00:01:26.710> top<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.100> his<00:01:27.219> head<00:01:27.429> and<00:01:27.700> I

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
right so there's a top of his head and I

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.510 
right so there's a top of his head and I
come<00:01:28.749> back

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
come back

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.389 
come back
sort<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.840> an<00:01:32.139> angle<00:01:32.439> like<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:32.619> just<00:01:33.219> kind

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
sort of in an angle like this just kind

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.010 
sort of in an angle like this just kind
of<00:01:33.429> continue<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:34.030> imaginary<00:01:34.450> line<00:01:34.569> to<00:01:34.929> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
of continue that imaginary line to the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.270 
of continue that imaginary line to the
front<00:01:35.319> okay

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
front okay

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.330 
front okay
now<00:01:37.090> let's<00:01:37.899> draw<00:01:38.139> on<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.319> face<00:01:38.499> so<00:01:38.799> here's<00:01:39.189> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
now let's draw on the face so here's the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.209 
now let's draw on the face so here's the
front<00:01:39.700> wind<00:01:39.969> windshield<00:01:40.569> so<00:01:41.439> drop<00:01:41.710> curve<00:01:42.039> like

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
front wind windshield so drop curve like

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.639 
front wind windshield so drop curve like
this<00:01:42.460> at<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.819> top<00:01:43.060> I'm<00:01:43.869> going<00:01:44.079> to<00:01:44.170> come<00:01:44.409> down

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
this at the top I'm going to come down

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.760 
this at the top I'm going to come down
sort<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:45.009> halfway<00:01:45.219> between<00:01:45.549> these<00:01:45.819> two<00:01:46.060> lines

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
sort of halfway between these two lines

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.679 
sort of halfway between these two lines
like<00:01:47.770> this<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.399> then<00:01:49.090> I'm<00:01:49.149> going<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.299> continue

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
like this and then I'm going to continue

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.199 
like this and then I'm going to continue
this<00:01:49.810> imaginary<00:01:50.259> line<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.700> front<00:01:51.969> like

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
this imaginary line to the front like

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.349 
this imaginary line to the front like
that<00:01:52.240> okay<00:01:53.259> now<00:01:54.100> let's<00:01:54.280> draw<00:01:54.490> his<00:01:54.670> eyeball<00:01:55.030> so

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
that okay now let's draw his eyeball so

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.099 
that okay now let's draw his eyeball so
here's<00:01:56.200> one<00:01:56.469> pupil<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.659> circle<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:58.899> then

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
here's one pupil a circle and then

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.330 
here's one pupil a circle and then
inside<00:01:59.469> I'm<00:01:59.649> just<00:01:59.679> going<00:01:59.920> to<00:01:59.979> color<00:02:00.159> in<00:02:00.279> a

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
inside I'm just going to color in a

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.120 
inside I'm just going to color in a
black<00:02:00.549> dot<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.109> then<00:02:02.109> beside<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.590> I'm<00:02:02.950> gonna

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
black dot and then beside that I'm gonna

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.849 
black dot and then beside that I'm gonna
do<00:02:03.249> another<00:02:03.490> pupil<00:02:03.880> exact<00:02:04.600> same<00:02:04.810> size<00:02:05.049> and

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
do another pupil exact same size and

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.190 
do another pupil exact same size and
draw<00:02:06.130> another<00:02:06.310> black<00:02:06.579> dot<00:02:06.789> okay<00:02:07.359> and<00:02:07.630> then

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
draw another black dot okay and then

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.660 
draw another black dot okay and then
he's<00:02:08.289> got<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.500> little<00:02:08.649> bit<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.979> glare<00:02:09.340> on<00:02:09.580> a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
he's got a little bit of a glare on a

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.550 
he's got a little bit of a glare on a
windshield<00:02:10.149> just<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.659> show<00:02:10.869> his<00:02:11.049> eyebrow<00:02:11.379> so

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
windshield just to show his eyebrow so

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.740 
windshield just to show his eyebrow so
I'll<00:02:11.650> do<00:02:11.799> a<00:02:11.830> curve<00:02:12.129> at<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.340> top<00:02:12.599> straight<00:02:13.599> down

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
I'll do a curve at the top straight down

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.420 
I'll do a curve at the top straight down
the<00:02:13.840> middle

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
the middle

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.809 
the middle
and<00:02:15.150> curl<00:02:15.569> up<00:02:15.720> again<00:02:16.230> okay<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:17.340> he's<00:02:17.489> got<00:02:17.640> a

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
and curl up again okay and he's got a

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.490 
and curl up again okay and he's got a
side<00:02:18.150> window<00:02:18.510> over<00:02:18.629> here<00:02:18.659> which<00:02:19.019> is<00:02:19.049> just<00:02:19.409> a

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
side window over here which is just a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.679 
side window over here which is just a
little<00:02:19.799> bit<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.099> from<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:20.610> line<00:02:21.239> here<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:21.629> I'm

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
little bit in from this line here so I'm

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.270 
little bit in from this line here so I'm
going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.900> give<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> little<00:02:23.010> bit<00:02:23.189> of

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
going to give it a little bit of

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.270 
going to give it a little bit of
thickness<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:24.840> imaginary<00:02:25.290> line<00:02:25.439> again<00:02:25.860> I'm

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
thickness this imaginary line again I'm

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.490 
thickness this imaginary line again I'm
going<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.459> continue<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.939> bottom<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.500> then

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
going to continue the bottom and then

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.330 
going to continue the bottom and then
I'll<00:02:28.739> come<00:02:29.010> close<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.519> outside<00:02:30.000> line<00:02:30.239> and

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
I'll come close to that outside line and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.039 
I'll come close to that outside line and
curve<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.489> back<00:02:32.670> in<00:02:32.879> okay<00:02:33.359> so<00:02:33.750> there's<00:02:33.930> our

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
curve that back in okay so there's our

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.009 
curve that back in okay so there's our
side<00:02:34.230> window<00:02:34.530> there's<00:02:34.950> his<00:02:35.069> face<00:02:35.810> now<00:02:36.810> from

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
side window there's his face now from

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.360 
side window there's his face now from
here<00:02:37.200> I'm<00:02:37.379> going<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.560> bring<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.829> belly<00:02:38.040> down

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
here I'm going to bring the belly down

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.369 
here I'm going to bring the belly down
but<00:02:39.090> somewhere<00:02:39.420> around<00:02:39.540> here<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.019> I'm<00:02:40.170> going

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
but somewhere around here that I'm going

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.110 
but somewhere around here that I'm going
to<00:02:40.409> draw<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> wing<00:02:40.829> so<00:02:41.040> maybe<00:02:41.220> I'll<00:02:41.849> draw<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
to draw a wing so maybe I'll draw the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.339 
to draw a wing so maybe I'll draw the
wing<00:02:42.329> in<00:02:42.450> first<00:02:42.689> so<00:02:42.810> it's<00:02:42.959> kind<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.319> a

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
wing in first so it's kind of like a

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.649 
wing in first so it's kind of like a
curve<00:02:43.709> it's<00:02:44.549> straight<00:02:44.909> there<00:02:45.299> kind<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.510> pull

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
curve it's straight there kind of pull

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.589 
curve it's straight there kind of pull
straight<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.140> way<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:46.349> I'll<00:02:46.799> start<00:02:47.069> here

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
straight up this way so I'll start here

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.879 
straight up this way so I'll start here
and<00:02:48.599> come<00:02:48.840> straight<00:02:49.260> down<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.970> about<00:02:51.239> here<00:02:51.889> I'm

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
and come straight down to about here I'm

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.759 
and come straight down to about here I'm
going<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.099> curve<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:53.670> around<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.200> okay

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
going to curve that around like so okay

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.289 
going to curve that around like so okay
so<00:02:56.370> that's<00:02:56.519> where<00:02:56.670> it's<00:02:56.790> attached<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.209> the

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
so that's where it's attached to the

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.720 
so that's where it's attached to the
body<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:58.349> at<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.530> tip<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.920> wing<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.579> I

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
body and at the tip of the wing and I

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.149 
body and at the tip of the wing and I
come<00:03:00.000> up<00:03:00.120> with<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.510> curve<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:01.049> that<00:03:01.129> with<00:03:02.129> a

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
come up with a curve like that with a

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.559 
come up with a curve like that with a
straight<00:03:02.430> line<00:03:02.609> sort<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.150> curved<00:03:03.359> slightly

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
straight line sort of curved slightly

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.720 
straight line sort of curved slightly
curved<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.230> come<00:03:05.010> back<00:03:05.159> straight<00:03:05.519> down

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
curved and come back straight down

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.710 
curved and come back straight down
towards<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.299> body<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:07.470> very<00:03:07.799> straight<00:03:08.099> line

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
towards the body this very straight line

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.869 
towards the body this very straight line
like<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:10.019> okay<00:03:10.909> and<00:03:11.909> then<00:03:12.209> as<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:13.680> come<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:14.159> I'm

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
like that okay and then as I come up I'm

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.059 
like that okay and then as I come up I'm
going<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.120> join<00:03:15.299> this<00:03:15.480> line<00:03:15.659> here<00:03:15.989> but<00:03:16.260> there

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
going to join this line here but there

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.939 
going to join this line here but there
is<00:03:17.099> a<00:03:17.250> tire<00:03:17.639> that<00:03:18.030> sort<00:03:18.599> of<00:03:18.629> sticks<00:03:19.199> down<00:03:19.500> here

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
is a tire that sort of sticks down here

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.640 
is a tire that sort of sticks down here
so<00:03:20.549> this<00:03:20.639> is<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.849> tire<00:03:21.090> leg<00:03:21.359> so<00:03:21.780> let's<00:03:22.530> do<00:03:22.620> it

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
so this is the tire leg so let's do it

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.550 
so this is the tire leg so let's do it
for<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:22.949> like<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.329> I've<00:03:24.329> come<00:03:24.629> down<00:03:24.810> an<00:03:25.139> angle

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
for it like that I've come down an angle

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.770 
for it like that I've come down an angle
and<00:03:26.069> this<00:03:26.489> I'm<00:03:26.760> going<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:26.910> tape<00:03:27.150> her<00:03:27.299> in<00:03:27.480> just

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
and this I'm going to tape her in just

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.390 
and this I'm going to tape her in just
like<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.109> and<00:03:28.319> then<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.620> can<00:03:28.680> go<00:03:28.889> back<00:03:29.069> in<00:03:29.280> and

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
like that and then I can go back in and

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.490 
like that and then I can go back in and
finish<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.359> line<00:03:30.599> off<00:03:30.810> like<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.139> okay<00:03:31.290> so

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
finish that line off like that okay so

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.860 
finish that line off like that okay so
that's<00:03:31.829> tucked<00:03:32.099> in<00:03:32.220> behind<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:33.299> then<00:03:33.659> for<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
that's tucked in behind and then for the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.039 
that's tucked in behind and then for the
wheel<00:03:34.049> basically<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.769> circle<00:03:35.659> just<00:03:36.659> draw<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.840> big

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
wheel basically a circle just draw a big

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.830 
wheel basically a circle just draw a big
circle<00:03:37.079> here<00:03:38.150> it's<00:03:39.150> okay<00:03:39.449> if<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.629> kind<00:03:39.810> of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
circle here it's okay if you kind of

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.360 
circle here it's okay if you kind of
overlap<00:03:40.319> because<00:03:40.799> we're<00:03:41.010> going<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.190> color

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
overlap because we're going to color

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.460 
overlap because we're going to color
that<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.699> I'm<00:03:42.510> going<00:03:42.629> to<00:03:42.690> do<00:03:42.750> another<00:03:42.989> smaller

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
that in I'm going to do another smaller

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.509 
that in I'm going to do another smaller
circle<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.669> the<00:03:44.790> left<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.389> that<00:03:45.540> circle<00:03:46.290> and

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
circle to the left of that circle and

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.580 
circle to the left of that circle and
here<00:03:47.519> I'm<00:03:47.669> just<00:03:47.699> going<00:03:47.909> to<00:03:48.000> draw<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.120> little<00:03:48.269> C

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
here I'm just going to draw a little C

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.990 
here I'm just going to draw a little C
just<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.769> show<00:03:49.919> a<00:03:49.949> little<00:03:50.099> bit<00:03:50.250> depth<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.729> then

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
just to show a little bit depth and then

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.159 
just to show a little bit depth and then
it's<00:03:51.150> sort<00:03:51.359> of<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.510> tight<00:03:51.720> little<00:03:51.930> tiny

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
it's sort of the tight little tiny

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.170 
it's sort of the tight little tiny
circle<00:03:52.530> inside<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:53.519> then<00:03:53.699> I'm<00:03:53.790> going<00:03:54.030> right

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
circle inside and then I'm going right

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:06.119 
circle inside and then I'm going right
ahead<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.479> color<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.139> that<00:03:55.889> wheel<00:03:56.159> right<00:03:56.459> in

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.880 

just<00:04:07.129> like<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.519> okay<00:04:07.939> there<00:04:08.420> we<00:04:08.540> go<00:04:08.650> okay<00:04:09.650> and

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
just like that okay there we go okay and

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.649 
just like that okay there we go okay and
so<00:04:10.400> for<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.640> wing<00:04:10.819> I'm<00:04:11.030> gonna<00:04:11.180> give<00:04:11.269> a<00:04:11.299> little

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
so for the wing I'm gonna give a little

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.149 
so for the wing I'm gonna give a little
bit<00:04:11.810> of<00:04:11.900> detail<00:04:12.349> so<00:04:12.590> I'm<00:04:12.680> just<00:04:12.829> going<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:12.980> come

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
bit of detail so I'm just going to come

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.420 
bit of detail so I'm just going to come
up<00:04:13.280> here<00:04:13.390> draw<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.420> strength<00:04:14.810> in<00:04:15.079> line<00:04:15.319> and<00:04:15.650> from

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
up here draw a strength in line and from

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.170 
up here draw a strength in line and from
here<00:04:16.759> I'm<00:04:17.030> gonna<00:04:17.150> come<00:04:17.329> straight<00:04:17.870> down<00:04:19.180> right

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
here I'm gonna come straight down right

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.140 
here I'm gonna come straight down right
to<00:04:20.359> where<00:04:20.479> that<00:04:20.630> tire<00:04:21.049> leg<00:04:21.350> is<00:04:21.530> okay<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.490> then

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
to where that tire leg is okay and then

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.890 
to where that tire leg is okay and then
I<00:04:23.389> can<00:04:23.419> draw<00:04:23.720> on<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:23.870> couple<00:04:24.199> angled<00:04:25.330> lines<00:04:26.330> just

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
I can draw on a couple angled lines just

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.379 
I can draw on a couple angled lines just
show<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:28.759> wing<00:04:28.940> fins<00:04:29.300> okay<00:04:30.039> now<00:04:31.210> here<00:04:32.210> I'm

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
show the wing fins okay now here I'm

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.219 
show the wing fins okay now here I'm
going<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.660> draw<00:04:32.900> in<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.669> bottom<00:04:34.669> of<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.660> plane

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
going to draw in the bottom of the plane

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.010 
going to draw in the bottom of the plane
so<00:04:36.590> let's<00:04:37.340> start<00:04:37.610> right<00:04:38.300> about<00:04:38.419> here<00:04:38.870> and

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
so let's start right about here and

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.770 
so let's start right about here and
curve<00:04:39.889> this<00:04:40.099> line<00:04:40.780> in<00:04:42.039> towards<00:04:43.039> that<00:04:43.160> leg<00:04:43.780> it's

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
curve this line in towards that leg it's

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.890 
curve this line in towards that leg it's
going<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.080> come<00:04:45.349> back<00:04:45.620> up<00:04:46.009> and<00:04:46.509> into<00:04:47.509> the<00:04:47.630> back

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
going to come back up and into the back

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.310 
going to come back up and into the back
so<00:04:48.289> here<00:04:49.250> is<00:04:49.759> where<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.000> tail<00:04:50.240> is<00:04:50.270> I'm<00:04:51.229> going

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
so here is where the tail is I'm going

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.749 
so here is where the tail is I'm going
to<00:04:51.440> sort<00:04:51.620> of<00:04:51.710> try<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:51.889> match<00:04:52.130> that<00:04:52.160> up<00:04:52.520> just

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
to sort of try to match that up just

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:53.050 
to sort of try to match that up just
like<00:04:52.849> that

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
like that

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.089 
like that
okay<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.720> then<00:04:54.440> I'm<00:04:54.680> going<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:54.919> bring<00:04:55.039> that

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
okay and then I'm going to bring that

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.980 
okay and then I'm going to bring that
back<00:04:55.460> up<00:04:55.669> a<00:04:55.880> little<00:04:56.030> bit<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.570> then<00:04:56.720> there's<00:04:56.900> a

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
back up a little bit and then there's a

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.390 
back up a little bit and then there's a
little<00:04:57.110> wing<00:04:57.380> in<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.590> back<00:04:57.770> here<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:58.250> I'm<00:04:58.370> just

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
little wing in the back here so I'm just

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.670 
little wing in the back here so I'm just
going<00:04:58.639> to<00:04:58.699> bring<00:04:58.849> the<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.900> line<00:05:00.169> just<00:05:00.380> around

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
going to bring the that line just around

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.510 
going to bring the that line just around
like<00:05:01.130> that<00:05:01.340> I'll<00:05:02.180> draw<00:05:02.419> a<00:05:02.449> straight<00:05:02.810> line<00:05:03.520> and

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
like that I'll draw a straight line and

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.360 
like that I'll draw a straight line and
then<00:05:05.270> I'll<00:05:05.419> draw<00:05:05.630> a<00:05:05.660> curve<00:05:06.050> back<00:05:06.590> in<00:05:07.070> toward

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
then I'll draw a curve back in toward

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.180 
then I'll draw a curve back in toward
the<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:08.030> wing<00:05:08.330> okay<00:05:08.870> and<00:05:09.289> then<00:05:09.979> from<00:05:10.159> here

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
the that wing okay and then from here

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.969 
the that wing okay and then from here
I'm<00:05:10.610> going<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.940> draw<00:05:11.120> a<00:05:11.479> little<00:05:12.320> bit<00:05:12.470> of<00:05:12.560> detail

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
I'm going to draw a little bit of detail

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.250 
I'm going to draw a little bit of detail
as<00:05:13.099> well<00:05:13.220> so<00:05:13.430> one<00:05:13.639> straight<00:05:13.880> line<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.960> then

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
as well so one straight line and then

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.570 
as well so one straight line and then
another<00:05:15.470> straight<00:05:15.770> line<00:05:15.889> going<00:05:16.070> back<00:05:16.220> into

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
another straight line going back into

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.770 
another straight line going back into
the<00:05:16.669> body<00:05:17.800> for<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.830> back<00:05:19.130> tail<00:05:20.060> I'm<00:05:20.510> going<00:05:20.570> to

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
the body for the back tail I'm going to

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.050 
the body for the back tail I'm going to
draw<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.020> straight<00:05:21.440> line<00:05:21.470> down<00:05:21.979> that<00:05:22.760> sort<00:05:23.030> of

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
draw a straight line down that sort of

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.879 
draw a straight line down that sort of
lines<00:05:23.240> up<00:05:23.419> with<00:05:23.510> this<00:05:23.659> back<00:05:23.900> in<00:05:24.139> here<00:05:24.470> I'm

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
lines up with this back in here I'm

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.629 
lines up with this back in here I'm
doing<00:05:25.580> angle<00:05:26.060> up<00:05:26.510> and<00:05:26.960> then<00:05:27.650> straight<00:05:28.010> angle

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
doing angle up and then straight angle

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.540 
doing angle up and then straight angle
back<00:05:28.820> down<00:05:29.120> okay<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.289> then<00:05:30.889> I'm<00:05:31.010> also<00:05:31.190> going

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
back down okay and then I'm also going

one line going out like so okay I'm
going<00:06:21.740> to<00:06:21.800> draw<00:06:22.010> another<00:06:22.790> line<00:06:22.910> sort<00:06:23.390> of

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
going to draw another line sort of

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.630 
going to draw another line sort of
coming<00:06:23.690> across<00:06:24.410> and<00:06:24.830> then<00:06:24.920> tapering<00:06:25.340> down

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
line down I'm going to curve it and go

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.080 
line down I'm going to curve it and go
straight<00:07:24.530> back<00:07:24.710> up<00:07:24.980> in<00:07:25.310> an<00:07:25.460> angle<00:07:25.790> that<00:07:25.910> way

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090
