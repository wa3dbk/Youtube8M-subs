00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.700 
yeah real quick change my shirt to show
the<00:07:51.210> green<00:07:53.810> that's<00:07:54.810> a<00:07:54.960> nice<00:07:55.140> picture<00:07:55.350> but

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:55.710 
the green that's a nice picture but

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.010 
the green that's a nice picture but
perhaps<00:07:56.090> we<00:07:57.090> can<00:07:57.210> do<00:07:57.330> a<00:07:57.360> little<00:07:57.510> touching<00:07:57.930> up

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.020 
perhaps we can do a little touching up

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.480 
perhaps we can do a little touching up
in<00:07:58.170> Photoshop<00:07:58.650> with<00:07:58.800> that<00:07:58.950> what<00:07:59.130> do<00:07:59.190> you<00:07:59.250> think

00:07:59.480 --> 00:07:59.490 
in Photoshop with that what do you think

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.870 
in Photoshop with that what do you think
of<00:07:59.670> this<00:08:00.570> picture
