00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.460 
yeah the bottom is like just like messed
up<00:01:17.130> concrete<00:01:17.460> down<00:01:18.090> there<00:01:18.360> looks<00:01:18.990> pretty<00:01:19.110> nice

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
up concrete down there looks pretty nice

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.880 
up concrete down there looks pretty nice
I<00:01:19.829> really<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:21.479> they<00:01:21.659> added<00:01:22.470> like

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
I really like that they added like

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.450 
I really like that they added like
three-dimensional<00:01:24.229> buildings<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
three-dimensional buildings to the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.420 
three-dimensional buildings to the
background<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.150> feel<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.720> gives<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.990> more

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
background I feel like it gives it more

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.429 
background I feel like it gives it more
just<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.729> bit<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:30.030> depth<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:31.259> looks

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
just a little bit more depth so it looks

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
just a little bit more depth so it looks
cooler<00:01:31.939> um<00:01:32.939> yeah

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
cooler um yeah

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.989 
cooler um yeah
now<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.920> clone<00:01:35.100> field<00:01:35.340> monster<00:01:35.520> does<00:01:35.819> come

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
now the clone field monster does come

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:40.039 
now the clone field monster does come
with<00:01:36.119> some<00:01:36.560> instruction<00:01:38.719> yeah<00:01:39.719> they're<00:01:39.899> just

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
with some instruction yeah they're just

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.609 
with some instruction yeah they're just
pretty<00:01:40.770> standard<00:01:41.609> easy<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:42.630> follow

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
pretty standard easy to follow

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.069 
pretty standard easy to follow

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
instructions you know batteries head

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.639 
instructions you know batteries head
under<00:01:46.409> changing<00:01:47.450> then<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.659> sound<00:01:48.960> mechanism

of<00:03:21.019> course<00:03:21.260> his<00:03:21.680> fingers<00:03:22.010> are<00:03:22.130> huge<00:03:22.340> so<00:03:22.550> they

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
of course his fingers are huge so they

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.069 
of course his fingers are huge so they
added<00:03:23.450> finger<00:03:23.780> articulation<00:03:24.530> um<00:03:24.800> I<00:03:26.079> think

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
added finger articulation um I think

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.560 
added finger articulation um I think
just<00:03:27.500> about<00:03:27.590> every<00:03:27.890> joint<00:03:28.130> yeah<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.519> one<00:03:28.760> the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
just about every joint yeah this one the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.990 
just about every joint yeah this one the
knuckle<00:03:30.019> then<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:30.950> inside<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.579> figure

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
knuckle then the inside of the figure

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.949 
knuckle then the inside of the figure
then<00:03:32.440> right<00:03:33.440> at<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:34.130> top<00:03:34.400> Michael<00:03:34.930> with<00:03:35.930> a

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959
