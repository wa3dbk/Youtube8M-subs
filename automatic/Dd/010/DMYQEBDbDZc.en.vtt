up where I just did you want to be

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.500 
up where I just did you want to be
somewhere<00:01:04.979> either<00:01:05.189> near<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> middle<00:01:05.909> maybe

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
somewhere either near the middle maybe

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.850 
somewhere either near the middle maybe
even<00:01:06.840> towards<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> top<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.530> really<00:01:07.710> just

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
even towards the top it really just

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.920 
even towards the top it really just
depends<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.180> basically<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.689> go

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
depends on you but basically you go

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.630 
depends on you but basically you go
around<00:01:10.049> collecting<00:01:10.590> blocks<00:01:11.010> now<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.280> thing

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
around collecting blocks now the thing

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.820 
around collecting blocks now the thing
is<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.420> whenever<00:01:12.960> you're<00:01:13.260> collecting

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
is here is whenever you're collecting

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.980 
is here is whenever you're collecting
blocks<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.430> leaves<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.939> less<00:01:14.970> spaces<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
blocks it leaves you less spaces to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
blocks it leaves you less spaces to
actually<00:01:16.290> jump<00:01:16.530> before<00:01:16.920> example<00:01:17.520> right<00:01:17.670> now<00:01:17.700> I

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
actually jump before example right now I

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550 
actually jump before example right now I
can<00:01:18.180> jump<00:01:18.450> over<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.049> piece<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.409> wood

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
can jump over to this piece of wood

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
can jump over to this piece of wood
however<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.729> mine<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.150> piece<00:01:21.360> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
however if I was to mine this piece of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.940 
however if I was to mine this piece of
wood<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.990> wanted<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.470> or<00:01:22.590> something

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
wood because I wanted it or something

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.550 
wood because I wanted it or something
that<00:01:23.369> leaves<00:01:23.580> me<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:24.150> less<00:01:24.450> spot<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.990> actually

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
that leaves me one less spot to actually

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.530 
that leaves me one less spot to actually
mined<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.220> that's<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> trickery

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
mined so that's kind of the trickery

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440 
mined so that's kind of the trickery
with<00:01:28.080> sky<00:01:28.650> grid<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.310> uh<00:01:29.340> anyways<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.329> just

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
with sky grid but uh anyways I just

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.700 
with sky grid but uh anyways I just
wanted<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> let<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.930> guys<00:01:31.020> know<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.290> can
