00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.100
 in the growing arid zones of our country achieve agricultural crops 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.730
 It has become a real challenge but here in Tlaxcala science and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.980
 technology have proven to have some answers to overcome this problem that 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.179
 affects so many producers of the national field 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.710
 an irrigation system that saves 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.570
 greenhouses that protect crops from climate protests and a 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.329
 effective organization between producers and men of science have achieved 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.250
 increase the quantity in production and the quality of the product of crops 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.510
 use innovative agronomic techniques 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.870
 the term irrigation by micro hit 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.060
 refers to the alternative method of irrigation with a very low flow rate that 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.430
 uses only gravity energy 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.580
 which results in a better distribution of water and fertilizers in 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.540
 the soil and a better nutrition of the crops during all its stage of 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.250
 increase 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.650
 This system allows to produce any type of crop at macro levels with 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.200
 micros 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.700
 takes advantage of small working spaces of land even dry lands 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.870
 yields that are obtained are quite contrasting with the 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.840
 current technology of the producer 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.040
 the product really to add and temporary culture 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.590
 and in those cases in which an irrigation ari culture makes the technique that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.090
 uses is an iverson system by gravity 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.510
 whose efficiency is only 35% 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.370
 the irrigation system by micro count 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.450
 allows to have an efficiency 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.820
 yes 95 percent 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.979
 but also this system that you have been appreciating appreciate the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:38.850
 culture 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.360
 in this case of aba 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.770
 It also allows adding fertilizers in the amounts that the plant 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.290
 requires and therefore the yields are up to ten times more in 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.300
 comparison with what the producer has in arid regions and 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.500
 semi-arid in a cd it will be an apology uras 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
 usually the problem is the quality of the floors 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.230
 not only do you need salt concentrations 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.440
 on the other hand 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.390
 when you want to be obligated 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.099
 the water is usually of poor quality 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.189
 another interesting technology to modernize agriculture 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:16.419
 are the aerodynamic greenhouses that allow producers to face them 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.059
 increasingly drastic climate changes without damaging their crops and 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.059
 avoid the entry of pests 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.109
 the intention 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.430
 as we all know from a greenhouse is to accelerate the precocity or the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.259
 Crop development 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.679
 in the innovation that we are implementing is that the entered is 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:40.789
 postulate 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:45.179
 well we are doing more aerodynamics to assess the problems of 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.229
 10 wind overloads 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:51.719
 rain hail and so on, we take advantage of the wind 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.129
 or natural ventilation 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.189
 for percent of talk for the benefit of the producer and the crop 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.329
 drawing hot air through the mind for this in central ventilation 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.840
 i robert g take advantage of this temperature we can place 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.370
 according to the orography of our republic of our country 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.070
 this type of greenhouses in tintÃ­n any terrain condition this we 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.129
 It allows optimizing land use as well as taking advantage of the value 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.730
 added that is being percent with the micro bottle system
