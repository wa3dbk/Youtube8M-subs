00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
let's see what I weigh in that this week

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.030 
let's see what I weigh in that this week
all<00:00:17.740> right

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.770 

all<00:00:24.040> right<00:00:24.280> 23<00:00:24.820> so<00:00:26.700> Wow<00:00:27.700> a<00:00:27.880> little<00:00:28.120> bit<00:00:28.240> less

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780 
all right 23 so Wow a little bit less

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.660 
all right 23 so Wow a little bit less
than<00:00:28.930> pound<00:00:29.260> now<00:00:29.740> I<00:00:29.770> knew<00:00:30.010> this<00:00:30.250> was<00:00:30.490> going<00:00:30.610> to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
than pound now I knew this was going to

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.560 
than pound now I knew this was going to
happen<00:00:30.820> eventually

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
happen eventually

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.779 
happen eventually
where<00:00:32.379> my<00:00:32.589> weight<00:00:32.829> gain<00:00:33.010> would<00:00:33.249> start<00:00:33.519> slowing

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
where my weight gain would start slowing

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.590 
where my weight gain would start slowing
down<00:00:35.609> as<00:00:36.609> we<00:00:36.850> all<00:00:36.969> know<00:00:37.089> muscle<00:00:37.449> weighs<00:00:37.570> more

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
down as we all know muscle weighs more

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.290 
down as we all know muscle weighs more
than<00:00:37.780> fat<00:00:37.929> and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:39.640> feel<00:00:39.969> like<00:00:40.059> I've<00:00:40.179> been

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
than fat and I feel like I've been

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.450 
than fat and I feel like I've been
losing<00:00:40.629> muscle<00:00:40.899> mass<00:00:40.929> but<00:00:41.379> I<00:00:41.409> feel<00:00:41.769> bigger<00:00:42.159> and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
losing muscle mass but I feel bigger and

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
losing muscle mass but I feel bigger and
I've<00:00:43.239> been<00:00:43.480> gaining<00:00:43.749> size<00:00:44.109> as<00:00:44.530> far<00:00:44.769> as<00:00:44.890> my<00:00:45.190> fat

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
I've been gaining size as far as my fat

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.660 
I've been gaining size as far as my fat
and<00:00:47.170> fat<00:00:47.409> doesn't<00:00:47.649> weigh<00:00:47.859> as<00:00:47.979> much<00:00:48.010> as<00:00:48.190> muscle

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
and fat doesn't weigh as much as muscle

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.430 
and fat doesn't weigh as much as muscle
so<00:00:48.789> as<00:00:48.940> I've<00:00:49.120> been<00:00:49.300> losing<00:00:49.659> muscle<00:00:50.409> mass

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
so as I've been losing muscle mass

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.379 
so as I've been losing muscle mass
slowly<00:00:51.100> it's<00:00:51.219> been<00:00:51.370> hard<00:00:51.639> and<00:00:51.789> harder<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.239> put

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.389 
slowly it's been hard and harder to put

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.770 
slowly it's been hard and harder to put
on<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.629> weight<00:00:52.780> at<00:00:53.319> least<00:00:53.499> that's<00:00:53.649> my<00:00:53.800> theory

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
on the weight at least that's my theory

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.200 
on the weight at least that's my theory
so<00:00:55.780> I<00:00:56.170> only<00:00:56.469> gain<00:00:56.710> you<00:00:56.979> know<00:00:57.100> about<00:00:57.280> 0.7<00:00:57.879> pounds

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
so I only gain you know about 0.7 pounds

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.520 
so I only gain you know about 0.7 pounds
this<00:00:58.269> week<00:00:58.389> and<00:00:58.780> I<00:00:58.870> know<00:00:59.019> I'm<00:00:59.079> going<00:00:59.289> to<00:00:59.350> get<00:00:59.469> a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
this week and I know I'm going to get a

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.959 
this week and I know I'm going to get a
lot<00:00:59.710> of<00:00:59.859> flack<00:01:00.069> from<00:01:00.219> people<00:01:00.549> saying<00:01:00.729> you're

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
lot of flack from people saying you're

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.610 
lot of flack from people saying you're
not<00:01:01.089> trying<00:01:01.389> hard<00:01:01.449> enough<00:01:01.659> and<00:01:02.139> you<00:01:02.319> know

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
not trying hard enough and you know

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.310 
not trying hard enough and you know
that's<00:01:02.799> not<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:02.979> case<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:04.570> just<00:01:05.140> knew<00:01:05.290> that

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
that's not the case I just knew that

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.480 
that's not the case I just knew that
eventually<00:01:05.710> was<00:01:05.950> going<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.130> hit<00:01:06.250> this<00:01:06.370> point

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
eventually was going to hit this point

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.210 
eventually was going to hit this point

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
like you know making a peanut butter

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.300 
like you know making a peanut butter
sandwich<00:01:51.940> or<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.690> frozen<00:01:53.440> dinner<00:01:53.560> even<00:01:53.890> seems

like<00:01:54.520> too<00:01:54.700> long<00:01:54.940> so<00:01:55.840> sometimes<00:01:56.290> I've<00:01:56.530> noticed

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
like too long so sometimes I've noticed

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.450 
like too long so sometimes I've noticed
this<00:01:57.040> past<00:01:57.310> week<00:01:57.490> that<00:01:57.640> I've<00:01:57.760> been<00:01:57.790> doing

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
this past week that I've been doing

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.300 
this past week that I've been doing
a little<00:01:58.670> bit<00:01:59.680> so<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.740> think<00:02:00.860> that's<00:02:01.130> also
