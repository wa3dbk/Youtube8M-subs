now<00:02:18.260> we'll<00:02:18.680> go<00:02:18.860> ahead<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.370> add<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.730> screen<00:02:20.660> so

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
now we'll go ahead and add a screen so

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.140 
now we'll go ahead and add a screen so
this<00:02:21.410> app<00:02:21.680> essentially<00:02:22.430> works<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:22.910> like

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
this app essentially works just like

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.460 
this app essentially works just like
that<00:02:24.019> your<00:02:24.140> home<00:02:24.380> screen<00:02:24.860> on<00:02:25.160> your<00:02:25.450> phone<00:02:26.470> you

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
that your home screen on your phone you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.990 
that your home screen on your phone you
can<00:02:27.650> add<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.160> screens<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.709> app<00:02:31.000> by

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
can add the screens to the app by

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.930 
can add the screens to the app by
selecting<00:02:32.660> settings

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
selecting settings

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.050 
selecting settings
add<00:02:35.940> display<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.960> then<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.740> can<00:02:37.920> add<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> an

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
add display and then you can add a an

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.870 
add display and then you can add a an
array<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.420> different<00:02:39.840> displays<00:02:40.440> on<00:02:40.650> here<00:02:41.010> you

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
array of different displays on here you

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.420 
array of different displays on here you
can<00:02:42.030> do<00:02:42.150> air<00:02:42.330> fuel<00:02:42.480> ratio<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.920> most<00:02:44.070> important

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
can do air fuel ratio the most important

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.730 
can do air fuel ratio the most important
one<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.670> drive<00:02:45.000> cycle<00:02:45.420> status<00:02:45.780> which<00:02:46.590> we

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
one is the drive cycle status which we

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.600 
one is the drive cycle status which we
really<00:02:46.980> have<00:02:47.190> downloaded<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.880> on<00:02:48.000> here<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:49.610> so

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
really have downloaded it on here and so

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.800 
really have downloaded it on here and so
go<00:02:50.670> back<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.150> app<00:02:51.950> back<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.640> which<00:02:54.630> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
go back to the app back and which is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.660 
go back to the app back and which is
this<00:02:55.050> one<00:02:55.260> right<00:02:55.320> here<00:02:55.640> obviously<00:02:56.640> I

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
this one right here obviously I

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.070 
this one right here obviously I
automatically<00:02:57.150> going<00:02:57.390> ahead<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.780> checked

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
automatically going ahead and checked

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.530 
automatically going ahead and checked
everything<00:02:58.350> no<00:02:58.680> misfires<00:02:59.070> no<00:02:59.430> nothing<00:02:59.790> so

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
everything no misfires no nothing so

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.870 
everything no misfires no nothing so
everything<00:03:00.990> is<00:03:01.110> good<00:03:01.320> now<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:02.460> it's<00:03:02.580> paired

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
everything is good now that it's paired

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.670 
everything is good now that it's paired
we'll<00:03:03.090> go<00:03:03.240> ahead<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.540> actually<00:03:04.020> create<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
we'll go ahead and actually create a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.320 
we'll go ahead and actually create a
check<00:03:04.950> engine<00:03:05.130> light<00:03:05.460> by<00:03:05.670> removing<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.150> mass

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
you to kind of get a better idea of what

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.050 
you to kind of get a better idea of what
the<00:04:22.660> situation<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.260> but<00:04:24.190> for<00:04:24.370> now<00:04:24.490> we<00:04:24.550> really

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
the situation is but for now we really

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.100 
the situation is but for now we really
know<00:04:25.180> what<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.450> is<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:25.750> we<00:04:25.780> should<00:04:25.990> go<00:04:26.050> ahead

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
know what it is so we should go ahead

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.170 
know what it is so we should go ahead
and<00:04:26.230> close<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:26.620> out<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:27.250> now<00:04:27.850> we<00:04:27.910> need<00:04:28.030> to

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
and close this out and now we need to

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.240 
and close this out and now we need to
clear<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.690> code<00:04:29.250> will<00:04:30.250> take<00:04:30.430> another<00:04:30.670> action

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
clear the code will take another action

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.430 
clear the code will take another action
clear<00:04:33.250> log<00:04:33.910> faults<00:04:34.530> yes<00:04:35.530> okay<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:37.380> now<00:04:38.380> the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
clear log faults yes okay and now the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.130 
clear log faults yes okay and now the
code<00:04:38.770> should<00:04:39.190> be<00:04:39.340> cleared<00:04:39.700> so<00:04:40.390> let's<00:04:40.690> see<00:04:40.870> if

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
code should be cleared so let's see if

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.550 
code should be cleared so let's see if
that<00:04:41.320> works<00:04:41.650> we'll<00:04:42.250> go<00:04:42.370> ahead<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:43.440> start<00:04:44.440> the

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
that works we'll go ahead and start the

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.159 
that works we'll go ahead and start the
car<00:04:44.770> back<00:04:44.950> up<00:04:47.669> as<00:04:48.669> you<00:04:49.000> can<00:04:49.150> see<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:49.960> check
