it a while and i just can I just can't
imagine<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.670> what<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.850> could<00:00:21.029> talk<00:00:21.180> about<00:00:21.390> for

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
imagine like what I could talk about for

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.750 
imagine like what I could talk about for
I<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:24.710> make<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> lot<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.430> based<00:00:26.640> on

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
I just make a lot of this just based on

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.179 
I just make a lot of this just based on
your<00:00:26.880> shot<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.480> there<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> big<00:00:28.740> person<00:00:29.130> I

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
your shot but there is a big person I

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.429 
your shot but there is a big person I
thing<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.970> think<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.570> important<00:00:31.260> as<00:00:31.410> well

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
thing that I think is important as well

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.520 
thing that I think is important as well
and<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.340> positioning<00:00:33.210> you'll<00:00:34.140> notice<00:00:34.440> a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
and that is positioning you'll notice a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.700 
and that is positioning you'll notice a
pinnacle<00:00:35.120> when<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.149> spawn<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.930> rocket<00:00:37.500> side

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
pinnacle when I spawn on the rocket side

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.119 
pinnacle when I spawn on the rocket side
I<00:00:38.329> like<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.450> try<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.660> take<00:00:39.840> over<00:00:39.960> big<00:00:40.530> tower<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
I like to try to take over big tower and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.040 
I like to try to take over big tower and
that's<00:00:41.760> what<00:00:42.000> I'm<00:00:42.149> i'll<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.899> demonstrating

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that's what I'm i'll be demonstrating

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.860 
that's what I'm i'll be demonstrating
this<00:00:43.500> whole<00:00:43.680> game<00:00:43.860> basically<00:00:44.629> sand<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.780> top

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
this whole game basically sand on top

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.100 
this whole game basically sand on top
this<00:00:46.260> tower<00:00:46.559> stop<00:00:47.300> taking<00:00:48.300> people<00:00:48.660> away<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
this tower stop taking people away and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.740 
this tower stop taking people away and
when<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.800> side<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> map<00:00:50.750> here

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
when you're on this side of the map here

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020 
when you're on this side of the map here
on<00:00:51.870> their<00:00:52.050> spawn<00:00:52.379> they'll<00:00:53.250> never<00:00:53.280> spawn<00:00:53.730> pass

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
on their spawn they'll never spawn pass

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.090 
on their spawn they'll never spawn pass
like<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> halfway<00:00:54.629> point<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.260> map<00:00:55.469> where

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
like the halfway point of a map where

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.389 
like the halfway point of a map where
you<00:00:56.250> spawn<00:00:56.510> originally<00:00:57.890> yeah<00:00:58.890> pinnacle<00:00:59.280> is

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
you spawn originally yeah pinnacle is

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.229 
you spawn originally yeah pinnacle is
one<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.609> those<00:00:59.699> maps<00:01:00.000> where<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:01.500> spawns<00:01:01.829> are

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
one of those maps where the spawns are

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.420 
one of those maps where the spawns are
one<00:01:03.239> sided<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:04.080> kind<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.500> like

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
one sided it's kind of like a like

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.460 
one sided it's kind of like a like
narrows<00:01:05.909> before<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> halo<00:01:07.020> 3<00:01:07.520> update<00:01:08.520> where

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
narrows before the halo 3 update where

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.570 
narrows before the halo 3 update where
that's<00:01:10.470> actually<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.890> terrible<00:01:11.280> example

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
that's actually a terrible example

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.760 
that's actually a terrible example
because<00:01:12.270> probably<00:01:13.200> happy<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.530> don't<00:01:13.619> know

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
because probably happy you don't know

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.800 
because probably happy you don't know
what<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:13.950> talking<00:01:14.189> about<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.909> uh<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.540> bones

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
what I'm talking about but uh this bones

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.850 
what I'm talking about but uh this bones
are<00:01:16.159> all<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.640> sided<00:01:17.909> meaning<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.860> you're

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
are all one sided meaning that you're

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.260 
are all one sided meaning that you're
not<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> spawn<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.640> their<00:01:20.790> side<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
not going to spawn on their side of the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.100 
not going to spawn on their side of the
map<00:01:21.509> there's<00:01:21.810> two<00:01:22.590> sides<00:01:22.830> basically<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.930> right

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
map there's two sides basically so right

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.749 
map there's two sides basically so right
now<00:01:25.140> I'm<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.650> I'm<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.189> their<00:01:26.310> side<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
now I'm just I'm on their side and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.100 
now I'm just I'm on their side and
they're<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> keep<00:01:27.420> spawning<00:01:27.659> over<00:01:27.990> here

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
they're going to keep spawning over here

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.010 
they're going to keep spawning over here
they<00:01:28.409> spawn<00:01:28.680> off<00:01:29.119> all<00:01:30.119> over<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.479> big<00:01:30.750> tower

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
they spawn off all over the big tower

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.200 
they spawn off all over the big tower
spawn<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.130> near<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> bottom<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.090> they

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
spawn like near the bottom and then they

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.289 
spawn like near the bottom and then they
also<00:01:33.329> spawn<00:01:33.860> near<00:01:34.860> their<00:01:35.040> sniper<00:01:35.310> spawn<00:01:35.729> down

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
also spawn near their sniper spawn down

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.420 
also spawn near their sniper spawn down
a<00:01:36.329> little<00:01:36.600> bit<00:01:36.840> towards<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> shotgun<00:01:38.189> but

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
a little bit towards the shotgun but

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
a little bit towards the shotgun but
they<00:01:38.579> won't<00:01:38.759> spawn<00:01:39.030> past<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> shotgun<00:01:40.290> point

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
they won't spawn past the shotgun point

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
they won't spawn past the shotgun point
spawn<00:01:40.740> top<00:01:40.979> middle<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.460> they'll<00:01:41.939> spawn<00:01:42.150> on

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
spawn top middle and they'll spawn on

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.429 
spawn top middle and they'll spawn on
the<00:01:42.479> span<00:01:42.750> she<00:01:42.990> path<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:45.320> basically<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the span she path with basically and

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.660 
the span she path with basically and
sniping<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.950> lot<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.520> just

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
sniping a lot of it it's just

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.330 
sniping a lot of it it's just
positioning<00:01:48.450> right<00:01:48.720> now<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:49.619> positioned<00:01:50.009> in

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
positioning right now I'm positioned in

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.940 
positioning right now I'm positioned in
a<00:01:50.430> very<00:01:50.670> good<00:01:51.060> area<00:01:51.479> where<00:01:51.720> these<00:01:52.470> kids<00:01:52.799> are

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
a very good area where these kids are

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.020 
a very good area where these kids are
having<00:01:53.070> trouble<00:01:53.460> taking<00:01:53.579> me<00:01:53.759> down<00:01:53.909> because

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
having trouble taking me down because

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.179 
having trouble taking me down because
there's<00:01:54.240> only<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.689> entry<00:01:55.350> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.829> where

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
there's only one entry if you like where

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.910 
there's only one entry if you like where
I<00:01:56.219> met<00:01:56.579> that's<00:01:56.880> up<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.479> pathway<00:01:57.920> spiraling

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
I met that's up this pathway spiraling

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.430 
I met that's up this pathway spiraling
up<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.159> towards<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.850> top<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.840> tower<00:02:01.049> so

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
up to towards the top of this tower so
