Prelude of the 1030 109 Prelude you'd

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.349 
Prelude of the 1030 109 Prelude you'd
like<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.940> see<00:00:15.619> some<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> visuals<00:00:17.279> more<00:00:18.240> up

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
like to see some of the visuals more up

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.340 
like to see some of the visuals more up
close<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.930> more<00:00:19.710> specific<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.900> this<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.109> for

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
close and more specific so this is for

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.769 
close and more specific so this is for
lean<00:00:22.500> dirt<00:00:22.680> 173<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:25.430> 1030<00:00:26.430> 109<00:00:27.150> Prelude

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
lean dirt 173 and the 1030 109 Prelude

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.560 
lean dirt 173 and the 1030 109 Prelude
so<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> very<00:00:29.400> visual<00:00:29.609> piece<00:00:30.119> there<00:00:30.449> are<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
so it's a very visual piece there are a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.740 
so it's a very visual piece there are a
lot<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.779> symbols<00:00:31.260> involved<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:33.480> first

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
lot of symbols involved and the first

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.650 
lot of symbols involved and the first
symbol<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.380> called<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.090> simple<00:00:36.090> front<00:00:36.390> flip

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
symbol is called the simple front flip

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.110 
symbol is called the simple front flip
this<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.739> simple<00:00:38.040> loop<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.640> an<00:00:38.879> arrow

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
this is just a simple loop with an arrow

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.200 
this is just a simple loop with an arrow
out<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:41.070> works<00:00:41.309> like<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.910> you're

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
out of it and it works like this you're

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.850 
out of it and it works like this you're
able<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> make<00:00:42.809> contact<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:43.590> flip

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
able to make contact and then flip

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.700 
able to make contact and then flip
straight<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.390> okay<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.840> first<00:00:46.020> measure

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
straight up okay so the first measure

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.279 
straight up okay so the first measure
excuse<00:00:47.610> me<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> first<00:00:47.969> count<00:00:48.270> goes<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> you

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
excuse me the first count goes so you

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.490 
excuse me the first count goes so you
toss<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> beat<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> stick<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.260> over<00:00:55.260> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
toss the beat of the stick up over and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.380 
toss the beat of the stick up over and
let<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.680> rotate<00:00:56.160> around<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.660> palm<00:00:57.980> like<00:00:58.980> this

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
let it rotate around your palm like this

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.200 
let it rotate around your palm like this
the<00:01:00.390> stick<00:01:00.750> should<00:01:01.079> not<00:01:01.379> leave<00:01:02.250> your<00:01:02.879> palm

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the stick should not leave your palm

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.710 
the stick should not leave your palm
okay<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.049> opposed<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:11.090> as<00:01:12.090> opposed<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
okay as opposed to the as opposed to the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.080 
okay as opposed to the as opposed to the
simple<00:01:13.049> half<00:01:13.320> flip<00:01:13.680> where<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.580> actually

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
simple half flip where you do actually

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.080 
simple half flip where you do actually
leave<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:16.710> palm<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> stick<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.790> actually

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
leave the palm and the stick do actually

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.469 
leave the palm and the stick do actually
separate<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:19.340> simple<00:01:20.340> half<00:01:20.549> flip<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.119> then

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
separate so simple half flip and then

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.260 
separate so simple half flip and then
simple<00:01:22.409> front<00:01:22.920> flip<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:26.000> sort<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.060> looks

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
simple front flip is this sort of looks

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.330 
simple front flip is this sort of looks
like<00:01:27.420> looks<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.470> you're<00:01:28.710> throwing<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.189> but

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
like looks like you're throwing it but

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
like looks like you're throwing it but
you're<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.610> alright<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:30.930> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
you're not alright and you can do this

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.830 
you're not alright and you can do this
with<00:01:31.229> both<00:01:31.259> hands<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.280> occurs<00:01:32.840> in

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
with both hands I think it occurs in

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:46.490 
with both hands I think it occurs in
both<00:01:33.900> hands<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.149> simple<00:01:45.750> front

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
both hands so that is the simple front

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.899 
both hands so that is the simple front
flip<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> next<00:01:47.070> thing<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.490> is

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
flip the next thing we have is

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.809 
flip the next thing we have is
the<00:01:48.590> double<00:01:49.640> flip<00:01:51.710> which<00:01:52.710> occurs<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.579> left

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
the double flip which occurs in the left

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.669 
the double flip which occurs in the left
hand<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.689> way<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.109> one<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.530> like

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
hand and the way I do this one is like

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.969 
hand and the way I do this one is like
this<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.880> my<00:01:57.210> being<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> stick<00:01:58.200> comes<00:01:58.500> over

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
this so my being of the stick comes over

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.380 
this so my being of the stick comes over
and<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.280> wrap<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.579> around<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.060> bring<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.359> down

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
and I wrap it around and bring it down

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.149 
and I wrap it around and bring it down
under<00:02:00.810> I've<00:02:01.170> seen<00:02:01.380> people<00:02:01.649> do<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.799> other

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
under I've seen people do this other

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.090 
under I've seen people do this other
ways<00:02:02.429> a<00:02:02.880> lot<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.329> people<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.959> see<00:02:04.020> start<00:02:04.619> under

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
ways a lot of people I see start under

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.339 
ways a lot of people I see start under
which<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:06.179> fine<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:06.689> me<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.170> long

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
which is just fine with me just so long

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.430 
which is just fine with me just so long
as<00:02:07.500> there's<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.920> long<00:02:08.399> flipping<00:02:09.000> gesture<00:02:09.869> so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
as there's a long flipping gesture so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.270 
as there's a long flipping gesture so
like<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.819> how<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> do<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:13.069> if<00:02:14.069> there

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
like that is how I do it but if there

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.430 
like that is how I do it but if there
was<00:02:14.400> an<00:02:15.120> easier<00:02:15.480> way<00:02:15.510> for<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:15.959> think<00:02:16.110> it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
was an easier way for you I think it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.440 
was an easier way for you I think it
would<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.650> fine<00:02:16.890> but<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:18.090> other<00:02:18.239> thing

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
would be fine but the other thing

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.420 
would be fine but the other thing
happening<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.049> beat<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.950> right<00:02:20.160> hand

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
happening in that beat is the right hand

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.880 
happening in that beat is the right hand
zigzag<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.900> symbol<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.650> looks

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
zigzag this is the symbol that looks

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.520 
zigzag this is the symbol that looks
like<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.220> jagged<00:02:24.060> up<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.569> down<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.410> it's

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
like this jagged up and down and it's

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.020 
like this jagged up and down and it's
just<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.310> kind<00:02:26.519> of<00:02:26.549> zigzag

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
just like this you just kind of zigzag

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:53.449 
just like this you just kind of zigzag
across<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.629> drumhead<00:02:27.989> no<00:02:28.610> fancy<00:02:31.040> just<00:02:52.459> like

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
across the drumhead no fancy just like

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.479 
across the drumhead no fancy just like
that<00:02:53.639> so<00:02:53.940> again<00:02:54.000> simple<00:02:54.859> back<00:02:55.859> to<00:02:56.040> front<00:02:56.280> and

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
that so again simple back to front and

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.360 
that so again simple back to front and
then<00:02:57.090> front<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.690> back<00:02:57.900> again<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:59.190> should

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
then front to back again this should

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.920 
then front to back again this should
change<00:02:59.609> your<00:02:59.849> positions<00:03:00.329> this<00:03:00.510> whole<00:03:00.690> piece

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
change your positions this whole piece

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.199 
change your positions this whole piece
is<00:03:01.170> sort<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.470> about<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.280> idea<00:03:02.579> of<00:03:02.639> backwards

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
is sort of about the idea of backwards

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.930 
is sort of about the idea of backwards
and<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:04.109> reason<00:03:04.950> it's<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.340> wrote<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.880> on

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
and the reason it's I wrote it on

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.430 
and the reason it's I wrote it on
Halloween<00:03:06.419> it's<00:03:06.720> because<00:03:06.900> everything<00:03:07.139> sort

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
Halloween it's because everything sort

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.349 
Halloween it's because everything sort
of<00:03:07.530> backwards<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.220> know<00:03:08.340> all<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.609> sudden<00:03:08.730> bad

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
of backwards you know all the sudden bad

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.140 
of backwards you know all the sudden bad
is<00:03:09.630> good<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.349> evil<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.220> fun<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.849> all<00:03:12.030> these

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
is good and evil is fun and all these

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.180 
is good and evil is fun and all these
things<00:03:12.389> so<00:03:12.480> anyway<00:03:13.139> the<00:03:13.380> whole<00:03:13.530> piece<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.799> sort

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
things so anyway the whole piece is sort

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.030 
things so anyway the whole piece is sort
of<00:03:14.280> about<00:03:14.489> backwards<00:03:15.150> but<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.410> theme<00:03:16.680> kind<00:03:16.889> of

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
of about backwards but the theme kind of

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.620 
of about backwards but the theme kind of
becomes<00:03:17.310> backwards<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.120> there's<00:03:18.239> tension

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
becomes backwards and there's tension

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.879 
becomes backwards and there's tension
and<00:03:18.750> release<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.319> there's<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.560> front<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.829> the

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
and release and there's the front of the

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.860 
and release and there's the front of the
state<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.190> back<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.609> stick<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:21.120> center

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
state the back of the stick the center

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.809 
state the back of the stick the center
and<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.079> edge<00:03:22.109> and<00:03:22.530> all<00:03:22.680> these<00:03:23.010> things<00:03:23.310> sort

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
and the edge and all these things sort

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.569 
and the edge and all these things sort
of<00:03:23.910> what<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.209> about<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:24.859> yeah<00:03:25.859> this<00:03:26.099> visual

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
of what this about so yeah this visual

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.860 
of what this about so yeah this visual
is<00:03:26.700> sort<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:26.940> what<00:03:27.090> takes<00:03:27.359> us<00:03:27.599> to<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:29.690> part<00:03:30.690> of

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
is sort of what takes us to that part of

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.860 
is sort of what takes us to that part of
the<00:03:31.530> theme<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.000> sticks<00:03:33.299> version<00:03:33.720> our

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
the theme but the sticks version our

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.490 
the theme but the sticks version our
back<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.230> front<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:34.739> done<00:03:35.160> with<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.549> simple

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
back to front is done with this simple

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.539 
back to front is done with this simple
simple<00:03:37.500> back<00:03:37.950> foot<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:38.970> we've<00:03:39.870> got<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.230> be

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
simple back foot so we've got to be

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.370 
simple back foot so we've got to be
double<00:03:41.549> flip<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.329> simple<00:03:42.720> front<00:03:42.959> flip<00:03:43.200> this

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
double flip the simple front flip this

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.150 
double flip the simple front flip this
exhibit<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:45.030> half<00:03:45.299> flip<00:03:45.599> like<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.290> so

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
exhibit and the half flip like that so

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.200 
exhibit and the half flip like that so
the<00:03:47.280> whole<00:03:47.489> first<00:03:47.879> two<00:03:48.209> bars<00:03:48.419> go

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.400 

third<00:03:55.210> bar<00:03:55.450> nothing

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
third bar nothing

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.440 
third bar nothing
flip<00:03:56.830> wise<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.430> it's<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.730> fourth<00:03:58.000> bar<00:03:58.240> there

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
flip wise and it's the fourth bar there

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.900 
flip wise and it's the fourth bar there
is<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.600> new<00:03:58.810> flip<00:03:59.080> it<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.770> called<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.340> simple

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
is a new flip it is called the simple

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.940 
is a new flip it is called the simple
back<00:04:01.240> flip<00:04:01.660> is<00:04:01.900> just<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.260> opposite<00:04:02.709> of<00:04:02.830> the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
back flip is just the opposite of the

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.860 
back flip is just the opposite of the
simple<00:04:03.310> front<00:04:03.610> flip<00:04:03.880> you<00:04:04.330> go<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.510> like<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.780> year

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
simple front flip you go to like a year

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.190 
simple front flip you go to like a year
and<00:04:05.470> then<00:04:05.620> scoop<00:04:05.950> under<00:04:06.760> so<00:04:07.270> before<00:04:07.780> we<00:04:08.020> went

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
and then scoop under so before we went

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.810 
and then scoop under so before we went
them<00:04:08.380> away<00:04:08.560> from<00:04:08.800> ourselves<00:04:09.250> this<00:04:09.370> time<00:04:09.430> go

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
them away from ourselves this time go

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:21.240 
them away from ourselves this time go
towards<00:04:10.480> our<00:04:10.750> body<00:04:19.769> separate<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:20.980> it<00:04:21.070> does

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
towards our body separate and it does

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.810 
towards our body separate and it does
rotate<00:04:21.519> around<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.600> inside<00:04:22.960> of<00:04:23.230> your<00:04:23.380> palm

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
rotate around the inside of your palm

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.550 
rotate around the inside of your palm
just<00:04:24.820> opposite<00:04:25.300> of<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.750> front<00:04:25.960> flip<00:04:26.169> so<00:04:26.320> front

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
just opposite of the front flip so front

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.880 
just opposite of the front flip so front
flip<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:26.950> back<00:04:27.850> flip<00:04:28.120> like<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:29.020> so<00:04:29.380> the

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
flip and back flip like that so the

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.880 
flip and back flip like that so the
whole<00:04:30.570> let's<00:04:31.570> see<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.870> whole<00:04:32.050> first<00:04:32.620> phrase

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
whole let's see the whole first phrase

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:45.510 
whole let's see the whole first phrase
is<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:43.750> that<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:44.350> that<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.950> next<00:04:45.220> new<00:04:45.490> thing

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
is and that is that the next new thing

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.820 
is and that is that the next new thing
is<00:04:46.620> in<00:04:47.620> measure<00:04:47.830> 14<00:04:49.020> we<00:04:50.020> see<00:04:50.200> what<00:04:50.350> I<00:04:50.380> call

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
is in measure 14 we see what I call

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.250 
is in measure 14 we see what I call
those<00:04:53.760> those<00:04:54.760> are<00:04:54.790> called<00:04:55.090> your<00:04:55.240> flat<00:04:55.570> tosses

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
those those are called your flat tosses

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.100 
those those are called your flat tosses
in<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.890> instructions<00:04:57.490> so<00:04:57.970> you<00:04:58.510> throw<00:04:58.960> the

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
in the instructions so you throw the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.110 
in the instructions so you throw the
stick<00:04:59.380> as<00:04:59.620> horizontally<00:05:00.520> as<00:05:00.729> you<00:05:00.880> can

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
stick as horizontally as you can

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.180 
stick as horizontally as you can
straight<00:05:01.960> up<00:05:02.140> and<00:05:02.350> then<00:05:02.770> catch<00:05:03.010> it

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
straight up and then catch it

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.070 
straight up and then catch it
horizontally<00:05:03.760> as<00:05:03.850> well<00:05:04.090> just<00:05:04.660> like<00:05:04.870> the

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
horizontally as well just like the

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.320 
horizontally as well just like the
simple<00:05:05.500> back<00:05:05.890> flips<00:05:06.280> it's<00:05:06.880> important<00:05:07.300> that

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
simple back flips it's important that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.570 
simple back flips it's important that
you<00:05:07.479> finish<00:05:07.810> in<00:05:08.229> time<00:05:08.590> so<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.130> back<00:05:09.310> flips

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
you finish in time so the back flips

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.650 
you finish in time so the back flips
head<00:05:10.830> so<00:05:11.830> more<00:05:12.370> than<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.610> actual<00:05:12.820> visual<00:05:13.479> of

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
head so more than the actual visual of

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.330 
head so more than the actual visual of
the<00:05:13.780> toss<00:05:14.020> or<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.380> flip<00:05:14.590> it's<00:05:14.860> about<00:05:15.070> the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
the toss or the flip it's about the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.790 
the toss or the flip it's about the
stopping<00:05:15.820> of<00:05:15.970> it<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.630> sound<00:05:17.200> matching

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
stopping of it and the sound matching

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.250 
stopping of it and the sound matching
with<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.580> abrupt<00:05:19.150> stop<00:05:19.419> of<00:05:19.630> it<00:05:19.780> so

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
with the the abrupt stop of it so

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.640 
with the the abrupt stop of it so
measure<00:05:20.650> 14<00:05:21.280> is<00:05:24.930> straight<00:05:25.930> up<00:05:25.960> catch<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.560> in

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
measure 14 is straight up catch it in

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.469 
measure 14 is straight up catch it in
time<00:05:26.680> so<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.640> other<00:05:27.790> ones<00:05:27.940> straight<00:05:28.120> up<00:05:28.300> catch

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
time so the other ones straight up catch

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.330 
time so the other ones straight up catch
it<00:05:28.660> in<00:05:28.780> time<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.229> then<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.830> last<00:05:30.010> one<00:05:30.250> of

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
it in time and then the last one of

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.890 
it in time and then the last one of
course<00:05:31.500> catch<00:05:32.500> like<00:05:32.710> that<00:05:32.890> so<00:05:33.400> let's<00:05:34.360> see<00:05:34.630> I'm

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
course catch like that so let's see I'm

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.380 
course catch like that so let's see I'm
just<00:05:34.960> back<00:05:35.289> up<00:05:35.530> to<00:05:35.650> measure<00:05:35.770> 13<00:05:36.550> this<00:05:36.850> is<00:05:36.880> a

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
just back up to measure 13 this is a

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.000 
just back up to measure 13 this is a
variation<00:05:37.870> on<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.229> theme<00:05:38.260> again<00:05:38.620> with

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
variation on the theme again with

00:05:39.010 --> 00:06:02.030 
variation on the theme again with
measure<00:05:39.190> 14<00:05:39.700> in<00:05:39.970> it<00:05:40.120> so<00:05:40.300> here's<00:05:40.510> 13<00:05:41.020> and<00:05:41.200> 14

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.970 

those<00:06:03.040> are<00:06:03.250> all<00:06:03.430> of<00:06:03.820> the<00:06:04.690> flips<00:06:05.380> the<00:06:05.710> last

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980 
those are all of the flips the last

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.150 
those are all of the flips the last
thing<00:06:06.310> is<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.850> rim<00:06:07.270> role<00:06:07.630> in<00:06:07.990> this<00:06:08.290> piece<00:06:08.650> and

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
thing is the rim role in this piece and

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.550 
thing is the rim role in this piece and
again<00:06:09.430> this<00:06:09.670> is<00:06:09.820> another<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:11.050> Matic<00:06:11.380> way<00:06:11.500> to

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
again this is another the Matic way to

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.380 
again this is another the Matic way to
have<00:06:11.770> back<00:06:11.980> to<00:06:12.160> front<00:06:12.400> because<00:06:12.760> we<00:06:12.910> use<00:06:13.090> the

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.540 

roll<00:06:16.390> back<00:06:16.570> and<00:06:16.780> forth<00:06:16.840> on<00:06:17.170> the<00:06:17.290> rim<00:06:17.500> like<00:06:17.830> this

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
roll back and forth on the rim like this

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.040 
roll back and forth on the rim like this
the<00:06:19.480> first<00:06:19.810> place<00:06:20.110> this<00:06:20.380> occurs<00:06:20.860> is<00:06:22.050> measure

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
the first place this occurs is measure

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:39.540 
the first place this occurs is measure
66<00:06:24.040> we<00:06:24.730> have<00:06:36.030> this<00:06:37.030> happens<00:06:37.450> a<00:06:37.780> lot<00:06:38.290> in<00:06:38.890> in<00:06:39.370> both

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
66 we have this happens a lot in in both

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:46.950 
66 we have this happens a lot in in both
hands<00:06:39.820> we<00:06:40.000> have<00:06:44.010> so<00:06:45.010> this<00:06:45.610> is<00:06:45.850> a<00:06:46.030> you<00:06:46.510> know<00:06:46.570> it's

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
hands we have so this is a you know it's

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.870 
hands we have so this is a you know it's
a<00:06:47.050> trick<00:06:47.680> that's<00:06:48.010> been<00:06:48.220> used<00:06:48.340> in<00:06:48.520> other<00:06:48.610> pieces

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
a trick that's been used in other pieces

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.030 
a trick that's been used in other pieces
as<00:06:49.120> well<00:06:49.330> if<00:06:49.750> your<00:06:49.960> regular<00:06:50.140> striking<00:06:50.919> spot

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
as well if your regular striking spot

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.780 
as well if your regular striking spot
okay<00:06:54.040> just<00:06:54.220> like<00:06:54.310> you're<00:06:54.430> doing<00:06:54.610> a<00:06:54.669> regular

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.790 
okay just like you're doing a regular

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.220 
okay just like you're doing a regular
stroke<00:06:55.270> and<00:06:55.540> then<00:06:55.630> you're<00:06:55.720> simply<00:06:55.900> going<00:06:56.169> to

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
stroke and then you're simply going to

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.740 
stroke and then you're simply going to
let<00:06:56.440> the<00:06:56.620> backend<00:06:57.130> fall<00:06:57.490> into<00:06:57.760> place<00:06:57.910> and<00:06:58.330> this

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
let the backend fall into place and this

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.770 
let the backend fall into place and this
should<00:06:58.960> cut<00:06:59.290> it<00:06:59.580> right<00:07:00.580> in<00:07:00.640> half<00:07:00.880> as<00:07:01.480> far<00:07:01.660> as

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
should cut it right in half as far as

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:10.980 
should cut it right in half as far as
time<00:07:06.030> okay<00:07:07.030> and<00:07:07.740> that<00:07:08.740> is<00:07:09.060> everything<00:07:10.060> visual

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
time okay and that is everything visual

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.159 
time okay and that is everything visual
in<00:07:11.320> this<00:07:11.919> piece<00:07:12.190> so<00:07:12.540> thanks<00:07:13.540> for<00:07:13.660> the<00:07:13.720> question
