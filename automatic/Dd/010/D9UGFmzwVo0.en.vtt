say it again the hootch the Hoosick

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.970 
say it again the hootch the Hoosick
mountains<00:03:43.420> this<00:03:43.599> is<00:03:43.659> the<00:03:44.200> mystic<00:03:44.709> trail

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
mountains this is the mystic trail

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.429 
mountains this is the mystic trail
coincides<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.819> 80<00:03:45.939> through<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.019> area<00:03:47.290> and

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
coincides the 80 through this area and

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.520 
coincides the 80 through this area and
it's<00:03:47.680> definitely<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.129> hardest<00:03:48.370> hiking<00:03:48.879> of

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
it's definitely the hardest hiking of

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.849 
it's definitely the hardest hiking of
anything<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:50.769> far<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.340> think<00:03:52.590> because<00:03:53.590> it's

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
anything so far I think because it's

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.830 
anything so far I think because it's
just<00:03:54.099> straight<00:03:54.730> up<00:03:54.760> but<00:03:55.090> it's<00:03:55.239> actual<00:03:55.629> like

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
just straight up but it's actual like

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.349 
just straight up but it's actual like
climbing<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.549> whites<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:58.120> would<00:03:58.269> go

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
climbing and the whites it would go

straight up a lot of times it wasn't
quite<00:04:00.549> as<00:04:00.790> much<00:04:00.970> climbing<00:04:01.299> as<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.920> is<00:04:03.069> here

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
quite as much climbing as it is here

real nice
through<00:04:10.510> this<00:04:10.629> whole<00:04:10.870> area<00:04:11.319> it's<00:04:11.500> looks<00:04:12.430> like

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
through this whole area it's looks like

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
this a lot and the rest of time it's

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:39.740 
this a lot and the rest of time it's
just<00:04:19.329> Christmas<00:04:19.720> tree

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.480 

the<00:04:40.750> section<00:04:41.320> is<00:04:41.350> definitely<00:04:41.889> very<00:04:41.919> familiar

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
the section is definitely very familiar

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.110 
the section is definitely very familiar
to<00:04:42.639> like<00:04:43.919> mount<00:04:44.919> Rogers<00:04:45.130> State<00:04:45.550> Park<00:04:45.580> in

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
to like mount Rogers State Park in

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.070 
to like mount Rogers State Park in
Virginia<00:04:47.010> where<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.160> ponies<00:04:48.490> are<00:04:48.810> it's<00:04:49.810> very

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
Virginia where the ponies are it's very

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.980 
Virginia where the ponies are it's very
similar<00:04:50.380> terrain<00:04:50.830> it's<00:04:51.040> just<00:04:51.300> not<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.330> swampy

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
similar terrain it's just not a swampy

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:09.560 
similar terrain it's just not a swampy
like<00:04:53.169> this<00:04:53.350> would<00:04:53.500> all<00:04:53.590> just<00:04:53.710> be<00:04:53.830> grass<00:04:54.190> there

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.990 

well<00:05:11.040> it's<00:05:12.040> supposed<00:05:12.100> to<00:05:12.280> be<00:05:12.400> about<00:05:12.490> 88

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
well it's supposed to be about 88

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.650 
well it's supposed to be about 88
degrees<00:05:13.330> today<00:05:13.540> so<00:05:15.270> it's<00:05:16.270> really<00:05:16.419> warm

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
degrees today so it's really warm

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.630 
degrees today so it's really warm
already<00:05:17.110> it's<00:05:17.320> 11:10<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:20.460> second<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:21.520> might

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
already it's 11:10 and second you might

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.770 
already it's 11:10 and second you might
be<00:05:21.760> able<00:05:21.820> to<00:05:21.970> see<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.150> mountain<00:05:22.419> we're<00:05:22.600> about

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
be able to see the mountain we're about

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.620 
be able to see the mountain we're about
to<00:05:22.990> hike<00:05:23.169> to<00:05:23.760> it's<00:05:24.760> kind<00:05:24.940> of<00:05:25.000> in<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.240> distance

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
to hike to it's kind of in the distance

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.890 
to hike to it's kind of in the distance
over<00:05:25.780> there<00:05:26.070> it's<00:05:27.070> uh<00:05:27.190> over<00:05:27.580> 4,000<00:05:28.479> feet<00:05:28.510> and

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
over there it's uh over 4,000 feet and

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.469 
over there it's uh over 4,000 feet and
there's<00:05:29.020> a<00:05:30.300> observation<00:05:31.300> tower<00:05:31.540> and<00:05:33.060> up<00:05:34.060> there

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
there's a observation tower and up there

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.920 
there's a observation tower and up there
so<00:05:34.690> we're<00:05:34.780> gonna<00:05:34.840> go<00:05:35.050> check<00:05:35.080> that<00:05:35.410> out<00:05:36.930> anyways

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
so we're gonna go check that out anyways

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.420 
so we're gonna go check that out anyways
it<00:05:38.110> looks<00:05:38.290> like<00:05:38.470> that's<00:05:38.680> about<00:05:38.770> it<00:05:39.040> up<00:05:39.190> here

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
it looks like that's about it up here

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.210 
it looks like that's about it up here
I'll<00:05:40.060> be<00:05:40.240> back<00:05:40.419> in<00:05:40.810> a<00:05:40.960> second<00:05:41.350> at<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.590> hardest

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
I'll be back in a second at the hardest

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.760 
I'll be back in a second at the hardest
mile<00:05:42.400> section
