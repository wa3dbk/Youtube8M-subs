on<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.260> pipe<00:00:50.469> it's<00:00:51.460> what<00:00:51.610> I<00:00:51.640> was<00:00:51.790> hoping<00:00:52.089> for

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
on the pipe it's what I was hoping for

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.939 
on the pipe it's what I was hoping for
I<00:00:52.479> wasn't<00:00:52.930> expecting<00:00:53.409> massive<00:00:53.769> horsepower

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
I wasn't expecting massive horsepower

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.700 
I wasn't expecting massive horsepower
gains<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:55.629> I<00:00:55.780> think<00:00:55.839> that's<00:00:56.110> what<00:00:56.379> we<00:00:56.530> got

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
gains and and I think that's what we got

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.950 
gains and and I think that's what we got
it<00:00:57.610> was<00:00:57.729> actually<00:00:58.269> not<00:00:58.390> too<00:00:58.510> hard<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.750> keep

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
it was actually not too hard to keep

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.100 
it was actually not too hard to keep
into<00:00:59.229> the<00:00:59.260> in<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.039> rev<00:01:00.159> range<00:01:00.190> I<00:01:00.610> found<00:01:00.940> that

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
into the in the rev range I found that

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.439 
into the in the rev range I found that
if<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.199> wanted<00:01:02.589> to<00:01:02.769> use<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.820> bottom<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.180> it

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
if you wanted to use the bottom in it

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.490 
if you wanted to use the bottom in it
was<00:01:04.629> non-existent

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
was non-existent

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.859 
was non-existent
I<00:01:05.619> mean<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.369> it's<00:01:06.550> a<00:01:06.759> good<00:01:06.940> thing<00:01:07.149> because<00:01:07.300> on

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
I mean and it's a good thing because on

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.300 
I mean and it's a good thing because on
the<00:01:08.050> one<00:01:08.259> two<00:01:08.380> fives<00:01:08.649> they<00:01:08.860> want<00:01:09.039> to<00:01:09.100> put<00:01:09.220> all

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
the one two fives they want to put all

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.279 
the one two fives they want to put all
their<00:01:09.429> effort<00:01:09.759> up<00:01:09.909> high<00:01:10.090> so<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.960> puddings

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
their effort up high so the puddings

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.399 
their effort up high so the puddings
obviously<00:01:11.770> not<00:01:12.390> trained<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.569> way<00:01:13.659> so<00:01:13.720> what

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
obviously not trained that way so what

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:15.870 
obviously not trained that way so what
you're<00:01:14.560> going<00:01:14.679> to<00:01:14.740> get<00:01:14.950> with<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.310> 150<00:01:15.850> and

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
you're going to get with the 150 and

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.020 
you're going to get with the 150 and
this<00:01:16.479> is<00:01:16.659> what<00:01:16.810> I<00:01:16.840> found<00:01:17.110> in<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.920> mid-range<00:01:18.100> it

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
this is what I found in the mid-range it

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
this is what I found in the mid-range it
does<00:01:19.360> come<00:01:19.720> on

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
does come on

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.630 
does come on
but<00:01:20.380> smoother<00:01:20.649> than<00:01:20.890> you'd<00:01:21.069> normally<00:01:21.250> get

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
but smoother than you'd normally get

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.809 
but smoother than you'd normally get
maybe<00:01:22.030> with<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.300> 1<00:01:22.539> 2<00:01:22.659> 5<00:01:22.869> 2<00:01:23.080> stroke<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.640> they

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
maybe with a 1 2 5 2 stroke and so they

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.160 
maybe with a 1 2 5 2 stroke and so they
had<00:01:24.970> enough<00:01:25.210> doggy<00:01:25.420> this<00:01:25.630> sort<00:01:25.810> of<00:01:25.869> hold<00:01:26.020> its

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
had enough doggy this sort of hold its

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.320 
had enough doggy this sort of hold its
own<00:01:26.289> and<00:01:26.560> then<00:01:27.250> when<00:01:27.399> it<00:01:27.490> got<00:01:27.580> up<00:01:27.759> top<00:01:28.000> it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
own and then when it got up top it

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.090 
own and then when it got up top it
wasn't<00:01:28.750> huge<00:01:29.020> amount<00:01:29.440> of<00:01:29.500> horsepower<00:01:29.800> that

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
wasn't huge amount of horsepower that

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.469 
wasn't huge amount of horsepower that
will<00:01:30.250> pull<00:01:30.429> you<00:01:30.580> through<00:01:30.610> any<00:01:31.119> more<00:01:31.330> than

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
will pull you through any more than

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.830 
will pull you through any more than
maybe<00:01:32.380> some<00:01:32.679> other<00:01:32.950> bikes<00:01:33.310> would<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.720> was

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
maybe some other bikes would but it was

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.690 
maybe some other bikes would but it was
a<00:01:34.869> lot<00:01:34.990> easy<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.350> keep<00:01:35.470> it<00:01:35.649> there<00:01:35.860> one<00:01:36.520> of<00:01:36.640> the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
a lot easy to keep it there one of the

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.190 
a lot easy to keep it there one of the
things<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.030> helped<00:01:37.300> also<00:01:37.629> to<00:01:37.690> keep<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:38.050> there

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
things that helped also to keep it there

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.410 
things that helped also to keep it there
was<00:01:38.349> the<00:01:38.440> class<00:01:38.709> it<00:01:39.340> just<00:01:39.580> felt<00:01:39.819> fear<00:01:40.300> the

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
was the class it just felt fear the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.210 
was the class it just felt fear the
light<00:01:40.629> and<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.349> funny<00:01:41.500> thing<00:01:41.679> about<00:01:41.709> it<00:01:42.099> is

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
light and the funny thing about it is

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.580 
light and the funny thing about it is
it's<00:01:42.399> not<00:01:42.459> even<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.819> hydraulic<00:01:43.330> it's<00:01:43.780> got<00:01:44.470> quite

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
it's not even a hydraulic it's got quite

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.430 
it's not even a hydraulic it's got quite
a<00:01:44.709> long<00:01:44.920> actuator<00:01:45.429> arm<00:01:45.670> on<00:01:45.849> it<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.149> so<00:01:46.509> I<00:01:46.750> just

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
a long actuator arm on it and so I just

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440 
a long actuator arm on it and so I just
found<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.739> it<00:01:48.160> was<00:01:48.310> almost<00:01:48.849> like<00:01:49.149> I<00:01:49.270> could

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
found that it was almost like I could

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.089 
found that it was almost like I could
look<00:01:49.929> down<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.319> check<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:50.709> it<00:01:50.830> was<00:01:50.890> actually

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
look down to check that it was actually

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.880 
look down to check that it was actually
I<00:01:51.700> was<00:01:51.910> using<00:01:52.209> it<00:01:52.450> because<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.530> just<00:01:53.619> feels

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
I was using it because it just feels

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.090 
I was using it because it just feels
really<00:01:54.250> light

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
really light

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.150 
really light

just<00:02:00.160> like<00:02:00.310> you'd<00:02:00.610> expect<00:02:00.850> with<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.270> one<00:02:01.390> to

today one of the interesting things I
noticed<00:04:32.720> about<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:33.140> bike<00:04:33.740> was<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.130> radiator

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
noticed about the bike was the radiator

rubber<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:37.040> you'd<00:04:37.220> see<00:04:37.490> on<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:38.180> normal<00:04:38.450> bike

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
rubber that you'd see on a normal bike

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.480 
rubber that you'd see on a normal bike
there<00:04:39.230> are<00:04:39.290> a<00:04:39.320> lot<00:04:39.440> of<00:04:39.470> thinner<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:39.980> they're

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
there are a lot of thinner and they're

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.060 
there are a lot of thinner and they're
more<00:04:40.640> of<00:04:40.730> a<00:04:40.790> sort<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.210> hotter<00:04:41.960> silicone<00:04:42.860> or

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
more of a sort of a hotter silicone or

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.860 
more of a sort of a hotter silicone or
something<00:04:43.730> like<00:04:43.850> that<00:04:43.910> they<00:04:44.419> obviously<00:04:44.570> do

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
something like that they obviously do

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.210 
something like that they obviously do
the<00:04:44.990> job<00:04:45.200> there<00:04:45.470> probably<00:04:45.740> be<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:45.890> bit<00:04:46.040> lighter

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
the job there probably be a bit lighter

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.940 
the job there probably be a bit lighter
and<00:04:46.760> my<00:04:47.510> only<00:04:47.630> concern<00:04:47.990> possibly<00:04:48.470> is<00:04:48.620> whether

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
and my only concern possibly is whether

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.190 
and my only concern possibly is whether
they<00:04:49.130> can<00:04:49.190> get<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:49.669> develop<00:04:50.300> cracks<00:04:50.510> or<00:04:50.930> bends

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
they can get it develop cracks or bends

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
it's it's so obvious to see because

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.240 
it's it's so obvious to see because
there's<00:04:56.960> such<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.110> big<00:04:57.320> open<00:04:57.650> space<00:04:57.680> in<00:04:58.100> there

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
there's such a big open space in there

underneath to the fuel tank and it was

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.060 
underneath to the fuel tank and it was
just<00:05:03.169> so<00:05:03.290> much<00:05:03.440> room<00:05:03.680> to<00:05:03.710> play<00:05:03.919> with

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
just so much room to play with

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
to take the tank off so we've learned

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.620 
to take the tank off so we've learned
the<00:05:08.930> subframe<00:05:09.260> so<00:05:10.220> it's<00:05:10.910> far<00:05:11.330> as<00:05:11.450> user

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
one of the things about the bike was

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:02.820 
one of the things about the bike was
that<00:06:01.630> I<00:06:01.660> found<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.080> gears<00:06:02.289> we're<00:06:02.530> a<00:06:02.560> bit

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
that I found the gears we're a bit

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.089 
that I found the gears we're a bit
clunky<00:06:03.250> and<00:06:03.750> didn't<00:06:04.750> feel<00:06:04.870> completely<00:06:05.590> 100%

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
clunky and didn't feel completely 100%

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.920 
clunky and didn't feel completely 100%
comfortable<00:06:06.430> with<00:06:06.699> them<00:06:06.910> especially<00:06:07.810> with

comfortable with them especially with

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.240 
comfortable with them especially with
the<00:06:08.020> fact<00:06:08.199> that<00:06:08.289> you're<00:06:08.500> dancing<00:06:08.889> on<00:06:09.009> them<00:06:09.099> so

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
the fact that you're dancing on them so

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.189 
the fact that you're dancing on them so
much<00:06:09.430> I<00:06:09.789> guess<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.300> puts<00:06:10.539> a<00:06:10.690> bit<00:06:10.840> more<00:06:10.990> load

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
much I guess that puts a bit more load

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.810 
much I guess that puts a bit more load
on<00:06:11.229> them<00:06:11.530> so<00:06:11.740> you're<00:06:12.250> going<00:06:12.400> to<00:06:12.490> get<00:06:12.610> a<00:06:12.639> little

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
on them so you're going to get a little

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.189 
on them so you're going to get a little
bit<00:06:13.000> of<00:06:13.090> trouble<00:06:13.419> and<00:06:13.630> then<00:06:13.810> combined<00:06:14.139> with

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
bit of trouble and then combined with

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.950 
bit of trouble and then combined with
the<00:06:14.500> slightly<00:06:15.250> strange<00:06:15.580> economics<00:06:16.180> that

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
the slightly strange economics that

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.420 
the slightly strange economics that
would<00:06:17.440> be<00:06:17.590> something<00:06:17.800> that<00:06:18.039> would<00:06:18.130> take<00:06:18.400> a

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
would be something that would take a

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.470 
would be something that would take a
little<00:06:18.580> bit<00:06:18.789> of<00:06:18.880> getting<00:06:19.000> used<00:06:19.090> to<00:06:19.270> a<00:06:19.389> measure

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
little bit of getting used to a measure
