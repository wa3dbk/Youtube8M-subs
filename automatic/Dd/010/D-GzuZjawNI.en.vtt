so when acceleration increases the

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.000 
so when acceleration increases the

of the elevator ride the elevator will

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.590 
of the elevator ride the elevator will
slow<00:00:44.680> down<00:00:44.980> which<00:00:45.489> means<00:00:45.670> our<00:00:45.940> upwards

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
slow down which means our upwards

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.119 
slow down which means our upwards
acceleration<00:00:47.410> will<00:00:47.530> be<00:00:47.559> greater<00:00:47.859> than<00:00:47.949> the

Kelly is currently on the scale we're on
the<00:00:56.289> second<00:00:56.649> floor<00:00:56.859> and<00:00:57.160> we're<00:00:57.339> going<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.550> move

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
the second floor and we're going to move

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.029 
the second floor and we're going to move
up<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.089> third<00:00:58.300> floor<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:58.839> his<00:00:59.410> weight

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
up to the third floor and his weight

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:07.610 
up to the third floor and his weight
should<00:01:00.370> increase<00:01:01.059> and<00:01:01.359> then<00:01:01.510> decrease<00:01:01.710> weight

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.880 

you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.710 

Oh<00:01:17.370> baby<00:01:18.370> we<00:01:18.880> are<00:01:18.909> now<00:01:19.150> going<00:01:19.450> through<00:01:19.510> the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
Oh baby we are now going through the

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.120 
Oh baby we are now going through the
experiment<00:01:20.290> of<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.560> elevator<00:01:20.890> moving

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
experiment of the elevator moving

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.460 
experiment of the elevator moving
downwards<00:01:21.700> when<00:01:22.570> it<00:01:22.690> starts<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.110> move<00:01:23.229> and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
downwards when it starts to move and

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.890 
downwards when it starts to move and
accelerates<00:01:23.950> downwards<00:01:24.550> and<00:01:24.790> his<00:01:25.659> weight

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
accelerates downwards and his weight

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.219 
accelerates downwards and his weight
will<00:01:26.080> decrease<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.890> then<00:01:27.490> as<00:01:27.700> we<00:01:28.450> reach<00:01:28.690> the

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
will decrease and then as we reach the

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.410 
will decrease and then as we reach the
floor<00:01:29.500> it<00:01:30.130> will<00:01:30.280> accelerate<00:01:30.640> upwards<00:01:31.150> as<00:01:31.330> it

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
floor it will accelerate upwards as it

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.960 
floor it will accelerate upwards as it
slows<00:01:31.600> down<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:32.140> his<00:01:32.259> weight<00:01:32.440> will<00:01:32.970> increase

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
slows down and his weight will increase

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.320 
slows down and his weight will increase
slightly<00:01:34.770> his<00:01:35.770> weight<00:01:36.100> should<00:01:36.400> decrease<00:01:37.060> and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
slightly his weight should decrease and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.630 
slightly his weight should decrease and
then<00:01:37.450> increase

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.419 

you

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.830 

so<00:01:53.429> we<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.789> proved<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.119> weight<00:01:54.630> is

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
so we just proved that weight is

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.929 
so we just proved that weight is
dependent<00:01:55.320> upon<00:01:55.350> acceleration<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.789> can

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
dependent upon acceleration and it can

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.459 
dependent upon acceleration and it can
be<00:01:57.030> shown<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.359> this<00:01:57.479> elevator<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:58.380> we're

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
be shown in this elevator now we're

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.630 
be shown in this elevator now we're
going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.649> head<00:01:58.799> over<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.039> another<00:01:59.369> elevator

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
going to head over to another elevator

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.380 
going to head over to another elevator
to<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.179> if<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.450> true<00:02:00.689> there<00:02:04.069> come<00:02:05.069> on<00:02:05.390> let's

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
to see if it's true there come on let's

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.550 
to see if it's true there come on let's
go<00:02:08.479> here<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.599> are<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.899> old<00:02:10.049> cattle<00:02:10.410> hall

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
go here we are in the old cattle hall

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.270 
go here we are in the old cattle hall

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.940 
elevator
eric<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> scale<00:02:12.480> right<00:02:12.690> now<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.590> as<00:02:13.709> we

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
eric is on the scale right now so as we

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.830 
eric is on the scale right now so as we
go<00:02:14.099> upwards<00:02:14.549> you'll<00:02:15.299> see<00:02:15.480> her<00:02:15.660> weight

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
go upwards you'll see her weight

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.140 
go upwards you'll see her weight
increase<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.590> bit<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.549> as<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> elevator

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
increase a bit and then as the elevator

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.660 
increase a bit and then as the elevator
slows<00:02:18.480> down<00:02:18.750> as<00:02:18.870> we<00:02:18.989> near<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.200> top<00:02:19.500> her<00:02:20.489> weight

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
slows down as we near the top her weight

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:38.089 
slows down as we near the top her weight
will<00:02:20.790> decrease<00:02:24.410> okay<00:02:25.410> ready<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.660> we're<00:02:27.660> going

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.589 

Erica's<00:02:39.099> still<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.489> scale<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.420> time

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
Erica's still on the scale and this time

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.460 
Erica's still on the scale and this time
we're<00:02:40.720> going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.900> go<00:02:40.989> in<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.140> opposite

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
we're going to go in the opposite

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.309 
we're going to go in the opposite
direction<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:42.099> as<00:02:42.879> she<00:02:43.330> as<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:43.870> elevator

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
direction and as she as the elevator

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.380 
direction and as she as the elevator
starts<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.769> accelerate<00:02:45.010> downwards<00:02:45.670> her<00:02:46.209> way

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
starts to accelerate downwards her way

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.509 
starts to accelerate downwards her way
will<00:02:46.569> decrease<00:02:47.049> but<00:02:47.590> as<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.890> elevator<00:02:48.159> slows

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
will decrease but as the elevator slows

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.670 
will decrease but as the elevator slows
down<00:02:48.819> in<00:02:49.000> tears<00:02:49.299> as<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.750> nears<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:49.989> bottom<00:02:50.200> her

you

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.040 

we<00:03:14.850> have<00:03:14.970> proved<00:03:15.300> Newton's<00:03:15.690> second<00:03:16.020> law

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
we have proved Newton's second law

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.310 
we have proved Newton's second law
enforcing<00:03:16.740> this<00:03:17.040> mass<00:03:17.280> time<00:03:17.550> acceleration<00:03:18.320> we

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
enforcing this mass time acceleration we

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.590 
enforcing this mass time acceleration we
also<00:03:19.530> showed<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.490> is<00:03:20.730> changeable<00:03:21.150> based

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
also showed that we is changeable based

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.830 
also showed that we is changeable based
on<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.960> acceleration<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.650> an<00:03:22.770> elevator<00:03:23.840> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
two elevators that we wrote up it's

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.090 
two elevators that we wrote up it's
