00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Then...

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:05.301
Jorge and Antonio were talking about you.

00:00:05.902 --> 00:00:08.702
And i said that, but they called me liar.

00:00:09.503 --> 00:00:13.703
But I want to prove it, because i'm not a liar.

00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:15.504
That you exists.

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:18.105
And this guy here...

00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:26.006
he's my nephew. And he asked me to bring the camera

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:29.807
to make a video, and upload to internet.

00:00:30.108 --> 00:00:33.708
They also said to me, in that day, that you wanna drive a motorcycle too.

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:35.009
But you don't do this.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.310
He don't. He won't do this.

00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.311
No, it's too dangerous.

00:00:40.412 --> 00:00:44.912
&lt;i&gt;I think I can, but I'm very afraid to do this.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:47.013
If we put him in a field, a soccer field...

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:51.914
Im able to tell that he can, if he train a little before.

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:56.315
&lt;i&gt;I don't need to train. I just need to be teached how to drive a bike.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:56.316 --> 00:01:00.016
"Just go straight, just go straight!" And he'll be able to do in the field.

00:01:00.017 --> 00:01:02.517
I think so...

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:05.618
But we can't insist, because he isn't trained.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.119
How can you come from Arena to here, in a bicycle?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.420
&lt;i&gt;No problem. I can go anywhere.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:13.921
Are you seeing this, Joaquim?

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:16.922
So, is it your memory...

00:01:16.923 --> 00:01:19.723
or you have some kind of ability to do this?

00:01:19.724 --> 00:01:21.024
To know the distance of every place that you go.

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:22.925
He used to ride in the road.

00:01:22.926 --> 00:01:26.226
If he get a road that he never rode before, he can't go anywere.

00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:32.827
&lt;i&gt;I'll possibly go wrong, but in the known roads i go with no problem.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:37.028
From "SapÃ©" to here he don't miss the right way.

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:43.329
And if you tell him the wrong way, he would't go. 'Cause he knows what's wrong.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.830
Sure. He only knows the right way.

00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:52.931
He created his own way to think, to know the correct timing to turn left or right and go towards.

00:01:52.932 --> 00:01:55.832
Yes. But he has some map to remember.

00:03:05.555 --> 00:03:08.355
I can hitch-hike and get a lift from him.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.655
I get a lift from him, with no problem.

00:03:10.927 --> 00:03:13.827
And im not afraid, cause he wont crash in the wire fence.

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:17.028
Is there anyone here that haves a computer?

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.229
Here in the farm... I think not.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.730
I have some relatives in "Cruz das Almas" that have one.

00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:29.631
I want to do a video of your ride.

00:03:31.132 --> 00:03:36.532
And I want a demonstration of you in a bike, to put in the web.

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:37.933
I'll go! No problem man.

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:40.734
Where? In the road or the field?

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:41.735
Anywhere.

00:03:42.536 --> 00:03:44.636
Where do you want, Joaquim?

00:03:44.637 --> 00:03:47.137
&lt;i&gt;Anywere. Where he feels better.&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:47.138 --> 00:03:48.738
The field is better to do.

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.039
But here is fine too.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.440
&lt;i&gt;Its just to shoot a video. To show that you ride in a bike.&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.441
I'll get the bike.

00:03:57.142 --> 00:03:58.042
Go forward a little bit.

00:03:58.043 --> 00:04:00.243
More!

00:04:00.244 --> 00:04:01.244
That's it.

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:02.945
Its fine!

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:09.282
Can you go up?

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:10.283
Isn't your legs weak or tired?

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.550
Can i go?

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.451
&lt;i&gt;Yes. You can do whatever you want.&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:20.826
Take the right way. Go straight! Go straight!

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:21.827
Just go straight.

00:04:29.467 --> 00:04:30.967
You can turn back now!

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.068
Come back!

00:04:41.768 --> 00:04:43.168
Come in the other side!

00:04:50.535 --> 00:04:51.535
Right!

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120
Just go down!

00:05:21.928 --> 00:05:22.928
Enough.

00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:35.661
I think that any deficient has conditions to ride in a bike an be normal, like anyone.

00:05:44.316 --> 00:05:49.616
I had sight until 9 years old. Then after I thought that I could ride too.

00:05:50.276 --> 00:05:52.176
&lt;i&gt;But you already known to ride before become blind.&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:52.177 --> 00:05:53.577
No. When I was child I didn't ride.

00:05:53.578 --> 00:05:55.178
&lt;i&gt;You learned after you got blind.&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:56.179
Yes, you right.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.580
&lt;i&gt;What does you really had? A glaucoma?&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:58.581 --> 00:05:59.581
Yes, a glaucoma.

00:06:01.082 --> 00:06:02.182
&lt;i&gt;How old are you?&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:02.183 --> 00:06:04.583
I have 29 years old.

00:06:04.584 --> 00:06:09.284
&lt;i&gt;So, 20 years since you become blind.&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:10.285
That's it.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.786
&lt;i&gt;And you do everything like a normal person.&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:12.587 --> 00:06:14.087
Everything as a normal guy.

00:06:14.088 --> 00:06:16.688
Thanks, Pita! Thank you so much!
