00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello here is your michael doing today 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.160
 we are not as without 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.790
 So people are without flesh for it 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.790
 the microphone 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.280
 yes exceeded as friday 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.150
 more precisely , they just ride over it 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:44.300
 shouting simply or fearfully 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:47.090
 but you would need better for your 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.089
 fresh proponent noises affected 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.089
 you can do that very well with possible 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.170
 distribute infection 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.460
 yes summer as a bible I have 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.950
 ever cut prepared 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.720
 paprika kidney beans corn corn is for 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.700
 example not in the original recipe in it 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.649
 one thinks that in the American 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.899
 Mexican now but in the original will 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.830
 But as I said most do me 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:18.500
 of five tastes yes tomatoes have one 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.100
 some tomato tomatoes passed by 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.530
 take the body did not match up 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.570
 made and I take something from mine 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.700
 account of provence oil is not quite 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.770
 really correct would be Mexican 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.770
 organo am, of course I did not because 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.020
 the preparation is in principle with 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.649
 equal without genetically said the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.149
 fin 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.149
 we should have a wrong bank 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.119
 account sometimes period chosen 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.190
 but and pure 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.989
 answer steps in and intervene 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.989
 lie over it 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.420
 stefan he has not forgotten you would have 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.420
 filed with the data 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.980
 and that would be his 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.280
 discourage 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.470
 then prefer to mark 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.250
 which must always largest by 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.510
 loses the acid and gives easy 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.680
 a great topic why could rapid 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.680
 happened to me at this point too 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.780
 difference is now forgotten 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.060
 when the now only one start 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.380
 that are let the substances do not specify 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.590
 and this western europe 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.360
 that's really great overall I get 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.670
 my simply make otter leg 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.980
 they let the whole thing boil up again 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.980
 and pure plate edge 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.510
 I leave now again there 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.920
 we have again nice roasted now 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:23.380
 you want with water too or 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.680
 vegetable broth if you once considered smooth 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.860
 stir 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.750
 As I said, nothing happened to tomatoes 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.280
 Of course not properly learned and 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:39.070
 now the German variant medium 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.060
 most of the rangers with the Trophos 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.220
 just has to be short now 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.890
 boil up a bit of water namely 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.840
 would have it again as high as it gets 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.090
 just again briefly expenses then 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.750
 it is finished with meat must now 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.700
 just an hour now 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.690
 Simmer 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.440
 We do not have to let that happen now 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.669
 once exceeded 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.669
 25 minutes spoken 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.760
 I'm coming to a close now 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.940
 but the cherry tomatoes fell in place 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.380
 really just so they could pull yes 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.690
 come kicker already ten seconds 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.690
 just bring to a boil 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.480
 That's how Harry Truman sees it 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.490
 a baguette 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.190
 Many also like traveling or curry 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.330
 I know that I would be like that now 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.220
 tacos and pancakes or something on board 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.060
 whatever they have in mind 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.060
 get this year
