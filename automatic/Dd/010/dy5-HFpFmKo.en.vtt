00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
did I forget exactly how many blocks

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.110 
did I forget exactly how many blocks
large<00:00:40.769> this<00:00:40.949> is<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.549> to<00:00:41.640> give<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.909> a<00:00:41.940> bit

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
large this is but just to give you a bit

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.329 
large this is but just to give you a bit
of<00:00:42.150> a<00:00:42.269> scale<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.350> did<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.860> MCEdit

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
of a scale and did this in MCEdit

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.160 
of a scale and did this in MCEdit
obviously<00:00:44.729> on<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.239> super<00:00:45.540> low<00:00:45.659> at<00:00:45.780> world<00:00:45.960> I

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
obviously on a super low at world I

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.920 
obviously on a super low at world I
couldn't<00:00:47.040> build<00:00:47.220> this<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.549> ground<00:00:47.790> level

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
couldn't build this on ground level

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.770 
couldn't build this on ground level
because<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.220> too<00:00:50.729> large<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.600> had

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
because it was just too large so I had

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
because it was just too large so I had
to<00:00:51.809> dig<00:00:52.440> all<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:52.769> way<00:00:52.799> down<00:00:53.040> to<00:00:53.309> start<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
to dig all the way down to start on the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.670 
to dig all the way down to start on the
floor<00:00:54.119> and<00:00:54.299> then<00:00:54.839> it<00:00:54.960> still<00:00:55.229> hit<00:00:55.409> the<00:00:55.440> world

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
floor and then it still hit the world

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
floor and then it still hit the world
height<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.790> head<00:00:57.540> is<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.930> about<00:00:58.110> as

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
height so that head is just about as

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.039 
height so that head is just about as
high<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.619> can<00:00:58.710> go<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.479> just<00:01:00.479> compare<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
high as you can go and just compare it

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:02.750 
high as you can go and just compare it
to<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.229> proper<00:01:01.949> landscape<00:01:02.220> look<00:01:02.610> at<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
to like proper landscape look at the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.479 
to like proper landscape look at the
size<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.089> it<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.650> another<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> test<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
size of it and another just a test of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.300 
size of it and another just a test of
the<00:01:05.519> scale<00:01:05.820> quickly<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.650> i<00:01:07.650> hollowed<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:08.070> some

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the scale quickly is i hollowed out some

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.450 
the scale quickly is i hollowed out some
of<00:01:08.430> its<00:01:08.549> head<00:01:08.960> just<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> second<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
of its head just for a second and if you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.300 
of its head just for a second and if you
go<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.440> a<00:01:13.560> tiny<00:01:13.950> portion

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
go in here this is like a tiny portion

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.150 
go in here this is like a tiny portion
of<00:01:14.550> its<00:01:14.670> head<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.300> this<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.260> how<00:01:16.410> many<00:01:16.620> actual

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
of its head and this is how many actual

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.770 
of its head and this is how many actual
goals<00:01:17.370> like<00:01:17.580> rafinha<00:01:17.820> i<00:01:18.030> could<00:01:18.180> easily<00:01:18.330> fit

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
goals like rafinha i could easily fit

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.840 
goals like rafinha i could easily fit
like<00:01:19.380> three<00:01:19.710> times<00:01:19.980> this<00:01:20.130> amount<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.730> is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
like three times this amount but this is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.210 
like three times this amount but this is
just<00:01:20.880> why<00:01:21.630> did<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.050> five<00:01:22.260> seconds<00:01:22.650> so

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
just why did in like five seconds so

it's incredibly difficult I just did it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.640

is<00:02:53.940> knows<00:02:54.390> its<00:02:54.870> faithful<00:02:55.140> probably<00:02:55.560> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
is knows its faithful probably the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.949 
is knows its faithful probably the
trickiest<00:02:55.829> part<00:02:56.250> because<00:02:56.610> I'm<00:02:56.790> MC<00:02:57.660> idea<00:02:57.840> is

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
trickiest part because I'm MC idea is

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.100 
trickiest part because I'm MC idea is
quite<00:02:58.200> buggy<00:02:58.470> at<00:02:58.709> times<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.670> um<00:03:00.019> yeah<00:03:01.019> i<00:03:01.049> just

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
because one of the request was actually

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.110 
because one of the request was actually
to<00:03:04.650> do<00:03:04.739> some<00:03:04.920> world<00:03:05.069> record<00:03:05.340> things<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.060> i
