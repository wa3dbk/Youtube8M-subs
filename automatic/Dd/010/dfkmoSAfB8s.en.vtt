00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 hi everyone i'm jo limbo 97 welcome 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.570
 back to our tony server from 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:18.260
 me that is Tony fat and also our 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:22.199
 strong and nothing as you see we have put a 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.779
 update to that on the server if 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.970
 you do not have to give a datum 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.419
 enough lives we are playing around here 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:37.100
 good when the schalke you will have more or 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:40.340
 minus the rules and the worlds that there are and 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.059
 good for where the tournaments 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.410
 what I recommend basically not but what 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.140
 which I recommend mainly when entering 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.400
 the server is good so you can take a 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.190
 work and here you can 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.790
 buy plots and so on we have created 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.370
 a city that the plots are free or 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.170
 be when the video is paid for those who 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.390
 you want to enter and those who want to play 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.880
 with him we have created a plot where he 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.230
 will live in it one of the plots will be 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.980
 free and you just have to give it 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.980
 click on the poster 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:26.030
 and a little 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.770
 we go to the good as it was before 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.689
 portal game is knows what nery said 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.689
 game and so on the world resources 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.350
 this would be a resource where you get here 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.670
 the materials you need and so on 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.460
 it safer than resists every 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.580
 five days like that so there's more 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.580
 material etcetera what as a post 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.270
 as a voice to the world, not that you are already 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.500
 the world the camera that looks etc 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.500
 cities around here 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.520
 it's just here you go where you want 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.080
 stuck where you want 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.030
 what I do recommend that you do not build 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.030
 because it is going to reset the world 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.820
 good if you want but you know that the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.560
 play against players etc and if you want 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.570
 we can build quietly being 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.030
 bother and they can send you go to 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.030
 alser viva is conte 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.860

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.950
 first in the tube 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.510
 and it counts here in the market is a 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.110
 little peculiar neither life hysteria 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.110
 never but good 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.820

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.050
