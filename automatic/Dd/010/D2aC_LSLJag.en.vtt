00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello today let's see 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.820
 how to perform a leather massage 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.460
 hairy and what are its benefits 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.210
 first make a leather massage 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.869
 hairy activates the microphone 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.420
 circulation at the level of the scalp and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.750
 so when the scalp and 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:30.029
 well oxygenated and well the hair is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.340
 more silky and shinier and so 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.969
 you never have problems falling 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.980
 of hair 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.070
 this type of massage can also you 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.219
 to be beneficial because it promotes the flow 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.260
 from the blood to the roots and therefore 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.899
 it will stimulate regrowth before 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.930
 start if like the person here you 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.870
 have irritated scalp ie 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.809
 that if ever your hair is greasy or 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.210
 although you have dandruff and 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.750
 well the gestures must be very soft 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.369
 not to aggravate the hyper secretion 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.640
 seborrheic to do this massage so 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.210
 we are going from the neck to the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.100
 Frank and we start making ears 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.920
 the top of the skull 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.150
 what you need to know before you start 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 it is to make the difference between 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.100
 massaged and rubbed because actually 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.979
 some people tend to 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.590
 confuse the two to make a massage 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.430
 of the scalp the fingers have to be 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.880
 firmly on the skull and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.210
 move the skin of the skull under the pulp 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.649
 fingers and not drag the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.799
 fingers on the skin so we start the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.640
 massage starting from the neck must 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.490
 spread firmly lay on the skull and 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.670
 the right thing to do is to ask 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.790
 so firmly fingers like these 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.180
 is 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:12.010
 slide the skin of the skull as 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:16.230
 this in a back-and-forth motion or 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.230
 still in a rotating motion 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.520
 you are of course using tomorrow as 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.300
 this so make sure not to 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.310
 move your fingers 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.140
 it's the scalp that we need 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.750
 move along the skull 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:45.570
 once this area well massage us 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:49.390
 go back little by little towards the franc 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:52.450
 then on the side starting from the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.080
 ears towards the top of the skull 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.290
 we always move the skin 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:04.830
 under the pulp of the fingers in a 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.830
 back and forth motion or rotation 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:25.540
 and we go back little by little towards the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:27.849
 top of the skull and you have to know that this 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.319
 type of massage lasts barely a minute 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:34.599
 so it's very fast 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:39.840
 I recap so we start the 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.840
 massage from the neck 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:51.120
 we go back to the front 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:12.480
 then ears above 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:12.480
 ears here to the top of the skull 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.540
 in that in short a this type of massage 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.660
 not only does it bring a sensation 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:29.680
 well-being and relaxation but in addition 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.470
 it will contribute to the beauty of your 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:39.660
 hair and be careful we 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.660
