months I mean you guys think like is the
you<00:03:14.460> gotta<00:03:14.670> start<00:03:14.910> thinking<00:03:15.209> not<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.750> the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
you gotta start thinking not is the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.620 
you gotta start thinking not is the
wearable<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.650> new<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.940> new<00:03:18.090> smartphone

wearable the new the new smartphone
because<00:03:19.080> think<00:03:19.470> like<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.860> wearable<00:03:20.280> the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
because think like is the wearable the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.460 
because think like is the wearable the
new<00:03:20.580> keyboard<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.600> printer<00:03:22.050> yet<00:03:22.200> their

new keyboard and printer yet their

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.810 
new keyboard and printer yet their
accessories<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.250> there<00:03:23.370> will<00:03:23.459> be<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.580> lot<00:03:23.790> of

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
accessories and there will be a lot of

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.890 
accessories and there will be a lot of
them<00:03:24.000> there<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.390> they'll<00:03:24.480> do<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.660> lot<00:03:24.840> of

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
them there and they'll do a lot of

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.000 
them there and they'll do a lot of
different<00:03:24.959> things<00:03:25.170> but<00:03:25.440> they're<00:03:25.620> you're

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
different things but they're you're

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.050 
different things but they're you're
still<00:03:26.190> going<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.340> need<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.580> computing

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
still going to need that computing

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.150 
still going to need that computing
resource<00:03:27.390> also<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.320> news<00:03:28.470> today<00:03:28.620> DARPA<00:03:29.130> is

offering IBM 3.2 million dollars to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.820 
offering IBM 3.2 million dollars to
create<00:03:32.489> vanishing<00:03:33.450> programmable<00:03:34.140> resources

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
create vanishing programmable resources

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.699 
create vanishing programmable resources
that's<00:03:35.280> right<00:03:35.430> technology<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.270> actually

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
that's right technology that actually

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.750 
that's right technology that actually
self-destructs<00:03:37.709> just<00:03:38.280> like<00:03:38.459> mission

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
self-destructs just like mission

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.040 
self-destructs just like mission
impossible<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.360> what<00:03:39.600> is<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.870> code<00:03:40.019> name

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
impossible and what is the code name

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.340 
impossible and what is the code name
it's<00:03:40.950> vapor<00:03:41.269> vapor<00:03:42.269> vanishing<00:03:42.870> programmable

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
it's vapor vapor vanishing programmable

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.259 
it's vapor vapor vanishing programmable
resources<00:03:43.860> so<00:03:43.980> vapor<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.550> vaporware<00:03:45.000> and

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
resources so vapor it is vaporware and

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.550 
resources so vapor it is vaporware and
the<00:03:45.660> idea<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.170> know<00:03:46.320> when

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
the idea is that you know when

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.229 
the idea is that you know when
technology<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.400> out<00:03:47.580> in<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.730> field<00:03:48.000> it'll

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
technology is out in the field it'll

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.540 
technology is out in the field it'll
work<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.750> then<00:03:49.170> when<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.830> army<00:03:50.250> wants<00:03:50.459> to

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
work and then when the army wants to

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.040 
work and then when the army wants to
turn<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.760> off<00:03:50.880> they<00:03:51.090> send<00:03:51.300> a<00:03:51.360> code<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.900> and

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
turn it off they send a code to it and

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.560 
turn it off they send a code to it and
the<00:03:52.680> glass<00:03:52.920> structure<00:03:53.220> breaks<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.360> no

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
the glass structure breaks and it is no

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.270 
the glass structure breaks and it is no
longer<00:03:54.780> functional<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:55.890> comes<00:03:56.160> from

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
longer functional and this comes from

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.400 
longer functional and this comes from
what<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.670> refer<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.060> as<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.420> government's

pumped<00:04:32.390> through<00:04:32.420> it<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:32.780> crumbles<00:04:33.230> into<00:04:33.350> dust

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
pumped through it it crumbles into dust

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.360 
pumped through it it crumbles into dust
and<00:04:34.010> uh<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.660> this<00:04:35.960> is<00:04:36.110> all<00:04:36.350> it's<00:04:36.740> great

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
and uh the this is all it's great

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.280 
and uh the this is all it's great
science<00:04:37.760> fictiony<00:04:38.150> stuff<00:04:38.420> it'll<00:04:38.990> be<00:04:39.050> very

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
science fictiony stuff it'll be very

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.900 
science fictiony stuff it'll be very
interesting<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.860> see<00:04:40.070> if<00:04:40.160> any<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.520> happens

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
interesting to see if any of it happens

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.790 
interesting to see if any of it happens
and<00:04:41.120> it'll<00:04:41.390> inevitably<00:04:41.810> have<00:04:42.290> civilian

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
and it'll inevitably have civilian

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.830 
and it'll inevitably have civilian
implications<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.520> it's<00:04:43.940> great<00:04:44.210> for<00:04:44.360> recycling

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
implications to it's great for recycling

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.030 
implications to it's great for recycling
yeah<00:04:45.080> I<00:04:45.110> think<00:04:45.230> about<00:04:45.410> this<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.860> know

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
yeah I think about this you know

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.770 
yeah I think about this you know
components<00:04:46.550> that<00:04:46.610> actually<00:04:46.940> dissolve<00:04:47.270> in<00:04:47.540> and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
components that actually dissolve in and

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.750 
components that actually dissolve in and
break<00:04:48.260> down<00:04:48.290> naturally<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:49.130> mean<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.430> actually

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
break down naturally I mean it actually

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.910 
break down naturally I mean it actually
makes<00:04:49.880> them<00:04:50.090> easier<00:04:50.420> to<00:04:50.690> put<00:04:51.380> in<00:04:51.470> length<00:04:51.650> yeah

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
makes them easier to put in length yeah

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.590 
makes them easier to put in length yeah
these<00:04:52.070> these<00:04:52.400> technologies<00:04:53.060> start<00:04:53.360> with<00:04:53.510> the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
these these technologies start with the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.850 
these these technologies start with the
military<00:04:54.020> because<00:04:54.170> that's<00:04:54.440> where<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.710> money

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
military because that's where the money

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.800 
military because that's where the money
is<00:04:54.950> but<00:04:55.580> eventually<00:04:55.940> they<00:04:56.390> come<00:04:56.600> down<00:04:56.750> and

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
is but eventually they come down and

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.660 
is but eventually they come down and
they<00:04:57.080> help<00:04:57.320> our<00:04:57.470> health<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.980> hopefully<00:04:58.520> they

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
they help our health and hopefully they

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.940 
they help our health and hopefully they
will<00:04:58.820> help<00:04:59.000> our<00:04:59.120> environment<00:04:59.360> and<00:04:59.800> you<00:05:00.800> know
