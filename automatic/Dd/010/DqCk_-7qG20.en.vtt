 string3 the television more also more 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.779
 that never goes spring with breast of 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
 chicken ingredients on screen a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.019
 we are going to love you very well 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.820
 who does not like a good dish 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.160
 pasta now we will do it style 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.089
 spring with vegetables and flavors very 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.430
 special 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.320
 look let's start with the breast as 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.689
 we make a delicious breast is very simple 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.670
 first we have to flatten the to 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.619
 that we plan it so that the cooking is 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.279
 uniform because because the breast 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.650
 It has its original shape and is more chubby 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.290
 from the upper part, well, this part 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.600
 high we're going to flatten it this way or 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.430
 with a roller with whatever you want 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.809
 of special unemployed but not necessary 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.790
 with your little hand you can make it stay 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.760
 then we are going to marinate it 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.340
 let's take it out of the plastic and we're going to 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.980
 put in a bowl 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.200
 in this area we are going to put it to marinate 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.930
 with lemon juice that he likes very well 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.070
 also the chicken by the way 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.440
 a little grated garlic 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.900
 and oregano 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.750
 and few ingredients really but 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.090
 extremely easy simple and no no 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.720
 requires more this pechuguita garlic 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.700
 lemon oregano 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.790
 let's put some olive oil 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.280
 and we leave it marinating for 20 minutes 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.770
 in the king since he is marinated after 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.900
 of 20 minutes we are going to put it in a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.740
 pan hot and here we are going to 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.750
 put salt and pepper and nothing but good 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.720
 colorcito pto montt 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.940
 how rich does oregano smell and good is 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.890
 elevated in an extremely Italian flavor 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.430
 what we want to achieve today 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.390
 we went to the sauce of this rich pasta 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:51.570
 look, let's put butter 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:55.320
 delicious butter if someday we're going 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.229
 to put onions s onions 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.650
 very subtle eyes imagine the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:07.520
 spring that comes to your house with these 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.520
 rich flavors are we saute asparagus 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:17.890
 let's put tomato cherry tomato 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.890
 elevated a delicious flavor 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.840
 let's add to the grass that you 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.939
 want but this time I decided 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.879
 for basil the basil carry a 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.630
 taste fresher than parsley or can 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.830
 put both 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.470
 broccoli squash let's put a little 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.570
 of cream 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.490
 and I saw nothing but rich before the 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.530
 I'm going to put salt on it so that it 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.350
 go spicing 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:53.130
 all the ingredients well 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.530
 let's put milk evaporated milk 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.250
 Evaporated will give you a nice taste 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.410
 special because it's kind of sweet 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.980
 then that sweetness will go very well with 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.590
 these spring vegetables are going to 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.930
 put some chicken broth or if you 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.860
 wants to leave you as a vegetarian and without 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.370
 chicken does not put vegetable broth 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.600
 let's let it cook a little 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.600
 add pepper 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.170
 let's put parmesan cheese 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.100
 delicious and let's mix the vegetables 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.040
 yes 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.240
 see how it melts and what it is or how it goes 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.130
 making a simple rich 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.040
 All vegetables ladies must 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.800
 be al dente not cook it too much 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.380
 if they cook it too much what can 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.380
 happen is that they soften we do not want 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.270
 that the vegetables are softened no idea 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.000
 checking the little one and that I know what 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.490
 what I did to speed up the cooking was 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.580
 cover what has no cover with a 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.620
 pan like this one can cover it without 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.050
 no problem look at the kitchen should not 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.780
 of you where you mortify that 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.970
 I do not have the exact lid of the soup pan 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.250
 with a plate with a frying pan he succeeds 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.639

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.560

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.130
 Parmesan cheese either melted 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:39.400

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:43.479
