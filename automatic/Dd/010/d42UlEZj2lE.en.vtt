00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.760
 Costa Rica I used to watch on TV 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:13.830
 I remembered really to say so Toka bottom of the beautiful sea of the video but I have a country Tteyuu 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.970
 Come to think of it I'd had a Spanish selection lessons from becoming a high school student I'd 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.109
 I thought that Costa Rica I saw at that time was in a child who is talking and talking 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.560
 Number of people speaking Spanish had been able to say also in the amazing world 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.960
 Well then 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.710
 I wanted to find out the possibility and I started Nespen 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.710
 me 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.270
 me 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.620
 me 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.890
 Though I think as Tteyuu the current you want to world-class First English is come up 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:51.170
 And had been spoken surprisingly in many countries said Spain 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.850
 Many people in the country who are studying as a second language are actually very much 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.589
 Singing in Spanish 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.380
 I think that there is such many potential Toka or try to speak in China people and Spanish 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.000
 In fact 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.739
 Also I and that it is the country's values by speaking in many countries of the people and Spanish 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.690
 I was able to study in various ways 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.690
 I think that it is great useful words 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.259
 That kind of thinking I mean really much more fairly values in Japan before going 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.119
 I can't deny maybe that's stiff 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:25.140
 There was that interact with people of various countries over the next still try out the actual Spain 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.900
 Toka Some people with this kind of thinking in such a though is 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.160
 Take a life like this every day kk 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.790
 Kedomo Is not it going to be more and more their own values is broken down by going to 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:41.790
 While experiencing a culture shock, I experienced that it changed little by little 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 I think the kana have led to Well now of yourself as a result in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.479
 After all that's a foreign language university , so there is a great deal of freedom in linguistics and so on . 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.160
 is not it 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.850
 That 's why I taught Japanese teachers such things as grammar theory of Japanese. 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.970
 Or 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.119
 Kishihito Hitoshi A great teacher in Central and South America 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.810
 There was such a class as Moomoodia theory 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:08.579
 Let's each and so 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.579
 I think that the sound is integrated and it leads to the cause of the present paper 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:17.700
 There Nante as the go in the direction of for me and I massaged now 4 l 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:21.959
 Even though I know you in an exciting world, such as the path to chose I'd had 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.430
 I think the world is really wide , but I would like to stay in Japan alone. 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.390
 In I think is the body 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.390
 I think I have to go to get the potential
