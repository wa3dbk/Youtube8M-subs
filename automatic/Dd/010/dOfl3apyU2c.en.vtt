00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:08.480
 hello today we cook croquettes 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:12.820
 champignon mushrooms ingredients 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.010
 chives garlic flour milk butter 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.180
 eggs and breadcrumbs 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.810
 we started thinly slicing the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.810
 mushrooms 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.279
 also onion and garlic 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.680
 that we fry in a pan with a little 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.680
 of oil 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.570
 at 5 minutes add the mushrooms 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.750
 cover and leave them on the fire for 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.790
 half an hour 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.790
 then we remove them and reserve them 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.450
 now we heat the milk and prepare 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.450
 the bechamel with butter and flour 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.780
 stir well 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.810
 and we add the milk little by little and without 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.260
 stop stirring so it does not stick in 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.260
 the bottom 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.130
 also a little salt 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.010
 and when everything is well integrated 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.830
 we add the mushrooms 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.870
 mix well and keep stirring in 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.320
 total the bechamel will be on fire a 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.320
 half an hour 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.280
 then we pour it into a container 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.680
 elongated we cover it with paper film 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.450
 and we keep it in the fridge for 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.350
 3 or 4 hours for more 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.350
 consistent 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.130
 once past that time we beat a 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.679
 egg 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.750
 we take a portion of dough 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.859
 and we shape it with our hands 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.859
 moistened senagua 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.780
 then we passed the croquette for the bread 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.720
 grated 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.250
 web 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.250
 and breadcrumbs again 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.300
 finally fry the croquettes in 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.720
 very hot oil so that it does not 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.720
 cut 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:05.230
 then we let them drain in a colander 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.230
 and it only remains to serve on the plate 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.370
 a cut to see the creaminess 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.920
 and that's it until soon
