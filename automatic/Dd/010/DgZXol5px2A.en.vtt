00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
to do what you're going to do more than

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.970 
to do what you're going to do more than
and<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:13.000> suspect<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.750> as<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.019> can<00:02:14.170> older<00:02:14.530> it's

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
and I suspect that as you can older it's

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.890 
and I suspect that as you can older it's
going<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.220> show<00:02:15.640> up<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.880> more<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.540> more<00:02:16.630> and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
going to show up in more and more and

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.190 
going to show up in more and more and
very<00:02:17.110> much<00:02:17.230> right<00:02:17.739> as<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.549> develop<00:02:18.700> but<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:20.019> is

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
very much right as you develop but it is

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.870 
very much right as you develop but it is

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
something you should develop there's a

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.370 
something you should develop there's a
