00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.270
 the j端rgen was always one of the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.670
 most terrific pilots I knew he 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.670
 has the feeling in the butt and i male 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.760
 We met the five school 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.770
 time has passed as in the air 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.430
 you have always been our top rank with the 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.430
 best flow characteristics 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.820
 I still remember it well, like me 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.550
 my training openly made 380 in 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.840
 Toulouse with you at that time still remember 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.520
 me still an excellent 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.080
 skills like you a Belgian 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.950
 pattern flying can mean 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.950
 greatest respect 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.490
 we stay on the track 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.490
 coffee break clean work young 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.150
 i'd rather say that you're in 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.410
 toulouse comes by to play golf 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.060
 or I'll take you on the 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.440
 race track with then you have to 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.270
 unfortunately then to the right 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.760
 unfortunately you can sit there too 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.200
 say nothing and I still hope that 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.570
 the band will enjoy it 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.990
 this is not how the oar usually gets 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.990
 emotional 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.410
 Why 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.930
 or others suits me right now 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.460
 spontaneously tell that was easy 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.040
 for me a flying highlight 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.430
 really great experience with you namely the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.259
 a day across germany 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.619
 to have flown from Austria 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.420
 Frankfurt to Stuttgart to Vienna 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.100
 dresden to linz to munich and 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.510
 back to Frankfurt everything 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.090
 one day with the 380 at pouring 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.180
 Thousands of people tens of thousands of people 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.180
 that was a great experience on the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.180
 roads 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.680
 the gods 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.520
 So for us it was a mystery why 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.890
 j端rgen went out j端rgen everyone else was 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.040
 that's not always the case in principle 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.590
 2 was flown faster faster 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.270
 fast corner taxi of the race grandpa itself 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.220
 certainly many fans flew on 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.570
 youtube since today I have 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.570
 anyway, basically belong to it 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.350
 I remember the most in memory 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.490
 minutes rather together a letter in the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.340
 have spent space 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.400
 on the legendary south america where you're there for 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.800
 I wonder how much has shown how 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.550
 get a crew together in no time 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.380
 can build 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.210
 that was my guiding principle for many 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.670
 many own flights followed afterwards 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.550
 are and I believe symbolizes that 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.860
 the whole generations of pilots though 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.110
 ultimately of very many 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:03.850
 cruz coined that i could be you now 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:05.350
 in representation for the whole crew who 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:11.170
 I know who knows will like the whole 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:14.710
 territory is a privilege I was allowed 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.130
 with you the first a 380 from hamburg 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.730
 pick up 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.650
 many have envied me there and have to 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.270
 i really say thank you it was a 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.270
 insanely great experience 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:35.680
 they seldom see me speechless though 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.680
 because they made it 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.800
 if it then but has come to realize 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.550
 but that the emotions the coolness 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.530
 of a human can surpass 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.990
 the permission for the low pass on the 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.090
 heavy traffic airports like frankfurt 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.310
 You do not get all days 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.720
 but I honestly tell you 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.720
 would have flown him without a permit 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.430
 dear j端rgen raps it was for me today 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.810
 again a very special day here 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.120
 to be allowed to be with which 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.670
 precision serenity and still 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.560
 full of emotions you are from your team 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.230
 says goodbye and also a bit 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.480
 deposited legacy you speak 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.150
 for his courage it speaks for your a 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.440
 Overview because you had and it will be 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.720
 I think today became clear 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.450
 which giant do you recognize in 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.450

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.200

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.509
 my shoulder fold 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.770
 the moment would be on your shoulders 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.270
 has taken hold of me and his shoulder 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.250
 hatched on the last 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.560
 was the one for me 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.730
 most emotional in the last three days 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.730
 He went straight to his knees 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.330
 Carsten only has to say 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.500
 message obediently executed 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.490
 Mr. Kraft becomes impeccable 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.930
 to hand over 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.930
