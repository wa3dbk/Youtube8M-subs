a venom gland produces the bee poison

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.380 
a venom gland produces the bee poison
and<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> stinger<00:00:56.280> provides<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.789> path<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.329> the

and the stinger provides a path for the

venom into the target B poison or a
patuxent<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> clear<00:01:00.840> bitter<00:01:01.230> tasting

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
patuxent is a clear bitter tasting

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
patuxent is a clear bitter tasting
cocktail<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.640> enzymes<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.359> proteins<00:01:03.510> that

cocktail of enzymes and proteins that

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.660 
cocktail of enzymes and proteins that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.399 
creates inflammation pain adrenal
response<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.479> begin<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> melt<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
response and then they begin to melt the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
response and then they begin to melt the
cell<00:01:07.710> membranes<00:01:08.189> near<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> sting<00:01:09.030> site<00:01:09.299> it

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
cell membranes near the sting site it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.020 
cell membranes near the sting site it
also<00:01:10.110> contains<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.830> mild<00:01:11.070> neurotoxin<00:01:11.880> which

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
also contains a mild neurotoxin which

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.000 
also contains a mild neurotoxin which
can<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.299> pretty<00:01:12.510> useful<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> bee<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.740> it's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
can be pretty useful for the bee if it's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.100 
can be pretty useful for the bee if it's
stinging<00:01:14.400> its<00:01:14.580> prey<00:01:14.850> bee<00:01:15.180> stings<00:01:15.570> might<00:01:15.840> seem

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
stinging its prey bee stings might seem

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.539 
stinging its prey bee stings might seem
like<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.350> worst<00:01:16.470> thing<00:01:16.740> ever<00:01:16.950> when<00:01:17.369> you're<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
defiance the Schmidt pain index would

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.249 
defiance the Schmidt pain index would
have<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.189> told<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.670> how<00:01:30.150> much<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.840> bee
