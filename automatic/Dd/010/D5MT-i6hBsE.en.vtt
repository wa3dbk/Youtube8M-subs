00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.439
 well today I bring you my first 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.439
 unboxing 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.889
 This is a system d 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:19.770
 labeling of marker discs 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.770
 is called 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.250
 sidi 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.160
 I divided 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.780
 Key insists 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.780
 and to remark is to be seen 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.300
 good look a lot on youtube before 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.440
 buy 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:43.220
 and I did not find anything about it 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.470
 I make a box and not about this 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.940
 how can you see 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.440
 the package 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.500
 It includes 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:59.010
 the software 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:02.610
 and applicator 130 white labels 24 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:11.960
 labels for cid and 2 labels for 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:11.960
 divide 52 centers 52 loins and 6 covers 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.159
 here we can observe 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.220
 well, software 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.270
 leaves 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.790
 and the marker 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.460
 on the back side 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.460
 good on the side side 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.490
 we bring the ribbon likely insist 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.220
 because he says that 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.340
 with the applicator and distant 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.680
 can have quick and easy perfect 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.680
 Label or label applications 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.130
 and we can see the guide 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.960
 on this side 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.310
 has steps 1 2 and 3 designs and 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.310
 print and apply 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.640
 what is the difference says 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.640
 here we can observe 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.260
 let's open it 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.010
 because it contains inside 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.390
 we go 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.640
 that our and ribbon but it contains 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.050
 this is the cost note 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.299
 164 pesos were offered handy 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.299
 office depot 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.870
 the original price 205 pesos offer 164 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.380
 pesos 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.710
 we have it 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.870
 well here at first glance we have 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.110
 and software 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.120
 to make our designs compatible 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:21.440
 with the labels included 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.480
 to our marker if it stamps 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.220
 this is a software called abri 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.510
 design pro that comes for free 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.510
 compatible with windows and with mac 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.470
 and here is 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.950
 let's put it on one side 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.390
 as well 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.390
 we have in our package 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:56.110
 a guide 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.110
 good in English 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.280
 in another language I do not know which one is 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.550
 I'm going to put who's going 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.260
 we have 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.800
 our 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.610
 sheets to label 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.610
 here it is 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.160
 we can observe 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.060
 it is not possible to distinguish 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.750
 what is there 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:39.460
 I do not think that distinguished one that you bring 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.460
 lines to cut it 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.910
 here 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.150
 Finally 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.889
 our 

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:02.610
 marker with p 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.150
 yes this but in the end 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.150
 but 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:13.070
 I do not know how to get it out 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.039
 I think I break this tab 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.280
 allow a moment I break it and then 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.280
 forget 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.809
 it's already here we can see our 

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:38.809
 Sinister 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.689
 basically 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.660
 it's a laptop 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.790
 I do not really understand how it works 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:59.200
 but it is the content 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.200
 from our package 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.540
 when there is nothing left inside 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.889
 I believe that I will proceed to fill 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.280
 instructions the instructions and 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:15.940
 now another video 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.910
 explaining its use 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.910
 here we have it more or less explained 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.169
 then I will see 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:37.640
 as we can see our stanford si 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.640
 our disc 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.960
 with the software to design 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.940
 our leaves 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.630
 they look like the labels 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.630
 if you 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:59.240
 our instruction 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.750
 that comes in English and in another language that 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.750
 I do not know which one is 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.440
 and that would be all the content of our 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.720
 site 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.300
 novell insists 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.600
 so he will proceed 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.480
 upload this video and 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.070
 in terms of learning how to use them 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:24.000
 I will do a tutorial 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:26.830
 so that would be all for now until 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.250
 the next friends of youtube 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:33.070
 I hope it has helped you to decide 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.080
 buy sushi stamper 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.529
 I took it because I did not find any 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.779
 video 

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:41.439
 to tell me what it contained 

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:45.030
 as it was used well here we can see it 

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:50.690
 I bring this for you 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:50.690
 so until then cut
