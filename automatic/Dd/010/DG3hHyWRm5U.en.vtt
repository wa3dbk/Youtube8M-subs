00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
around a little bit but the be bender

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.099 
around a little bit but the be bender
you<00:00:19.189> know<00:00:19.310> obviously<00:00:19.730> you<00:00:22.839> can<00:00:23.839> do<00:00:23.929> all<00:00:24.050> the

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
you know obviously you can do all the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:36.549 
you know obviously you can do all the
bender<00:00:24.380> licks<00:00:33.760> but<00:00:34.760> having<00:00:35.719> the<00:00:35.840> Bigsby<00:00:36.289> and

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
bender licks but having the Bigsby and

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.650 
bender licks but having the Bigsby and
the<00:00:36.980> B<00:00:37.129> string<00:00:37.430> not<00:00:37.640> going<00:00:37.969> through<00:00:38.269> it<00:00:38.449> it

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
the B string not going through it it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.150 
the B string not going through it it
opens<00:00:39.199> up<00:00:39.350> a<00:00:39.440> bunch<00:00:39.649> of<00:00:39.739> other<00:00:39.890> cool<00:00:40.100> things

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
like you can use the Bigsby to drop say

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.950 
like you can use the Bigsby to drop say
the<00:00:45.440> g-string

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.620 

and<00:00:48.500> get<00:00:48.650> pedal<00:00:48.950> steel<00:00:49.190> type<00:00:49.430> licks<00:00:49.700> or<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.450> D

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
and get pedal steel type licks or the D

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.030 
and get pedal steel type licks or the D
string<00:00:50.810> if<00:00:51.050> you<00:00:51.140> just<00:00:51.320> play<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.530> B<00:00:51.740> and<00:00:51.920> then

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
string if you just play the B and then

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:03.490 
string if you just play the B and then
and<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.460> D<00:00:59.170> so<00:01:00.170> that's<00:01:00.350> C<00:01:00.590> well<00:01:00.800> say<00:01:00.980> Oh

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.590 

you<00:01:04.040> know<00:01:04.160> so<00:01:04.340> you're<00:01:04.489> going<00:01:04.700> from<00:01:04.820> your<00:01:04.910> one

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
you know so you're going from your one

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.310 
you know so you're going from your one
to<00:01:05.750> your<00:01:05.870> five

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:24.920 

so<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:20.360> five<00:01:21.360> chord<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.080> chord

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.610 

just<00:01:25.740> by<00:01:25.860> touching<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.240> g<00:01:28.080> string<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
just by touching the the g string and

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.820 
just by touching the the g string and
the<00:01:28.830> B<00:01:28.860> string<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.170> coming<00:01:31.170> down<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.620> or

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
the B string and coming down with it or

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.240 
the B string and coming down with it or
bending<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:34.380> then<00:01:34.560> dropping<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.040> g

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
bending it up and then dropping the g

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.880 
bending it up and then dropping the g
string<00:01:35.580> I<00:01:38.360> went<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> little<00:01:39.420> too<00:01:39.570> far<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.890> this

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
string I went a little too far but this

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
string I went a little too far but this
just<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> whole<00:01:44.910> world<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.420> possibilities

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
just a whole world the possibilities

00:01:46.110 --> 00:02:03.200 
just a whole world the possibilities
opened<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.710> for<00:01:46.920> me<00:01:47.040> when<00:01:47.160> I<00:01:47.220> did<00:01:47.430> this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.849 

even<00:02:03.840> harmonics<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:07.229> know<00:02:07.469> because<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.770> can

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
even harmonics you know because you can

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.430 
even harmonics you know because you can
use<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> vendor<00:02:08.929> do<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> vendor<00:02:10.319> at<00:02:10.379> a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
use the vendor do the vendor at a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.690 
use the vendor do the vendor at a
half-step

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.659 

all<00:02:17.700> kinds<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.000> cool<00:02:18.150> stuff<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.510> do
