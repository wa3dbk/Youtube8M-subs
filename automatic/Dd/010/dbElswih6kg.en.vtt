can<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:02.719> there's<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> little<00:01:03.840> bit<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
can do there's a little bit of

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.750 
can do there's a little bit of
sluggishness<00:01:04.500> seemed<00:01:05.010> early<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> game

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
sluggishness seemed early in the game

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.359 
sluggishness seemed early in the game
going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> take<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> while<00:01:06.210> before<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
going to take a while before you got the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.469 
going to take a while before you got the
feel<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> game<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:09.000> each<00:01:09.119> other<00:01:09.299> with

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
feel of the game with each other with

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.340 
feel of the game with each other with
Kobe<00:01:09.840> not<00:01:09.990> being<00:01:10.200> there<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.820> think<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:11.970> just

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
Kobe not being there I think it was just

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.450 
Kobe not being there I think it was just
the<00:01:13.350> first<00:01:13.470> few<00:01:13.680> possessions<00:01:13.979> with<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.369> these

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the first few possessions with all these

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.480 
the first few possessions with all these
shots<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:15.390> did<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.659> well<00:01:16.009> I<00:01:17.009> think<00:01:17.280> quickly

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
shots they did as well I think quickly

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.160 
shots they did as well I think quickly
everyone<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:18.030> into<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> rhythm<00:01:18.420> started<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
everyone got into a rhythm started to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.340 
everyone got into a rhythm started to
feel<00:01:19.350> good

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
feel good

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.200
