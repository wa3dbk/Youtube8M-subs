00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:19.540
 I went to the man it was regret that I did not even 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:26.590
 has been worrying about another video of mother 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:31.030
 haft so people are today I'm here more 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:35.250
 still to you 11 to sherry that is also 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:38.859
 for the pirate she has already got 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.769
 available at a good 6.4 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:44.890
 That 's right folks to a point with amazement 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:47.079
 very few people know that they left 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.289
 but already left 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.679
 You are now online in several of his many non 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:58.960
 but there are enough servers who look 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:01:00.729
 here it looks all 1.6 with almost 1 point 6.4 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.039
 of 6.4 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:06.520
 only few people still suffer from it 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:11.590
 He left and looks at the green legÃ­stica to DP 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.540
 eit 1.6.1 4 also many servers already 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.050
 look that 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:21.760
 many me 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:26.010
 many games even went server a lot 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:30.660
 it is also available for 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:34.120
 1.644 before this bad smell enters 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:39.670
 16.4 is speaking here that is what this 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:44.080
 is a good 6.4 that is compatible with 1,684 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.530
 but it does not work looks and our look this 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.570
 here for example guys tabu cattle because 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.570
 appeared a Chinese appear a point 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:58.330
 6.4 high pixel server looks 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:02.260
 now says bugle but is rented and then 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.230
 but it's version 1 6 points 4 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.590
 I think that poses is as always 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.740
 you should know that the versions 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.960
 like this 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:20.940
 11.1 to 1,682 is not only drawn improvements 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.760
 from bugs from 1.6.1 to a pool 6.4 takes the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.460
 banks gives a 6.2 point 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.930
 and if you have another 61 point and if so 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.310
 onwards 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.940
 I do not think there are any more new ones 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.560
 this is not the case because it is the business 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.430
 of the all share but so the thigh picks up 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.020
 super good 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:51.030
 It is that it serves ep just to pirate does not 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:55.800
 for unique thing with him is unless 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.500
 if you do the business but it is recommended but 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.120
 I will not explain it either because it is 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.790
 do not go to 6 with one in freight 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.870
 because you would have to use a mouse I 've already seen 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.840
 a video but let's the hacker I do not want 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.510
 that you use arkin here because you 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.650
 can be permanently banned from the mother 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.560
 craft 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.500
 I just did that video there with rock 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.860
 You know I have the built- in ok but 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.600
 I do not use at all the indexes come this 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:33.540
 and more so soon mother will also be 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.900
 update proposing 6.4 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.700
 it's kraft lland never updated do not know 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.930
 not now think 6.2're not a point 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.680
 6.2 she is 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:51.680
 they were good and spontaneous 2 even now 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:55.380
 had 1.6.1 is now in a point two ne 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.650
 and took a look here on the internet 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.980
 the next video the guys and cid an intro 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.880
 that you will be able to have your own 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.780
 people 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.710
 my I will help you in that 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.960
 and that's it 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:18.720
 the lot is great is you and he has a 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.840
 option that you put on to see your 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.470
 from 1.6 with two you can choose the 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.780
 version with minecraft forge 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.430
 you can already put any mode that 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.350
 you want 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:37.320
 In your manifesto, it's so for you. 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.260
 put mode could not 6.4 not if this 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.190
 You know but you have here in the square. 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:48.510
 11 and put a can inside the 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:52.590
 folder of the version so it is more difficult 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.420
 up but it expected to be tanned this 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.210
 motorboat that I love 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.510
 I can never show the voucher itself 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.640
 for you but that's how low you are 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.900
 do not get washable find all 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:11.280
 straight and great to get very good 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.250
 100% that even today they did not put 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.050
 one point 6.4 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.140
 I went in there a minute later. 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:25.020
 had a new version was a point 6.4 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:26.280
 with the strong tone is a very time thing 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.960
 very good 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.720
 I just use it and of course - when I went to play 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.770
 in an original server there is no way to use 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:41.760
 He but when I go to play pirate I just 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:44.640
 use it because I particularly found it 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.240
 much better and so it can you 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.140
 publish any logic you want not 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.360
 It's going to be a problem and I think he thinks 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.930
 better than the original mnaa in 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.900
 credit then take a look at it myself 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.670
 I hope you like it because she thinks 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.150
 very good 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:09.030
 It's the favorite I only use it I said no 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.590
 I know when its the one I can use 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.380
 pirate looks 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:18.600
 Who serves and I can not but when I 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:22.520
 Can I just use it but I hope these 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:31.410
 they had tanned galeano that's just the video 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:35.010
 that's the quietly the launcher I serve not 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.420
 for mac I do not know vigo does not fit 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.920
 netbook 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:44.970
 You know it's almost impossible to 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:47.610
 Find a launch for me I've never found 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:52.350
 all caches always gave error 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:55.740
 but mine is not a macbook or I do not know 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.440
 but they hope that if you have 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.380
 liked 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.800
 Be good, until the next time. 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.800
 went
