leaves and stuff like that but not
really<00:01:32.009> gonna<00:01:32.220> matter<00:01:32.430> when<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
really gonna matter when it's in the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.280 
really gonna matter when it's in the
ground<00:01:33.540> there<00:01:33.799> looks<00:01:34.799> healthy<00:01:35.189> enough<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
ground there looks healthy enough and

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.899 
ground there looks healthy enough and
every<00:01:37.290> single<00:01:37.740> bug<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.220> was<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.520> bucket

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
every single bug that was in that bucket

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.819 
every single bug that was in that bucket
didn't<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.810> anaerobic<00:01:41.600> process<00:01:42.829> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
didn't like the anaerobic process of

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.370 
didn't like the anaerobic process of
leaving<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.280> lid<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.640> having<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
leaving the lid on and having the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.719 
leaving the lid on and having the
bacteria<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.750> it's<00:01:48.750> bug<00:01:49.020> free<00:01:49.320> so

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
bacteria in there and it's bug free so

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.420 
bacteria in there and it's bug free so
that's<00:01:50.729> even<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.090> bigger<00:01:51.270> bonus<00:01:52.340> winds<00:01:53.340> have

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that's even a bigger bonus winds have

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.359 
that's even a bigger bonus winds have
already<00:01:53.640> been<00:01:53.820> through<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:55.130> no<00:01:56.130> great

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
already been through it so no great

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.280 
already been through it so no great
drama<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.570> I'll<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.810> put<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
drama there so I'll just put this in the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.840 
drama there so I'll just put this in the
ground<00:01:58.500> now<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.100> should<00:01:59.280> give<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.520> peas<00:01:59.820> a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
ground now that should give the peas a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.780 
ground now that should give the peas a
head<00:02:00.119> start<00:02:00.390> and

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
head start and

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.660 
head start and
oh<00:02:01.820> that's<00:02:02.300> in<00:02:02.510> rock<00:02:02.660> dust<00:02:02.840> as<00:02:03.050> warm<00:02:03.670> basically

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
oh that's in rock dust as warm basically

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.600 
oh that's in rock dust as warm basically
