00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.950
 history 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.410
 I was 20 when I had my daughter not married 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.920

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.099

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:31.290
 I told my parents when they sent me to 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.800

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.700
 after a few months in the organization 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.940

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.170
 stop the approval of the ng or they were going to 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.110

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.629
 international human rights and 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.420
 that we take the streets during that 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.460
 walk we became a family what 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.640
 only thing we could do was unite 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.800
 one another the police appeared from the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.310
 nothing the police was in a team 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:17.980
 riot helmets macanas 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.220
 that was the first time I was arrested 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.130
 we were put in a small cell 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.250
 full of narrow mud more can not with 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.580
 a single sanitary 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.850
 at the moment the women said let's do 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.010
 noise we started singing and dancing was 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.710
 a thing so beautiful that it disappeared 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.600
 the horror we had 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.920
 we got to keep the police 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.920
 up all night 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.350
 I was so proud that in ejea 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.570
 it was never approved 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.759
 after nine years of activism 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.470
 human rights the government continues 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.430
 harassing the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.930
 I have been beaten, arrested, threatened 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.950
 many times 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.979
 once I was hit nine times forced 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.990
 to tell many lies there was a 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.480
 old woman next to me also being 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.610
 hit 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.159
 I got up and shouted for him to 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.019
 stop I did not care that I 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.269
 do something to me because there was already 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.090
 had enough I thought about 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.640
 it's worth what if I die 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.510
 correct the letters of the people that we 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.910
 supports support and solidarity gives us 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.879
 hope and makes the authorities 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.910
 keep at bay I will continue the fight 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:44.069
 until you see a change in Zimbabwe 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.620
 eventually in the end maybe we can 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.010
 enjoy our human rights as 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.010
 Humans
