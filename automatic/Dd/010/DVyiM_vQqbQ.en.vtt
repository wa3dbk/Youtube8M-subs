 So I went to do it so it was closing 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.280
 slowly until you lock the device 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:13.540

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.090

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.270
 I do not know if a temporary file will fill out 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.020
 all memory is simply or is to 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.310
 grandmother 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.410

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.700
 I stopped liking my self, I love mine. 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.320
 Cell the s5 found fantastic ended 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:20.840
 the better than he is today the market 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:25.100

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.460
 understood 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.820
 So the guys had to tell 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.070
 You catch whoever thinks who talks 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.780
 that does not lock the beam and another had a 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.690
 person who had 14 s 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.640
 from work said that last 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:44.150
 update windows 8 windows not 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:48.560
 Look, looks just like I traveled 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:51.950
 west 88 -8 I just mistaken for 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.720
 cause of 8 8 s 8 14 s 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:58.940
 said that I am is became extremely 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:00.740
 slow as the iphone 4 slowed down 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.040
 after you had the update I think 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:08.260
 of the seven that version 8 no longer caught 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:12.590
 plus 14 is only picked from the 4s onwards 4s 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:15.860
 5565 if now the 6 and 6 plus right 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:20.060
 So this is personal, I hope I 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:23.540
 have you been as clear as possible? 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:26.420
 with you who think well here is not 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:30.020
 is to want to take the fight away from no one 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:35.120
 is to want to moralize thing is just 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:40.100
 show that everything is everything really exists 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:43.460
 and yes there is something people find 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.410
 That's 100% It's not 100% It's ok. 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:50.210
 so I hope you have 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:53.650
 liked sure thank you even more than the 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.650
 your young man had said
