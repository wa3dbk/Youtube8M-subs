hi all and welcome to the beta version

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.500 
hi all and welcome to the beta version
of<00:00:02.550> Jimmy<00:00:02.760> break<00:00:02.909> let's<00:00:03.149> load<00:00:03.300> up<00:00:03.330> the

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
of Jimmy break let's load up the

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.390 
of Jimmy break let's load up the
character<00:00:04.140> this<00:00:04.290> is<00:00:04.440> Jimmy<00:00:04.740> it's<00:00:05.069> got<00:00:05.190> six

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
character this is Jimmy it's got six

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.410 
character this is Jimmy it's got six
thousand<00:00:05.670> three<00:00:05.730> hundred<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.150> sixteen

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
thousand three hundred and sixteen

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.900 
thousand three hundred and sixteen
polygons<00:00:06.960> but<00:00:07.470> more<00:00:07.680> importantly<00:00:08.099> he<00:00:08.370> has<00:00:08.580> no

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
polygons but more importantly he has no

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.299 
polygons but more importantly he has no
bones<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.540> he<00:00:09.900> has<00:00:10.110> no<00:00:10.469> weight<00:00:10.769> maps<00:00:11.010> for

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
bones and he has no weight maps for

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.730 
bones and he has no weight maps for
those<00:00:11.429> bones<00:00:11.730> okay<00:00:12.450> so<00:00:12.509> let's<00:00:13.080> go<00:00:13.230> over<00:00:13.410> into

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
those bones okay so let's go over into

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.499 
those bones okay so let's go over into
Jimmy<00:00:14.070> rig<00:00:14.250> here's<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.030> interface<00:00:15.299> let's

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
Jimmy rig here's the interface let's

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.900 
Jimmy rig here's the interface let's
load<00:00:15.660> up<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.839> character

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
load up the character

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.820 
load up the character
let's<00:00:17.910> get<00:00:18.029> him<00:00:18.150> Jimmy<00:00:18.510> there<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:18.900> go<00:00:19.260> loading

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
let's get him Jimmy there we go loading

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.540 
let's get him Jimmy there we go loading
him<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.100> okay<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.439> me<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.010> you're

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
him in okay so if you like me and you're

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.550 
him in okay so if you like me and you're
not<00:00:23.730> very<00:00:23.939> good<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.510> rigging<00:00:25.019> character

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
not very good with the rigging character

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.290 
not very good with the rigging character
and<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.039> find<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> whole<00:00:26.460> process<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:27.029> bit

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
and you find the whole process a bit

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.779 
and you find the whole process a bit
tedious<00:00:27.740> what<00:00:28.740> Jimmy<00:00:29.010> rig<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.279> doing<00:00:29.640> is

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
tedious what Jimmy rig is doing is

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.560 
tedious what Jimmy rig is doing is
automatically<00:00:30.630> reading<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.560> character<00:00:32.130> here

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
automatically reading the character here

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.360 
automatically reading the character here
now<00:00:33.570> why<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.320> special<00:00:34.800> well<00:00:34.950> there's<00:00:35.190> no

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
now why is that special well there's no

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.670 
now why is that special well there's no
model<00:00:36.110> prerequisites<00:00:37.110> required<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.649> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
model prerequisites required so you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.350 
model prerequisites required so you
don't<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.129> put<00:00:38.399> him<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.670> specific<00:00:39.120> pose

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
don't have to put him in a specific pose

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.310 
don't have to put him in a specific pose
you<00:00:40.350> don't<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> closed<00:00:41.190> manifold

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
you don't have to have a closed manifold

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.110 
you don't have to have a closed manifold
basically<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.469> will<00:00:43.559> rig<00:00:43.800> any<00:00:44.010> model<00:00:44.399> does

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
basically it will rig any model does

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.940 
basically it will rig any model does
this<00:00:45.239> through<00:00:45.420> volumetrics<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.770> see

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
this through volumetrics so you can see

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.299 
this through volumetrics so you can see
there<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.840> it<00:00:48.840> uses<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.410> volumetric<00:00:49.710> stew

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
there and it uses the volumetric stew

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.130 
there and it uses the volumetric stew
weight<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.239> mesh<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.399> let's<00:00:53.399> say<00:00:53.610> it

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
weight the mesh and let's say it

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.110 
weight the mesh and let's say it
outperforms<00:00:55.140> auto<00:00:55.410> weight<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.100> some<00:00:56.850> other

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
outperforms auto weight on some other

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.000 
outperforms auto weight on some other
and<00:00:57.570> well-known<00:00:57.809> packages<00:00:59.030> okay<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:01.010> it's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and well-known packages okay so it's

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.359 
and well-known packages okay so it's
weight<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.640> second<00:01:04.909> now<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.330> using<00:01:07.369> GPU

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
weight for a second now it's using GPU

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.370 
weight for a second now it's using GPU
in<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> render<00:01:09.450> view<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.049> can

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
in the render view there which you can

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.850 
in the render view there which you can
see<00:01:10.880> which<00:01:11.880> enables<00:01:12.570> very<00:01:12.900> very<00:01:13.200> fast

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
see which enables very very fast

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.530 
see which enables very very fast
feedback<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.700> fact<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.180> pretty<00:01:15.420> much

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
feedback in fact it's pretty much

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.070 
feedback in fact it's pretty much
real-time<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.400> most<00:01:17.400> purposes<00:01:17.810> it's<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.869> plane

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
real-time for most purposes it's a plane

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.350 
real-time for most purposes it's a plane
character<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.820> textured

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
character but you can have a textured

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.859 
character but you can have a textured
character<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:22.200> normal<00:01:22.560> maps<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:24.060> specular

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
character with normal maps and specular

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.940 
character with normal maps and specular
and<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.350> okay<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.009> let's<00:01:26.970> load<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.409> motion

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
and so on okay so let's load up a motion

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.539 
and so on okay so let's load up a motion
we've<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:30.110> 2,500<00:01:31.110> or<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.439> Carnegie<00:01:32.159> Mellon

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
we've got 2,500 or so Carnegie Mellon

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.420 
we've got 2,500 or so Carnegie Mellon
University<00:01:33.350> motions<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.680> library<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
University motions in the library to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.819 
University motions in the library to
start<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.299> let's<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
start with and let's just just the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.039 
start with and let's just just the
character<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.520> add<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.509> bit<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.750> shading

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
character and add in a bit of shading

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.819 
character and add in a bit of shading
now<00:01:40.799> what<00:01:41.009> we've<00:01:41.130> done<00:01:41.159> there<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.729> we've<00:01:41.759> used

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
now what we've done there is we've used

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.429 
now what we've done there is we've used
auto<00:01:43.829> cyclic<00:01:44.610> animation<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.259> done

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
auto cyclic animation so what it's done

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.249 
auto cyclic animation so what it's done
it's<00:01:46.619> moving<00:01:46.950> down<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.189> bit<00:01:47.430> okay<00:01:48.140> what<00:01:49.140> it's

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it's moving down a bit okay what it's

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.740 
it's moving down a bit okay what it's
done<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.220> looked<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:51.000> within<00:01:51.479> that

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
done is it's looked for within that

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.069 
done is it's looked for within that
motion<00:01:52.020> capture<00:01:52.530> data<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:53.420> Spartan<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.630> frame

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
for a cycle loop I automatically created

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.580 
for a cycle loop I automatically created
it<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> blend<00:01:59.070> and<00:02:00.049> we<00:02:01.049> go<00:02:01.259> what<00:02:01.469> we're

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it with a blend and we go what we're

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.590 
it with a blend and we go what we're
going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.399> make<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.880> into<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
going to do is going to make that into a
