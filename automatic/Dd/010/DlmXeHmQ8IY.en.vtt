00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
actually beautiful we can go back to the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.450 
actually beautiful we can go back to the
start<00:00:48.300> screen<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> second<00:00:49.129> it's<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.340> very

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
start screen for a second it's just very

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.619 
start screen for a second it's just very
impressive<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.210> might<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
impressive and it might just be the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.420 
impressive and it might just be the
background<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.500> which<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> little

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
background on this which is a little

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.380 
background on this which is a little
different<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> background<00:00:54.000> we've<00:00:54.270> been

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
different for the background we've been

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.490 
different for the background we've been
seeing<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> other<00:00:54.989> delves<00:00:55.350> but

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
seeing on some of the other delves but

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.990 
seeing on some of the other delves but
just<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> screen<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.399> struck<00:00:56.730> me<00:00:56.760> as

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
just the screen really struck me as

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.790 
just the screen really struck me as
being<00:00:57.030> very<00:00:57.239> nice<00:00:57.690> clear<00:00:58.199> bright<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
being very nice clear bright and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.920 
being very nice clear bright and
beautiful<00:00:58.949> when<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> first<00:01:00.000> saw<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.420> tablet

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
beautiful when I first saw this tablet

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.100 
beautiful when I first saw this tablet
I'm<00:01:01.579> taking<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> look<00:01:02.760> at<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> edges<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
I'm taking a look at the edges it's a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.260 
I'm taking a look at the edges it's a
very<00:01:04.290> thin<00:01:04.619> tablet<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.460> well<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:06.030> gonna<00:01:06.180> be

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
very thin tablet as well it's gonna be

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.200 
very thin tablet as well it's gonna be
nice<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.600> hold<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.890> lot<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.159> ports<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.000> we're

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
nice to hold not a lot of ports so we're

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.899 
nice to hold not a lot of ports so we're
there<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> micro<00:01:10.140> SD<00:01:10.170> card<00:01:10.740> slot<00:01:10.799> there<00:01:11.280> but

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
there is a micro SD card slot there but

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.570 
there is a micro SD card slot there but
the<00:01:12.720> only<00:01:12.840> other<00:01:13.020> port<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.500> seem<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the only other port we seem to have is a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.870 
the only other port we seem to have is a
micro<00:01:15.240> USB<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.170> doesn't<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.920> docking

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
micro USB so this doesn't have a docking

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.830 
micro USB so this doesn't have a docking
port<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.470> grown-up<00:01:20.310> venue<00:01:21.180> 11<00:01:21.450> crow

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
port like the grown-up venue 11 crow

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.969 
port like the grown-up venue 11 crow
this<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> pretty<00:01:23.549> thin<00:01:24.150> tablet<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.710> it

with<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.290> quad<00:01:35.280> core<00:01:35.549> atom<00:01:35.790> processor<00:01:36.540> this

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
with a quad core atom processor this

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.609 
with a quad core atom processor this
display<00:01:38.220> aside<00:01:39.119> from<00:01:39.180> being<00:01:39.329> IPS<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.869> also<00:01:40.079> HD

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
display aside from being IPS is also HD

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.550 
display aside from being IPS is also HD
and<00:01:40.979> again<00:01:41.490> looks<00:01:42.150> really<00:01:42.210> nice<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.229> bright

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and again looks really nice and bright

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.289 
and again looks really nice and bright
it's<00:01:44.040> very<00:01:44.159> thin<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.640> very<00:01:44.790> light<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.090> very

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
it's very thin it's very light it's very

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.819 
it's very thin it's very light it's very
foldable<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.380> fold<00:01:46.710> in

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
foldable as you can see we can fold in

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.109 
foldable as you can see we can fold in
one<00:01:46.979> hand<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.340> wouldn't<00:01:47.549> necessarily<00:01:47.670> want

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
one hand you wouldn't necessarily want

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.399 
one hand you wouldn't necessarily want
to<00:01:48.329> hold<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.600> your<00:01:48.630> hand<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.020> all

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
to hold it in your hand like that all

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.670 
to hold it in your hand like that all
the<00:01:49.439> time<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.640> possible<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.439> far

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the time but it is possible and so far

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.190 
the time but it is possible and so far
the<00:01:53.070> performance<00:01:53.640> seems<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.509> very<00:01:54.540> smooth

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the performance seems to be very smooth

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.490 
the performance seems to be very smooth
now<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> things<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.060> probe<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
now one of the things that the probe the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.870 
now one of the things that the probe the
venue<00:01:58.799> pros<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> common<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.729> they

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
venue pros have a common is that they

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.149 
venue pros have a common is that they
both<00:02:00.030> work<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.509> 10

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
both work with 10

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.630 
both work with 10
the<00:02:01.789> pen<00:02:02.090> is<00:02:02.390> separate<00:02:03.130> there<00:02:04.130> we<00:02:04.249> go<00:02:04.369> and

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
the pen is separate there we go and

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.980 
the pen is separate there we go and
let's<00:02:04.939> just<00:02:05.060> talk<00:02:05.210> about<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.479> pen<00:02:05.689> for<00:02:05.719> a

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
let's just talk about the pen for a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.520 
let's just talk about the pen for a
second<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:08.019> one<00:02:09.019> thing<00:02:09.140> you'll<00:02:09.289> notice<00:02:09.410> about

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
second so one thing you'll notice about

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.900 
second so one thing you'll notice about
this<00:02:09.739> kind<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.310> thicker<00:02:10.670> than<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
this kind of it is thicker than the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.809 
this kind of it is thicker than the
average<00:02:11.420> pen<00:02:11.720> if<00:02:12.680> you're<00:02:12.860> used<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.340> Galaxy

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
average pen if you're used to the Galaxy

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.030 
average pen if you're used to the Galaxy
Note<00:02:13.849> series<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.690> really<00:02:15.080> comes<00:02:15.230> with<00:02:15.500> very

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
Note series this really comes with very

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.369 
Note series this really comes with very
thin<00:02:16.239> pens<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.420> actually<00:02:17.780> fit<00:02:18.049> into<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
thin pens that actually fit into the

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.710 
thin pens that actually fit into the
body<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:19.340> tablet<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:20.180> is<00:02:20.330> not<00:02:20.480> true<00:02:20.660> for

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
body of the tablet that is not true for

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.300 
body of the tablet that is not true for
either<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.170> tablets<00:02:21.769> this<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.160> the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
either the tablets this is the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.710 
either the tablets this is the
standalone<00:02:22.730> pants<00:02:23.030> also<00:02:23.120> going<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.330> be<00:02:23.420> sold

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
standalone pants also going to be sold

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.559 
standalone pants also going to be sold
separately<00:02:24.459> another<00:02:25.459> thing<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:26.239> it<00:02:26.450> is

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
separately another thing is that it is

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.080 
separately another thing is that it is
not<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:27.019> walk<00:02:27.620> home<00:02:27.830> technology<00:02:28.340> synaptics

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
not a walk home technology synaptics

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.640 
not a walk home technology synaptics
technology<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.049> since<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> little

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
technology and so since it is a little

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.259 
technology and so since it is a little
bit<00:02:30.799> thicker<00:02:31.010> one<00:02:31.549> of<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.730> reasons<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.120> that

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
bit thicker one of the reasons is that

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.449 
bit thicker one of the reasons is that
it<00:02:32.480> has<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.629> battery<00:02:32.989> in<00:02:33.349> it<00:02:33.379> this<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:33.950> an<00:02:34.010> active

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
it has a battery in it this is an active

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.330 
it has a battery in it this is an active
10<00:02:34.849> but<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.959> does<00:02:36.200> have<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.500> battery<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.129> and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
10 but it does have a battery in it and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.670 
10 but it does have a battery in it and
that<00:02:37.879> is<00:02:38.030> again<00:02:38.629> different<00:02:39.170> from<00:02:39.379> what<00:02:39.530> we've

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
that is again different from what we've

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.880 
that is again different from what we've
seen<00:02:39.709> with<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:41.000> Galaxy<00:02:41.420> Note<00:02:41.450> series<00:02:41.890> yes

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
seen with the Galaxy Note series yes

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.220 
seen with the Galaxy Note series yes
there<00:02:43.099> we<00:02:43.220> go<00:02:43.340> has<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.120> knife<00:02:44.360> stuff<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:44.989> for

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
there we go has a knife stuff to it for

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.569 
there we go has a knife stuff to it for
a<00:02:45.260> pen<00:02:45.470> that's<00:02:45.709> one<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.160> nice<00:02:46.549> things

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
a pen that's one of the nice things

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.699 
a pen that's one of the nice things
about<00:02:46.849> that<00:02:47.000> we<00:02:47.299> really<00:02:47.569> like<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:48.530> does

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
about that we really like and it does

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.690 
about that we really like and it does
have<00:02:48.739> some<00:02:49.340> like<00:02:49.700> pressure<00:02:50.030> sensitivity<00:02:51.019> but

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
have some like pressure sensitivity but

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.400 
have some like pressure sensitivity but
apparently<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:53.269> is<00:02:53.690> not<00:02:53.840> dev<00:02:54.019> someone<00:02:54.319> of

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
apparently that is not dev someone of
