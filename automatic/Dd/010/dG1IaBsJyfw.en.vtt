point<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:56.870> hope<00:01:57.080> you're<00:01:57.290> thinking<00:01:58.270> as<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.300> genius

but<00:02:01.130> I've<00:02:01.520> come<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.090> realization<00:02:02.360> that's

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
but I've come to the realization that's

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.210 
but I've come to the realization that's
that's<00:02:03.200> probably<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:03.770> not<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:03.950> reality

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
that's probably just not a reality

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.680 
that's probably just not a reality
that's<00:02:04.700> not<00:02:04.910> one<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.120> the<00:02:05.240> things<00:02:05.480> going

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
that's not one of the things going

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.660 
that's not one of the things going
through<00:02:05.900> your<00:02:05.960> mind<00:02:06.310> so<00:02:07.310> you're<00:02:07.460> probably

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
through your mind so you're probably

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.530 
through your mind so you're probably
thinking<00:02:07.940> one<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.390> three<00:02:08.840> things<00:02:09.080> most<00:02:09.950> likely
