I'm Steve Carano with ask a real expert

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.150 
I'm Steve Carano with ask a real expert
Smith<00:00:03.300> Greg<00:00:03.540> asks<00:00:04.140> this<00:00:04.319> question<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.980> I've

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
Smith Greg asks this question and I've

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.889 
Smith Greg asks this question and I've
been<00:00:05.310> waiting<00:00:05.640> for<00:00:05.819> somebody<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.150> ask<00:00:06.450> it

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
been waiting for somebody to ask it

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.370 
been waiting for somebody to ask it
he<00:00:07.319> says<00:00:07.529> Steve<00:00:07.859> are<00:00:08.160> negative<00:00:09.030> reps<00:00:09.330> as<00:00:09.630> good

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
he says Steve are negative reps as good

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.360 
he says Steve are negative reps as good
or<00:00:10.410> as<00:00:10.800> important<00:00:11.370> as<00:00:11.519> positive<00:00:12.389> reps<00:00:12.630> and

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
or as important as positive reps and

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.160 
or as important as positive reps and
that's<00:00:14.370> been<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> big<00:00:14.849> question<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.990> big

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
that's been a big question and a big

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.779 
that's been a big question and a big
study<00:00:16.470> since<00:00:16.859> guys<00:00:17.039> started<00:00:17.430> lifting<00:00:17.580> weights

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
study since guys started lifting weights

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.640 
study since guys started lifting weights
and<00:00:18.150> I'm<00:00:18.270> sure<00:00:18.690> there<00:00:18.869> are<00:00:18.900> tons<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.470> studies

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
and I'm sure there are tons of studies

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.189 
and I'm sure there are tons of studies
out<00:00:19.980> there<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.520> show<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.539> negative<00:00:21.720> reps

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
out there that show that negative reps

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.240 
out there that show that negative reps
are<00:00:22.529> better<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> only<00:00:24.240> problem<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.750> this

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
are better but the only problem is this

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.160 
are better but the only problem is this
we<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.550> take<00:00:26.730> into<00:00:26.880> consideration<00:00:27.170> real

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
we have to take into consideration real

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.070 
we have to take into consideration real
life<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:29.250> can't<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.699> lift<00:00:30.119> doing<00:00:30.900> negative

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
life you can't just lift doing negative

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.319 
life you can't just lift doing negative
reps<00:00:31.560> even<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:32.340> they<00:00:32.489> were<00:00:32.550> better<00:00:33.239> than

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
reps even if they were better than

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.630 
reps even if they were better than
positive<00:00:33.930> reps<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.710> can't<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.309> some

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
positive reps you can't just have some

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.270 
positive reps you can't just have some
monster<00:00:35.969> lift<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.079> weight<00:00:37.320> off<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.040> you

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
monster lift the weight off you and you

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.860 
monster lift the weight off you and you
bench<00:00:38.579> press<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.879> lower<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> guy

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
bench press you lower it then the guy

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.900 
bench press you lower it then the guy
lifts<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.440> off<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.890> don't<00:00:41.040> help<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.489> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
lifts it off and you don't help and you

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.700 
lifts it off and you don't help and you
take<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> again<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.510> lower<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.620> you

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
take it again and lower it and then you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.410 
take it again and lower it and then you
have<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> guy<00:00:44.040> lift<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:44.489> again<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
have the guy lift it up again and you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.600 
have the guy lift it up again and you
lower<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.079> mean<00:00:46.500> that's<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:47.039> realistic

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
lower it I mean that's not realistic

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700 
lower it I mean that's not realistic
lifting<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.960> some<00:00:49.170> dude<00:00:49.320> hand<00:00:49.590> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
lifting or you have some dude hand you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.110 
lifting or you have some dude hand you
the<00:00:49.800> weight<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.250> lower<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> curl

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the weight and you lower it and a curl

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
the weight and you lower it and a curl
then<00:00:51.690> he<00:00:51.780> takes<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.140> from<00:00:52.289> yet<00:00:52.530> picks<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> up

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
then he takes it from yet picks it up

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.299 
then he takes it from yet picks it up
and<00:00:53.219> then<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.670> lower<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.000> again<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> even<00:00:56.039> if

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and then you lower it again so even if

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.029 
and then you lower it again so even if
negative<00:00:56.969> reps<00:00:57.420> created<00:00:58.050> additional<00:00:58.770> trauma

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
negative reps created additional trauma

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.760 
negative reps created additional trauma
simply<00:00:59.820> using<00:01:00.300> negative<00:01:00.480> reps<00:01:00.960> alone

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
simply using negative reps alone

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.119 
simply using negative reps alone
wouldn't<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> realistic<00:01:03.030> way<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.210> train<00:01:03.600> I

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
wouldn't be a realistic way to train I

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.640 
wouldn't be a realistic way to train I
think<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.489> need<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.150> positive<00:01:06.420> reps<00:01:07.020> meaning

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
think we need the positive reps meaning

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.240 
think we need the positive reps meaning
the<00:01:07.950> concentric<00:01:08.790> phase<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> exercise<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
the concentric phase of the exercise to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.390 
the concentric phase of the exercise to
maximize<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.450> negative<00:01:12.930> or<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.400> eccentric

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
maximize the negative or the eccentric

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.600 
maximize the negative or the eccentric
benefits<00:01:15.060> by<00:01:15.990> working<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.590> by<00:01:17.009> driving<00:01:17.520> the

weight<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.909> by<00:01:18.090> contracting<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> muscle<00:01:19.350> we

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
weight up by contracting the muscle we

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.260 
weight up by contracting the muscle we
are<00:01:20.100> doing<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.610> couple<00:01:20.759> things

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
are doing a couple things

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.359 
are doing a couple things
adding<00:01:22.049> trauma<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> muscle<00:01:23.009> causing

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
adding trauma to the muscle causing

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.609 
adding trauma to the muscle causing
growth<00:01:23.610> we're<00:01:24.330> fatiguing<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> muscle<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
growth we're fatiguing the muscle and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.880 
growth we're fatiguing the muscle and
we're<00:01:26.040> utilizing<00:01:26.189> or<00:01:26.909> using<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:27.420> energy<00:01:27.710> so<00:01:28.710> by

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
we're utilizing or using up energy so by

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.469 
we're utilizing or using up energy so by
the<00:01:28.950> time<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.520> want<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.790> incorporate<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the time you want to incorporate a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.870 
the time you want to incorporate a
couple<00:01:30.960> negative<00:01:31.439> reps<00:01:31.680> at<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> end<00:01:32.189> where

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
couple negative reps at the end where

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.490 
couple negative reps at the end where
you<00:01:32.909> lower<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.509> weight<00:01:33.689> your<00:01:33.930> buddy<00:01:34.170> helps

you lower the weight your buddy helps

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.440 
you lower the weight your buddy helps
you<00:01:34.590> back<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.310> those<00:01:35.820> negative<00:01:36.240> reps

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
you back up with it those negative reps

you back up with it those negative reps
are<00:01:37.189> impacting<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.280> muscle<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:38.820> already

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
are impacting a muscle that's already

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960 
are impacting a muscle that's already
been<00:01:39.780> worked<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.829> death<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.369> you're<00:01:41.759> just

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
been worked to death and you're just

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.609 
been worked to death and you're just
adding<00:01:42.119> some<00:01:42.450> additional<00:01:42.990> trauma<00:01:43.320> and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
adding some additional trauma and

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.440 
adding some additional trauma and
absolutely<00:01:44.369> when<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> muscle<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.030> tight<00:01:45.270> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
absolutely when a muscle is tight and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.060 
absolutely when a muscle is tight and
you<00:01:45.560> straighten<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.649> out

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
you straighten it out

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.770 
you straighten it out
I<00:01:47.100> believe<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.850> does<00:01:48.090> add<00:01:48.299> some<00:01:48.600> additional

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
I believe that does add some additional

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.200 
I believe that does add some additional
micro<00:01:49.409> trauma<00:01:49.740> causing<00:01:50.549> additional<00:01:50.970> growth

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
micro trauma causing additional growth

micro trauma causing additional growth
do<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.810> need<00:01:51.990> tons<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.649> tons<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:53.009> negative

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
do you need tons and tons of negative

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.600 
do you need tons and tons of negative
reps<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.689> or<00:01:54.840> two<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.140> fine<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:56.280> also

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
reps I think one or two is fine but also

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.889 
reps I think one or two is fine but also
think<00:01:56.790> about<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.210> instead<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.719> negative

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
think about this instead of negative

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.530 
think about this instead of negative
reps<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:58.920> also<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> down<00:01:59.610> set<00:02:00.000> you

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
reps you can also do a down set you

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
military you know 225 for 10 then you

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.130 
military you know 225 for 10 then you
pull<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.200> off<00:02:04.310> put<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.340> 185<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.420> do<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.810> for

pull that off put on 185 and do that for

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
five or six pull that off and do 135 for

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.130 
five or six pull that off and do 135 for
10<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.970> another<00:02:12.390> way<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.629> creating<00:02:13.050> a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
10 that is another way of creating a

no<00:02:13.709> trauma<00:02:14.130> on<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.819> muscle<00:02:15.390> causing

additional<00:02:16.319> growth<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.160> that's<00:02:17.430> my<00:02:17.610> take<00:02:17.819> on

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
additional growth so that's my take on
