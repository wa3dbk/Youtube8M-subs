00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.589
 I don't know if you're noticing that you are 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.130
 completely framed you left me 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.330
 a corner of really sadness is 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.790
 then that leaves with some more 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.130
 spurs what he thinks exalted we talk about 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.299
 spurs this debate you 've seen 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.000
 versailles 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.340
 let's return to the playstation topic 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.519
 since the good andrew house one of the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.990
 absolute leaders in short in the field of Sony not 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.980
 I remember precisely his own 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.790
 qualification for emerald is however it is 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.040
 sony Czech tv I do n't know if the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.820
 president of sony sony america sunday 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.829
 however, it should be founded 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.390
 in the last warehouseman who spoke 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.950
 practically released this beauty 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.870
 interview on games inc if in reality it is 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.329
 a very good full-bodied and view them 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.739
 half let's say two bombs came out that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.719
 have been around the world and are 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.980
 return to your ass since 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.760
 then he obviously had to do the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.480
 classic clarifications on two fronts the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.910
 first is that which concerned 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.920
 playstation life he is aa while 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.909
 he spoke of it as a legacy 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.860
 alloy platform is a term you use 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.770
 unexpected songs to understand 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.939
 now outdated platforms we say ceo 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.049
 archived in terms of novelty that is 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.860
 what you use today for 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.720
 playstation 3 xbox 360 wii nintendo 64 e 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.979
 etc 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.930
 there can be but to say a single one 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.590
 hardware than four years three 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.780
 34 years on the rump 15 postal 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.000
 I am one of the few stevensons and of the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.430
 fight form on the one hand sky still in the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 my backpack that you don't see if there 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.110
 I'm just post on the train there are not 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.790
 great new titles are almost 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.700
 all in to adapt the console to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.570
 vincenzo by the way could seen that 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.369
 then he gave some clarifications 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.890
 purpose could actually open the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.540
 road also to the concept of these yes 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.950
 rumor of a new life playstation 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.100
 that is, he actually wanted to say 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.409
 a platform that we are archiving 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.689
 because we will review it 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.909
 as important as before so it is also 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.680
 a discussion to see if there is a non 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.950
 I see the foundation of controversy no 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.990
 because then the sense 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.470
 he said that they will not abandon the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.860
 their mobile business so I believe that 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.110
 in the end we are happy because they have them 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.600
 many things are definitely oriented 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.790
 in break even and it would be a thing for 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.980
 which you sell enough to fit in 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.720
 development costs hex software i don't know 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.130
 how they are made but I don't think well in 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.710
 sense that evident of a certain point 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.050
 have stopped the same to invest the 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.740
 famous gravity race tour is not known that 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.050
 end did 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.910
 and if it came out it will come out as playstation e 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.430
 playstation life maybe if there were 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.020
 it would be a road that is finally like 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.440
 play because how to make a do 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.630
 interesting ps4 game and ps life type 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.880
 shooting and hdi that this brings us to the 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.500
 second and it brings 6 worked that is 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.730
 the one that generated the most panic, that is 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.750
 the fact that basically rivas has 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.640
 heard the train of discord 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.480
 confirmed that we were saying that is the 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.730
 first bet exactly the line up per 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.520
 sparti of playstation 4 and said 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.730
 clearly it is and little stars this 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.709
 written sparse which generated 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.150
 discussions but that can be produced 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.890
 in anything that concerns one 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.400
 scarcity in numerical terms we can 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.200
 that is to say, it is scarce and not scarce 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.330
 many employees give the bald one 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.950
 still offends zero parties too 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.360
 because it has no negative load is a 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.299
 as a matter of fact they gave to do the 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.200
 jump that I do not know that there is also the don 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:32.120
 August 0 and hdi huila with read it as 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.320
 the line up of it is part is true 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.480
 problem is that he says he gave a 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.860
 As a matter of fact it is that they amelia st primes 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.750
 all amazes that one is generated 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.220
 controversy a debate on a given 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.620
 fact is because he declared it the 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.260
 we were president like him to 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.640
 running naked is very good 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.410
 then I tell you, I didn't get one 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.360
 reflection on the subject in the sense that 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.060
 rightly so much now 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.709
 consoles sell for third parties e 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.510
 no doubt that in any case it is not that they sell 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.280
 other people play much more 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.200
 third part of what the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.120
 explosives and primis because I know more and 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.540
 then the most sold games are 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.120
 multi platform and those that sony alle 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.209
 its exceptions and even microsoft has one 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.850
 pair sony has the most 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.250
 then I think the problem here is that 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.700
 sony itself this is a bit of the strand of 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.150
 you picked up account a few years ago on 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.400
 playstation 3 had made a big one 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.620
 communication campaign boasting 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.900
 of the exclusive if you remember the year in 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.509
 they said this year we have 12 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.449
 exclusive an exclusivity per month and if not 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.380
 the ads are communication stuff 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.660
 one year 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.940
 where he sold so much playstation 4 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.360
 also on the promise of exclusives 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.979
 because it came out last of us masterpiece 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.509
 of life in the last year of 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.060
 playstation 3 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.039
 re-launched playstation 4 because you know 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.560
 that sony by its users 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.150
 and because every one will not abandon them 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.370
 in the end microsoft instead from this 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.560
 ugly vice that when it feels stinks 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.330
 burned and closes bulkhead ocean 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.800
 Italian shutter must be done this 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.940
 there are two exceptions with time force 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.010
 last year but it was 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.020
 an exception the rest moves everything and 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.370
 he says goodbye we make one of the 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.370
 few things, however, the same strength 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.610
 motorsport 5 instead of 360 was not released 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.860
 then we see them as a fact 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.330
 there is that the scaccia has been one 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.280
 astral conjuncture that led to 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.240
 these very few titles for playstation 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.229
 we arrived we will come down 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.400
 let's go that led to these 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.479
 very few titles for playstation 4 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.570
 what is the problem is that in the moment in 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.820
 which of course this is generated 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.770
 there is a palio which can be debated not 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.409
 there was a debate, however, it is the grip and the 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.300
 speech is that from an executive to one 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.680
 week from the three you don't 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.720
 would you wait because at the moment 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.510
 you're buying communities to tell them 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.659
 look we will shoot bombs and there 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.860
 they will also be triple sony for Christmas 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:54.190
 such an admission makes you think 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.490
 that perhaps all these bombs are not there 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.380
 by the end of the year they will not be made 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.610
 there can be and then to see the outside 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.470
 exact Palermo and therefore the controversy 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.240
 according to honest the vote made to have so many 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.830
 nice multiplatform games after me 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.909
 we have in fact that for now you see 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.320
 announced themes is not there and I repeat not you 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.729
 there is not exact there are no titles 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.740
 the home that make you say that the 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.389
 I only see on the outside I buy 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.120
 playstation remember that being already 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.949
 has it at the end there is the offer 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.680
 videogame of the past even if it is not 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.449
 which I do n't know because understanding then I repeat is 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.180
 communication film was made 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:33.460
 because sony just the last few years has 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.889
 bet very much on the quality of the 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.469
 apologies 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.599
 here I am always excellent and true 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:40.039
 amount of exclusive time when 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:42.740
 you find yourself anyway because of us too 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:46.430
 hd that looks very interesting though it is 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:49.219
 however a rebus of montella was out 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.669
 on ps life you have to see other tones myself 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:55.069
 I really believe in taste and la 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:57.979
 we shoot milan despite the red we said 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:59.449
 anyway what do you think for you I have a 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.669
 problem or especially if you have 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.379
 playstation 4 which I then have a problem with 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:04.909
 there are no more spaces if you don't have one 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:07.310
 is a problem because it makes you spend the 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:08.659
 want to buy it exactly and if there is 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.080
 liked our little train they do 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:11.080
 review again
