you're<00:00:08.540> watching<00:00:08.690> a<00:00:08.960> series<00:00:09.350> of<00:00:09.379> videos<00:00:09.799> on

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
you're watching a series of videos on

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.560 
you're watching a series of videos on
how<00:00:10.250> to<00:00:10.280> create<00:00:10.610> the<00:00:10.879> perfect<00:00:11.090> painting

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.279 

we<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.590> used<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.130> seeing<00:00:17.340> color<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:19.110> don't

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
we so used to seeing color that we don't

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.040 
we so used to seeing color that we don't
realize<00:00:19.680> how<00:00:20.189> complex<00:00:20.939> color<00:00:21.360> really<00:00:21.660> years

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
realize how complex color really years

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.190 
realize how complex color really years
you<00:00:23.039> see<00:00:23.220> color<00:00:23.790> has<00:00:24.240> three<00:00:24.750> distinct

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
you see color has three distinct

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.740 
you see color has three distinct
components<00:00:25.619> which<00:00:26.430> are<00:00:26.700> i<00:00:27.000> takes<00:00:27.480> into

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
components which are i takes into

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.019 
components which are i takes into
consideration<00:00:28.009> every<00:00:29.009> time<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.490> sees<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
consideration every time it sees the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.220 
consideration every time it sees the
color<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:31.439> first<00:00:31.710> component<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.720> Hugh<00:00:33.720> now

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
color the first component is Hugh now

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.700 
color the first component is Hugh now
here<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:36.030> color<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:37.050> actually<00:00:37.199> seen

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
here is a color that we actually seen

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.470 
here is a color that we actually seen
for<00:00:38.100> example<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.910> yellow<00:00:39.150> or<00:00:39.720> blue<00:00:39.989> or<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.620> red

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
for example in yellow or blue or a red

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.540 
for example in yellow or blue or a red
the<00:00:42.480> next<00:00:42.900> component<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:44.250> full<00:00:45.080> value<00:00:46.550> value

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the next component is full value value

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.729 
the next component is full value value
is<00:00:48.649> unlight<00:00:49.649> by<00:00:50.039> her<00:00:50.250> darker<00:00:50.789> color<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
is unlight by her darker color is a

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.100 
is unlight by her darker color is a
yellow<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.129> got<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> much<00:00:53.820> higher<00:00:54.120> total<00:00:54.719> value

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
yellow is got a much higher total value

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.740 
yellow is got a much higher total value
then<00:00:55.770> say<00:00:56.309> your<00:00:56.430> other<00:00:56.879> order<00:00:57.480> french

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
then say your other order french

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.580 
then say your other order french
ultramarine<00:00:57.960> which<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> darker<00:00:59.520> color<00:01:00.590> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
ultramarine which is a darker color the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.150 
ultramarine which is a darker color the
third<00:01:01.800> component<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.730> chroma<00:01:03.589> chroma<00:01:04.589> is

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
third component is chroma chroma is

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.350 
third component is chroma chroma is
decided<00:01:05.850> by<00:01:06.030> how<00:01:06.240> pure<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.140> color<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.800> and<00:01:08.360> in

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
decided by how pure the color is and in

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.990 
decided by how pure the color is and in
other<00:01:09.539> words<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.560> grey<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> version<00:01:11.850> for

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
other words if it's a grey a version for

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.350 
other words if it's a grey a version for
example<00:01:12.899> a<00:01:13.080> war<00:01:13.410> amber<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.160> a<00:01:14.610> much<00:01:14.880> grayer

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
example a war amber is a much grayer

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.600 
example a war amber is a much grayer
color<00:01:15.780> then<00:01:16.229> say<00:01:16.649> a<00:01:17.000> sienna<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:20.220> colors

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
color then say a sienna the colors

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.760 
color then say a sienna the colors
chroma<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:22.320> also<00:01:22.920> decided<00:01:23.490> by<00:01:23.880> its<00:01:24.180> strength

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
chroma is also decided by its strength

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.800 
chroma is also decided by its strength
for<00:01:25.770> example<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.460> yellow<00:01:26.909> ochre<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.630> raw

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
for example a yellow ochre and a raw

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.410 
for example a yellow ochre and a raw
sienna<00:01:28.400> yellow<00:01:29.400> because<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.850> much<00:01:30.090> stronger

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
sienna yellow because I'm much stronger

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.690 
sienna yellow because I'm much stronger
color<00:01:30.840> than<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.140> raw<00:01:31.439> sienna<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.430> had<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
color than the raw sienna if you had to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.420 
color than the raw sienna if you had to
mix<00:01:32.880> each<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.479> those<00:01:33.659> into<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> French<00:01:35.280> soldier

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
mix each of those into a French soldier

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.940 
mix each of those into a French soldier
marine<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.210> example<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.930> will<00:01:37.500> notice<00:01:37.740> that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
marine for example you will notice that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.899 
marine for example you will notice that
you<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.520> throw<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.970> way<00:01:39.509> more<00:01:39.540> raw<00:01:40.170> Sienna

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
you have to throw in way more raw Sienna

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.670 
you have to throw in way more raw Sienna
then<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.329> would<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.750> throw<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.200> yellow

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
then you would have to throw in yellow

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.780 
then you would have to throw in yellow
ochre<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:44.970> roughly<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.020> same<00:01:46.229> color<00:01:46.790> it's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
ochre to get roughly the same color it's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.700 
ochre to get roughly the same color it's
because<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> raw<00:01:48.600> Sienna<00:01:48.990> has<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> lower

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
because the raw Sienna has a lower

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.050 
because the raw Sienna has a lower
chroma<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.390> strong<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:53.369> yellow

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
chroma it's not as strong as the yellow

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.630 
chroma it's not as strong as the yellow
ochre<00:01:54.920> those<00:01:55.920> are<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> three<00:01:56.430> components

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
ochre those are the three components

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.080 
ochre those are the three components
that<00:01:57.240> you've<00:01:57.509> got<00:01:57.750> four<00:01:58.710> color<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.909> shows

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
that you've got four color it just shows

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.110 
that you've got four color it just shows
