00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.270
Hey Head Squeezers, I hope you're well.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.070
This question comes in from Kevin Sheppard
from our G plus community, who asks-- 'The

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.920
armpit, what's it for and why is it hairy?'

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.920
Great question Kevin.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.179
Now I was thinking of calling this one 'how
the smell of your sweat helps you score',

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:22.179
or not.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.349
In this video I'm going to uncover whether
or not you should eat red meat, and whether

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.420
or not that makes you more attractive to the
opposite sex or not, and the definitive answer

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.050
from the world of science -- who has the most
potent BO, men or women.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.620
That's all coming up.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.620
First things first, though.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.600
There are a whole load of theories as to why
we have hairy pits...

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.250
Theory number one says it's actually to wick
the sweat away from the underarm so that you

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.629
prevent the lymph nodes from over-heating.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.280
Theory number two says it's too lower down
the friction, reduce the friction when you

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.239
walk between your upper arm and your thorax.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.020
The third theory, and the one that I want
to explore is all about sweating, and releasing

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.420
sex pheromones.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, not to go all Sherlock on you, but you
are giving out a lot of information to the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
outside world.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.390
Now I'm not talking about a particular type
of mud on your shoe, or spotting a particular

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.050
hair on your jacket.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.140
No, I'm talking about your smell.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.820
And while I'm at it, let's uncover why that
smell is produced.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.500
It's kind of icky.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.830
It's all about the by-products of microbial
fermentation in your body's damp creases.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.970
In other words, you have bacteria living in
there that are feeding off your nutrient rich

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.230
secretions, and it is their waste that creates
that smell.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.810
Gross.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.380
James May did a fantastic film last year all
about smell, and about how deodorant works,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.560
so we'll put a link up to that after this
film.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.580
So, next question, what does your sweat say
about you?

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.420
Well, recent research suggests that sweat
says a whole load of things about an individuals'

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.859
status within a group, about their gender,
about their reproductive state... in hyenas.

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:16.069
But heh, hyenas are mammals.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.069
We're mammals....

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.260
No, there is a lot of research that has been
done on humans as well that suggests that

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.409
the underarm smell does have a big role in
attracting and keeping a partner.

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.290
Think about it, you're in a club, you're strutting
your stuff, someone comes up close to you,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.550
you think "yeah, they're pretty fine."

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.610
But then you get a waft and it's all a bit
of a turn off.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.610
Yeah.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.200
But it's a lot deeper than that.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.060
Actually, subconsciously, you may be attracted
or not attracted to their smell

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.879
Now, I'm not talking about Chanel or CK, I
am talking about Eau de armpit.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:02.099
More specifically, I'm talking about your
major histocompatibility complex or MHC -- it's

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.560
a bunch of genes that are important and are
linked to not only your smell but your immune

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560
system.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.001
There was a brilliant experiment done by a
scientist called Claus Wedekind what hed did

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:19.499
was he asked some guys to wear the same t-shirt
for a few days.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:25.310
He then gave these smelly t-shirts to a bunch
of ladies, and asked them to choose a partner

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.360
based purely on the smell of those t-shirts.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.540
They found the t-shirts most pleasant from
guys who had very different MHCs to them.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.840
Why is that the case?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.310
Well, it's really good because it shows they've
got very different genes.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.370
So not only would it stop incest -- that was
one thing they thought -- it would also mean

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.310
that if they did partner up and have a kid
they would have a combination of those two

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.950
different types of genes, different types
of immune systems and they'd have the strongest

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.989
immune system that they could.

http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/260/1359/245.abstract

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:00.989
So there's clearly a whole bunch of different
chemicals in play here, and the last one I

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.469
want to tell you about is androstadienone
-- it's a steroid, a natural by-product of

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:06.469
testosterone

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:12.680
Now, researchers at Liverpool University set
up a very interesting speed dating event.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.910
They gave a portion of the women some of that
androstadienone underneath their nostrils,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.580
and the other portion didn't have that at
all, they just had a placebo that smelt the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.580
same.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.790
And they found that the ones that were under
the influence of that chemical rated all the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.830
men as a lot more attractive than the ones
that weren't.

human chemosignal, modulates women's attributions

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18601928

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.520
There you go, sex pheremones are very very
important, and the idea that hairy pits can

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.890
help release these sex pheremones out and
have a very big impact on mate choice.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.560
So, time for the big question.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.500
Who has the smelliest BO -- men or women?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.770
Well, the research was done by the Monell
Chemical Senses Center, and they found...it

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.200
was men.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.200
Sorry guys.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.160
And, And, bonus fact for you, women apparently
prefer the "odor signatures" from men who

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.160
are on a non-meat diet.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160
So, our advice, best lay off that steak before
a night out!

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160
That's pretty much it from me.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.420
If you do have any burning questions you want
to ask Head Squeeze all you have to do is

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.810
put them in the comments below this video
or even better join up to our G plus community

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.210
page, allo the details in the description
below.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.949
Until next time, Happy Head Squeezing!
