that<00:01:48.170> difficult<00:01:48.759> maybe<00:01:49.759> just<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.119> last<00:01:50.270> step

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
that difficult maybe just the last step

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.789 
that difficult maybe just the last step
of<00:01:50.659> opening<00:01:51.020> things<00:01:51.170> up<00:01:51.320> can<00:01:51.530> be<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.649> little

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
of opening things up can be a little

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.550 
of opening things up can be a little
tricky<00:01:52.159> but<00:01:52.429> not<00:01:53.270> too<00:01:53.450> hard<00:01:53.659> to<00:01:53.719> use<00:01:54.109> a<00:01:54.140> smaller

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
tricky but not too hard to use a smaller

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.279 
tricky but not too hard to use a smaller
piece<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.799> paper<00:01:55.100> like<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.399> seven<00:01:55.789> by<00:01:55.909> seven<00:01:56.329> you

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
piece of paper like a seven by seven you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.559 
piece of paper like a seven by seven you
just<00:01:57.499> start<00:01:57.890> off<00:01:58.009> with<00:01:58.249> a<00:01:58.280> square<00:01:58.909> base<00:01:59.090> so<00:01:59.509> you

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
just start off with a square base so you

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.649 
just start off with a square base so you
want<00:01:59.749> to<00:01:59.810> just<00:01:59.929> fold<00:02:00.140> your<00:02:00.319> paper<00:02:00.439> in<00:02:00.859> half<00:02:00.890> and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
want to just fold your paper in half and

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.010 
want to just fold your paper in half and
then<00:02:02.659> fold<00:02:02.689> it<00:02:03.049> in<00:02:03.140> half<00:02:03.170> again<00:02:03.499> the<00:02:03.770> other<00:02:03.890> way

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
then fold it in half again the other way

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.700 
then fold it in half again the other way
and<00:02:06.460> then<00:02:07.460> fold<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:07.939> and<00:02:08.179> flip<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.259> over<00:02:09.380> for<00:02:09.679> a

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
and then fold it and flip it over for a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.830 
and then fold it and flip it over for a
second<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.190> then<00:02:10.399> fold<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.850> into<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.660> big

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
second and then fold it into a big

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.760 
second and then fold it into a big
triangle<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:13.400> do<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.090> both<00:02:14.330> ways<00:02:14.569> too

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.110 

open<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.830> back<00:02:21.860> up<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.460> sides<00:02:22.790> where<00:02:23.030> we

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
open it back up to the sides where we

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.330 
open it back up to the sides where we
made<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.540> vertical<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.560> horizontal<00:02:24.620> creases

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
made the vertical and horizontal creases

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.610 
made the vertical and horizontal creases
and<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:25.850> kind<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.090> pinch<00:02:26.540> in<00:02:26.930> half<00:02:27.200> here<00:02:27.590> and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and just kind of pinch in half here and

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.620 
and just kind of pinch in half here and
push<00:02:28.040> into<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.520> center<00:02:28.820> things<00:02:29.450> should

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
push into the center things should

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.200 
push into the center things should
shimmy<00:02:29.960> around<00:02:30.200> into<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> nice<00:02:30.710> little<00:02:31.210> diamond

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
shimmy around into a nice little diamond

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.120 
shimmy around into a nice little diamond
or<00:02:32.390> square<00:02:32.690> shape<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.500> then<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.920> want<00:02:34.100> to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
or square shape and then you want to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.200 
or square shape and then you want to
just<00:02:34.280> make<00:02:34.400> sure<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:34.580> you're<00:02:34.790> looking<00:02:35.000> at<00:02:35.120> it

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
just make sure that you're looking at it

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.940 
just make sure that you're looking at it
with<00:02:35.300> those<00:02:35.390> little<00:02:35.480> flaps<00:02:35.870> facing<00:02:36.500> up<00:02:36.650> we're

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
with those little flaps facing up we're

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.650 
with those little flaps facing up we're
just<00:02:36.980> going<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.250> fold<00:02:37.580> everything<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.360> half

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
just going to fold everything in half

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.320 
just going to fold everything in half
here<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.550> try<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.580> get<00:02:40.820> a<00:02:40.850> good<00:02:41.150> crease<00:02:41.510> going

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
here and try to get a good crease going

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.480 
here and try to get a good crease going
just<00:02:44.330> helps<00:02:44.630> things<00:02:44.840> along<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.170> little<00:02:45.490> and

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
just helps things along a little and

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.740 
just helps things along a little and
then<00:02:46.640> you're<00:02:46.790> going<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.000> take<00:02:47.210> each<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.570> these

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
then you're going to take each of these

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.560 
then you're going to take each of these
sides<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.860> fold<00:02:49.250> towards<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.970> center<00:02:50.270> here

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
sides and fold towards the center here

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.740 
sides and fold towards the center here
creating<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.470> nice<00:02:52.370> little<00:02:52.610> triangular<00:02:53.240> flap

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
creating a nice little triangular flap

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.770 
creating a nice little triangular flap
from<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.770> fold<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.970> creased<00:02:56.300> edge<00:02:56.570> you

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
from the fold and the creased edge you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.630 
from the fold and the creased edge you
make<00:02:56.960> here<00:02:57.350> should<00:02:57.680> be<00:02:57.830> parallel<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.520> the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
make here should be parallel to the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.460 
make here should be parallel to the
center<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.630> I'm<00:02:59.690> going<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.870> do<00:02:59.990> that<00:03:00.170> for<00:03:00.380> all

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
center so I'm going to do that for all

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.280 
center so I'm going to do that for all
four<00:03:00.500> sides<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:05.750> make<00:03:05.990> sure<00:03:06.110> of<00:03:06.230> course

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
four sides and just make sure of course

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.600 
four sides and just make sure of course
you<00:03:06.530> flip<00:03:06.710> it<00:03:06.770> over<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.040> do<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.250> same<00:03:07.310> thing

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
you flip it over and do the same thing

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.760 
you flip it over and do the same thing
on<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.820> other<00:03:07.850> side<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.410> some<00:03:09.560> pretty

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
on the other side this is some pretty

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.850 
on the other side this is some pretty
easy<00:03:10.190> steps<00:03:10.730> really<00:03:11.290> then<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.410> can<00:03:12.560> fold<00:03:12.740> it

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
easy steps really then you can fold it

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.470 
easy steps really then you can fold it
in<00:03:12.980> half<00:03:13.010> again<00:03:13.280> just<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.820> make<00:03:13.970> sure<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.300> know

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
in half again just to make sure you know

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.210 
in half again just to make sure you know
where<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.200> center's<00:03:15.590> are<00:03:15.800> for<00:03:16.010> everything

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
where the center's are for everything

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.670 
where the center's are for everything
and<00:03:16.610> as<00:03:17.120> you've<00:03:17.300> had<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.660> folded<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:18.110> half<00:03:18.350> take

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
and as you've had it folded in half take

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.440 
and as you've had it folded in half take
this<00:03:18.890> first<00:03:19.220> layer<00:03:19.490> of<00:03:19.670> what<00:03:19.820> we've<00:03:20.060> had<00:03:20.330> at

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
this first layer of what we've had at

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.720 
this first layer of what we've had at
the<00:03:20.570> top<00:03:20.780> hold<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.380> down<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.890> then<00:03:22.370> just<00:03:22.520> pull

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
the top hold it down and then just pull

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.840 
the top hold it down and then just pull
apart<00:03:23.090> from<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.630> top<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:25.430> just<00:03:25.610> want<00:03:25.790> to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
apart from the top and you just want to

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.490 
apart from the top and you just want to
kind<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.060> make<00:03:26.240> sure<00:03:26.270> you<00:03:26.540> open<00:03:26.810> these<00:03:27.140> sides

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
kind of make sure you open these sides

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.250 
kind of make sure you open these sides
up<00:03:27.770> as<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.040> do<00:03:28.220> this<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:29.020> then<00:03:30.020> when<00:03:30.200> you

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
up as you do this and then when you

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.970 
up as you do this and then when you
press<00:03:30.530> down<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:31.850> can<00:03:32.030> open<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.510> up<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:33.740> each

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
press down you can open this up to each

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.660 
press down you can open this up to each
of<00:03:34.010> these<00:03:34.310> edges<00:03:34.550> to<00:03:35.030> create<00:03:35.330> a<00:03:35.390> nice<00:03:36.670> little

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
of these edges to create a nice little

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.850 
of these edges to create a nice little
square<00:03:38.300> or<00:03:38.570> diamond<00:03:39.020> shape<00:03:39.260> there<00:03:39.530> for<00:03:39.800> the

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
square or diamond shape there for the

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.400 
square or diamond shape there for the
petals<00:03:40.160> on<00:03:40.340> either<00:03:40.490> side<00:03:40.820> so<00:03:41.720> it's<00:03:42.020> a<00:03:42.110> really

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
petals on either side so it's a really

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.590 
petals on either side so it's a really

flower so you've got this nice little
space<00:03:48.980> back<00:03:49.250> here<00:03:49.280> where<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.850> can<00:03:50.030> connect

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
space back here where you can connect

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.990 
space back here where you can connect
things<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:51.050> if<00:03:51.260> I've<00:03:51.410> got<00:03:51.440> two<00:03:51.920> here<00:03:52.400> what

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
things and if I've got two here what

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.300 
things and if I've got two here what
helps<00:03:53.330> is<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.510> take<00:03:53.930> one<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.800> we<00:03:54.890> just<00:03:55.130> opened

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
helps is to take one that we just opened

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.850 
helps is to take one that we just opened
and<00:03:55.820> fold<00:03:56.150> this<00:03:56.330> part<00:03:56.570> in<00:03:56.780> half<00:03:56.990> up<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:57.800> we

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
and fold this part in half up so that we

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.140 
and fold this part in half up so that we
can<00:03:58.010> kind<00:03:58.130> of<00:03:58.250> see<00:03:58.460> where<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.730> space<00:03:58.970> we're

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
can kind of see where the space we're

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.630 
can kind of see where the space we're
working<00:03:59.450> with<00:03:59.600> and<00:03:59.960> then<00:04:00.710> what<00:04:00.920> I<00:04:00.950> did<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.490> make

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
working with and then what I did to make

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.810 
working with and then what I did to make
though<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:02.330> wreath<00:04:02.720> is<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.320> just<00:04:03.650> slid<00:04:04.430> this<00:04:04.580> in

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
though the wreath is I just slid this in

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.660 
though the wreath is I just slid this in
as<00:04:05.120> snug<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:05.840> edge<00:04:06.080> as<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:06.350> could<00:04:06.740> so<00:04:07.490> that

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
as snug to the edge as you could so that

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.910 
as snug to the edge as you could so that
this<00:04:07.880> flap<00:04:08.300> lays<00:04:08.660> over<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:09.230> lines<00:04:09.470> up<00:04:09.710> right

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
this flap lays over and lines up right

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.070 
this flap lays over and lines up right
in<00:04:10.160> with<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.520> middle<00:04:10.700> of<00:04:10.940> things<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.510> that

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
in with the middle of things and that

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.900 
in with the middle of things and that
creates<00:04:12.500> an<00:04:12.740> angle<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.520> wind<00:04:13.790> up

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
creates an angle so that you wind up

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.020 
creates an angle so that you wind up
getting<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:15.050> know<00:04:15.170> an<00:04:15.260> eight<00:04:15.560> piece<00:04:16.220> wreath

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
getting you know an eight piece wreath

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.270 
getting you know an eight piece wreath
so<00:04:17.660> that's<00:04:18.080> all<00:04:18.230> you<00:04:18.380> do<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.710> kind<00:04:18.859> of<00:04:18.950> connect

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
so that's all you do to kind of connect

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.190 
so that's all you do to kind of connect
things<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:19.730> just<00:04:19.760> get<00:04:20.120> in<00:04:20.239> here<00:04:20.540> with<00:04:21.020> this

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
things you just get in here with this

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.530 
things you just get in here with this
angle<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:21.859> connect<00:04:22.430> right<00:04:22.640> so<00:04:22.880> that<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.120> evens

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
angle and connect right so that it evens

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.800 
angle and connect right so that it evens
up<00:04:23.720> with<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.220> Center<00:04:25.220> crease<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.880> just<00:04:25.910> put

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
up with that Center crease and just put

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.120 
up with that Center crease and just put
a<00:04:26.840> little<00:04:26.990> bit<00:04:27.080> glue<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:27.560> get<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:27.800> all<00:04:27.890> put

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
a little bit glue to get it all put

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.239 
a little bit glue to get it all put
together<00:04:28.280> until<00:04:28.790> you

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:29.249 
together until you

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:31.399 
together until you
can<00:04:29.369> get<00:04:29.489> a<00:04:29.549> full<00:04:29.939> ring<00:04:30.239> or<00:04:30.509> wreaths<00:04:30.869> from

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
can get a full ring or wreaths from

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.889 
can get a full ring or wreaths from
putting<00:04:31.799> them<00:04:32.339> together<00:04:32.549> so<00:04:33.359> I've<00:04:33.689> got<00:04:33.869> all

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:33.899

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:36.749 
mine here are the seven pieces so far

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.869 
mine here are the seven pieces so far
and<00:04:36.929> then<00:04:37.019> I'll<00:04:37.139> just<00:04:37.319> put<00:04:37.559> this<00:04:38.189> last<00:04:38.489> piece
