 Hello, very good people, how are you? 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.270
 a video in which I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:12.269
 communicate what it is when you ask them to 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:15.660
 iceta but the title xperia s we have 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.570
 here the accesses of the direct ones and 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.370
 we have good player that 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.700
 we need 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.950
 be root users and had installed the 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.380
 recovery and that is no longer a copy of 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.840
 security just in case something goes wrong or 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.910
 in case I do not like how it looks 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.000
 well first we have to leave us in 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.000
 the description files 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.870
 are these files part 1 part 2 and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.239
 xperia z when we unloaded the sprint 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.629
 of the xperia s we have to decompress 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.470
 and put these two are vais compressing 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.740
 I would pass these two parts 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.020
 we have to install the xperia 7 for 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.440
 have the z can not be installed from a 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.970
 Once the elche is so the first thing is 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.970
 restart in recovery 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.040
 and I want we have 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:39.160
 restarting in the record 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.370
 the seeds but the route is install 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.840
 siphon sd card 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:48.080
 choice cipher a sdk we install the part 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080
 one 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.100

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.150
 and going back to the menu again and we 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.560
 we are going to install siphon sd card and this 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.560
 once we are going to install part 2 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.530
 if they did not understand very well the routes of 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.870
 the earth in the description of the video 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.540
 so they can follow 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.019
 to install the two parts we restart and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.019

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.129

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.879
