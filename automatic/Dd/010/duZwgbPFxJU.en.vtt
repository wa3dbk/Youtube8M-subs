this<00:00:01.170> video<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.890> about<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:03.230> cheap<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.440> discovered

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
this video is about a cheap I discovered

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.280 
this video is about a cheap I discovered
with<00:00:05.640> photon<00:00:06.089> drops<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.750> how<00:00:06.960> they<00:00:07.170> are

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
with photon drops and how they are

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.620 
with photon drops and how they are
actually<00:00:07.470> useful<00:00:07.980> in<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.730> offline<00:00:09.150> mode<00:00:09.210> of

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
actually useful in the offline mode of

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.480 
actually useful in the offline mode of
the<00:00:10.080> GameCube<00:00:10.500> version<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:11.010> Phantasy<00:00:11.460> Star

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the GameCube version of Phantasy Star

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.620 
the GameCube version of Phantasy Star
Online<00:00:13.280> you'll<00:00:14.280> need<00:00:14.490> at<00:00:14.670> least<00:00:14.700> 10<00:00:15.150> photon

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
Online you'll need at least 10 photon

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.609 
Online you'll need at least 10 photon
drops<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.670> item<00:00:18.090> trick<00:00:18.990> only<00:00:19.380> works

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
drops and this item trick only works

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.570 
drops and this item trick only works
with<00:00:20.189> recovery<00:00:21.119> items<00:00:22.250> you<00:00:23.250> know<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.490> I'm

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
with recovery items you know what I'm

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.519 
with recovery items you know what I'm
talking<00:00:23.910> about<00:00:24.260> see<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> have<00:00:25.529> 13<00:00:26.130> now<00:00:27.529> but

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
talking about see I have 13 now but

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.259 
talking about see I have 13 now but
that's<00:00:28.710> only<00:00:28.859> because<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.429> 13<00:00:29.849> foot<00:00:30.060> time

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
that's only because I have 13 foot time

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.030 
that's only because I have 13 foot time
drop<00:00:31.130> what<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:33.500> make<00:00:34.500> sure<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.860> don't

here you go right yet you press up so

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.069 
here you go right yet you press up so
you<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.860> right<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.309> photon<00:00:44.670> drops<00:00:45.079> select

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
you get right to the photon drops select

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.700 
you get right to the photon drops select
them<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:47.070> max<00:00:47.340> number<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.030> only<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.570> 13<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.260> 13

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
them the max number I only have 13 so 13

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.639 
them the max number I only have 13 so 13
is<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.950> max<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.460> I'm<00:00:50.550> taking<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:52.469> when

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
you want I want star advisors so I'll

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.030 
you want I want star advisors so I'll
take<00:01:04.559> those<00:01:07.549> now<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:09.720> see<00:01:09.990> my<00:01:10.439> photon<00:01:10.799> job

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
take those now you see my photon job

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.289 
take those now you see my photon job
stay<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.580> bank

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
stay in the bank

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.929 
stay in the bank
and<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:14.079> have<00:01:15.390> those<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:18.220> they're<00:01:18.670> all<00:01:18.790> on

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the floor I can also pick them back up

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.660 
the floor I can also pick them back up
but<00:01:22.180> I<00:01:22.270> can't<00:01:22.479> pick<00:01:22.659> it<00:01:22.689> up<00:01:22.869> again<00:01:23.490> works<00:01:24.490> with

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
but I can't pick it up again works with

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.279 
but I can't pick it up again works with
any<00:01:24.880> recovery<00:01:25.270> item<00:01:25.780> oh<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:27.159> also<00:01:27.310> works<00:01:27.729> with

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
any recovery item oh it also works with

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.219 
any recovery item oh it also works with
trap<00:01:29.289> visions<00:01:29.830> and<00:01:30.100> teletypes<00:01:30.880> any<00:01:31.840> item<00:01:32.200> that

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
trap visions and teletypes any item that

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.969 
trap visions and teletypes any item that
comes<00:01:32.590> in<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:32.799> quantity<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:35.259> only<00:01:35.500> problem<00:01:35.830> is

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
comes in a quantity the only problem is

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.399 
comes in a quantity the only problem is
you<00:01:36.159> can't<00:01:36.399> use<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.390> make<00:01:37.720> more<00:01:37.960> photo<00:01:38.259> time

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
you can't use it to make more photo time

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.289 
you can't use it to make more photo time
jobs<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.600> yep<00:01:41.640> that's<00:01:42.640> all<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:42.939> worked

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
jobs but yep that's all it worked

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.020 
jobs but yep that's all it worked
but<00:01:43.630> all<00:01:44.049> that's<00:01:44.259> how<00:01:44.409> it<00:01:44.530> works<00:01:44.710> also<00:01:45.549> if<00:01:45.909> you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
but all that's how it works also if you

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.120 
but all that's how it works also if you
need<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.450> make<00:01:46.600> money<00:01:46.929> for<00:01:47.200> some<00:01:47.409> reason<00:01:47.799> if

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
need to make money for some reason if

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.609 
need to make money for some reason if
you<00:01:48.310> actually<00:01:48.490> need<00:01:48.909> meseta<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:50.080> can<00:01:50.259> just<00:01:50.470> do

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
you actually need meseta you can just do

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.789 
you actually need meseta you can just do
that<00:01:50.670> come<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.970> store<00:01:52.209> and<00:01:52.690> do<00:01:53.319> that<00:01:53.560> it's

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
that come to the store and do that it's

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.559 
that come to the store and do that it's
faster<00:01:54.220> if<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.459> do<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.729> on<00:01:54.850> Episode<00:01:55.330> two

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
faster if you do it on Episode two

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.809 
faster if you do it on Episode two
though<00:01:55.810> because<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.590> shop<00:01:56.830> is<00:01:57.039> right<00:01:57.280> next<00:01:57.610> to

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
though because the shop is right next to

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:07.979 
though because the shop is right next to
the<00:01:58.060> bank<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:03.659> yeah<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:05.799> it
