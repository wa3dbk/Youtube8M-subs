 he is one of the oldest table tennis clubs in Westphalia 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.970
 Table tennis association of the TTC Gronau 1932 was exactly 75 years the club was in 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.519
 a small restaurant in Gronau and has so far many heights 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.160
 and deep experienced the climax in the 75-year history Wadern became 28 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.490
 April 2007 in the sports hall on the Gasstraße was the anniversary on 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.619
 Saturday really celebrated and in the middle Call then off 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.989
 when entering the hall were still a few hard-working helpers here 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.440
 hang remaining posters and lay cables 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.570
 everything but calm and relaxed 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.660
 15:00 against the anniversary party with a family maintenance and program going on 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.850
 in the hall it was about the best voices and outside who has the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.790
 Of course, the most beautiful balloon was also played with table tennis 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.940
 after the junior players were allowed to get to the plates first 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.740
 should actually be 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.340
 Immediately proceed with the program but it did not go to plan Timo had 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.740
 Called me in between and told me I stop in 20 kilometers 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.630
 long traffic jam 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.660
 and last 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.890
 of course right seconds but they have succeeded in displacing tent 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.900
 and percent see coming here alone and not just ladies from escort what 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.920
 crucial for us 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.900
 meant the top-stars Dr current triple European champion Timo Boll and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230
 his team-mate Jörg Roßkopf 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.790
 who arrived at quarter to seven before the light 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.840
 but not only these two were the stars of the evening as well 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.260
 19-year-old Ansgar Ludger Glanemann from Westerkappeln Ansgar had Friday 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.930
 Birthday and his birthday present he was allowed with Jörg Roßkopf at the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.710
 Plate and play against Vith and get out of here 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.390
 11% Timo Boll national player to play 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.660
 the failure is inheritable 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.190
 Valencia was 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.680
 hahaha 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.100
 he was fun, "said Federer Bender, where she quickly disappeared 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.010
 finally knows as far as the show could begin the anniversary tournament 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.069
 the big 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.059
 next to the two top stars Boll and Roßkopf 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:16.409
 six other players from the region took part, among other caliber us 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:21.289
 Bischer player of the host TTC Gronau and with castles the Sato 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:22.670
 the one in the preliminary round 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.379
 had to compete against Timo Boll 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.760
 As expected, Boll had no chance against Boll, so Boll was in the semi-final 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.659
 also Jörg Roßkopf 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.629
 and the two girls Anna Hendrik Waterkamp and Heiko Fislage 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:41.839
 even before these games were played the world ranking third Boll 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:45.959
 still goose bumps oscar director frenetic 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:49.479
 when very nice should come in the morning 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:50.989
 Jeffers Olli Rehn 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.119
 such people beat 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.139
 I would be interrupted for a small extra deposit 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.699
 the rackets were exchanged for pins on a table 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:04.579
 crowded many fans pump autographs of the two to get hold of 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.870
 After half an hour we went on 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.430
 in the preliminary round there was already one or the other on places from the Bolz 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.560
 can be seen in the final but Barenboim would hit Rost's head 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.680
 Often the spectators are looking for spectacular rallies 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.479
 Mr. Behave of all individual beliefs 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:26.079
 but if we can do that, he is in favor of it 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.139
 already too much 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.619
 the actions the two also here a few highlights to enjoy 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.070
 just under an hour played the top-10 people hardest around 850 spectators 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.270
 "Insider" Wolf Bruns Roßkopf passed 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.800
 Now we were satisfied after a great event 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.479
