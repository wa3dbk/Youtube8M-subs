00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 here is garden video point is my 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.359
 name is markus planed 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.330
 next to her is sabine ill and we 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.200
 are already with the whole afternoon 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.599
 Christmas decoration is busy 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.480
 employed now comes the high school 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.020
 tinkering namely the production 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.270
 a balance what did you do 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.660
 how are you going four 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.820
 So I really can 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.240
 burned candles use the man 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.660
 otherwise throw the wreckage into a can 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.340
 or make it hot in a water bath 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.500
 that all this melts into itself 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.670
 after that, it should be fine again 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.550
 cool down so that you do not stop 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.969
 dreamy and it may quietly such a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.430
 his hand is hard again 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.890
 then take a balloon fill 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.800
 Then you with water and go 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.520
 Carefully with the balloon in the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.520
 hot wax 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:23.290
 Turn that two to three times 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.290
 thick shell gives 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.130
 then let it dry a bit 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.220
 is very hot 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.930
 no that's not very hot anymore 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.820
 really should not be too hot 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.640
 that is very dangerous because then bursts 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.540
 the balloon so it may be quiet 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.340
 pretty much again 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.789
 but first it has to be made hot 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.159
 So the whole thing is an art consistency 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.690
 war and then again cool down 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.070
 let that be very important and so 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.200
 two to three times pure 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.630
 and then we have to get the water now 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.819
 let out if that's pretty much 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.009
 let it dry and then the water 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.470
 let out and then the shell remains 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.580
 the scale left ok ok wonderful 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.580
 Let's see what it looks like afterwards 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.269
 the scale is slightly dry 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:35.360
 and now I let the water from 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:37.989
 Balloon out and then it dissolves 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.989
 pan 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.269
 here is data video point come name 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.590
 is markus planed it is about the 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.220
 Christmas tavern with sabine 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.310
 Ill the one next to me stands next to us 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.040
 the wax still sizzles that we 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.599
 have used this horizontal 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.819
 Now what have you got out of the balance 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:06.810
 what made for your decor object 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:11.190
 we have created it ourselves 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.400
 I just made a rose there 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.549
 a bit green and a bit 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.190
 dekomaterial simply summarized 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:25.739
 some feathers tied together and so on 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.750
 is there a nice a nice one 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.920
 Flower arrangements could be there now 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.950
 also do pure water 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.810
 it actually belongs to water purely yes 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.459
 Explained water purely then you could the 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.790
 fires that may emerge right away 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.790
 Clear 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.430
 a homemade wise, so to speak 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.410
 wax and then with two three handles 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.549
 23 plan to flower one 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.690
 beautiful to a beautiful 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.579
 arrangement combines something else 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.530
 arrangements could you still 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.150
 So imagine the fast 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.459
 So I could imagine one 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.549
 Christmas ball also decorated a 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.450
 even then no water needs 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.370
 no water i really accurate or one 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.440
 Apple, for example, can be just like that 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.280
 decorate and reinstall 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.060
 So you can let your imagination run wild 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.919
 to let 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.090
 you can pull that too long 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.610
 Over the table in the middle an apple 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.710
 or a rose and then quite a long time 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.639
 run out that over the 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.280
 whole table goes 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.260
 beautiful so the ideas are enough 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.139
 let your ideas flow 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.849
 just give it a try and then 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.979
 Enjoy as we said at the gardener
