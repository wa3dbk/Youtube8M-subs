anything today there was science an
elementary<00:02:32.349> school<00:02:32.410> in<00:02:32.709> school<00:02:33.220> when<00:02:33.520> he<00:02:33.550> was

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
elementary school in school when he was

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.520 
elementary school in school when he was
a<00:02:33.880> kid<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.970> he<00:02:36.970> would<00:02:37.599> struggle<00:02:37.900> in<00:02:38.200> school

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
a kid but he would struggle in school

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.350 
a kid but he would struggle in school
and<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.959> reason<00:02:41.140> for<00:02:41.349> that<00:02:41.580> would<00:02:42.580> be<00:02:42.910> the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
and the reason for that would be the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.589 
and the reason for that would be the
main<00:02:43.599> factor<00:02:43.989> for<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.319> would<00:02:44.980> be<00:02:45.160> because<00:02:45.599> in

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
main factor for that would be because in

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.500 
main factor for that would be because in
school<00:02:47.110> were<00:02:47.800> forced<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.370> take<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.880> bunch<00:02:49.390> of

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
say ABC 123 and whatever I think it's

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.650 
say ABC 123 and whatever I think it's
easier<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.370> do<00:04:26.490> stuff<00:04:26.970> like<00:04:27.060> that<00:04:27.180> because

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
easier to do stuff like that because

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.770 
easier to do stuff like that because
it's<00:04:28.200> stuff<00:04:28.860> that<00:04:28.890> you<00:04:29.490> did<00:04:30.030> stuff<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.570> it's

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
it's stuff that you did stuff that it's

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.659 
it's stuff that you did stuff that it's
just<00:04:30.990> memorization<00:04:31.320> it's<00:04:32.040> not<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:32.640> doesn't

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
just memorization it's not it doesn't

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.950 
just memorization it's not it doesn't
really<00:04:33.120> take<00:04:33.500> mathematical<00:04:34.640> explications<00:04:35.960> or

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
really take mathematical explications or

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.760 
really take mathematical explications or
examples<00:04:39.110> explanation<00:04:40.110> sorry<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.530> said

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
examples explanation sorry I said

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.890 
examples explanation sorry I said
explications<00:04:41.340> what<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:42.270> wrong<00:04:42.479> with<00:04:42.540> me<00:04:42.780> today

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
explications what is wrong with me today

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.050 
explications what is wrong with me today
I<00:04:43.050> can't<00:04:43.290> pronounce<00:04:43.440> anything<00:04:44.010> but<00:04:44.790> you<00:04:44.940> get

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
I can't pronounce anything but you get

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.630 
I can't pronounce anything but you get
the<00:04:45.120> point<00:04:45.390> and<00:04:45.660> that's<00:04:46.530> exactly<00:04:46.740> why<00:04:47.580> the

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
the point and that's exactly why the

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.909 
the point and that's exactly why the
main<00:04:48.090> factor<00:04:48.360> why<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.960> student<00:04:49.410> couldn't

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
main factor why a student couldn't

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.180 
main factor why a student couldn't
cannot<00:04:50.910> just<00:04:51.860> learn<00:04:52.860> all<00:04:53.550> those<00:04:54.890> courses<00:04:55.890> and

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
cannot just learn all those courses and

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.050 
cannot just learn all those courses and
be<00:04:56.580> good<00:04:56.850> in<00:04:57.060> all<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.979> second<00:04:58.979> point<00:04:59.460> the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
be good in all the second point the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.820 
be good in all the second point the
second<00:05:00.479> main<00:05:00.630> factor<00:05:01.110> i<00:05:01.140> would<00:05:01.410> say<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:01.710> i

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
second main factor i would say and i

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.500 
second main factor i would say and i
mentioned<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.460> quite<00:05:02.669> a<00:05:02.700> few<00:05:02.790> times<00:05:02.970> is<00:05:03.450> that

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
mentioned it quite a few times is that

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.190 
mentioned it quite a few times is that
there<00:05:04.470> is<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:05.190> many<00:05:05.370> courses<00:05:05.820> in

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
there is so many courses in

there is so many courses in
all<00:05:08.320> that<00:05:08.950> it<00:05:09.250> may<00:05:09.490> be<00:05:09.550> hard<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:09.940> grasp<00:05:10.210> all<00:05:10.510> the

high school to get straight A's because

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.400 
high school to get straight A's because
there<00:06:06.970> are<00:06:07.060> so<00:06:07.090> many<00:06:07.390> things<00:06:07.810> that<00:06:07.960> are

I<00:06:17.740> really<00:06:18.070> don't<00:06:18.430> know<00:06:18.640> I<00:06:18.730> just<00:06:18.850> said<00:06:19.300> that<00:06:19.450> at

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
I really don't know I just said that at

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.300 
I really don't know I just said that at
the<00:06:19.600> top<00:06:19.780> of<00:06:19.810> my<00:06:20.020> head<00:06:20.170> it<00:06:20.620> may<00:06:20.890> be<00:06:20.950> hard<00:06:21.250> for

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
the top of my head it may be hard for

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.820 
the top of my head it may be hard for
you<00:06:21.490> to<00:06:21.550> do<00:06:21.790> so<00:06:22.030> and<00:06:22.270> I<00:06:22.720> think<00:06:22.780> that's<00:06:23.140> what<00:06:23.530> can

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
you to do so and I think that's what can

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.760 
you to do so and I think that's what can
what<00:06:24.580> can<00:06:24.820> bother<00:06:25.780> or<00:06:26.260> interfere<00:06:26.920> with<00:06:27.220> the

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
what can bother or interfere with the

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.630 
what can bother or interfere with the
success<00:06:29.770> of<00:06:29.950> a<00:06:30.130> student<00:06:30.520> that's<00:06:31.300> when

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
success of a student that's when

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.700 
success of a student that's when
university<00:06:33.640> gets<00:06:33.970> easier<00:06:34.510> when<00:06:35.260> life<00:06:35.500> gets

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
university gets easier when life gets

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.650 
university gets easier when life gets
easier<00:06:36.100> because<00:06:36.310> that's<00:06:36.610> where<00:06:36.970> you<00:06:37.300> decide

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
easier because that's where you decide

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.840 
easier because that's where you decide
to<00:06:38.320> go<00:06:38.530> and<00:06:38.800> do<00:06:38.920> the<00:06:39.130> job<00:06:39.370> that<00:06:39.400> you<00:06:39.610> are

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
to go and do the job that you are

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.150 
to go and do the job that you are
destined<00:06:40.450> to<00:06:40.570> do<00:06:40.720> do<00:06:41.200> what<00:06:41.380> you<00:06:41.560> want<00:06:41.830> to<00:06:42.040> do

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
destined to do do what you want to do

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.030 
destined to do do what you want to do
and<00:06:42.400> that's<00:06:42.880> in<00:06:43.270> my<00:06:43.540> opinion<00:06:43.840> when<00:06:44.200> life<00:06:44.710> gets

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040 
and that's in my opinion when life gets

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.240 
and that's in my opinion when life gets
easier<00:06:45.940> so<00:06:46.750> that's<00:06:47.110> pretty<00:06:47.350> much<00:06:47.530> it<00:06:47.800> for<00:06:47.860> that

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
easier so that's pretty much it for that

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.180 
easier so that's pretty much it for that
