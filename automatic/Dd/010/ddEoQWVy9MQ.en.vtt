every time the switch is pressed it will

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.760 
every time the switch is pressed it will
cycle<00:01:40.330> through<00:01:40.540> therefore<00:01:41.200> different<00:01:41.380> states

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
cycle through therefore different states

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.470 
cycle through therefore different states
will<00:01:42.040> go<00:01:42.160> left<00:01:42.370> right<00:01:45.060> force<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.360> the

will go left right force it to the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.270 
will go left right force it to the
middle<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.900> then<00:01:47.140> they'll<00:01:47.350> both<00:01:47.470> relax<00:01:47.920> so

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
middle and then they'll both relax so

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.630 
middle and then they'll both relax so
first<00:01:49.060> one<00:01:49.180> will<00:01:49.270> do<00:01:49.420> will<00:01:49.690> be<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.900> left<00:01:53.640> then

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
first one will do will be the left then

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.920 
first one will do will be the left then
go<00:01:54.670> right

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.180
