00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.659
 conscious of working with animal 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:48.539
 therapists like hare cats and horses 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:50.670

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.920
 What can they do for them? 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.900
 Talents have a great process 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.799

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.349
 Today, we form one of the foundations 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.489

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.459
 People will also give something in the future 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.870

 to give hope 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.750
 the biggest challenge is that we 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.550
 say the claim to the honeycomb as 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.440
