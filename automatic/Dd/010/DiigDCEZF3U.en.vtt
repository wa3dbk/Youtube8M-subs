00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.149
 Today there is a new Mexican who defines us 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.600
 is one that is distinguished by being unique 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.949
 that seeks the original and not the clichÃ© 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.379
 transforming what it does with that brightness 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:50.039
 that stands out and fills us with a new 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.350
 sordid pride mundet since 1902 the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.570
 Only Mexican soda with juices 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.579

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.229

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:04.049
 every day from 7:30 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.489
 hours 19 30 hours 7 30 a night at 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.830
 length and width of the Mexican republic 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.569
 in this central sports you will see the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.060
 people that allows us to reach the 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.979
 homes there in usa and canada through 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.409
 of the south channel by the directv system 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.200
 also and remember that we have lada without 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.899
 cost of any part of the republic 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.310
 to call us will not cost 0 1 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:29.459
 800 triple 81 triple 8 and today more than 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.340
 special because it seems to me that today 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:34.350
 We do not give the place that has and with the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.569
 over the years we are going to give it 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.000
 because that is the champion 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.200
 Guadalajara is so special after 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.110
 so many years 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.390

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.850
 scorers of the most popular team of 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.150
 mexican soccer omar bravo created 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.810

 the most important in mexico those are already 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.400
 reasons to be happy to be happy 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.210

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.820
 many reasons to be 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.190
 happy enjoying the profession that 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.710
 I have many times said 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.560
 that I am privileged and nothing is 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.360
 front when I refer to that part of 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.170
 When I see you happy, it's also that you 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.270
 I see more mature be a player more more 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.660
 made more conscious than learned in 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.340
 base to the years yes and certainly I think 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.709
 that I am 34 years old already 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.670
 I've been here in this club 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.940

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.340
 everything you do in my career you that 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.069
 I really want that you reopened me 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.049
 the doors again once more and that 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.730
 I'm fighting fighting like our 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.160
 my colleagues like the board as the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.310
 technical body for getting this out 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.319
 forward on the subject of permanence and 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.269
 give back to the place it deserves in 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.720
 a team like ghana let's go a little bit 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.210
 back 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.200
 the brave omar that ate seafood that 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.720
 I was on the beach there in your land that 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.240
 he practiced boxing he did not go through the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.210
 head the theme of playing soccer 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.590
 I always had the dream of being 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.880
 professional footballer from very 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.260
 small since childhood 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.040
 we are talking about how many years when 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.040
 you start to like soccer 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.860
 between primary six years seven 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.900
 years is a missionary totally 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.390
 totally plays a lot of baseball time 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.800
 also especially in my time of the of 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.600
 the first and the first year of the 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.380
 high school 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.870
 but until a teacher told me that 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.800
 nothing is not good for me mine 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.450
 He defended that nothing is so bad but 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.370
 I saw myself better qualities in football 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.370
 I always practice it in one at a time 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.440
 a bowl of neighborhoods 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.000
 with chilaquiles teams with where I 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.360
 give the opportunity really in that 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.330
 part was very vague this trousseau five or 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.220
 six matches per day does not this make me 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.830
 he paints it is not right 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.720
 for playing soccer and fulfilling was what 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.730
 I liked it more and without asking I had that 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.910
 I dream that professional like how was the 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.200
 infant omar bravo deficiency or what not 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.660

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.930

 masters you always lost it young to your 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.240
 father not when it was just the 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.169
 inauguration of omnilife mi stadium 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.800

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.620
 they always gave me everything 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.630
 they needed 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.419
 regularly life with my grandmother not that 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.350
 she was the one who spoiled me the most and grandmother 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.350
 maternal my maternal grandmother 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.000
 in that sense in my house I always 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.250
 gave the support and what I needed to 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.760
 get ahead and then how come the 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.890

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.809
 complex 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:32.430
 a moment that was blue laser cross 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:35.010
