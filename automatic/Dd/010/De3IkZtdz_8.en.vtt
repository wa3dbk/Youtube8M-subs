zooms not going to wait the minute and a

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.180 
zooms not going to wait the minute and a
half<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.170> provide<00:00:16.500> act<00:00:16.680> just<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> tank

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
half to provide act just going to tank

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.070 
half to provide act just going to tank
up<00:00:17.369> as<00:00:17.460> much<00:00:17.640> as<00:00:17.699> possible<00:00:17.850> now<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.779> he<00:00:18.930> just

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
up as much as possible now and he just

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.689 
up as much as possible now and he just
can<00:00:19.199> survive<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.890> burst<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.310> then<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.490> think

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
can survive the burst and then I think

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.400 
can survive the burst and then I think
he's<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.600> know<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:21.840> gonna<00:00:21.960> get<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> time

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
he's you know just gonna get the time

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.080 
he's you know just gonna get the time
lapse<00:00:22.650> off<00:00:22.859> like<00:00:23.100> last<00:00:23.130> couple<00:00:23.640> fights<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
lapse off like last couple fights and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.490 
lapse off like last couple fights and
then<00:00:24.210> they'd<00:00:24.539> won<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> fight<00:00:24.930> have<00:00:25.230> they<00:00:25.439> seen

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
then they'd won the fight have they seen

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.099 
then they'd won the fight have they seen
