fake<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:09.110> authentic<00:00:10.110> monster<00:00:10.590> beats<00:00:11.269> so<00:00:12.269> I

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
fake and authentic monster beats so I

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.720 
fake and authentic monster beats so I
think<00:00:12.870> there's<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.440> few<00:00:13.799> ways<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.519> can

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
think there's a few ways that we can

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.900 
think there's a few ways that we can
tell<00:00:15.000> whether<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.109> fake<00:00:16.320> or<00:00:16.470> not<00:00:16.730> first<00:00:17.730> of

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
tell whether it's fake or not first of

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.990 
tell whether it's fake or not first of
all<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.300> going<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> box<00:00:19.760> the<00:00:20.760> faith

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
all it's going to be the box the faith

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.210 
all it's going to be the box the faith
one<00:00:21.270> don't<00:00:21.480> need<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> scan<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.529> original<00:00:23.010> box

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
one don't need to scan the original box

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.700 
one don't need to scan the original box
and<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.580> printed<00:00:23.970> off<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.109> quality<00:00:25.410> and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and the printed off so the quality and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.910 
and the printed off so the quality and
color<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:26.910> different<00:00:27.680> so<00:00:28.680> now<00:00:28.859> we
