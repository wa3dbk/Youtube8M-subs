00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
for this new order the breakthrough is

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.710 
for this new order the breakthrough is
the<00:05:18.470> prescription<00:05:19.220> so<00:05:20.180> that<00:05:20.360> you<00:05:20.450> can't

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
the prescription so that you can't

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.380 
the prescription so that you can't
function<00:05:21.080> without<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.980> breakthrough<00:05:22.550> you

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
function without the breakthrough you

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.050 
function without the breakthrough you
can't<00:05:23.690> live<00:05:24.020> without<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:24.710> breakthrough<00:05:25.250> you

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
can't live without the breakthrough you

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.300 
can't live without the breakthrough you
can't<00:05:26.330> depend<00:05:26.540> on<00:05:26.990> anything<00:05:27.290> else<00:05:27.620> but<00:05:27.860> the

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
can't depend on anything else but the

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.370 
can't depend on anything else but the
breakthrough<00:05:28.850> to<00:05:29.540> get<00:05:29.750> you<00:05:29.900> to<00:05:30.080> where<00:05:30.200> you've

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
breakthrough to get you to where you've

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.710 
breakthrough to get you to where you've
got<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.680> go<00:05:30.830> in<00:05:30.980> God<00:05:31.190> I<00:05:31.610> said<00:05:32.060> oh<00:05:32.090> god<00:05:32.390> help<00:05:32.660> me

got to go in God I said oh god help me
now<00:05:33.130> so<00:05:34.130> I<00:05:34.160> wrote<00:05:34.700> it<00:05:34.730> down<00:05:35.470> breakthrough<00:05:36.470> and

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
now so I wrote it down breakthrough and

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.580 
now so I wrote it down breakthrough and
that's<00:05:36.980> a<00:05:37.130> breakthrough<00:05:37.720> and<00:05:38.720> then<00:05:39.140> he<00:05:39.290> said

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
that's a breakthrough and then he said

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.060 
that's a breakthrough and then he said
new<00:05:40.310> order<00:05:41.290> now<00:05:42.290> what<00:05:42.410> he<00:05:42.500> said<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:42.800> me<00:05:42.830> new

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
new order now what he said to me new

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.700 
new order now what he said to me new
order<00:05:43.520> it<00:05:43.730> really<00:05:44.090> shook<00:05:44.419> me<00:05:44.450> because<00:05:44.900> again<00:05:45.440> I

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
order it really shook me because again I

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.520 
order it really shook me because again I
went<00:05:46.220> back<00:05:46.370> to<00:05:46.400> God<00:05:46.760> because<00:05:47.440> immediately<00:05:48.440> he

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
went back to God because immediately he

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.220 
went back to God because immediately he
said<00:05:48.740> to<00:05:48.830> me<00:05:48.950> but<00:05:49.520> tell<00:05:49.910> them<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.510> new<00:05:50.750> order

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
said to me but tell them the new order

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.510 
said to me but tell them the new order
is<00:05:51.410> really<00:05:52.310> not<00:05:52.520> new<00:05:52.850> at<00:05:53.240> all
