00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
well it's just got basically the perfect

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.330 
well it's just got basically the perfect
details<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.750> everything<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.469> mean<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
details for everything I mean all the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.260 
details for everything I mean all the
little<00:00:59.370> lines<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.590> grooves<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.270> everything

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
little lines and grooves and everything

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.479 
little lines and grooves and everything
you<00:01:03.420> know<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.589> supposed<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you know is supposed to be there is

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.820 
you know is supposed to be there is
actually<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.630> texturing<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
actually there the texturing on the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.490 
actually there the texturing on the
under<00:01:08.340> suit<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:09.479> pretty<00:01:09.840> much<00:01:09.960> everything's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
under suit just pretty much everything's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
under suit just pretty much everything's
the<00:01:10.770> way<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.890> should<00:01:11.280> be

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the way it should be

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.030 
the way it should be
I<00:01:11.750> suppose<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.900> some<00:01:12.930> places<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> elbow

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
I suppose in some places like the elbow

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.499 
I suppose in some places like the elbow
for<00:01:14.220> example<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.939> could<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> little<00:01:15.360> bit

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
for example you could have a little bit

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.830 
for example you could have a little bit
more<00:01:15.750> detail<00:01:16.110> perhaps<00:01:16.340> but<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
more detail perhaps but really it's a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.539 
more detail perhaps but really it's a
pretty<00:01:19.110> nice<00:01:19.380> piece<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.830> think<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> visors

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
pretty nice piece I think the visors

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.990 
pretty nice piece I think the visors
nice<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.530> iridescent<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:23.400> looks<00:01:23.670> great

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
nice and iridescent just looks great

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.080 
nice and iridescent just looks great
overall<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.590> seize<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.970> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
overall you can seize on this kind of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.740 
overall you can seize on this kind of
dirt<00:01:27.299> base<00:01:28.040> really<00:01:29.040> nice<00:01:29.189> texturing<00:01:29.820> sculpted

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
dirt base really nice texturing sculpted

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.569 
dirt base really nice texturing sculpted
well<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:31.560> over<00:01:31.799> here<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.189> side<00:01:32.250> we

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
well and then over here on this side we

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.100 
well and then over here on this side we
have<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> broken<00:01:33.689> piece<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110

building<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.650> some<00:01:34.860> brute<00:01:35.100> armor<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.450> it's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
building and some brute armor so it's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.460

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
see he's got the sword in this hand

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.609 
see he's got the sword in this hand
right<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.930> his<00:02:01.020> right<00:02:01.200> hand<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.530> then

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
right here in his right hand and then

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.880 
right here in his right hand and then
the<00:02:01.740> open<00:02:02.040> hand<00:02:02.219> back<00:02:02.399> here<00:02:02.729> those<00:02:03.270> are

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
the open hand back here those are

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.010 
the open hand back here those are
removable<00:02:05.060> they<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.240> pop<00:02:06.390> right<00:02:06.420> out<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
removable they just pop right out and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.309 
removable they just pop right out and
then<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.890> give<00:02:08.129> him<00:02:08.340> his<00:02:09.119> dual<00:02:09.420> Magnum

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
then you can give him his dual Magnum

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.619 
then you can give him his dual Magnum
pistols<00:02:10.800> which<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.330> way<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.450> normally

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
pistols which is the way I normally

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.700 
pistols which is the way I normally
leave<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.319> because

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
leave it because

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.860 
leave it because
I<00:02:13.800> think<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.850> looks<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.120> lot<00:02:15.270> cooler<00:02:15.510> with<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
I think it looks a lot cooler with the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.920 
I think it looks a lot cooler with the
two<00:02:16.020> pistols<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.640> course<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:18.030> can<00:02:18.240> mix

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
two pistols and of course you can mix

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.690 
two pistols and of course you can mix
and<00:02:19.110> match<00:02:19.200> if<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.590> don't<00:02:19.860> want<00:02:20.160> him<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:20.580> to

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
and match if you don't want him just to

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.760 
and match if you don't want him just to
have<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> two<00:02:21.150> pistols<00:02:21.600> as<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.440> can<00:02:22.590> see

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
have the two pistols as you can see

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.310 
have the two pistols as you can see
right<00:02:22.980> there<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.520> can<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.510> course<00:02:24.540> pop<00:02:25.110> out

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
right there you can of course pop out

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.190 
right there you can of course pop out
this<00:02:25.650> one<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.180> give<00:02:27.180> him<00:02:27.330> just<00:02:27.510> one<00:02:27.600> pistol<00:02:28.080> in

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
this one and give him just one pistol in

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
this one and give him just one pistol in
one<00:02:28.380> open<00:02:28.950> hand<00:02:30.440> which<00:02:31.440> looks<00:02:31.710> pretty<00:02:31.800> good<00:02:32.100> I

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
one open hand which looks pretty good I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.540 
one open hand which looks pretty good I
think

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
think

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.780 
think
or<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:33.390> course<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.130> common<00:02:35.460> sense

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
or of course this is just common sense

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.060 
or of course this is just common sense
here<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.570> just<00:02:36.870> leave<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.560> and

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
here you can just leave that one in and

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.650 
here you can just leave that one in and
give<00:02:38.310> him<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.610> sword<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.120> hand<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
give him the sword in this hand and a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.510 
give him the sword in this hand and a
pistol<00:02:40.020> even<00:02:40.740> though<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.980> never<00:02:41.100> find<00:02:41.430> him

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
pistol even though you never find him

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.340 
pistol even though you never find him
like<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.820> in<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.030> game<00:02:42.210> it's<00:02:43.110> not

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
like that in the game it's not

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.640 
like that in the game it's not
necessarily<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.340> bad<00:02:45.300> idea<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:48.480> that's<00:02:49.320> kind<00:02:49.590> of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
necessarily a bad idea so that's kind of

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.250 
necessarily a bad idea so that's kind of
a<00:02:49.740> nice<00:02:49.890> look<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:51.060> personally<00:02:51.510> I'm<00:02:51.990> not<00:02:52.050> a

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
a nice look to but personally I'm not a

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.010 
a nice look to but personally I'm not a
huge<00:02:52.590> fan<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.070> sword<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.870> leave

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
huge fan of the sword so I just leave

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.480
