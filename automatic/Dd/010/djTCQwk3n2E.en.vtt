personal orange with first time I met

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.980 
personal orange with first time I met
him<00:00:23.519> he<00:00:23.580> told<00:00:23.939> me<00:00:24.060> he<00:00:24.210> was<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> last<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:24.779> he's

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
him he told me he was the last one he's

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.160 
him he told me he was the last one he's
gone<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.320> direct<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.390> real<00:00:27.869> shock

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170
