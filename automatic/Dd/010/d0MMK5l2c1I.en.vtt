and will often use the read wheel on the
side<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.910> do<00:01:22.119> my<00:01:22.270> manual<00:01:22.690> stitches<00:01:23.290> around<00:01:23.470> the

pull<00:01:32.670> them<00:01:32.850> through<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> back<00:01:33.620> you<00:01:34.620> can<00:01:34.800> use<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
pull them through the back you can use a

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.640 
pull them through the back you can use a
scissor<00:01:35.370> tip<00:01:35.610> or<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.880> sharp<00:01:36.270> craft<00:01:36.570> file<00:01:36.930> to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
pull that loose edge through so then now

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.740 
pull that loose edge through so then now
there<00:01:40.680> are<00:01:40.830> no<00:01:41.210> strings<00:01:42.210> hanging<00:01:42.480> on<00:01:42.660> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.460 
of stitches is perfectly neat and again
I'm<00:03:28.370> starting<00:03:28.700> just<00:03:28.909> before<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:29.659> going

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
I'm starting just before and going

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.970 
I'm starting just before and going
straight<00:03:31.250> over<00:03:31.840> these<00:03:32.840> pennants<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.439> a

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
straight over these pennants and a

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.710 
straight over these pennants and a
little<00:03:34.189> into<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.579> next<00:03:34.909> panel<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.419> that's

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
little into the next panel and that's

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.240 
little into the next panel and that's
why<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:35.900> call<00:03:36.079> it<00:03:36.169> over<00:03:36.439> stitching<00:03:36.829> is<00:03:36.950> because

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
why I call it over stitching is because

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.759 
why I call it over stitching is because
it's<00:03:37.400> stitching<00:03:37.790> over<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.989> original<00:03:39.590> line

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
it's stitching over the original line

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:47.080 
it's stitching over the original line
and<00:03:40.239> into<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.359> next<00:03:41.599> panel<00:03:45.609> sometimes<00:03:46.609> I<00:03:46.819> want

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
and into the next panel sometimes I want

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.520 
and into the next panel sometimes I want
to<00:03:47.150> add<00:03:47.269> even<00:03:47.510> more<00:03:47.750> stitching<00:03:48.319> to<00:03:48.440> my

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
to add even more stitching to my

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.649 
to add even more stitching to my
projects<00:03:49.040> but<00:03:49.609> I<00:03:49.639> know<00:03:49.729> that<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.030> have<00:03:50.269> too<00:03:50.510> many
