00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.560
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.920
 further unboxing of mobile review de 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 before you the two current tab of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.590
 samsung and once the samsung 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.009
 galaxy tab 2 10.1 it's something 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.040
 longer available in the market and 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.540
 the samsung galaxy note 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.910
 10.1 which thankfully from 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.230
 ghettos de was made available 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.600
 Both versions come with 16 gigabytes 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.450
 Festspeicher therefore can be with micro 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.000
 sd memory cards expand 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.899
 over a 10.1 inch display with a 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.140
 use resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.680
 but different processors and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.729
 more then now when boxing so come 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.630
 we go to galaxy tab 2 10.1 the packaging 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.040
 also kept white here silver 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.570
 back on the front of the device 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.040
 even pictured on the back the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.240
 technical details maybe should 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 I hold it right then you can do it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.610
 also read about it but just now open 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.560
 the packaging and what happens 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.619
 the fore 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.720
 of course the samsung device here 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.939
 Incidentally, the 16 gb variant with 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.210
 built-in umts module that's me 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.180
 can surf from anywhere relatively 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.240
 unspectacular of design as I said 10.1 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.790
 i had 1280 x 800 pixel display 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.909
 already mentioned here the dimensions 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.920
 the appliance would necessarily know wants 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:53.520
 257 millimeters wide 175 mm high 9 7 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.770
 millimeters thin and weighs about 580 grams 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.399
 backside as I said kept silver here 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.740
 the camera 3 2 megapixel makes videos 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.290
 with 720p it so from the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.409
 efficiency lower than that of 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.429
 galaxy note 10.1 is also clear that 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.619
 here is, so to speak 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.090
 euro already much older is 16 gb 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.019
 internal memory via microsd 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.299
 expandable 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.269
 up here we have the bay for the 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.000
 Sim-card here for the micro SD loud 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.689
 soft key on and off switch 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 headphone jack right not left 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:29.459
 nothing and down the samsung own 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.900
 dock connection I start the device times 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.900
 Press the on / off switch 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.859
 then you also see the samsung directly 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:44.280
 galaxy tab 2 10.1 logo of the battery supplies 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.980
 some 7,000 milliamps I am 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.389
 yes curious how long persists 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.280
 this is a t-mobile device 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.790
 that's why the turn-on animation 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.810
 She is in the unlocked screen 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.250
 unadorned unlike unlock 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.780
 at the galaxy note here the homescreens 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.280
 kolba from left to right with the 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.459
 home button, I'll come back here 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.549
 top right the menu key a whole 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.530
 set icons on two sides spread out 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.180
 looks up here yet there is the 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.709
 possibilities in the place there to the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.799
 But I want to change that 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.120
 Not at all I want to go straight to the 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.879
 attitude and show you the times 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.060
 software version on it is infos 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.290
 to device android 4.0 4 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.229
 here is an older kernel version 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.459
 on it as the galaxy note 10.1 is too 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.590
 clear as I said the device is indeed synonymous 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.000
 already much older I left times to 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.590
 side and easier what else in cartons 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.519
 I do not expect any now 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.099
 surprise 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.129
 and so it is we have one here 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.930
 Charger we have to collide with 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.209
 the euro stronger for the outlet 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.069
 the whole thing as possible without it click 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:56.790
 Clack makes it so now it's done then 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:58.470
 the charging data cable and that's it 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.379
 it should have been to the unboxing of 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.449
 samsung galaxy tab 10.1 pictures of it 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.280
