00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.449
 standard annotation 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.449
 see how it starts 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:31.929
 [Music] 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:52.750
 [Music] 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.399
 perfect let's start with the base 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.920
 this base is for the whole song 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.920
 we will occupy less 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:13.800
 again less 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.240
 after the minor re 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.860
 do not 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.470
 and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.040
 the sustained that they can do so 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.040
 as power 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.130
 or so fulfilling 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.090
 and then again the least we are going to 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.090
 start with the strum 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.380
 [Music] 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.380
 [Applause] 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.350
 then we add nothing to the classic 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.480
 chucu chucu trump from a train to make 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.090
 the chord change the boy I know that 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.310

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.890
 [Music] 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.700
 [Applause] 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.700
 cÃºcuta 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.910
 u2 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.680
 [Music] 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:06.260
 [Applause] 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:09.500
 [Music] 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:14.160
 and now I'm going to put the lyrics for you 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.370
 that identify 321 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.260
 [Applause] 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.090
 [Music] 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.350
 [Applause] 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.700
 [Music] 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.280
 the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.280
 [Music] 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.300
 [Applause] 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.429
 [Music] 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.429
 [Applause] 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.289
 [Music] 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.920
 and we repeat civility 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.440
 [Music] 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.390
 and 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.330
 [Music] 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.520
 [Applause] 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.260
 and so everything is repeated all the 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.990
 circle is the whole song the most 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.470
 interesting here is the intro let's 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:08.319
 start by placing number one finger behind 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.819
 number ten rope number two 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.890
 i 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.709
 since it will be our starting point 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.079
 for the first sentence let's start 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.030
 sliding here it does not matter if they slide 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:23.269
 from any part of the guitar if 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.400
 they are short as long as they want 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:30.400
 ok that appears with a diagonal 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.400
 i 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.410
 ok slower 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.030
 we use the technique of the vase 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.130
 shrimp disappears with a h 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.420
 [Music] 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.810
 that we have to hammer the rope 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.860
 that is to say Cameron as they see nothing else is 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.860
 left hand work 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.830
 [Music] 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.830
 because the 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.709
 since you are going to use a technique later 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.360
 cameron and pool of hair is like 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.940
 reverse of the cameron 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.260
 let's pull with your finger here in this 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.260
 case with finger number 3 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:24.780
 ok ok slower 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.100
 let's join these two phrases 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.100
 I want 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.100
 d 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.870
 ah 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.229
 ok we move on to the next sentence that as 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.990
 they realize we're still at the same point 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.840
 starting with reference to the 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.889
 fret 10 although there are we repeat that phrase 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.889
 slower 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.440
 and 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:04.580
 next phrase we use finger number 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.919
 one I say three pardon and we slip up 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.080
 the 12th fret of the first string what 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.080
 it also does not matter from where they slide 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.160
 then we occupy our number 2 finger 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.400
 to make the rope slip 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.400
 two 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:26.139
 let's repeat the phrase 3a again 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.070
 and 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.700
 okay 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.290
 we move on to the next sentence 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.569
 since we are going to make a slide 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:40.469
 with finger number 2 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:41.580
 then with finger number one and then 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:48.289
 fingers number three 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:52.149
 [Music] 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.149
 let's make another of this slow part 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.460
 glide 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.650
 [Music] 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:06.969
 all right 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:09.219
 [Music] 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.229
 and then we're going to use the 20 them 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:12.339
 appears with one of them in that is pull 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.149
 upwards 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:18.909
 here the rope number 1 fret 13 up 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:22.259
 get to a tone up ok 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:22.259
 4 times we repeat that 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:36.020
 [Music] 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:38.590
 and the last phrase comes 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:44.020
 i 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:46.570
 let's do everything all slow 3 2 1 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.570
 [Music] 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.570
 Y 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.560
 ah 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:58.070
 [Music] 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.090
 and we slide 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.340
 we return to the initial position 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.340
 [Music] 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.710
 look 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:13.850
 [Music] 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.850
 although the vent 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:28.060
 franz and finals that we have armed already 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.030
 all our song if they have a friend 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.770
 so make this the base and you go 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.090

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.970
