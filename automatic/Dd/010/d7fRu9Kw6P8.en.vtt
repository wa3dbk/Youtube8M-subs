apply<00:00:35.340> more<00:00:35.520> glue<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.149> repeat<00:00:36.420> this

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
apply more glue and just repeat this

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:49.760 
apply more glue and just repeat this
step

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.170 

now<00:00:50.770> I'm<00:00:50.890> going<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.160> use<00:00:51.190> liquid<00:00:51.579> latex<00:00:51.880> and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
now I'm going to use liquid latex and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.200 
now I'm going to use liquid latex and
apply<00:00:52.390> this<00:00:52.450> over<00:00:52.870> top<00:00:53.050> of<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.320> black<00:00:53.530> fabric

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
apply this over top of the black fabric

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.729 
apply this over top of the black fabric
this<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:55.270> going<00:00:55.540> to<00:00:55.600> create<00:00:55.870> big<00:00:56.140> skin<00:00:56.440> and

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
this is going to create big skin and

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.619 
this is going to create big skin and
just<00:00:57.100> make<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.399> very<00:00:57.579> easy<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:58.059> cover<00:00:58.210> over<00:00:58.480> the

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
just make it very easy to cover over the

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.119 
just make it very easy to cover over the
black<00:00:59.050> fabric<00:00:59.320> instead<00:00:59.739> of<00:00:59.860> just<00:00:59.980> using

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
black fabric instead of just using

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.540 
black fabric instead of just using
foundation<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.680> part<00:01:02.949> I<00:01:03.040> found<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.340> be<00:01:03.460> the

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
foundation this part I found to be the

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.270 
foundation this part I found to be the
most<00:01:03.699> tedious<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.269> time-consuming<00:01:05.280> each

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
most tedious and time-consuming each

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.310 
most tedious and time-consuming each
layer<00:01:06.610> you're<00:01:06.759> gonna<00:01:06.850> have<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.180> let<00:01:07.330> dry<00:01:07.570> so<00:01:07.960> I

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
layer you're gonna have to let dry so I

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.530 
layer you're gonna have to let dry so I
found<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.830> use<00:01:08.860> about<00:01:09.550> four<00:01:09.880> layers<00:01:10.180> was

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
found to use about four layers was

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.790 
found to use about four layers was
enough<00:01:10.780> for<00:01:10.960> me<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.290> cover<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.650> black

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
enough for me to cover the black

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.730 
enough for me to cover the black
completely<00:01:12.509> so<00:01:13.509> after<00:01:13.810> each<00:01:14.020> layer<00:01:14.229> remember

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
completely so after each layer remember

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.290 
completely so after each layer remember
to<00:01:14.860> let<00:01:15.009> it<00:01:15.100> dry<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.640> then<00:01:15.729> move<00:01:16.030> on<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.210> the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
to let it dry and then move on to the

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.790 
to let it dry and then move on to the
next<00:01:16.450> layer<00:01:16.690> until<00:01:17.110> you<00:01:17.259> found<00:01:17.410> you<00:01:17.590> have

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
next layer until you found you have

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:34.890 
next layer until you found you have
covered<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.190> enough
