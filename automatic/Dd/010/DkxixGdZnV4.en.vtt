00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.330
 You want the bottom also has the year

 on the same link you have the optimal download 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.600
 It fits in the discretion to you who have a pc 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.420
 a little less strong with the problem 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.310
 less powerful for you to run this 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.110
 Mold more good locking a little bit 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.579
 because I'm recording it not with the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.739
 program that I use to record the 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.380
 minecraft plus a doubt that much 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.480
 people have when minecraft is ugly 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.459
 with the reins for example what is 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.680
 this ugliness you will me in options 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.780
 fill up if you will see that you have a 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.420
 here is the control panel here 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.090
 O have to control if he and 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.769
 Rendering is something that causes 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.260
 quite light and depending on the boss 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.900
 you use recommend you leave 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.000
 A thousand or more because he 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.799
 also takes care of the resolution already 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.049
 foot that looks how it is that stays in the minimum 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.959
 It's possible to have a really ugly thing, right? 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.239
 I use it at most because my pc it 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.459
 Take it easy, so it looks pretty. 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.829
 here is this one 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.720
 the one that takes care of the resolution of the shadow 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.079
 Look, you're going to look down at what 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.420
 you will see that the nude shadow 0 25 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.190
 It gets all the morning but I've increases 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.019
 that the head of the body 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.510
 it is already gaining a more 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.849
 beautiful is 14 thousand is the maximum that gives 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.660
 put it looks pretty but you 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.910
 you can adjust according to what you saw 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.320
 prefer according to what your pc 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.580
