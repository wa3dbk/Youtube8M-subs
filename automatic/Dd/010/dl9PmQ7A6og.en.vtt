00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
I would like to show you something quite

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.920 
I would like to show you something quite
unique<00:00:05.920> namely<00:00:06.920> the<00:00:07.250> worm<00:00:07.490> detector<00:00:08.000> it<00:00:08.780> is

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930 
unique namely the worm detector it is

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.030 
unique namely the worm detector it is
called<00:00:09.200> warming<00:00:09.980> this<00:00:10.130> one<00:00:11.530> it<00:00:12.530> is<00:00:12.710> a<00:00:12.740> tool

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
called warming this one it is a tool

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.290 
called warming this one it is a tool
that<00:00:13.280> searches<00:00:13.820> for<00:00:14.150> worms<00:00:14.420> and<00:00:14.720> finds<00:00:15.530> them

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:16.300 
that searches for worms and finds them

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.279 
that searches for worms and finds them
believe<00:00:17.300> it<00:00:17.449> or<00:00:17.539> not<00:00:17.660> but<00:00:18.470> it's<00:00:18.619> for<00:00:18.800> real<00:00:20.289> it

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
believe it or not but it's for real it

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.980 
believe it or not but it's for real it
consists<00:00:21.950> out<00:00:22.130> of<00:00:22.550> her<00:00:22.760> earth<00:00:22.970> piece<00:00:23.270> that

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
consists out of her earth piece that

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.320 
consists out of her earth piece that
functions<00:00:24.500> as<00:00:24.560> an<00:00:24.710> antenna<00:00:24.980> for<00:00:25.310> worms<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:25.789> a

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
functions as an antenna for worms and a

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.270 
functions as an antenna for worms and a
little<00:00:26.570> box<00:00:26.780> that<00:00:27.050> has<00:00:27.380> a<00:00:27.410> sling<00:00:27.740> that<00:00:27.949> when

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
little box that has a sling that when

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.490 
little box that has a sling that when
turned<00:00:28.490> around<00:00:28.720> generates<00:00:29.720> loud<00:00:30.080> clicking

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
turned around generates loud clicking

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.709 
turned around generates loud clicking
noises<00:00:30.830> that<00:00:31.520> are<00:00:31.550> sent<00:00:31.910> through<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.419> antenna

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
noises that are sent through the antenna

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:33.959 
noises that are sent through the antenna
in<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.260> earth

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
in the earth

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.850 
in the earth
this<00:00:34.969> causes<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.480> worms<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:36.320> come<00:00:36.560> to<00:00:36.770> the

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
this causes the worms to come to the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.910 
this causes the worms to come to the
surface<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.970> it<00:00:38.120> really<00:00:38.329> works<00:00:38.630> I<00:00:38.899> have<00:00:39.590> tried

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
surface and it really works I have tried

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.740 
surface and it really works I have tried
it<00:00:40.070> in<00:00:40.280> several<00:00:40.700> different<00:00:40.880> spots<00:00:41.450> and

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
it in several different spots and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.440 
it in several different spots and
without<00:00:42.260> any<00:00:42.530> effort<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.489> worms<00:00:43.760> will<00:00:44.239> come

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
without any effort the worms will come

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.319 
without any effort the worms will come
to<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.720> surface<00:00:44.930> I<00:00:45.760> would<00:00:46.760> like<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.059> show<00:00:47.270> you

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
to the surface I would like to show you

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.889 
to the surface I would like to show you
that<00:00:47.840> there<00:00:47.960> are<00:00:47.989> worms<00:00:48.290> at<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:48.860> location<00:00:49.399> so

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
that there are worms at this location so

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.069 
that there are worms at this location so
you<00:00:50.899> put<00:00:51.200> it<00:00:51.320> too<00:00:51.469> deep<00:00:52.190> in<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.489> earth<00:00:52.930> this<00:00:53.930> is

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
you put it too deep in the earth this is

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.560 
you put it too deep in the earth this is
a<00:00:54.110> hard<00:00:54.350> spot<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:54.890> I'll<00:00:54.980> try<00:00:55.190> another<00:00:55.360> so<00:00:56.360> now

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
a hard spot so I'll try another so now

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.569 
a hard spot so I'll try another so now
it's<00:00:56.780> about<00:00:56.899> twenty<00:00:57.800> centimeters<00:00:58.280> deep<00:00:58.430> in

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
it's about twenty centimeters deep in

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.600 
it's about twenty centimeters deep in
the<00:00:58.670> ground<00:00:58.820> I<00:00:59.739> would<00:01:00.739> like<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.190> ask<00:01:01.370> the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
the ground I would like to ask the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:11.270 
the ground I would like to ask the
camera<00:01:01.969> to<00:01:02.120> search<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.539> ground<00:01:02.780> for<00:01:03.230> worms

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.260 

I<00:01:12.049> will<00:01:13.049> turn<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> handle<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.860> few<00:01:14.070> times<00:01:14.369> two

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
I will turn the handle a few times two

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.749 
I will turn the handle a few times two
or<00:01:15.299> three<00:01:15.600> times<00:01:15.840> around<00:01:19.250> then<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> wait<00:01:20.549> for

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
or three times around then I wait for
about<00:01:20.970> thirty<00:01:21.270> seconds<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.320> I'll<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.619> it

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
about thirty seconds and I'll do it

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:36.070 
about thirty seconds and I'll do it
again

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.410 

hey<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.620> first<00:01:37.890> worm<00:01:38.300> can<00:01:39.300> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
hey you can see the first worm can you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:56.090 
hey you can see the first worm can you
see<00:01:40.130> there<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.220> comes<00:01:41.400> up<00:01:54.560> I'll<00:01:55.560> put<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.920> my

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
see there it comes up I'll put it in my

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.650 
see there it comes up I'll put it in my
box

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
box

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:07.100 
box
and<00:01:57.660> then<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.230> try<00:01:58.440> again

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.620 

and<00:02:08.110> there's<00:02:08.259> another<00:02:08.500> one<00:02:08.649> coming<00:02:08.979> up<00:02:09.630> about

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
and there's another one coming up about

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:24.670 
and there's another one coming up about
25<00:02:11.140> centimeters<00:02:11.650> from<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.860> antenna

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.449 

so<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.280> do<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.549> two<00:02:25.970> three<00:02:26.390> or<00:02:26.750> four<00:02:26.810> times

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
so you do this two three or four times

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.500 
so you do this two three or four times
and<00:02:28.459> then<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.670> have<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.819> little<00:02:28.970> break

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
and then you have a little break

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.130 
and then you have a little break
there's<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.500> worm<00:02:30.680> can<00:02:31.370> be<00:02:31.489> seen<00:02:31.700> clearly

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
there's the worm can be seen clearly

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.059 
there's the worm can be seen clearly
there<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:35.110> it's<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.260> little<00:02:36.530> small

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
there it is it's a little small

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:53.240 
there it is it's a little small
but<00:02:37.579> still<00:02:42.040> I'll<00:02:43.040> put<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.549> in<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.760> box<00:02:43.970> as<00:02:44.180> well

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.080 

there's<00:02:53.820> another<00:02:54.120> one<00:02:54.360> about<00:02:55.200> 30cm

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
there's another one about 30cm

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.860 
there's another one about 30cm
from<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.330> antenna

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:27.059 

you

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.490 

there's<00:03:28.069> another<00:03:28.280> one<00:03:28.459> coming<00:03:28.760> up<00:03:29.500> and

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
there's another one coming up and

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.410 
there's another one coming up and
another<00:03:31.099> one<00:03:31.720> near<00:03:32.720> my<00:03:32.870> foot<00:03:33.819> too<00:03:34.819> at<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.180> same

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
another one near my foot too at the same

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.250 
another one near my foot too at the same
time<00:03:35.690> that's<00:03:36.200> fantastic

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.080 

well<00:03:42.260> cut<00:03:42.440> off<00:03:42.470> quickly<00:03:43.010> as<00:03:43.099> well<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.730> we<00:03:43.879> put

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
well cut off quickly as well and we put

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.759 
well cut off quickly as well and we put
them<00:03:44.180> with<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.360> rest<00:03:44.569> of<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.900> test<00:03:45.080> worms<00:03:47.769> as

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
them with the rest of the test worms as

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.589 
them with the rest of the test worms as
you<00:03:49.010> can<00:03:49.190> see<00:03:49.400> they<00:03:49.730> try<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.030> get<00:03:50.209> away<00:03:50.390> as

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
you can see they try to get away as

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.930 
you can see they try to get away as
quick<00:03:50.870> as<00:03:50.989> possible<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.860> disappear<00:03:52.370> again<00:03:52.610> in

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
quick as possible to disappear again in

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.339 
quick as possible to disappear again in
the<00:03:53.030> fresh<00:03:53.239> earth<00:03:55.209> with<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.299> worm<00:03:56.480> -<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:56.959> have
