00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
to be the exact same so not every TV

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.410 
to be the exact same so not every TV
will<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.560> these<00:01:34.740> four<00:01:35.130> main<00:01:35.369> parts<00:01:35.640> it

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.830 
you would be testing different
components<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.369> board<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.820> making<00:02:06.659> sure

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
components on the board and making sure

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.229 
components on the board and making sure
that<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.200> work<00:02:07.459> the<00:02:08.459> first<00:02:08.729> board<00:02:09.030> we're

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
that they work the first board we're

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.479 
that they work the first board we're
going<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.569> look<00:02:09.720> at<00:02:09.959> closer<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.280> power

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
going to look at closer is the power

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.690 
going to look at closer is the power
supply<00:02:12.350> now<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.410> power<00:02:13.650> supply<00:02:14.040> again<00:02:14.370> takes

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
supply now the power supply again takes

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.699 
supply now the power supply again takes
in<00:02:14.910> power<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.599> distributes<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.650> throughout

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
in power and distributes it throughout

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.370 
in power and distributes it throughout
the<00:02:17.190> TV<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.540> first<00:02:18.780> thing<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.140> could<00:02:19.260> go

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
the TV so the first thing that could go

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.650 
the TV so the first thing that could go
around<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.730> TV<00:02:20.910> set<00:02:21.300> will<00:02:21.480> not

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
around here is that the TV set will not

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.680 
around here is that the TV set will not
turn<00:02:21.989> up<00:02:22.280> if<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.430> are<00:02:23.549> not<00:02:23.730> able<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.090> power<00:02:24.420> on

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
turn up if you are not able to power on

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.170 
turn up if you are not able to power on
your<00:02:24.900> TV<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:26.100> first<00:02:26.310> thing<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:26.610> would<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.910> is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
your TV the first thing I would do is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.330 
your TV the first thing I would do is
double<00:02:27.510> check<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.110> outlet<00:02:28.440> works<00:02:28.680> try

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
double check that the outlet works try

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.009 
double check that the outlet works try
plugging<00:02:29.730> something<00:02:29.940> else<00:02:30.209> into<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.660> outlet

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
plugging something else into that outlet

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.770 
plugging something else into that outlet
and<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.500> sure<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:32.040> turns<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:33.630> can

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
and be sure that it turns on you can

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.420 
and be sure that it turns on you can
plug<00:02:33.959> in<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> clock<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.650> can<00:02:34.799> plug<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.100> anything

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
plug in a clock you can plug in anything

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.190 
plug in a clock you can plug in anything
but<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.180> sure<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.690> outlet<00:02:37.019> works

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
but just be sure that the outlet works

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.479 
but just be sure that the outlet works
before<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.010> start<00:02:38.340> taking<00:02:38.519> apart<00:02:38.760> your<00:02:38.970> TV<00:02:40.489> if

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
before you start taking apart your TV if

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.789 
before you start taking apart your TV if
the<00:02:41.790> outlet<00:02:42.090> works<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:43.260> are<00:02:43.380> not<00:02:43.500> getting

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
the outlet works and you are not getting

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.350 
the outlet works and you are not getting
and<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.130> are<00:02:44.250> still<00:02:44.489> not<00:02:44.640> getting<00:02:44.940> power<00:02:45.150> to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and you are still not getting power to

and you are still not getting power to
your<00:02:45.450> TV<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.440> will<00:02:46.650> want<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.950> take<00:02:47.130> a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
your TV then you will want to take a

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.699 
your TV then you will want to take a
look<00:02:47.400> at<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.730> power<00:02:47.940> supply<00:02:48.360> power<00:02:49.290> supplies

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
look at the power supply power supplies

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.890 
look at the power supply power supplies
will<00:02:49.920> have<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.070> fuse<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.519> them<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.690> check

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
will have a fuse on them you can check

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.170 
will have a fuse on them you can check
the<00:02:52.049> fuse<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.380> see<00:02:52.560> if<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.799> is<00:02:52.920> blown<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.820> if<00:02:54.030> it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the fuse to see if it is blown and if it

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.080 
the fuse to see if it is blown and if it
is<00:02:54.359> you<00:02:54.810> can<00:02:54.930> try<00:02:55.109> replacing<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.859> and<00:02:56.190> plug

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
is you can try replacing that and plug

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.110 
is you can try replacing that and plug
the<00:02:57.239> TV<00:02:57.390> back<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:58.010> if<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.190> TV<00:02:59.519> powers<00:02:59.880> on<00:03:00.090> and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the TV back in if the TV powers on and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.690 
the TV back in if the TV powers on and
the<00:03:00.390> fuse<00:03:00.630> stays<00:03:00.930> good<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:02.070> should<00:03:02.250> be<00:03:02.370> set<00:03:02.579> to

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
the fuse stays good you should be set to

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.360 
the fuse stays good you should be set to
go<00:03:02.730> if<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.900> fuse<00:03:04.109> blows<00:03:04.380> immediately<00:03:05.040> right

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
go if the fuse blows immediately right

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.310 
go if the fuse blows immediately right
when<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.579> plug<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.790> TV<00:03:06.060> back<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.450> then<00:03:07.049> you'll

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
when you plug the TV back in then you'll

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.289 
when you plug the TV back in then you'll
have<00:03:07.470> another<00:03:07.769> issue<00:03:08.070> on<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.579> board<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:09.150> is

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
have another issue on the board that is

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.449 
have another issue on the board that is
blowing<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.810> fuse<00:03:10.109> if<00:03:10.829> you<00:03:10.950> are<00:03:11.100> going<00:03:11.340> to

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
blowing that fuse if you are going to

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.640 
blowing that fuse if you are going to
try<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.850> check<00:03:12.060> your<00:03:12.630> fuse<00:03:12.989> on<00:03:13.260> your<00:03:13.470> power

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
try and check your fuse on your power

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.890 
try and check your fuse on your power
supply<00:03:14.090> sometimes<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.239> can<00:03:15.359> be<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> little<00:03:15.690> bit

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
supply sometimes it can be a little bit

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.380 
supply sometimes it can be a little bit
more<00:03:16.049> difficult<00:03:16.620> some<00:03:17.250> fuses<00:03:17.640> are<00:03:17.790> ceramic

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
more difficult some fuses are ceramic

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.270 
more difficult some fuses are ceramic
and<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:18.930> would<00:03:19.079> need<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.260> meter<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.829> test<00:03:20.070> that

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
and you would need a meter to test that

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.690 
and you would need a meter to test that
fuse<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.940> see<00:03:21.120> if<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.390> bed<00:03:22.340> some<00:03:23.340> common
