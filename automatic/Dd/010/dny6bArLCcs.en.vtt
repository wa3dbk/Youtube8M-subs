00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.180 
problem all on his own we took the whole
which<00:01:50.569> we<00:01:50.690> hope<00:01:50.869> your<00:01:51.350> will<00:01:51.500> will<00:01:51.740> stuff<00:01:52.039> like

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
which we hope your will will stuff like

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.340 
which we hope your will will stuff like
that<00:01:52.220> got<00:01:52.610> someone<00:01:52.819> all<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.090> sand<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:53.630> dirt

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
that got someone all the sand and dirt

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.960 
that got someone all the sand and dirt
because<00:01:54.590> I<00:01:54.679> mean<00:01:54.920> there's<00:01:55.159> quite<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.640> quite<00:01:55.909> a

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
because I mean there's quite a quite a

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.309 
because I mean there's quite a quite a
mess<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.330> you're<00:01:56.479> over<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.780> roll<00:01:56.929> it<00:01:57.020> for<00:01:57.170> sure

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
mess and you're over to roll it for sure

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.460 
mess and you're over to roll it for sure
and<00:01:58.360> then<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.539> course<00:01:59.569> we<00:01:59.960> just<00:02:00.140> had<00:02:00.259> a<00:02:00.289> look

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
and then of course we just had a look

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.010 
and then of course we just had a look
there<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.890> see<00:02:01.039> if<00:02:01.190> we<00:02:01.280> could

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
there to see if we could

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.330 
there to see if we could
what<00:02:03.140> was<00:02:03.259> on<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.500> go

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
what was on the go

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.570 
what was on the go
ended<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:05.969> think<00:02:06.299> we've<00:02:06.450> seen<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> wheel<00:02:07.140> sensor

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
ended up think we've seen a wheel sensor

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.740 
ended up think we've seen a wheel sensor
ABS<00:02:08.580> sensor<00:02:08.759> or<00:02:09.030> something<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.599> was

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
ABS sensor or something that was

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.330 
ABS sensor or something that was
disconnected<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.709> your<00:02:10.800> front<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
disconnected there on your front the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.000 
disconnected there on your front the
front<00:02:12.120> wheel<00:02:12.360> there<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> tried<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.560> prepare

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
front wheel there so I tried to prepare

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.009 
front wheel there so I tried to prepare
