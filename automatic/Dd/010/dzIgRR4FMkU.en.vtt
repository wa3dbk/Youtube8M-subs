going racing we develop products at a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.640 
going racing we develop products at a
very<00:00:19.369> high<00:00:19.460> level<00:00:19.640> under<00:00:20.630> very<00:00:20.840> extreme

very high level under very extreme

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.279 
very high level under very extreme
conditions<00:00:22.250> but<00:00:22.790> always<00:00:22.970> we<00:00:23.359> need<00:00:23.750> to<00:00:24.020> improve

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
conditions but always we need to improve

conditions but always we need to improve
performance<00:00:25.539> it's<00:00:26.539> not<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:26.840> same<00:00:27.019> thing<00:00:27.050> as

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
performance it's not the same thing as

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.890 
performance it's not the same thing as
as<00:00:27.710> as<00:00:28.340> we<00:00:28.699> deal<00:00:28.850> with<00:00:29.000> the<00:00:29.090> base<00:00:29.269> we<00:00:29.689> throw

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
as as we deal with the base we throw

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.540 
as as we deal with the base we throw
many<00:00:30.080> things<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:30.560> then<00:00:30.710> we<00:00:30.890> give<00:00:31.070> this<00:00:31.279> big

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
many things and then we give this big

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.610 
many things and then we give this big
hug<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:31.939> then<00:00:32.449> they<00:00:32.900> start<00:00:33.199> making<00:00:33.500> the

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
hug and then they start making the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.350 
hug and then they start making the
production<00:00:34.070> it's<00:00:34.519> always<00:00:34.850> just<00:00:35.120> when<00:00:35.269> you

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
production it's always just when you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.240 
production it's always just when you
think<00:00:35.510> you<00:00:35.690> got<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.019> lightest<00:00:36.440> trickers<00:00:36.800> so

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
think you got the lightest trickers so

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.740 
think you got the lightest trickers so
the<00:00:37.309> letters<00:00:37.550> are<00:00:37.850> coming<00:00:38.030> in<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.330> saying<00:00:38.629> oh

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
the letters are coming in and saying oh

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.509 
the letters are coming in and saying oh
we've<00:00:38.960> got<00:00:38.989> a<00:00:39.199> lighter<00:00:39.530> but<00:00:39.860> it's<00:00:40.040> stronger

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
we've got a lighter but it's stronger

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.570 
we've got a lighter but it's stronger

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.160 

you<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.100> keep<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.610> safe<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.090> also<00:01:48.390> that

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
you have to keep it safe but also that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.859 
you have to keep it safe but also that
it's<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.530> too<00:01:50.159> strong<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:51.000> garden<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
it's not too strong to garden that you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
it's not too strong to garden that you
can<00:01:52.049> move<00:01:52.170> around<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.590> bike<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.100> mean<00:01:53.640> it's

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
can move around the bike I mean it's

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.160 
can move around the bike I mean it's
it's<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.420> balance<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.840> know<00:01:57.020> racing<00:01:58.020> is

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
it's a balance you know racing is

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.679 
it's a balance you know racing is
uniquely<00:01:58.830> demanding<00:01:59.700> when<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.030> comes<00:02:00.270> to
