replacing a thermostat on a w210 III 20
is<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.389> great<00:00:09.960> beginner<00:00:10.559> DIY<00:00:11.160> job<00:00:11.490> if<00:00:11.700> you

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
is a great beginner DIY job if you

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.360 
is a great beginner DIY job if you
haven't<00:00:12.570> worked<00:00:12.780> on<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> car<00:00:13.469> before<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.160> is

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
haven't worked on a car before this is

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.550 
haven't worked on a car before this is
something<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.940> can<00:00:15.240> do<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.080> not<00:00:16.109> difficult

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
something you can do it is not difficult

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.470 
something you can do it is not difficult
and<00:00:17.210> also<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.420> these<00:00:19.369> m112<00:00:20.369> v6<00:00:20.939> engines<00:00:21.330> I

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
and also with these m112 v6 engines I

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.359 
and also with these m112 v6 engines I
mean<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.869> another<00:00:22.230> example<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:23.189> how

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
mean this is another example of how

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.759 
mean this is another example of how
these<00:00:23.609> engines<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:24.359> been<00:00:24.539> engineered<00:00:24.930> for

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
these engines have been engineered for

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.160 
these engines have been engineered for
the<00:00:25.890> person<00:00:26.340> that's<00:00:26.670> going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.359> work<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.990> them

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the person that's going to work on them

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.750 
the person that's going to work on them
and<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.859> service<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.400> repair<00:00:29.730> work

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
and do the service and repair work

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.870 
and do the service and repair work
that's<00:00:30.119> required<00:00:30.750> down<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.890> road<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
that's required down the road the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.380 
that's required down the road the
thermostat<00:00:33.570> comes<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.410> an<00:00:34.980> integral<00:00:35.640> unit<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
thermostat comes as an integral unit in

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.049 
thermostat comes as an integral unit in
the<00:00:37.320> top<00:00:37.649> half<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> thermostat<00:00:38.820> housing

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the top half of the thermostat housing

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.110 
the top half of the thermostat housing
so<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.379> could<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.680> simpler<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.760> part

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
so what could be simpler that one part

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.260 
so what could be simpler that one part
you've<00:00:42.750> got<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.320> new<00:00:43.590> ceiling<00:00:44.430> ring<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.030> comes

you've got a new ceiling ring that comes
with<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.840> kit<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.520> it's<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
with the kit and it's just it's just a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.470 
with the kit and it's just it's just a
matter<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.070> draining<00:00:50.070> out<00:00:50.219> some<00:00:50.940> coolant<00:00:51.329> out

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
lip and just twist and pry out on it and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.410 
lip and just twist and pry out on it and
that'll<00:03:10.170> break<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.940> thermostat<00:03:11.940> free<00:03:14.420> just

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
that'll break the thermostat free just
