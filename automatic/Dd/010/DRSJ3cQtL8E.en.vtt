 Hello everyone! 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.840
 Today we received a question from a community player 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.040
 The question is this: Why is there no audio equipment on the chariot? 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.720
 Can you install audio equipment on the chariot? 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.520
 Our chariot research team is going to experiment 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.160
 Dude, you can start! 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.680
 So now you can test our sound and see if it really needs it on the chariot. 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.200
 People usually don't install audio equipment in the chariot, because... it’s too hard to hear what is in the end. 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.480
 But isn't that obvious? and so… 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.440
 So, this is obvious, right? 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.520
 Well, we solved a problem again. 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.160
 If you think that some things are very difficult to do on the chariot, you can ask us questions, let us study how to solve 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.720
 So, let’s enjoy the engine sound of the chariot. 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.000
 music? You won't need it
