00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
dope he's somebody that I think that is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.740 
dope he's somebody that I think that is
doing<00:00:58.260> something<00:00:58.739> different

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
doing something different

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.939 
doing something different
much<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.930> same<00:01:01.020> way<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.590> are

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
much in the same way that we are

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
much in the same way that we are
something<00:01:02.430> different<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.030> can't<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.449> put

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
something different you can't really put

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.990 
something different you can't really put
it<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.930> box<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.000> chance

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
it in a box and be like this is chance

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.640 
it in a box and be like this is chance
sounds<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.659> or<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.320> sound<00:01:07.530> like

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
sounds like this or that we sound like

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.719 
sounds like this or that we sound like
this<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.189> there's<00:01:08.369> there's<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
this so I think that there's there's a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.060 
this so I think that there's there's a
natural<00:01:09.240> pair<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.799> um

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
natural pair for that I think that um

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.179 
natural pair for that I think that um
you<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:12.320> he's<00:01:13.320> from<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:13.740> I've<00:01:13.860> seen<00:01:14.040> on

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
videos are huge if not at the very top

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.200 
videos are huge if not at the very top
of<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.420> list<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.460> think<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.790> terms<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
of the list and I think in terms of a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.700 
of the list and I think in terms of a
blueprint<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.840> mean<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.170> think<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.439> there<00:01:58.619> was

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
blueprint I mean I think that there was

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
blueprint I mean I think that there was
a<00:01:58.890> couple<00:01:59.280> very<00:01:59.520> simple<00:01:59.939> things<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.360> did

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
a couple very simple things that we did

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.039 
a couple very simple things that we did
which<00:02:00.869> was<00:02:01.079> we're<00:02:01.710> gonna<00:02:01.829> try<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.869> do<00:02:03.869> as<00:02:04.020> much

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
which was we're gonna try and do as much

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.719 
which was we're gonna try and do as much
of<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.649> our<00:02:04.770> own<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.399> have

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
of this on our own as we can have

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.459 
of this on our own as we can have
creative<00:02:06.180> control<00:02:06.479> creative<00:02:06.960> oversight<00:02:07.439> over

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
