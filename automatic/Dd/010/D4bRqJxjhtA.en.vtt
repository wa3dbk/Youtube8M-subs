not gonna stick to your bike yeah or
look<00:00:06.509> good<00:00:10.790> like<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.969> Machado<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.630> got<00:00:12.900> one<00:00:13.019> of

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
look good like the Machado I got one of

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.600 
look good like the Machado I got one of
our<00:00:13.200> really<00:00:13.440> important<00:00:13.830> things<00:00:14.040> as<00:00:14.219> always

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
our really important things as always

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.939 
our really important things as always
designing<00:00:15.089> under<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.719> idea<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> simplest

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
designing under the idea of the simplest

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.250 
designing under the idea of the simplest
simplest<00:00:17.850> path<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.300> function<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.140> that's

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
simplest path to the function and that's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.290 
simplest path to the function and that's
really<00:00:19.500> what<00:00:19.680> bands<00:00:20.010> has<00:00:20.250> always<00:00:20.699> been<00:00:20.970> and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
really what bands has always been and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.970 
really what bands has always been and
that's<00:00:21.390> why<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> think<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.590> marriage<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
that's why I think that the marriage of

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.349 
that's why I think that the marriage of
the<00:00:23.070> two<00:00:23.100> kind<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.460> coming<00:00:23.730> together<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the two kind of coming together is a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.960 
the two kind of coming together is a
really<00:00:24.600> embody<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.650> same<00:00:25.890> philosophy<00:00:26.609> keep

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
really embody the same philosophy keep

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.000 
really embody the same philosophy keep
it<00:00:27.090> simple<00:00:27.330> stupid<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:28.199> know<00:00:28.320> i<00:00:28.349> don't<00:00:28.680> saying

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
it simple stupid you know i don't saying

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.500 
it simple stupid you know i don't saying
goes<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.310> know<00:00:29.820> because<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:30.390> don't

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
goes you know because you really don't

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.350 
goes you know because you really don't
need<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.199> create<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.500> space<00:00:31.830> shuttle<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.610> have

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
need to create a space shuttle to have

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.150 
need to create a space shuttle to have
the<00:00:33.510> function<00:00:34.050> i<00:00:34.079> mean<00:00:34.410> i<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.860> vans

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the function i mean i think with vans

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.430 
the function i mean i think with vans
having<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> waffle<00:00:36.000> sole<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.410> of

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
having the waffle sole it's just one of

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.709 
having the waffle sole it's just one of
the<00:00:37.530> best<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> best<00:00:38.550> solos<00:00:38.940> ever<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the best one of the best solos ever so I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.810 
the best one of the best solos ever so I
mean<00:00:39.809> having<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.910> simple<00:00:41.910> design<00:00:43.610> works<00:00:44.610> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
mean having that simple design works so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.950 
mean having that simple design works so
perfectly<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.360> think<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.660> embodies

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
perfectly I think it really embodies

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.690 
perfectly I think it really embodies
also<00:00:46.680> kinda<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.250> we've<00:00:47.399> done<00:00:47.550> with

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
also kinda like what we've done with

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.310 
also kinda like what we've done with
shadow<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.149> mean<00:00:48.360> we've<00:00:48.480> always<00:00:48.690> tried<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> keep

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
shadow I mean we've always tried to keep

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.520 
shadow I mean we've always tried to keep
our<00:00:49.530> parts<00:00:50.660> function<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.670> stay<00:00:53.930> clean<00:00:54.930> clean

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
our parts function and stay clean clean

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.439 
our parts function and stay clean clean
and<00:00:55.710> classic<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.489> think<00:00:56.699> that's<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.090> I

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
and classic and I think that's really I

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.060 
and classic and I think that's really I
mean<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.780> really<00:00:57.899> embodies<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.649> bands

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
mean that really embodies what bands

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.520 
mean that really embodies what bands
about<00:00:59.460> also<00:00:59.879> is<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.420> really<00:01:00.690> altered

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
about also is I think it really altered

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.260 
about also is I think it really altered
really<00:01:01.829> makes<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.100> lot<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> sense<00:01:02.399> how<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:02.940> came

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
really makes a lot of sense how we came

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.230 
really makes a lot of sense how we came
together<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.549> first<00:01:05.549> vans<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.060> shadow

quality fabrics when you look at the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
quality fabrics when you look at the
shoot<00:01:33.210> first<00:01:33.479> glance<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> nice<00:01:34.229> simplicity

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
cushioning effect to those so it kind of

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.940 
cushioning effect to those so it kind of
prevents<00:03:04.720> any<00:03:04.870> sort<00:03:05.079> of<00:03:05.110> heel<00:03:05.260> bruising<00:03:05.739> when
