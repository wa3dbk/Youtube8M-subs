00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.920 
one explant triplets flanger press are
where<00:00:33.769> we<00:00:33.800> do<00:00:33.980> a<00:00:34.220> flam<00:00:34.489> followed<00:00:35.449> by<00:00:35.540> two<00:00:35.600> more

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
where we do a flam followed by two more

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.899 
where we do a flam followed by two more
notes<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:36.440> three<00:00:36.830> notes<00:00:37.040> in<00:00:37.190> tow<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:37.580> we<00:00:37.699> go<00:00:37.790> on

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:37.909 
notes so three notes in tow so we go on

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.380 
notes so three notes in tow so we go on
to<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.059> right<00:00:38.269> hand<00:00:38.479> and<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:39.589> left<00:00:39.799> and<00:00:39.979> a<00:00:40.040> right

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
to the right hand and a left and a right

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.619 
to the right hand and a left and a right
so<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:41.420> go<00:00:41.659> to<00:00:42.430> three<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:44.150> that's<00:00:44.330> the<00:00:44.420> right

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
so I go to three and that's the right

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.660 
so I go to three and that's the right
hand<00:00:44.809> inside<00:00:44.960> of<00:00:45.199> it<00:00:45.290> so<00:00:45.440> if<00:00:45.500> we<00:00:45.589> call<00:00:45.799> all

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
hand inside of it so if we call all

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.130 
hand inside of it so if we call all
those<00:00:46.850> three<00:00:47.089> notes<00:00:47.210> think<00:00:47.600> about<00:00:47.780> is<00:00:47.900> right

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
those three notes think about is right

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.640 
those three notes think about is right
so<00:00:49.479> that's<00:00:50.479> the<00:00:50.600> right<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.930> muzak<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.440> same

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
so that's the right the muzak the same

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.250 
so that's the right the muzak the same
on<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.460> left<00:00:52.489> hand<00:00:52.820> mirror<00:00:53.180> image<00:00:53.869> so<00:00:53.989> on<00:00:54.140> to

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
on the left hand mirror image so on to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.500 
on the left hand mirror image so on to
the<00:00:54.350> left<00:00:55.239> right<00:00:56.239> left<00:00:58.210> so<00:00:59.210> without<00:00:59.299> the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
the left right left so without the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.490 
the left right left so without the
flam's<00:00:59.750> in<00:00:59.930> there<00:01:00.080> it's<00:01:00.199> actually<00:01:00.470> just<00:01:00.710> one

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
flam's in there it's actually just one

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.439 
flam's in there it's actually just one
hand<00:01:03.729> triplets<00:01:04.729> where<00:01:04.850> they<00:01:04.909> got<00:01:05.030> flam's<00:01:05.269> in

faster<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.390> get<00:01:56.750> more<00:01:56.930> stick<00:01:57.170> control

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
faster and get more stick control

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.609 
faster and get more stick control
there's<00:01:58.549> no<00:01:58.640> usually<00:01:59.149> as<00:01:59.390> feels<00:01:59.689> and<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:00.409> if<00:02:00.530> i

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
there's no usually as feels and so if i

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.070 
there's no usually as feels and so if i
play<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.970> sometimes<00:02:02.149> i<00:02:02.600> want<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.780> put<00:02:02.869> some

play and sometimes i want to put some
sort<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.259> structure<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.830> what<00:02:04.430> i<00:02:04.460> use<00:02:04.670> was<00:02:04.880> I've

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
sort of structure so what i use was I've

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.880 
sort of structure so what i use was I've
used<00:02:05.149> stick<00:02:05.840> control<00:02:06.170> it's<00:02:06.470> just<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.770> they

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
used stick control it's just that they

used stick control it's just that they
kind<00:02:07.070> of<00:02:07.130> book<00:02:07.340> or<00:02:07.549> we've<00:02:07.670> got<00:02:07.789> all<00:02:07.909> these

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
kind of book or we've got all these

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.760 
kind of book or we've got all these
different<00:02:08.239> pans<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:09.110> we<00:02:09.200> do<00:02:09.350> things<00:02:09.590> like

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
different pans and we do things like

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.150 
different pans and we do things like
single<00:02:10.610> strokes<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.209> double<00:02:11.569> strokes

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
single strokes and double strokes

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.440 
single strokes and double strokes
paradiddles<00:02:13.160> if<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.700> show<00:02:13.819> you<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:13.970> parotid<00:02:14.360> of

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
paradiddles if I show you the parotid of

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.430 
paradiddles if I show you the parotid of
what<00:02:14.540> we'd<00:02:14.660> be<00:02:14.750> doing<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.989> we<00:02:15.110> could<00:02:15.260> be<00:02:15.319> the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
what we'd be doing is we could be the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.710 
what we'd be doing is we could be the
right-handed<00:02:15.950> one<00:02:16.099> left-handed<00:02:16.280> one<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.390> two

right-handed one left-handed one and two
rights<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:19.790> left<00:02:20.000> only<00:02:20.180> one<00:02:20.420> writing<00:02:20.900> the

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
rights and I left only one writing the

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.770 
rights and I left only one writing the
one<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.650> left<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> sense<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:23.180> do<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.510> /

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
one to left so in a sense you do this /

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:39.250 
one to left so in a sense you do this /
/<00:02:25.150> by<00:02:26.150> this

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.569 

and<00:02:40.260> that's<00:02:40.409> it<00:02:40.560> now<00:02:40.920> all<00:02:41.099> I've<00:02:41.219> done<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.459> as

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
and that's it now all I've done that as

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.099 
and that's it now all I've done that as
I'm<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:41.849> through<00:02:41.939> state<00:02:42.239> control<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.689> I'm

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
I'm going through state control so I'm

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.860 
I'm going through state control so I'm
maxing<00:02:43.680> out<00:02:43.769> at<00:02:43.829> about<00:02:43.980> 180<00:02:44.489> at<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.569> moment<00:02:45.810> I

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
maxing out at about 180 at the moment I

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.459 
maxing out at about 180 at the moment I
think<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.290> when<00:02:46.920> they<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.219> try<00:02:47.430> that
