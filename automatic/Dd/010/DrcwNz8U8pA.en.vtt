 favorite audet pitches because she 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.580
 is very 60 years a rock'n'roll 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.200

 dracula will also be that I see myself then 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.190
 I started by describing his 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.590
 face she has purple makeup and 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.030
 pink around the eyes 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.510
 with a little glitter 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.500
 eyelids on a red lipstick 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.500
 so lively 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.630
 she wears a monohull in the shape of 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.340
 heart on the side we have a canvas 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.450
 of spider and a spider in loops 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.450
 with red ears 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.690
 on the other side she has a loop 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:15.150
 with some kinds of discs 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:20.710
 vinyls with regards to her hairstyle 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.930
 she has a roll so her hair is 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.950
 red and black she has no tail of 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:31.260
 horse pulled back so there that 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.260
 effect with his own hair 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.829
 so I really like the facts of 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:45.099
 roll like that it's great so we're going 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:50.349

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:52.110

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:58.569

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:28.169
