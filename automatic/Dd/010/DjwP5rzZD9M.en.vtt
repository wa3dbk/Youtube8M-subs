management<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.100> organization<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.759> I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
management and the organization that I

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.230 
management and the organization that I
work<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:40.170> whole

work for as a whole

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.240 
work for as a whole
I<00:01:41.329> think<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:41.869> definitely<00:01:42.530> prepared<00:01:43.070> me<00:01:43.130> for

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
I think it definitely prepared me for

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.149 
I think it definitely prepared me for
future<00:01:44.060> role<00:01:44.240> in<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.509> company<00:01:45.159> for

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
researching the capstone project I think

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.630 
researching the capstone project I think
a<00:01:49.820> key<00:01:50.270> for<00:01:50.600> students<00:01:51.080> is<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.430> write<00:01:52.430> down<00:01:52.460> a

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
a key for students is to write down a

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.429 
a key for students is to write down a
good<00:01:52.909> outline<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:53.659> then<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.110> can<00:01:54.289> go<00:01:54.409> through

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
good outline and then you can go through
