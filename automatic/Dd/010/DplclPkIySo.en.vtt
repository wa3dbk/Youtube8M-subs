doing
better<00:03:52.239> job<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.780> of<00:03:52.930> understanding<00:03:53.470> how<00:03:53.709> that

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
better job to of understanding how that

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.280 
better job to of understanding how that
how<00:03:54.220> everything<00:03:54.640> fits<00:03:54.790> together<00:03:54.970> was<00:03:55.810> in

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
how everything fits together was in

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.479 
how everything fits together was in
college<00:03:56.500> again<00:03:56.590> Pat<00:03:56.860> like<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.040> light<00:03:57.310> bulb

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
college again Pat like a light bulb

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.160 
college again Pat like a light bulb
moment<00:03:57.610> for<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.120> don't<00:03:58.870> know<00:03:58.930> if<00:03:59.019> it's<00:03:59.110> a

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
moment for the don't know if it's a

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.809 
moment for the don't know if it's a
lightbulb<00:03:59.590> moment<00:04:00.010> but<00:04:00.099> I<00:04:00.129> mean<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.400> think<00:04:00.610> it's

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
lightbulb moment but I mean I think it's

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.009 
lightbulb moment but I mean I think it's
just<00:04:00.879> a<00:04:01.090> growing<00:04:01.420> experience<00:04:01.569> that<00:04:01.930> you

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
just a growing experience that you

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.270 
just a growing experience that you
hopefully<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.319> learn<00:04:02.439> from<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:02.980> then

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
hopefully you learn from it and then

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.520 
hopefully you learn from it and then
