00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:09.030
 98% of all meat comes from factory farming, but as a vegan you almost always only meet 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.280
 the 2% who buy only organic and eat only very little meat and only from the butcher 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.690
 At the corner where they personally convince themselves that the animals are well. 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.860
 At the factory farms are probably only the other guilt: the other not so "conscious" 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.040
 Meat-eaters with a miser-is-cool mentality, the government, discounters and capitalism. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.050
 It is good to know that a guilty conscience seems to be raining there but 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.050
 Organic meat also comes from intentionally killed, helpless, suffering living beings. 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.940
 Biotiers are by no means happily free-roaming until they reach the end of their "natural" 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.720
 Let your life be caressed for free. 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.100
 The BIO-caged and BIO-exploited animals are not just killed a bit. 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.170
 To put on organic is useful in most plant foods. 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.500
 In animals, it is not much more than a label to calm the conscience, because the suffering 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.130
 which the animals endure in their far too short life before their violent slaughter 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.920
 are hardly distinguishable from that in factory farming. 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.420
 The slaughter is identical in the end. 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.310
 Even the environmental impact is not significantly lower for organic meat. 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.119
 Sometimes even the opposite is the case, as the animals take a little longer to reach them 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.279
 Are "ready for slaughter" and in this time, of course, burden the environment more. 

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:23.319
 It is an illusion that bio is synonymous with free-running or with a happy, 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.639
 idyllic animal life is, as it is represented for example in advertising. 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:31.719
 Even if these animals are happy, it is absurd to say that it will be okay 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:32.719
 is to kill her. 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.610
 Imagine, someone would argue that is okay to kill people, though 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.409
 you have treated this well before. 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.619
 Unfortunately, this logic is not a problem for nonhuman animals. 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.140
 Even organic animals get a bolt shot in the brain and are then slit to bleed. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.530
 In addition, virtually all of our so-called "farm animals" are bred to extreme amounts 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.429
 to produce meat, milk or eggs. 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.779
 Therefore, her whole short life is already painful in itself and they are after a short while 

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.039
 Time completely at the end and used up. 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.579
 Also at bio. 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.569
 A chicken from factory farming lays about 300 eggs a year, when Biotierhaltung are 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.569
 it 270. 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.510
 The natural ancestors of our laying hens lay about 10 eggs a year. 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.170
 The situation is similar with milk production. 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.240
 That such extreme "achievements" can not work without suffering and theirs 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.330
 Call for price, should be obvious. 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.090
 The "natural" life expectancy of domestic cattle is about 20 years. 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.560
 Meat cattle are usually killed after less than a year. 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.990
 Dairy cows and laying hens live a little longer until their performance wears off and they do not 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.130
 are more profitable and disposed of. 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.170
 Whether this is something positive for them in this way of life, I can not judge. 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.560
 A small bill: Every year in Germany about 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.390
 54.8 million pigs were slaughtered, of which just 244,000 were from organic farming. 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.030
 That equals 0.45%. 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.231
 This is 168 grams of organic pork with an average consumption of 37.9 kg of pork 

00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:00.790
 per person -PRO YEAR! 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.310
 The average German eats 240g of meat ... ON THE DAY! 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.510
 Apparently it is thought very very briefly. 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.510
 Not only that it is enough for many people, theoretically their meat in a theoeretic 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.000
 Buy trust flesh, where you could theoretically ask how it the hacked 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.831
 Earlier so went to argue with it, or to convince yourself that you can 

00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:21.290
 practically always does. 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.750
 It seems to be with meat only to raw pieces to think and the much larger share 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.350
 do not consider. 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.980
 It always sounds like these people only insist on biovegetative food, 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.620
 if they are not presented the complete curriculum vitae of their main course. 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.750
 The bacon in the pea soup, the schnitzel in the canteen, the goulash in the cafeteria, 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.290
 the roulade in the restaurant, the casserole at the family celebration, the doner in his lunch break, 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.160
 the sausage in the pedestrian precinct, the molded ham on the pizza, the mortadella 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.850
 the children ... All this is just as meat as the like the hypothetical Sunday Roast 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.216
 for 30 â‚¬ you could theoretically buy and where you also like to spend a bit more, 

00:04:00.216 --> 00:04:02.400
 because you also value quality.
