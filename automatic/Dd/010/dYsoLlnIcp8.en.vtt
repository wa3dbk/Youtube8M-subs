remove<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.560> middle<00:00:16.940> divider<00:00:17.940> thing<00:00:18.300> because

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
remove the middle divider thing because

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.529 
remove the middle divider thing because
the<00:00:18.990> motherboard<00:00:19.439> came<00:00:19.680> down<00:00:19.949> maybe<00:00:20.760> five

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the motherboard came down maybe five

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.509 
the motherboard came down maybe five
milk<00:00:21.869> too<00:00:22.080> much<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.400> had<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.699> be<00:00:23.820> removed

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
milk too much so that had to be removed

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.900 
milk too much so that had to be removed
so<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.849> would<00:00:27.150> empty<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.689> now<00:00:27.810> until<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
so it would empty for now until the

when I first turned out i thought oh

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.940 
when I first turned out i thought oh
