00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:08.300
 here patera to return report now 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:13.500
 it's a kind 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:16.230
 it's a side to differentiate money 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.270
 cumulative of differences made 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.270
 among the participants 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.279
 wearing and touching some domina skin 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.759
 touching up sugar production 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.040
 three weeks with the participation of 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.840
 llanelli in the surprise box the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.730
 last week with the intervention of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.860
 panela in order to this series of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.690
 events has been adding up but 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.250
 because there is an accumulation we are going to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.220
 see then this report lend 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.489
 attention to always see at the end some 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.489
 opinion 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.520
 today 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.380
 the proposal was public a 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.719
 competitor 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.719
 I liked it and evaluate them 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.880
 in your letter you know a participant does not 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.799
 matters is what you want to put 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.630
 sing to dance 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.909
 you have to give the best of it 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.549
 amount in emergencies I am never from network and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.070
 again I think they ask you to 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.840
 I say I did not like what it would look like and 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.630
 you have to understand that a summation that 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.149
 we get the result the average of 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.820
 four evaluations I think in this 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.860
 case as the teacher said seconding it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.049
 the error was of the production 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.890
 then they pass the news to me and I do not 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.259
 I had prior knowledge of what was going 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.170
 it was thickened very clear that he could not 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.509
 read the lie so the lyrics are 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.970
 confuse then why I had that 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.310
 really inconvenient I do not think there's 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.869
 been a fair challenge 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.869
 put by production 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.069
 very interesting anyone who enjoys 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.560
 no very difficult challenge and I 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.250
 possibly I would have overcome them 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.050
 he did not assume that the overall score I 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.690
 I understand that in the last weeks or 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.640
 belgium has been very well 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.950
 positioned and you already feel that you have 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.269
 well-earned option and if this does not end 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.269
 until it ends as it says 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.350
 I respect the decision of the jury but 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.340
 x 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.180
 when you read 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.230
 here 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:11.300
 for a stimulus 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.300
 for saying a name that they have given me 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.370
 and always arrives late to the jury 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.920
 well I have my own personality I have 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.170
 like me only and I think it would be 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.020
 perfect in what programming is 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.370
 other robert 2000 and in the lists of 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.530
 representation when I say marÃ­a 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.530
 Alejandra later we see 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.670
 the version because all the others 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.750
 sung 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:49.140
 certainly all these days that 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.140
 there really is a perfect for her 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.950
 very jovial 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.400
 do not say anything do not say your name 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.789
 today well 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.140
 we looked at the earring last week 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.140
 as it says its way 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:43.100
 the small convenient with the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.100
 rock paper declaration 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.430
 then evidently they have surfaced 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.040
 many things there is a production we 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.720
 you have taken the 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.720
 companions to the deserved ones 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.760
 contest and that's the things that those 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.470
 contestants think that the stamping of 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.800
 Cowboys 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.800
 the score presided as 4 degrees 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.220
 if I put a 10 to a compulsa 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:20.520
 giving the best 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.520
 now 24 106 regretting it a lot 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:33.090
 before the program on the roads the 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:39.099
 risks they have during the week 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:41.780
 because every decade 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.470
 two 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.470
 Y 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.470
 all right 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.449
 Perez 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:57.219
 the competition becomes stronger the 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.110
 opinions as to if she 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.969
 gray look at the owner we take care of 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.889
 through twitter to explain to the 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.999
 people who had against another rigor 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:10.029
 same as an average of the summation 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:12.430
 although look alfonso have told me that 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:13.900
 without anyone having a score 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.719
 magic that was mine if I say 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:22.770
 honestly that computing is 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:22.770
 when the marine doctors and for me 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.890
 It is not such 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.449
 understand that it is not a competition 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.000
 Nothing personal at the moment 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.520
 we see ourselves in a bind we try to 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.300
 come out and defend it but not in a way 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:02.129
 staff because I understand that today 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.990
 look at this a competition I think that 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:06.300
 the girl has to be clear on that 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.830
 and here each one of us what 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.770
 we came to feel for our work 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.789
 to evaluate her work to help them 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:17.849
 to grow up somehow I regret that 

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:19.070
 what happened with one of the rounds where 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:21.860
 Look 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.780
 limited and I really said no 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.520
 they were fine she was bending 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.800
 where all the other girls were 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.660
 making the attempt to sing you indicate 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.510
 I 'm sorry that this caused so much 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.760
 welt but the reality here we 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:40.300
 we have no favorite is not going to decide 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.300
 he composed by
