00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.890 

I<00:00:27.699> think<00:00:28.699> for<00:00:28.849> me<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.119> crazy<00:00:29.359> catch<00:00:29.599> has<00:00:29.750> been

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
I think for me the crazy catch has been

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.019 
I think for me the crazy catch has been
really<00:00:30.140> useful<00:00:30.289> this<00:00:30.529> week<00:00:30.770> in<00:00:30.949> terms<00:00:31.189> of<00:00:31.430> its

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
really useful this week in terms of its

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.060 
really useful this week in terms of its
dynamic<00:00:32.480> nature<00:00:32.689> when<00:00:33.350> you<00:00:33.440> put<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:33.739> ball<00:00:33.890> in

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
dynamic nature when you put the ball in

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.650 
dynamic nature when you put the ball in
it's<00:00:34.220> going<00:00:34.340> to<00:00:34.430> come<00:00:34.579> back<00:00:34.610> at<00:00:34.879> you<00:00:35.000> exactly

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
it's going to come back at you exactly

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.970 
it's going to come back at you exactly
what<00:00:35.780> you<00:00:35.900> did<00:00:36.079> or<00:00:36.320> if<00:00:36.379> you<00:00:36.440> put<00:00:36.590> it<00:00:36.680> in<00:00:36.770> at<00:00:36.890> an

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
what you did or if you put it in at an

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.830 
what you did or if you put it in at an
angle<00:00:37.100> it's<00:00:37.370> going<00:00:37.520> to<00:00:37.579> come<00:00:37.699> at<00:00:37.790> an<00:00:38.059> angle<00:00:38.390> so

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
angle it's going to come at an angle so

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.569 
angle it's going to come at an angle so
we've<00:00:39.170> been<00:00:39.260> kind<00:00:39.410> of<00:00:39.530> using<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:39.890> in<00:00:40.070> terms<00:00:40.370> of

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
we've been kind of using it in terms of

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.119 
we've been kind of using it in terms of
a<00:00:40.610> movement<00:00:41.329> in<00:00:41.629> change<00:00:41.839> of<00:00:41.960> direction

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
a movement in change of direction

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.079 
a movement in change of direction
keeping<00:00:43.129> your<00:00:43.220> weight<00:00:43.370> over<00:00:43.550> your<00:00:43.670> feet<00:00:43.970> which

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
keeping your weight over your feet which

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:45.280 
keeping your weight over your feet which
is<00:00:44.120> really<00:00:44.449> important<00:00:44.809> with<00:00:44.930> netball<00:00:45.260> and

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
is really important with netball and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.990 
is really important with netball and
being<00:00:45.949> reactive<00:00:46.339> because<00:00:46.550> you<00:00:46.730> never<00:00:46.910> gonna

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
being reactive because you never gonna

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.920 
being reactive because you never gonna
be<00:00:47.150> able<00:00:47.239> to<00:00:47.330> predict<00:00:47.629> what's<00:00:47.780> going<00:00:47.870> to

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
be able to predict what's going to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:01:16.029 
be able to predict what's going to
happen<00:00:47.989> in<00:00:48.290> a<00:00:48.320> game

for about four years now and we've been

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.649 
for about four years now and we've been
using<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.460> crazy<00:01:20.670> catch<00:01:20.969> and<00:01:21.179> a<00:01:21.210> lot<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.539> our

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
using the crazy catch and a lot of our

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.300 
using the crazy catch and a lot of our
different<00:01:21.810> drills<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.829> use<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
different drills we use it with the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.999 
different drills we use it with the
goalkeepers<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.210> work<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.659> their<00:01:25.409> reaction

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
goalkeepers to work on their reaction

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.069 
goalkeepers to work on their reaction
speeds<00:01:26.459> and<00:01:26.819> when<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.719> don't<00:01:27.899> necessarily

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
speeds and when we don't necessarily

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.870 
speeds and when we don't necessarily
have<00:01:28.500> enough<00:01:28.619> players<00:01:29.039> to<00:01:29.369> run<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> drills

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
have enough players to run the drills

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.520 
have enough players to run the drills
with<00:01:30.090> them<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.569> use<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.719> crazy<00:01:31.020> catch<00:01:31.289> as<00:01:31.439> an

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
with them we can use a crazy catch as an

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.859 
with them we can use a crazy catch as an
extra<00:01:31.859> deflector<00:01:32.459> so<00:01:32.969> they've<00:01:33.119> no<00:01:33.329> idea<00:01:33.359> where

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
extra deflector so they've no idea where

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.779 
extra deflector so they've no idea where
it's<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.200> go<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.219> can<00:01:35.399> see<00:01:35.579> from

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
it's going to go and you can see from

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.819 
it's going to go and you can see from
some<00:01:35.969> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.149> drills<00:01:36.390> again<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:37.679> it's
