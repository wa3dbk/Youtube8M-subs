00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
something that has color because usually

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.580 
something that has color because usually
with<00:04:59.330> colors<00:04:59.630> you<00:04:59.840> have<00:04:59.870> to<00:05:00.200> look<00:05:00.410> in<00:05:00.500> the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
with colors you have to look in the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.530 
with colors you have to look in the
mirror<00:05:00.919> when<00:05:01.340> you're<00:05:01.520> putting<00:05:01.700> it<00:05:01.880> on<00:05:01.970> but<00:05:02.180> not
