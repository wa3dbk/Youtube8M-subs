00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
the the stomping and all that that came

think the only reason they reacted at
the<00:00:32.340> end<00:00:32.520> was<00:00:32.759> because<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.239> Santino

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
supposed to build these characters like

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.530 
supposed to build these characters like
you're<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> guys<00:01:59.159> telling<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.909> story<00:02:00.270> about

something stupid like that and kind of

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.340 
something stupid like that and kind of
go<00:02:05.399> against<00:02:05.969> what<00:02:06.479> these<00:02:06.659> characters<00:02:07.170> are

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
supposed to be now this isn't the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.540 
supposed to be now this isn't the
