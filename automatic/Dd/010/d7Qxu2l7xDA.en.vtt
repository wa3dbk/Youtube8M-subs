down<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.500> haven't<00:00:49.650> seen<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.130> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
down you know we haven't seen this that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.070 
down you know we haven't seen this that
much<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:51.060> the<00:00:51.150> past<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.540> was<00:00:51.720> kind<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
much in the past this was kind of a

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.270 
much in the past this was kind of a
common<00:00:52.440> thing<00:00:52.590> watching<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> body

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
common thing watching the body

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.460 
common thing watching the body
completely<00:00:53.820> blow<00:00:54.150> off<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> car<00:00:54.810> but<00:00:55.050> with

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
completely blow off of the car but with

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.080 
completely blow off of the car but with
the<00:00:55.590> advent<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.130> burst<00:00:56.400> panels<00:00:56.790> and<00:00:56.910> stuff

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the advent of the burst panels and stuff

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.510 
the advent of the burst panels and stuff
to<00:00:57.210> help<00:00:57.300> relieve<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:57.750> pressure<00:00:58.290> that's<00:00:59.160> what

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
to help relieve the pressure that's what

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.130 
to help relieve the pressure that's what
they're<00:00:59.880> supposed<00:01:00.330> to<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.630> when<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> birth

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
they're supposed to do when the birth

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
they're supposed to do when the birth
panel<00:01:01.500> comes<00:01:01.710> off<00:01:02.040> of<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.460> relieves<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
panel comes off of that relieves the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.850 
panel comes off of that relieves the
pressure<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.630> the<00:01:03.780> body<00:01:04.020> doesn't<00:01:04.110> come<00:01:04.559> flying

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
pressure so the body doesn't come flying

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.130 
pressure so the body doesn't come flying
off<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.400> chassis<00:01:05.730> but<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.120> if<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.930> birth

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
off of the chassis but here if the birth

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.600 
off of the chassis but here if the birth
panel<00:01:07.440> went<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.100> body<00:01:08.400> was

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
panel went up but then the body was

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.910 
panel went up but then the body was
right<00:01:08.940> behind<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.540> splits<00:01:10.230> it<00:01:10.350> apart<00:01:10.710> him

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
right behind it splits it apart him

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.390 
right behind it splits it apart him
pieces<00:01:11.910> were<00:01:12.030> flying<00:01:12.390> everywhere<00:01:12.810> Wow<00:01:13.800> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
pieces were flying everywhere Wow you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.490 
pieces were flying everywhere Wow you
are<00:01:14.550> talking<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.060> lot<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.300> energy<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.080> make<00:01:16.290> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
are talking a lot of energy to make that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.060 
are talking a lot of energy to make that
happen

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.300 

one<00:01:20.070> other<00:01:20.250> look<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.680 

Oh<00:01:28.460> some<00:01:29.460> good<00:01:29.640> camera<00:01:30.000> work<00:01:30.030> cats<00:01:30.360> Nana

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
Oh some good camera work cats Nana

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.410 
Oh some good camera work cats Nana
that's<00:01:31.500> great<00:01:32.010> then<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.909> safety

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
that's great then you see the safety

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840 
that's great then you see the safety
Safari<00:01:33.630> right<00:01:34.320> away<00:01:34.650> goes<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> parts<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
Safari right away goes for the parts and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.969 
Safari right away goes for the parts and
pieces<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.750> want<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.259> track<00:01:37.619> clear

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
pieces we want to get that track clear

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.680 
pieces we want to get that track clear
like<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.340> said<00:01:38.580> it's<00:01:38.729> unusual<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.330> that<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
like I said it's unusual for that to

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.120 
like I said it's unusual for that to
happen<00:01:39.840> because<00:01:40.080> here's<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> burst<00:01:40.770> panel

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
happen because here's the burst panel

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010 
happen because here's the burst panel
right<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:42.000> happens<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.630> when

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
right up here now what happens with when

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.749 
right up here now what happens with when
the<00:01:43.140> pressure<00:01:43.409> when<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.740> engine<00:01:44.070> backfires

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the pressure when that engine backfires

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.760 
the pressure when that engine backfires
that<00:01:45.300> burst<00:01:45.570> panel<00:01:45.899> comes<00:01:46.110> up<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.560> tries

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that burst panel comes up and it tries

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.200 
that burst panel comes up and it tries
is<00:01:46.979> supposed<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.310> relieve<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> pressure<00:01:47.940> from

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
is supposed to relieve the pressure from

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.359 
is supposed to relieve the pressure from
the<00:01:48.509> body<00:01:48.720> thus<00:01:49.320> keeping<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.830> body<00:01:50.070> from

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the body thus keeping the body from

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.999 
the body thus keeping the body from
you'll<00:01:51.360> break<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.899> half<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.440> or<00:01:52.619> flying

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
you'll break it in half and or flying

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.859 
you'll break it in half and or flying
off<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.220> car<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.790> saw<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.690> this

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
off the car like we saw on this

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.749 
off the car like we saw on this
particular<00:01:55.200> incidence<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:55.979> Bob<00:01:56.220> Bodie<00:01:56.549> but

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
particular incidence with Bob Bodie but

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.580 
particular incidence with Bob Bodie but
it<00:01:56.880> looked<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.600> burst<00:01:57.840> panel<00:01:58.140> came<00:01:58.320> off

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it looked like the burst panel came off

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.230 
it looked like the burst panel came off
but<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.039> body<00:01:59.160> was<00:01:59.580> just<00:01:59.789> right<00:02:00.060> behind

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
but then the body was just right behind

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.050 
but then the body was just right behind
it<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.720> was<00:02:00.869> had<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.320> huge<00:02:02.060> exploding

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it so it was had to be a huge exploding
