that looks like it's gonna be fun and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.350 
that looks like it's gonna be fun and
then<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:47.309> mom<00:00:47.520> made<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.050> makeshift<00:00:49.050> teaching

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
then my mom made this makeshift teaching

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.389 
then my mom made this makeshift teaching
it<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> keyring<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> black<00:00:52.739> strap<00:00:53.160> on

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
it was a keyring with a black strap on

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.330 
it was a keyring with a black strap on
it<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.820> mom<00:00:54.059> slit<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> quarter<00:00:55.140> into<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> key

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
it my mom slit a quarter into the key

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.580 
it my mom slit a quarter into the key
string<00:00:56.699> errors<00:00:57.180> are<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.719> key<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:59.460> key<00:00:59.699> spot

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
string errors are the key the key spot

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.979 
string errors are the key the key spot
all<00:01:01.590> right<00:01:02.090> well<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> better<00:01:03.420> back<00:01:03.629> away<00:01:03.930> from

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
all right well I better back away from

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.960 
all right well I better back away from
the<00:01:04.260> tracks<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:05.040> there's<00:01:05.309> no<00:01:05.489> tone<00:01:05.729> when

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the tracks because there's no tone when

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.070 
the tracks because there's no tone when
it's<00:01:06.119> gonna<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:08.420> I'll<00:01:09.420> by<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> way<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
it's gonna get here I'll by the way I

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.590 
it's gonna get here I'll by the way I
never<00:01:10.350> told<00:01:10.830> anyone<00:01:11.189> about<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.820> line<00:01:12.240> right

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
never told anyone about this line right

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.679 
never told anyone about this line right
here<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:13.140> guess<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.890> could<00:01:14.549> kill<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:15.000> time<00:01:17.689> this

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
here I guess I could kill some time this

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.850 
here I guess I could kill some time this
is<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> line<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.580> way<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.860> ends

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
is the line going that way it just ends

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.950 
is the line going that way it just ends
but<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.390> there<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> few

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
but as you can see there are a few

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.719 
but as you can see there are a few
switch<00:01:25.290> tracks<00:01:25.740> hang<00:01:26.009> on

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
switch tracks hang on

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.459 
switch tracks hang on
and<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:30.189> can<00:01:30.369> see<00:01:30.579> this<00:01:31.030> one<00:01:31.390> that<00:01:32.049> goes<00:01:32.079> off

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
and you can see this one that goes off

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:33.690 
and you can see this one that goes off
to<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.710> left<00:01:32.979> over<00:01:33.340> there

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
to the left over there

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.950 
to the left over there
that's<00:01:34.329> the<00:01:34.899> siding<00:01:35.350> for<00:01:35.530> Smurfs<00:01:35.860> at<00:01:36.009> Stone

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.980 
that's the siding for Smurfs at Stone
but<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.530> do<00:01:38.710> this<00:01:38.890> one<00:01:39.329> would<00:01:40.329> head<00:01:40.539> off<00:01:40.750> into

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
but to do this one would head off into

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.850 
but to do this one would head off into
Medina<00:01:42.479> more<00:01:43.479> like<00:01:43.630> upstate<00:01:44.170> New<00:01:44.350> York<00:01:44.380> kind
