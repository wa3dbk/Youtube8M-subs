00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.500
 the owner only thought of meal that came in and was there 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.700
 I thought no one where ever heard nice music, I thought 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.540
 and when I saw those people coming in yes I have there are only high point 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.199
 The evening Esther Vergeer had Monday between evening full of construction 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.759
 but why 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.079
 well because for the tenth year in a row they have the world ranking at it 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.730
 wheelchair tennis 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.999
 ten years at number one 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.699
 and then a party is indeed appropriate if I now look back on the 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.580
 it's just the past ten years 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.760
 yes actually a sum of highlights arrow say and i am 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.260
 just very happy that I can celebrate it with so many people in this way 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.690
 yes because of those fantastic ten years you just decided to just go 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.600
 to throw a party 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.269
 yes i liked it very much 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.319
 actually weeks many people reason should actually 4 every day and that is 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:53.520
 actually I have to 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.170
 and but when i'm sure after the win on ios about that i'll agree 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.270
 and that it is ten years 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.839
 in a row that the year is the time you know I really want to party and 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.780
 then I went to see if that was possible in this way and values ​​are 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.190
 so many people who immediately said years that wanted to support you immediately 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.480
 we did that 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.240
 it was an evening with a smile thanks to presenter jörgen raymann 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.220
 for the traffic on the railways 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.980
 haha 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.110
 but also an evening with a tear for ten years the codes 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.970
 has learned a lot 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.740
 and beautiful words were spoken, such as by the priest's chalk 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.330
 then the world would be about a 384 the sidelines 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.950
 we won seven games in a row 2 0 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.430
 that says man of my dreams of 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.320
 this month the motivation of staying on to work 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.770
 and that is the summer it was considered and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.100
 yes i'm glad i'm just allowed to say the charge after one of the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.060
 greatest with that man with most successful 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.630
 transporter that we actually have one of the largest in the Netherlands 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.119
 athletes that the world yes I do not know so well in regard to what went there 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.450
 announce the events of suppliers 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.780
 no matter how many people have me there are still learn from it and you know it 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.709
 no tonight i like this is just our emotional head like 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.680
 girlfriends who have to show understanding that I can't go on a year's day again 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.680
 and that is also just companies that put a lot of violence in May and collapsed say 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.719
 but not appalling for unpaid 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.510
 yes everything and everyone in his way but equally valuable and that is really cool 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:27.649
 to see 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:32.089
 After a skin it is the facts question but what is needed for you 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.299
 yeah right i don't know i don't know what it will stop and did 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.669
 actually I don't want to think about that at the moment and now they are 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.709
 quite a few difficult moments in the past year perhaps the 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.200
 I want most of that through with a true body, but I still have that 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.629
 challenge you know you are trying to find and yes twente groeneveldt is one of them 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.330

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.229

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:15.849

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.849
