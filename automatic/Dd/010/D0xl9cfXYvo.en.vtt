 advisors your pharmacist or your 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.359

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.010
 responsibility or even for 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.930
 people who are completely 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.370
 allergic to essential oils 7 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.780

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.810
 so I said I was going to make you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.280
 a video just after my treatment 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.950
 it's that a very long time ago because 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.140
 the treatment I do in February and 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.090
 he remembered me well and I was done 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.620
 so I had to I know more if I 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.450
 started in February I finished in March 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.470
 so and still a long time what 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.570
 now we are still months of 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.830
 June is how to say I have not you 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.060
 did the recipe and I told you 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.770
 in a video really that I was going 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.210
 you make a video on it so 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.159
 today I do it to you even if it 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.720
 did anyway some time that I 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.360
 done of treatment so I 'm going to you 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.000
 explain first how to proceed 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.070
 level of the small child's head 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.540
 business mixture and after I'm going to you 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.000
 explain my experience if it worked 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.100
 or not on me so you need 5 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.520
 essential oils that are here so the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.960
 young worker you will need some 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:33.220
 cinnamon from China then you will need 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:37.750
 of the saint of the cloutier mountains 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.550
 rov and then the rig so compact 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.470
 it's true that at the budget level 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.570
 pretty much count and I think 25 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.590
 euros if I remember correctly 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.580
 but good after when you have them 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.050
 do you have them you can very well 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.510
 use for something else after 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.250
 look at the description of the oil and 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.770
 to know if she is good for this or 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.780
 for that but for warts the ditch 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.400
 5,800 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.170
 that's what to do 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.850
 it's simple as hello to take 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.409
 a milliliter of each and puts them in 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.960
 game in a small bottle of 5000 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.580
 liters me here it's a tithe and liters 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.280
 but you can do it anyway 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.770
 completely one says militate so 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.750
 put 2008 of each in the bottle 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.860
 and it will make you decrease said like that 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.330
 you will still do a lot more 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.000
 for a long time that 5000 says it's true it has 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.500
 not have to last you long 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.030
 how to apply it is simple you 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.170
 have completely means coaticook 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.280
 you will take your cotton 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.930
 go straight to master on your 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.280
 cotton and apply directly on the 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.780
 street life where will we see if you have 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.030
 several martyrs or change the cotton 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.310
 which cotton swab but you apply 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.830
 then against the budget level 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.750
 dressings it's worth making a good look 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.400
 budget because every time so he 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.800
 must be applied twice a day on 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.060
 keep the general after your shower on 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.950
 evening if they did not take a shower where 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.989
 you have it where the place is 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.030
 streets and you put a bandage 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.830
 until after two applications 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.360
 daily and clean just 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.860
 before so it's true that it's a small 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.230
 uncomfortable because having chanted 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.400
 if these auditions it is really the galley 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.569
 I really want to tell you that it is 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.340
 really the hassle of having any time 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.799
 dressing to the fingers to make 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.510
 to eat to do the dishes and everything 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.530
 so that sometimes you di roma juan throws I 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.480
 will do them after but it's true that 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.850
 it's really a mess 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.590
 it's true that in higher levels of 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.049
 the period is not a week without 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.370
 between three to four weeks 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.680
 and then after if you see that this is 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.930
 not enough attenuated you start again in 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.180
 done on letting you happen one to 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.959
 two a week a week louis and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.760
 you start again 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.100
 but it's true that it's really 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.450
 so binding on me is that it 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.970
 worked and had me alleys and 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.440
 really old for a very long time and 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.640
 she did not leave with the treatment 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.640
 with essential oils 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.930
 it's really i think a treatment 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.940
 for people where the wart comes 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.430
 just start - maveraud she is 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.959
 really created first I tried before 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.609
 to try the essential oils 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.470
 I did not want to tell myself alone with 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.090
 essential oils traxel at the level 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.130
 pairing also I will try in 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.660
 pharmacy so I tried the pens 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.500
 years who sell in pharmacy hunt and 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.840
 then what is the 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.860
 riou pharma this is not at all 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.450
 part either so 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.220
 after I stand I'll do with the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.490
 essential oils so oils 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.760
 essential it did not work 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.850
 so here is my experience against it 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.140
 you I think you have a wart there 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.520
 not so long ago that I think 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.000
 that it would go away with the oils 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.700
 essential 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.829
 so it's true that I was disappointed yes 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.200
 yes yes and no because these racks a 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.150
 budget anyway for and 25 euros 6.9 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.620
 in the room it's slower after as I 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.940
 just told you the oils 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.230
 essential you have them it's true 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.780
 that is relatively long 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.620
 there for example brigands compact until 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.780
 2017 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.430
 you have time to think about 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.070
 redo a few recipes with and 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.200
 what is it but it's true that as I 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.520
 tell you I was disappointed yes and no 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.800
 it is true that the wart and still 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.610
 present since actually at the base when 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.960
 I was in front of my doctor 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.370
 I did not know at all that these 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.740
 last russ and my doctor who told me 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.910
 that it was a wart to tell you I 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.140
 did not think at all when was a 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.110
 wart so every time what 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.340
 I was doing it I was scratching it playing the cup and 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.419
 without it bleeding what's needed 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.160
 pay attention to the level of the crooks 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.390
 when it does not bleed automatically 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.919
 will develop a little more elsewhere 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.810
 So really be very careful not 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.410
 not cut you the wart because that 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.050
 can spread 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.180
 but it's true that so less by 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.550
 against 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.810
 I saw some of them as they went 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.190
 as far as I did the 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.240
 treatment I saw they had when 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.740
 even groups that were leaving 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.530
 swallow super it'll go away after 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.009
 from almost 7 7 days or a week to 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.050
 ten days 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.360
 there were bits of my life rockies 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.340
 in live I thought to myself great it starts 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.870
 to work well then after that had to 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.550
 put at least two weeks after to 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.169
 remove even better from layers yet 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.850
 another layer the age the guitar and that 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.740
 left alone but in fact she did not 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.419
 is really well anchored so what I 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.400
 will do if I go directly went 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.949
 at the dermato and have it removed 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.449
 because it's really not like 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.270
 aesthetic of everything and especially at 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.979
 finger level I do not like it at all 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.720
 it's at the foot again when we're in 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.020
 winter and that did not hurt at all 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.300
 past 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.770
 but hey that's really not who 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.250
 it's a public microbe it's a microbe 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.830
 so 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.270
 so here is all my experience I hope 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.740
 that you will have a little bit of rules 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.820
 I really hope that you handed 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.289
 to have you at best in fact we know 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.240
 that it's negative for me in you 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.160
 saying it's going to work on alexandra so 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.229
 I do not try I think it really 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.419
 famous crooks that are recent I 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.039
 think it has to leave so if you 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.630
 try in the same six months 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.889
 return to my video or send me a 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.210
 little comment to tell me if that 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.449
 was working because I would have 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.520
 wanted to have a return from someone so 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.050
 so here for this video I hope that 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.760
 it will have pleased you if you liked 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.340
 do not forget to put a little thumb 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.449
 blue to please me and I you 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.449
 tell soon lease
