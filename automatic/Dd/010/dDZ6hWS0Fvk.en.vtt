00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.510
 hey i'm gonna show you how today 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.429
 this glittery terrible night 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.799
 in making maybe for old and new 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.480
 because yes this does not look natural 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.820
 Hey 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.420
 this is what you need glitter and 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.340
 silver nail polish and top coat and you 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.230
 nails of course 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.359
 I will start painting your nails and 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.269
 I use a silver glitter polish from 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.750
 sanssouci the perfect nails in the color 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.630
 180 metallic hours and this serves as 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.910
 basis for the glitter secretly the same 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.400
 color by doing so that the might 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.320
 glitter doesn't come in every spot 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.020
 so a lot of nail polish in any case 20 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.700
 shining through and it is everywhere 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.350
 silver glitter looks let it momentarily 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:00.910
 drying as flutter 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:02.980
 blowing while dry looks at my 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.220
 instagram I have my notifications and 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.220
 so 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.020
 and then I continue with the second layer me 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.540
 use the same nail polish and that again 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.010
 I just apply as a second layer 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.710
 my nails 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:29.250
 So we have a nice smooth silver base 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:31.470
 and then I let it dry for a while 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.910
 in it is thijs I send a figurine 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.910
 selfie vs nexit 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.840
 then comes the tricky part he 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.759
 applies a top coat on one nail per 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.190
 once you get your glitter and that 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.440
 chrono threw that becomes strange and tender 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.789
 lots but paper than our background 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.789
 you can easily clean up again 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:10.780
 then you grab it know top coat good weather 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.240
 put your glitter on top and then tap 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.690
 nail off so that most of the watering can 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.560
 well 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:25.230
 off again and you do this at all 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.230
 just tap nails well 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.720
 and then I press all the glitters 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.210
 through the cautious another fingers 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.800
 actually pushing so that you get the 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.800
 glitter nail polish well in your 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.640
 and for the other hand do of course 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.020
 the same nail per nail but then throw 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.450
 I no longer have the glitter over it 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.340
 but I used glitter that I already have 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.260
 sprinkled it is I grab that between two 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.980
 fingers up and scatters like that 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.330
 my nail one 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.010
 that saves a lot of glitter 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.130
 a lot of clothes so that is 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.130
 handy 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.310
 and if all the grid is completely right 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.829
 I bring up an extra layer 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.900
 topcoat so the guide also 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.879
 sit well because that would be a shame 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.109
 if you are with half glittery 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.450
 next to arrive at 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.129
 old and new or whatever so just one 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.230
 extra layer of topcoat leaves it well 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.489
 dry and when you are ready, grab one 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.040
 brush and you wipe whole 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.659
 easily remove all other glitter from you 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.159
 hands and fingers 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.719
 you can use the other glitter again 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.250
 then back in the jar like me here 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.469
 do it 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.349
 half went wrong but yes 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:40.599
 you understand the idea and then you have 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.159
 as a result one the beautiful glittery 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.750
 nails you can do it anyway 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.730
 color glitter do not half per sÃ© with 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.680
 silver thank you so much for looking 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.680
 and see you next time
