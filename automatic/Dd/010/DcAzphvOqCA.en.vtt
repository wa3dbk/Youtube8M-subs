hi<00:00:02.610> Sonia<00:00:03.179> from<00:00:03.360> 49<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:03.840> we<00:00:04.110> are<00:00:04.200> at<00:00:04.319> Google

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
hi Sonia from 49 and we are at Google

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.130 
hi Sonia from 49 and we are at Google
i/o<00:00:04.770> 2014<00:00:05.400> we<00:00:06.390> will<00:00:06.509> be<00:00:06.629> comparing<00:00:06.899> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
i/o 2014 we will be comparing the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.020 
i/o 2014 we will be comparing the
Motorola<00:00:07.560> MOTO<00:00:07.830> 360<00:00:08.370> which<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.760> kickass

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
Motorola MOTO 360 which is a kickass

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.700 
Motorola MOTO 360 which is a kickass
smart<00:00:09.420> words<00:00:09.570> coming<00:00:09.900> out<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:09.990> Motorola<00:00:10.469> and

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
smart words coming out of Motorola and

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.070 
smart words coming out of Motorola and
to<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.490> qualcomm<00:00:11.880> toq<00:00:12.120> which<00:00:12.719> came<00:00:12.900> out<00:00:13.019> last

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
to the qualcomm toq which came out last

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.700 
to the qualcomm toq which came out last
year<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:14.330> it's<00:00:15.330> kind<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.870> similar<00:00:16.109> devices<00:00:16.470> in

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
year so it's kind of similar devices in

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.500 
year so it's kind of similar devices in
from<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> hardware<00:00:17.190> standpoint<00:00:18.180> large

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
from the hardware standpoint large

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.670 
from the hardware standpoint large
screens<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.470> both<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> touch<00:00:20.369> screens<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
screens and both a touch screens and

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.670 
screens and both a touch screens and
huge<00:00:22.680> dials<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.630> qualcomm<00:00:25.050> toq<00:00:25.260> uses<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
huge dials so the qualcomm toq uses the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.500 
huge dials so the qualcomm toq uses the
mirrors<00:00:25.800> for<00:00:26.070> display<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.300> it's

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
mirrors for display as you can see it's

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.060 
mirrors for display as you can see it's
