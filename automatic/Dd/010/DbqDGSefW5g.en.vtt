you can play the same common ok there
are<00:00:33.320> infinite<00:00:33.800> possibilities<00:00:34.300> well<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:35.600> our

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
are infinite possibilities well so our

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:44.490 
are infinite possibilities well so our
aim<00:00:36.110> is<00:00:38.079> study<00:00:39.940> one<00:00:40.940> method<00:00:41.420> that<00:00:42.110> is<00:00:42.380> going<00:00:42.649> to

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
aim is study one method that is going to

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.120 
aim is study one method that is going to
hello<00:00:45.500> that<00:00:46.160> we<00:00:46.510> create<00:00:47.510> our<00:00:47.720> own<00:00:48.050> cause<00:00:48.440> well

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
hello that we create our own cause well

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.229 
hello that we create our own cause well
for<00:00:49.520> example<00:00:49.880> i<00:00:50.059> am<00:00:50.840> not<00:00:51.380> going<00:00:52.309> to<00:00:52.760> play<00:00:52.940> on

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
for example i am not going to play on

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.639 
for example i am not going to play on
with<00:00:53.450> the<00:00:53.510> imam<00:00:55.300> abu<00:00:56.300> selena<00:00:57.670> chemical<00:00:58.670> coffee

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
with the imam abu selena chemical coffee

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.910 
with the imam abu selena chemical coffee
and<00:01:00.649> we<00:01:01.280> are<00:01:01.399> at<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.510> end<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:03.110> result<00:01:03.290> can<00:01:03.860> be

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
and we are at the end the result can be

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.359 
and we are at the end the result can be
monogamous<00:01:04.670> well<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.049> our<00:01:06.350> end<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:06.950> going<00:01:07.249> to

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
monogamous well so our end is going to

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.580 
monogamous well so our end is going to
be<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.549> study<00:01:07.939> the<00:01:08.600> different<00:01:08.749> parts<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.469> the

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
be a study the different parts of the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.879 
be a study the different parts of the
neck<00:01:09.859> and<00:01:10.159> telling<00:01:10.789> to<00:01:10.909> emulate<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.889> new

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:12.889 
neck and telling to emulate the new

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:15.069 
neck and telling to emulate the new

encoder they are playing all along the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.149 
encoder they are playing all along the
neck<00:01:18.590> not<00:01:19.069> we<00:01:19.700> are<00:01:19.819> not<00:01:20.439> we<00:01:21.439> are<00:01:21.469> not<00:01:21.709> always

going<00:01:22.729> pretty<00:01:23.090> like<00:01:23.420> 70<00:01:24.079> or<00:01:24.229> 80<00:01:24.469> years<00:01:24.889> ago

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
going pretty like 70 or 80 years ago

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.569 
going pretty like 70 or 80 years ago
always<00:01:25.639> in<00:01:25.999> this<00:01:26.299> part<00:01:26.869> of<00:01:27.079> the<00:01:27.139> neck<00:01:27.490> we<00:01:28.490> are

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
always in this part of the neck we are

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.120 
always in this part of the neck we are
going<00:01:28.819> to<00:01:28.969> investigate<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.990> neck<00:01:30.200> we<00:01:30.770> have<00:01:30.979> to

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130
