your own wicks an html5 which is pretty
amazing<00:02:42.370> depending<00:02:43.370> on<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.669> network

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
amazing depending on the network

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.619 
amazing depending on the network
connections<00:02:44.689> it<00:02:45.200> may<00:02:45.349> be<00:02:45.409> fast<00:02:45.769> may<00:02:46.010> be<00:02:46.069> slow

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
connections it may be fast may be slow

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.750 
connections it may be fast may be slow
sometimes<00:02:47.629> it<00:02:48.319> takes<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.650> little<00:02:48.799> time<00:02:49.099> for<00:02:49.430> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
sometimes it takes a little time for the

depending on the content but this may

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.979 
depending on the content but this may
also<00:02:56.510> be<00:02:56.900> because<00:02:57.349> I<00:02:57.849> have<00:02:58.849> other<00:02:59.269> things

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989

your network pretty much reduce all the

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.409 
your network pretty much reduce all the
content<00:03:22.220> levels<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:22.669> you<00:03:22.849> have<00:03:23.030> on<00:03:23.239> other

content levels that you have on other
sections<00:03:24.139> which<00:03:25.069> I'll<00:03:25.400> take<00:03:25.729> this<00:03:25.940> one<00:03:26.000> out

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
sections which I'll take this one out

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.360 
sections which I'll take this one out
and<00:03:26.540> I'll<00:03:27.319> leave<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:27.650> one<00:03:27.829> up<00:03:27.889> because<00:03:28.129> this

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
and I'll leave this one up because this

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.520 
and I'll leave this one up because this
is<00:03:28.549> my<00:03:28.729> hub<00:03:28.939> that<00:03:29.150> I'm<00:03:29.329> building<00:03:32.079> let's<00:03:33.079> see<00:03:33.319> I

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
is my hub that I'm building let's see I

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.559 
is my hub that I'm building let's see I
don't<00:03:34.040> see<00:03:34.220> anything<00:03:34.549> else<00:03:34.849> I<00:03:35.000> think<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.389> is

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
don't see anything else I think this is

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.909 
don't see anything else I think this is
the<00:03:35.810> actual<00:03:37.419> template<00:03:38.419> so<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:38.930> just<00:03:39.139> click

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
the actual template so you just click

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.390 
the actual template so you just click
the<00:03:40.509> different<00:03:41.509> icon<00:03:41.900> tabs<00:03:42.229> and<00:03:42.590> you<00:03:43.069> can<00:03:43.250> move

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
the different icon tabs and you can move

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.469 
the different icon tabs and you can move
around<00:03:43.549> it<00:03:44.139> like<00:03:45.139> so<00:03:46.000> just<00:03:47.000> like<00:03:47.180> any<00:03:47.389> other

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.550 

the<00:03:51.970> content<00:03:52.420> takes<00:03:52.630> a<00:03:52.780> little<00:03:52.900> time<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.230> load

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
the content takes a little time to load

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.930 
the content takes a little time to load
like<00:03:53.800> I<00:03:53.950> said<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.630> since<00:03:55.630> I'm<00:03:55.780> using<00:03:55.990> this

screen<00:03:57.940> recorder<00:03:58.690> tool<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.200> may<00:03:59.380> take<00:03:59.620> even

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
screen recorder tool it may take even

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.150 
screen recorder tool it may take even
more<00:03:59.980> time<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.540> bear<00:04:02.380> with<00:04:02.410> it<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:04.300> just<00:04:04.570> a

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160
