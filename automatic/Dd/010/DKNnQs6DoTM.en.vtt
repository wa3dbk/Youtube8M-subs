today<00:06:24.829> we<00:06:25.159> were<00:06:25.279> looking<00:06:25.669> at<00:06:25.819> atom<00:06:26.419> and<00:06:26.629> I'll

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
today we were looking at atom and I'll

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:36.460 
today we were looking at atom and I'll
see<00:06:27.529> you<00:06:27.619> guys<00:06:27.649> next<00:06:27.829> time
