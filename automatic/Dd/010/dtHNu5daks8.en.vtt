and about what how old do they how old

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.380 
and about what how old do they how old
does<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:52.960> take<00:00:53.110> before<00:00:53.140> they<00:00:53.590> start<00:00:53.860> fruiting

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
does it take before they start fruiting

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.450 
does it take before they start fruiting
typically<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.630> plants<00:00:56.050> usually<00:00:56.830> reaches<00:00:57.250> 5

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
typically the plants usually reaches 5

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.490 
typically the plants usually reaches 5
or<00:00:57.610> 6<00:00:57.850> feet<00:00:58.090> in<00:00:58.360> about<00:00:58.630> 3<00:00:58.930> years<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.410> that's

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
or 6 feet in about 3 years and that's

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.440 
or 6 feet in about 3 years and that's
about<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.830> time<00:01:00.130> when<00:01:00.340> it<00:01:00.460> starts<00:01:00.880> the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
about the time when it starts the

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.300 
about the time when it starts the
tell-tale<00:01:01.690> sign<00:01:02.200> is<00:01:02.440> what<00:01:02.650> it<00:01:02.800> starts<00:01:03.160> going

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
tell-tale sign is what it starts going

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.560 
tell-tale sign is what it starts going
from<00:01:03.610> a<00:01:03.700> straight<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.850> then<00:01:06.970> branches<00:01:07.390> at<00:01:07.540> the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
from a straight and then branches at the

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.060 
from a straight and then branches at the
top<00:01:07.840> at<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.200> point<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.590> reaches<00:01:08.920> maturity

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
top at that point it reaches maturity

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.310 
top at that point it reaches maturity
and<00:01:09.610> then<00:01:09.940> you<00:01:10.119> start<00:01:10.390> pruning<00:01:10.660> off<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.140> lower

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
and then you start pruning off the lower

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.490 
and then you start pruning off the lower
leaves<00:01:11.530> any<00:01:12.040> branches<00:01:12.760> and<00:01:13.330> uh<00:01:13.600> fruits<00:01:14.050> how

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
leaves any branches and uh fruits how

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.290 
leaves any branches and uh fruits how
much<00:01:14.920> space<00:01:15.220> would<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:15.520> need<00:01:15.670> in<00:01:15.970> my<00:01:16.090> backyard

kind how much how many pounds of seeds
we<00:03:27.769> could<00:03:27.950> get<00:03:28.099> out<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.459> one<00:03:28.700> tree<00:03:29.000> as<00:03:29.299> a

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
we could get out of one tree as a

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.280 
we could get out of one tree as a
typical<00:03:29.840> yield<00:03:30.470> out<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.459> one<00:03:31.790> tree<00:03:32.290> actually

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.500 
typical yield out of one tree actually
it'll<00:03:33.799> be<00:03:33.980> less<00:03:34.280> than<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.549> pound<00:03:34.760> it's<00:03:35.299> gonna

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
it'll be less than a pound it's gonna

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.220 
it'll be less than a pound it's gonna
take

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
take

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.309 
take
you'll<00:03:36.950> get<00:03:37.069> anywhere<00:03:37.459> from<00:03:37.519> 30<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.360> 60<00:03:38.510> seeds

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
you'll get anywhere from 30 to 60 seeds

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.710 
you'll get anywhere from 30 to 60 seeds
per<00:03:40.129> pod<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.810> it'll<00:03:41.810> take<00:03:42.140> somewhere<00:03:42.950> around

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
per pod and it'll take somewhere around

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.369 
per pod and it'll take somewhere around
500<00:03:44.720> or<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.109> to<00:03:45.950> make<00:03:46.129> a<00:03:46.160> pound<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.579> chocolate

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
500 or so to make a pound of chocolate

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.140 
500 or so to make a pound of chocolate
so<00:03:48.379> it<00:03:48.500> is<00:03:48.650> possible<00:03:48.890> but<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.430> have<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.910> really

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
so it is possible but you have to really

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.300 
so it is possible but you have to really
be<00:03:50.329> you<00:03:50.930> have<00:03:51.049> to<00:03:51.170> love<00:03:51.379> it<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.560> way<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.829> do<00:03:51.980> in

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
be you have to love it the way I do in

be you have to love it the way I do in
order<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.549> get<00:03:53.390> a<00:03:53.480> lot<00:03:53.660> of<00:03:53.810> chocolate<00:03:54.319> got<00:03:54.470> two

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
order to get a lot of chocolate got two

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.259 
order to get a lot of chocolate got two
or<00:03:54.769> three<00:03:54.799> trees<00:03:55.280> we're<00:03:55.549> probably<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:56.150> order

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
or three trees we're probably in order

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.930 
or three trees we're probably in order
to<00:03:56.510> get<00:03:56.660> one<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.079> two<00:03:57.140> pounds<00:03:57.940> consistently

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
to get one to two pounds consistently

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.180 
to get one to two pounds consistently
it'll<00:03:59.359> take<00:03:59.510> about<00:03:59.930> 10<00:04:00.290> pods<00:04:00.530> in<00:04:00.769> order<00:04:01.010> for

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
it'll take about 10 pods in order for

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.220 
it'll take about 10 pods in order for
you<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.370> have<00:04:01.400> enough<00:04:01.730> seeds<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.810> work<00:04:02.989> with

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
you to have enough seeds to work with

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.500 
you to have enough seeds to work with
now<00:04:03.769> now<00:04:04.129> these<00:04:04.280> are<00:04:04.459> a<00:04:04.489> tropical<00:04:05.060> plant<00:04:05.239> so

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
now now these are a tropical plant so

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.879 
now now these are a tropical plant so
they're<00:04:05.660> not<00:04:05.930> gonna<00:04:06.079> be<00:04:06.200> able<00:04:06.319> to<00:04:06.470> handle<00:04:06.769> a

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
they're not gonna be able to handle a

they're not gonna be able to handle a
freeze<00:04:07.130> at<00:04:07.370> all<00:04:07.489> do<00:04:07.700> you<00:04:07.730> know<00:04:07.940> like<00:04:08.450> what<00:04:09.440> is

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
freeze at all do you know like what is

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.659 
freeze at all do you know like what is
the<00:04:09.680> lowest<00:04:09.950> temperature<00:04:10.099> that<00:04:10.549> they're

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
the lowest temperature that they're

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.010 
the lowest temperature that they're
going<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:10.849> be<00:04:10.970> able<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.269> withstand<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.959> still

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
going to be able to withstand and still

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.400 
going to be able to withstand and still
ideally<00:04:13.980> as<00:04:14.340> far<00:04:14.660> they<00:04:15.660> could<00:04:15.840> take<00:04:15.990> probably

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
ideally as far they could take probably

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.160 
ideally as far they could take probably
down<00:04:16.620> into<00:04:16.920> 40s<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:18.330> live<00:04:18.660> if<00:04:18.959> you're

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
down into 40s and live if you're

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.470 
down into 40s and live if you're
encouraging<00:04:20.010> fruit<00:04:20.430> you're<00:04:21.030> gonna<00:04:21.120> have<00:04:21.360> to

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
encouraging fruit you're gonna have to

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.240 
encouraging fruit you're gonna have to
maintain<00:04:21.870> at<00:04:22.020> least<00:04:22.080> sixty<00:04:22.560> degrees<00:04:23.010> that

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
maintain at least sixty degrees that

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.800 
maintain at least sixty degrees that
have<00:04:23.430> been<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.580> moment<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.210> very<00:04:24.480> little<00:04:24.660> of

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
have been a moment and very little of

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.930 
have been a moment and very little of
that<00:04:24.870> impossible<00:04:25.710> so<00:04:26.520> you're<00:04:26.610> gonna<00:04:26.730> have<00:04:26.880> to

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
that impossible so you're gonna have to

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.180 
that impossible so you're gonna have to
keep<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.270> nice<00:04:27.420> warm<00:04:27.780> yeah<00:04:28.080> yeah<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:28.860> don't<00:04:29.070> have

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
keep a nice warm yeah yeah I don't have

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.410 
keep a nice warm yeah yeah I don't have
to<00:04:29.310> be<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.430> temperature<00:04:29.850> control<00:04:30.210> greenhouse

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
to be a temperature control greenhouse

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.370 
to be a temperature control greenhouse
and<00:04:30.900> be<00:04:31.230> able<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.590> wait<00:04:32.340> till<00:04:32.580> morning<00:04:32.990> now<00:04:33.990> the

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
and be able to wait till morning now the

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.810 
and be able to wait till morning now the
one<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.860> whole<00:04:35.010> things<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.430> got<00:04:35.550> me<00:04:35.670> so

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
one of the whole things that got me so

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.340 
one of the whole things that got me so
inspired<00:04:36.210> about<00:04:36.360> this<00:04:36.630> was<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:37.020> was<00:04:37.200> in

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
inspired about this was I was in

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.680 
inspired about this was I was in
Washington<00:04:37.500> DC<00:04:38.070> at<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.880> National<00:04:39.570> Botanical

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
Washington DC at the National Botanical

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.390 
Washington DC at the National Botanical
Garden<00:04:40.440> something<00:04:40.710> this<00:04:40.890> gigantic

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
Garden something this gigantic

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.040 
Garden something this gigantic
greenhouse<00:04:41.910> right<00:04:42.210> when<00:04:42.540> you<00:04:42.600> walk<00:04:42.780> in

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
greenhouse right when you walk in

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.460 
greenhouse right when you walk in
there's<00:04:43.290> a<00:04:43.490> 25-foot<00:04:44.690> fruiting<00:04:45.690> cacao<00:04:46.140> tree

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
there's a 25-foot fruiting cacao tree

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.520 
there's a 25-foot fruiting cacao tree
there<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.690> I<00:04:48.810> don't<00:04:48.870> believe<00:04:49.230> they

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
there and so it and I don't believe they

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.020 
there and so it and I don't believe they
were<00:04:49.590> using<00:04:49.830> grow<00:04:50.070> lights<00:04:50.310> so<00:04:50.550> it<00:04:50.670> looks<00:04:50.940> like

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
were using grow lights so it looks like

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.760 
were using grow lights so it looks like
you<00:04:51.270> can<00:04:51.420> you'll<00:04:51.690> have<00:04:51.870> enough<00:04:52.140> sunlight<00:04:52.410> for

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
you can you'll have enough sunlight for

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.950 
you can you'll have enough sunlight for
them<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:53.010> fruit<00:04:53.250> at<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:54.030> latitude<00:04:54.540> of

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
them to fruit at the latitude of

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.800 
them to fruit at the latitude of
Washington<00:04:55.920> DC<00:04:56.280> which<00:04:56.580> is<00:04:56.730> about<00:04:57.000> Kansas<00:04:57.600> City

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
Washington DC which is about Kansas City

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.540 
Washington DC which is about Kansas City
and<00:04:57.990> Sacramento<00:04:58.680> across<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.190> United<00:04:59.520> States

and Sacramento across the United States

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.850 
and Sacramento across the United States
do<00:05:00.480> you<00:05:00.570> know<00:05:00.720> how<00:05:00.990> much<00:05:01.170> further<00:05:01.440> north<00:05:01.740> that

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
do you know how much further north that

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.070 
do you know how much further north that
would<00:05:02.130> go<00:05:02.250> or<00:05:02.490> is<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.730> just<00:05:02.900> something<00:05:03.900> gonna

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
would go or is that just something gonna

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.140 
would go or is that just something gonna
have<00:05:04.260> to<00:05:04.350> experimentally<00:05:04.650> yes<00:05:05.430> but<00:05:05.910> basically

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
have to experimentally yes but basically

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.720 
have to experimentally yes but basically
because<00:05:06.600> look<00:05:06.840> at<00:05:07.100> how<00:05:08.100> they<00:05:08.250> grow<00:05:08.430> in<00:05:08.610> nature

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
because look at how they grow in nature

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.410 
because look at how they grow in nature
they're<00:05:09.570> an<00:05:09.780> understory<00:05:10.260> plant<00:05:11.420> where

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
they're an understory plant where

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.270

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
chocolate they're usually shaded with

chocolate they're usually shaded with
other<00:05:16.290> types<00:05:16.650> trees<00:05:17.100> so<00:05:17.580> they<00:05:17.730> don't<00:05:17.880> get<00:05:17.970> the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
other types trees so they don't get the

other types trees so they don't get the
full<00:05:18.270> brunt<00:05:18.480> of<00:05:18.600> tropical<00:05:19.140> Sun<00:05:19.380> so<00:05:20.040> diffuse

full brunt of tropical Sun so diffuse
light<00:05:20.730> is<00:05:20.940> fine<00:05:21.920> so<00:05:22.920> they<00:05:23.040> may<00:05:23.220> do<00:05:23.280> well<00:05:23.610> even

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
light is fine so they may do well even
