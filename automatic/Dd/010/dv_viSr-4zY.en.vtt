00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.830
 therefore we read on all the headings of it 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:17.620
 let's take a republic for example 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.430
 heavy against Verona from 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.279
 part of whom of the tosel judge 40 thousand 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.590
 euro fine for having his reads 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.750
 supporters during the race against 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.730
 the milan launched six smoke bombs in the 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.100
 gaming fence to also have towards 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.230
 the end of the race addressed some 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.300
 laser light beams towards the arbiter ei 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.160
 players of the opposing team e 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.110
 to finally have the conclusion of 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.270
 race while the public flowed from 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.860
 bentegodi stage launched objects of 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.390
 various nature and some seats in 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.329
 plastic wrecked towards supporters 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.930
 of the opposing team without 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.570
 injurious consequences 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.579
 hellas verona we are not there with the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.579
 general manager giovanni gambini 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:03.090
 evening director of the di 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:06.430
 why the clear listener? 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.820
 we believe in the light of what appears to 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.830
 we at the moment without having read 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.310
 still the official documents issued 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.760
 by the race director or staff 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.570
 of the federal prosecutor's office that he threw to 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:26.400
 say little music in the entity than not 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.110
 it seems to us that it is commensurate with the facts 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.110
 really happened 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.020
 it seems to me that there was all that 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.640
 that the aforementioned young man is asked 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.790
 in the legislative decision that 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.620
 however let's not forget it exercises 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.590
 a function based on what you 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.630
 is written by the race director e 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.270
 of the attorneys who are 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.830
 complete the merit and everything 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.960
 what happens inside 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.400
 assimilate Cagliari occupies 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.490
 we have clearly already requested 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.430
 to the league to the federation 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.110
 the documents to understand the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:09.250
 reasons that led to this 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.520
 ugly so dropped after that anyway 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.380
 we are going to expose our reasons 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.710
 through the appeal that puts us in 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:24.630
 condition of being able to give our own 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:27.970
 motivations and ours and to exonerate 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.360
 here I do not ask you to win because 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.600
 obviously there will be a procedure though 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.610
 you believe you can have weapons but 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.220
 beyond weapons we believe in 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.620
 justice and we believe that anyway 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.260
 beyond what he presumably is 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.710
 given to know the state of things the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.350
 fine in its entity is somewhat in 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:58.030
 how much was the number proposed? 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:02.530
 because we believe the 40,000 euro a ta 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:08.950
 big part of the cock is that not 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:11.350
 be motivated all this I connect 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.450
 I was a very thorough manager myself 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.650
 I always talk about a judge 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.780
 sports because the Verona will go to Rome 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.090
 with a stage in a situation 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.300
 quite surreal there will be a sector 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.540
 presumably the warmest one that 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.840
 it will be empty, something that of those who do 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.760
 football knows who vc played to those who do the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.050
 executive c is who is a told al 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.120
 work 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.870
 I believe he would never want to see why 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.660
 they are situations that hurt everything 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.470
 the system to the whole soccer world 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.180
 too much if he decides so of this type there 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.220
 is part of the motivations of though 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.980
 bad things they shouldn't 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.050
 occur and that above all instead of 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.900
 bring people together young families 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.540
 guys at soccer definitely yes 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.330
 away they move away I am more 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.370
 for prevention than for 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.980
 repression regardless of the fact that 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.830
 I don't know what he has 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.630
 determined the closure of the sector 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.780
 in Rome indicate in few judgments 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.430
 final 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.120
 but a bad thing a stadium always 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.120
 a part of the public 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.250
 last thing and then I let it go e 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.050
 director talked about approaching the 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.820
 people in the stadium you in this sense 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.490
 what did you do network reopened the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.470
 season ticket campaign for example yes 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.150
 we reopened we will keep it open up 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.340
 on the eve of the match with the 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.350
 stony because we believe ours 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.500
 many parents who have been close 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.700
 during underwriting almost sicily 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:52.930
 weaving for hunters 4 million 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.090
 euros should be rewarded and therefore 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.820
 since the possibility of seeing 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.610
 instead of 19 18 games with the card 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.860
 yes in equal advantages which is granted i 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.860
 our to our fans we believe that 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.540
 it is right to give the opportunity in the case 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.650
 the thread with sex without writing anything else 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.390
 yet 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.910
 the subscription is from yesterday there was one 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:17.110
 part today will continue and we will say to the 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.270
 eve of the thank you game e 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.340
 I wish you a good continuation of a good 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.340
 work for the general manager of Verona 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.730
 giovanni gardini thanks to you and to understand 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.730
 to the spectators
