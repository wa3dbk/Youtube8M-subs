slides I degrees in the corner should be

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.920 
slides I degrees in the corner should be
the<00:02:27.570> best<00:02:27.810> spot<00:02:28.610> but<00:02:29.610> since<00:02:30.030> I'm<00:02:30.300> deciding<00:02:30.720> to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the best spot but since I'm deciding to

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.150 
the best spot but since I'm deciding to
just<00:02:31.530> don't<00:02:31.800> have<00:02:31.890> enough<00:02:31.980> room<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.460> put<00:02:34.160> both

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160

just don't have enough room to put both
on<00:02:36.150> both<00:02:36.630> caves<00:02:36.990> on<00:02:37.200> each<00:02:37.320> side<00:02:38.210> actually<00:02:39.210> I

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
on both caves on each side actually I

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.680 
on both caves on each side actually I
guess<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.540> did<00:02:39.780> hey<00:02:41.120> I'm<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:42.300> going<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.480> try<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
i guess i'll just stick isn't back don't

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.190 
i guess i'll just stick isn't back don't
know<00:02:54.120> why<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.330> really<00:02:54.600> should<00:02:54.810> sing<00:02:55.020> in<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
know why you really should sing in the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.340 
know why you really should sing in the
front<00:02:55.550> but<00:02:56.550> i'm<00:02:57.510> just<00:02:57.750> going<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.960> stick<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.290> the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
front but i'm just going to stick in the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.650 
front but i'm just going to stick in the
back<00:02:58.530> from<00:02:58.710> now<00:03:01.730> yeah<00:03:02.730> that's<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.030> high<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.630> i

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
back from now yeah that's the high so i

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.170 
back from now yeah that's the high so i
guess<00:03:04.020> they<00:03:05.010> can't<00:03:05.160> zoom<00:03:05.400> lens<00:03:05.640> drink<00:03:06.000> and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
guess they can't zoom lens drink and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.280 
guess they can't zoom lens drink and
you'll<00:03:06.330> probably<00:03:06.540> feel<00:03:06.720> safer<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.960> I'm<00:03:09.960> not
