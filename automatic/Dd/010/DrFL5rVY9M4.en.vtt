don't break on you so we've broken a few
jars<00:02:19.210> here<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.660> think<00:02:20.440> you're<00:02:20.530> getting<00:02:20.620> stages

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
jars here I think you're getting stages

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.210 
jars here I think you're getting stages
so<00:02:21.700> first<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.180> all<00:02:22.209> I'll<00:02:22.420> put<00:02:22.600> hot<00:02:22.750> water<00:02:22.780> on<00:02:23.080> it

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
so first of all I'll put hot water on it

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.949 
so first of all I'll put hot water on it
to<00:02:24.220> warm<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.490> up<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:28.030> what<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> need<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> scale

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
to warm it up so what I need is a scale

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.520 
to warm it up so what I need is a scale
so<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:29.830> can<00:02:30.130> weigh<00:02:30.580> out<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.110> nettle<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.290> mean

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
so I can weigh out the nettle I mean

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.690 
so I can weigh out the nettle I mean

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
for it to set here great so that's one

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.460 
for it to set here great so that's one
point<00:02:56.769> one<00:02:57.300> basically<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.930> then<00:03:05.080> just<00:03:05.260> pour

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
point one basically and then just pour

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:23.430 
point one basically and then just pour
about<00:03:05.709> an<00:03:05.800> ounce<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:06.550> here

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
you know so that's two point one so of

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.050 
you know so that's two point one so of
course<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:27.280> want<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.460> make<00:03:27.580> sure<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.790> seal

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
course you want to make sure you seal

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.120 
course you want to make sure you seal
the<00:03:28.210> bag<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:28.660> that<00:03:28.690> way<00:03:28.960> it<00:03:29.080> doesn't<00:03:29.290> it

the bag so that way it doesn't it

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.530 
the bag so that way it doesn't it
doesn't<00:03:30.340> get<00:03:30.580> moisture<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.090> there<00:03:31.240> you<00:03:31.450> know

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
doesn't get moisture in there you know

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.390 
doesn't get moisture in there you know
because<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.900> will<00:03:32.050> lose<00:03:32.230> some<00:03:32.770> nutrients<00:03:33.250> and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.010 
because you will lose some nutrients and
you<00:03:33.610> don't<00:03:33.730> want<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:33.880> build<00:03:34.420> herb<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.870> spoil

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
you don't want to build herb to spoil

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.780 
you don't want to build herb to spoil
metal<00:03:38.020> left<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.380> enough<00:03:38.590> metal<00:03:39.280> left<00:03:39.400> in<00:03:39.730> a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
metal left and enough metal left in a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.520 
metal left and enough metal left in a
moist<00:03:40.060> environment<00:03:40.210> will<00:03:40.780> spoil<00:03:41.110> over<00:03:41.350> time

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
moist environment will spoil over time

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:51.920 
moist environment will spoil over time
so<00:03:41.710> you<00:03:41.800> want<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:41.980> make<00:03:42.070> sure<00:03:42.100> you<00:03:42.280> seal<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:42.640> up

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.050 

here<00:03:52.930> we<00:03:52.990> go<00:03:53.080> I<00:03:53.110> have<00:03:53.200> an<00:03:53.320> ounce<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:54.790> nettle

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
here we go I have an ounce of the nettle

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.460 
here we go I have an ounce of the nettle
all<00:03:55.660> right<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:55.960> let's<00:03:56.110> see

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
all right so let's see

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.740 
all right so let's see
pretty<00:03:57.370> simple<00:03:57.580> seeds<00:03:57.850> nettle<00:03:58.120> leaf<00:03:58.270> right<00:03:58.570> so

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
pretty simple seeds nettle leaf right so

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.060 
pretty simple seeds nettle leaf right so
it's<00:03:58.870> all<00:03:58.990> dehydrated<00:03:59.620> right<00:03:59.710> so<00:03:59.860> that's<00:03:59.950> the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
it's all dehydrated right so that's the

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.320 
it's all dehydrated right so that's the
nice<00:04:00.160> part<00:04:00.400> about<00:04:00.430> ordering<00:04:00.790> at<00:04:00.940> these<00:04:01.090> bags

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
nice part about ordering at these bags

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.420 
nice part about ordering at these bags
is<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.570> you<00:04:01.780> get<00:04:01.960> it<00:04:02.220> dehydrated<00:04:03.220> and

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
is that you get it dehydrated and

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.250 
is that you get it dehydrated and
already<00:04:03.700> prepared<00:04:04.090> otherwise<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.110> have<00:04:05.230> to

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
already prepared otherwise you have to

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.780 
already prepared otherwise you have to
hang<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.620> individually<00:04:06.160> in<00:04:06.220> your<00:04:06.310> house<00:04:06.490> and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
hang it individually in your house and

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.120 
hang it individually in your house and
it<00:04:06.910> would<00:04:07.120> take<00:04:07.270> quite<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.510> bit<00:04:07.660> of<00:04:07.810> work

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
it would take quite a bit of work

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.890 
it would take quite a bit of work
manually<00:04:09.130> speaking<00:04:09.670> so<00:04:09.850> it's<00:04:10.600> kind<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.780> nice

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
manually speaking so it's kind of nice

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:19.950 
manually speaking so it's kind of nice
to<00:04:11.050> do<00:04:11.140> this<00:04:11.350> way

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:19.960 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.810 

so<00:04:20.960> I<00:04:20.990> already<00:04:21.140> have<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:22.340> know<00:04:22.460> my<00:04:22.610> jar

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
so I already have you know my jar

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.360 
so I already have you know my jar
preheated<00:04:23.420> so<00:04:23.480> it's<00:04:23.600> nice<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:23.780> warm<00:04:24.140> right<00:04:24.380> so

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
preheated so it's nice and warm right so

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.480 
preheated so it's nice and warm right so
then<00:04:25.490> I<00:04:25.580> put<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.850> metal<00:04:26.300> in

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.890 

can<00:04:32.090> have<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.240> spoon<00:04:32.480> to<00:04:32.630> stir<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:32.930> around<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:35.690> I

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
can have a spoon to stir it around and I

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.250 
can have a spoon to stir it around and I
just<00:04:36.080> have<00:04:36.170> to<00:04:36.200> wait<00:04:36.380> for<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.710> water<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:36.950> boil

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
just have to wait for the water to boil

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.290 
just have to wait for the water to boil
grease<00:04:39.260> so<00:04:40.160> now<00:04:40.280> that<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.490> water's<00:04:40.790> boiling<00:04:40.970> I

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
grease so now that the water's boiling I

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.620 
grease so now that the water's boiling I
just<00:04:41.840> add<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.110> water<00:04:42.260> in<00:04:43.180> simple<00:04:44.180> stuff<00:04:44.389> this

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
just add the water in simple stuff this

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.659 
just add the water in simple stuff this
is<00:04:44.750> like<00:04:44.900> how<00:04:45.889> does<00:04:46.010> sometimes<00:04:46.340> like<00:04:46.550> the

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
is like how does sometimes like the

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.550 
is like how does sometimes like the
simple<00:04:46.970> tutorials<00:04:47.450> on<00:04:47.570> YouTube<00:04:48.110> so<00:04:48.320> that's

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
simple tutorials on YouTube so that's

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.170 
simple tutorials on YouTube so that's
why<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:48.710> go<00:04:48.919> through<00:04:49.100> each<00:04:49.220> step<00:04:49.460> but<00:04:49.669> I'm<00:04:49.790> sure

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
why I go through each step but I'm sure

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.520 
why I go through each step but I'm sure
that<00:04:50.210> most<00:04:50.540> you<00:04:50.660> can<00:04:50.810> figure<00:04:51.020> out<00:04:51.080> how<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.380> do

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
that most you can figure out how to do

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.070 
that most you can figure out how to do
all<00:04:51.710> this<00:04:51.800> stuff<00:04:52.070> by<00:04:52.280> yourself

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
all this stuff by yourself

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.420 
all this stuff by yourself
but<00:04:54.080> anyway<00:04:54.320> yeah<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:54.830> just<00:04:54.950> fill<00:04:55.130> it<00:04:55.220> up<00:04:55.280> all

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
but anyway yeah you just fill it up all

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.040 
but anyway yeah you just fill it up all
the<00:04:55.520> way<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.639> the<00:04:55.790> top<00:04:55.970> enough<00:04:56.810> that<00:04:56.960> it

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
the way to the top enough that it

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.150 
the way to the top enough that it
doesn't<00:04:57.200> spill<00:04:57.470> over<00:04:57.500> but<00:04:57.800> you<00:04:57.860> don't<00:04:58.040> want

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
doesn't spill over but you don't want

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.210 
doesn't spill over but you don't want
any<00:04:58.310> air<00:04:58.580> between<00:04:59.419> that<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.290> lid<00:05:00.500> you

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
any air between that and the lid you

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.620 
any air between that and the lid you
want<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.400> make<00:05:01.520> sure<00:05:01.639> that<00:05:01.820> all<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.360> nettle<00:05:02.570> is

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
want to make sure that all the nettle is

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.120 
want to make sure that all the nettle is
getting<00:05:02.900> soaked<00:05:03.139> right<00:05:03.350> so<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.620> nutrition<00:05:03.890> is

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
getting soaked right so the nutrition is

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.290 
getting soaked right so the nutrition is
coming<00:05:04.370> from<00:05:04.490> all<00:05:04.610> of<00:05:04.700> it<00:05:04.790> so<00:05:04.910> I'm<00:05:05.030> just<00:05:05.150> making

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
coming from all of it so I'm just making

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.760 
coming from all of it so I'm just making
sure<00:05:05.450> all<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.870> nettle<00:05:06.080> is<00:05:06.200> in<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.380> water<00:05:06.530> here

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
sure all the nettle is in the water here

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.570 
sure all the nettle is in the water here
you<00:05:07.490> know<00:05:07.610> that<00:05:07.730> it's<00:05:07.880> all<00:05:07.970> moist<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.390> know

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.480 

great<00:05:14.290> they<00:05:15.290> do<00:05:15.350> is<00:05:15.560> I<00:05:15.680> just<00:05:15.710> sealed<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.250> jar

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
great they do is I just sealed the jar

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.590 
great they do is I just sealed the jar
so<00:05:16.520> you'll<00:05:16.760> get<00:05:16.820> a<00:05:16.880> little<00:05:17.030> bit<00:05:17.180> of<00:05:17.270> spillover

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
so you'll get a little bit of spillover

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.020 
so you'll get a little bit of spillover
sometimes<00:05:18.940> and<00:05:19.940> that's<00:05:20.180> it<00:05:21.700> so<00:05:22.700> here<00:05:22.850> we<00:05:22.910> go

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
sometimes and that's it so here we go

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.850 
sometimes and that's it so here we go
here's<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.330> nettle<00:05:23.630> so<00:05:24.380> you<00:05:24.440> just<00:05:24.590> leave<00:05:24.710> it

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
here's the nettle so you just leave it

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.630 
here's the nettle so you just leave it
sit<00:05:25.100> for<00:05:25.340> four<00:05:25.610> hours<00:05:25.940> or<00:05:26.470> overnight<00:05:27.470> and<00:05:27.830> and

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
sit for four hours or overnight and and

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.150 
sit for four hours or overnight and and
then<00:05:28.940> you<00:05:29.030> strain<00:05:29.300> it<00:05:29.419> from<00:05:29.570> there<00:05:29.979> now<00:05:30.979> that

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
then you strain it from there now that

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.710 
then you strain it from there now that
finished<00:05:31.520> making<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:31.910> infusion<00:05:32.240> I'll<00:05:32.540> let<00:05:32.690> it

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
finished making the infusion I'll let it

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.409 
finished making the infusion I'll let it
sit<00:05:32.990> for<00:05:33.020> four<00:05:33.440> hours<00:05:33.740> or<00:05:33.979> overnight<00:05:34.370> and<00:05:34.729> then

sit for four hours or overnight and then

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:36.880 
sit for four hours or overnight and then
I'll<00:05:35.630> strain<00:05:35.870> it<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.050> next<00:05:36.260> day<00:05:36.380> so<00:05:36.440> I'm<00:05:36.770> going

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
I'll strain it the next day so I'm going

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.170 
I'll strain it the next day so I'm going
to<00:05:36.919> show<00:05:37.040> you<00:05:37.130> some<00:05:37.310> footage<00:05:37.490> of<00:05:37.729> me<00:05:37.820> straining

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
to show you some footage of me straining

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.140 
to show you some footage of me straining
a<00:05:38.240> different<00:05:39.280> infusion<00:05:40.280> that<00:05:40.400> I<00:05:40.460> made<00:05:41.000> the

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
a different infusion that I made the

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.120 
a different infusion that I made the
other<00:05:41.300> day<00:05:41.360> but<00:05:42.229> the<00:05:42.380> principle<00:05:42.770> is<00:05:42.800> exactly

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
other day but the principle is exactly

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.610 
other day but the principle is exactly
the<00:05:43.310> same<00:05:43.520> so<00:05:43.790> I'll<00:05:44.030> show<00:05:44.210> that<00:05:44.240> to<00:05:44.390> you<00:05:44.510> now<00:05:44.620> so

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
the same so I'll show that to you now so

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.500 
the same so I'll show that to you now so
all<00:05:45.710> you<00:05:45.830> do<00:05:45.950> is<00:05:45.979> pour<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.550> infusion<00:05:47.000> into<00:05:47.330> a

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
all you do is pour the infusion into a

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.810 
all you do is pour the infusion into a
container<00:05:47.990> into<00:05:48.979> the<00:05:49.190> strainer<00:05:49.460> itself

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
container into the strainer itself

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.279 
container into the strainer itself
actually<00:05:50.210> as<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.539> strainer<00:05:50.780> is<00:05:50.930> sitting<00:05:51.169> in

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
actually as the strainer is sitting in

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.650 
actually as the strainer is sitting in
the<00:05:51.350> container<00:05:51.650> and<00:05:52.030> of<00:05:53.030> course<00:05:53.360> that

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
the container and of course that

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.240 
the container and of course that
container<00:05:54.050> was<00:05:54.229> a<00:05:54.260> little<00:05:54.440> bit<00:05:54.530> too<00:05:54.620> small<00:05:54.950> so

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
container was a little bit too small so

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.070 
container was a little bit too small so
I<00:05:55.280> kind<00:05:56.210> of<00:05:56.270> spilled<00:05:56.479> a<00:05:56.600> little<00:05:56.660> bit<00:05:56.780> earlier

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
I kind of spilled a little bit earlier

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.210 
I kind of spilled a little bit earlier
and<00:05:57.169> that's<00:05:57.260> why<00:05:57.440> I<00:05:57.470> have<00:05:57.710> another<00:05:57.919> container

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
and that's why I have another container

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.159 
and that's why I have another container
off<00:05:58.430> to<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:58.669> side<00:05:58.850> where<00:05:59.030> I<00:05:59.060> pour<00:05:59.419> it<00:05:59.479> in<00:05:59.600> most

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
off to the side where I pour it in most

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.750 
off to the side where I pour it in most
of<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:00.530> infusion<00:06:01.010> already<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.610> already

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
of the infusion already and already

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.430 
of the infusion already and already
strained<00:06:02.180> most<00:06:02.360> of<00:06:02.479> it<00:06:02.539> but<00:06:03.080> yeah<00:06:03.229> I'm<00:06:03.289> just

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
strained most of it but yeah I'm just

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.750 
strained most of it but yeah I'm just
showing<00:06:03.620> you<00:06:03.650> here<00:06:03.919> you<00:06:04.190> just<00:06:04.370> put<00:06:04.610> it<00:06:04.669> in

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
showing you here you just put it in

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.820 
showing you here you just put it in
there<00:06:04.880> with<00:06:04.910> a<00:06:05.030> spoon<00:06:05.300> pretty<00:06:06.260> simple<00:06:06.650> stuff

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
there with a spoon pretty simple stuff

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.560 
there with a spoon pretty simple stuff
really<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:07.729> then<00:06:07.820> what<00:06:07.970> you<00:06:08.030> do<00:06:08.150> is<00:06:08.240> you<00:06:08.330> pack

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
really and then what you do is you pack

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.750 
really and then what you do is you pack
it<00:06:08.750> down<00:06:08.900> you<00:06:09.200> make<00:06:09.350> sure<00:06:09.530> that<00:06:09.560> you<00:06:09.950> you<00:06:10.520> push

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
it down you make sure that you you push

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.400 
it down you make sure that you you push
it<00:06:10.910> down<00:06:10.940> so<00:06:11.360> you<00:06:11.450> get<00:06:11.600> all<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:11.900> liquid<00:06:12.050> out<00:06:12.260> so

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
it down so you get all the liquid out so

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.779 
it down so you get all the liquid out so
you're<00:06:12.500> getting<00:06:12.710> all<00:06:12.830> the<00:06:12.979> nutrients<00:06:13.430> out<00:06:13.550> of

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
you're getting all the nutrients out of

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.240 
you're getting all the nutrients out of
the<00:06:14.229> out<00:06:15.229> of<00:06:15.410> the<00:06:15.500> herb<00:06:15.650> because<00:06:15.890> that's

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
the out of the herb because that's

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.170 
the out of the herb because that's
that's<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.550> most<00:06:16.669> important<00:06:16.970> thing<00:06:17.090> this

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
most of the liquid out and and that's

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.279 
most of the liquid out and and that's
about<00:06:24.979> it

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
about it

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.420
