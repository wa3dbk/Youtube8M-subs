00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:12.219
 the spiritist moment is in the air 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.120
 the program that brings spiritualism to 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.120
 very close to you 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.440
 the ball 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.890
 once a child of 7 years 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.620
 asked his mother that she was famous 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.989
 tv show host 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.840
 because on the television screen you always 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.260
 appears smiling and happy and at home is 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.510
 always nervous series the mother picks up 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.839
 Surprise answer is because on television 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.120
 I'm paid to smile and the most 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.309
 who quickly asked the mother again 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.949
 When do you want to win to smile? 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.570
 also our house 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.629
 the little girl's question offers us 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.210
 reflection of reasons why not smile at 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.740
 best place in the world that is our home 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.950
 why not give to our treasures 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.330
 most precious the best 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.520
 Have you ever stopped to watch a sprinkler? 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.130
 of grass in operation 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.430
 turning it irrigates all the grass of it 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.750
 back but when we got closer 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.400
 we noticed that the grass that is nearby 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.740
 of the sprinkler is dry 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.470
 the soft grass irrigator that is 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.560
 far from being but can not get wet 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.360
 the grass that is closest 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.390
 will we be acting in our family? 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.439
 similar to the lawn sprinkler if 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.759
 This is the time to change urgently. 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.969
 we find that when a friend comes to 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.329
 Our house we put a smile on our face. 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.189
 we try to be helpful mates 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.420
 We ask how he is what he has. 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.569
 done 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.819
 We are extremely friendly to our 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.159
 face is the very expression of joy and 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.079
 of camaraderie 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.450
 we hit you affectionately on your back 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.079
 we look with respect and friendship in their 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.979
 eyes 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.960
 smile and smile all over our 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.390
 attention during the time that he is 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.370
 with us it 's for him 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.920
 we leave our usual activities 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.180
 we left the newspaper we stopped watching the 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.969
 TV show that we both enjoy 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.969
 finish the conversation the friend needs to go 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:27.019
 away and say goodbye following us it 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.090
 to the door 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.200
 we signed until it disappears 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.750
 in the street 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.689
 now we go back inside our 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.659
 house and for our family as if in a 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:41.510
 magic trick our face closes 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.819
 We are calm, let's read our 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.750
 newspaper in silence and that no one 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.109
 Disturb 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.000
 we become another person next to the 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.609
 friend, we are nice people and 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.989
 smiling with our family we are 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.819
 unfriendly and demanding because it will 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.840
 our loves do not deserve our 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.840
 attention and our affection 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.599
 if you realized you were acting 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.450
 more or less as a sprinkler 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.519
 to review the situation even today 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.640
 while you are with your children your 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.780
 wife your parents are gay 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.700
 Talk matter if the life of them 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.819
 what they do when you're in the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.430
 school at work on the street 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.590
 they are in trouble like 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.650
 to count 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.989
 smile with stories of good content 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.620
 relative facts of their experience and 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.540
 smile mainly hug with affection 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.000
 kiss with love 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.569
 by doing so our house will be transformed 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.719
 in a home and even today we will be more 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.719
 happy 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.040
 safe 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.200
 ae 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.910
 and so we come to the end of yet another 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.910
 spiritist moment until the next program
