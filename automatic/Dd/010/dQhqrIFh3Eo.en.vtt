00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.480
 Hello everyone, today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 I make cauliflower in sauce 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.490
 ingredients are the following cauliflower 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.369
 that previously cooked with water and salt 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.760
 for 10 minutes at medium heat for 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:29.530
 that is how you see a little bit 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:34.330
 then two raw eggs sea ​​salt 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:39.090
 oil white wine half onion parsley 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:42.210
 and two boiled eggs and one garlic 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.680
 the first thing we have songs beat 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.170
 the eggs 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.060
 I recommend that you do it in a 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.550
 container that is a little bit deep like 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.200
 this so that when it comes time to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.200
 cauliflower or simpler 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.619
 in a pan we put a little bit of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.310
 oil just enough to be able to enjoy well the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.180
 good cauliflower we start we take a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:20.240
 cauliflower cogollito we went through 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.240
 flour we remove the excess 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.720
 and we put the egg 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.590
 and that's it 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.590
 we miss it 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.940
 we have to do this with all the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.940
 cauliflower 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.670
 we go to excess 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.110
 we are going around 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.570
 I'm going to be 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.570
 golden by all 80 now maybe 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.030
 we take it out to the bride 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.830
 and we keep laughing the trail of the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.590
 cauliflower 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.920
 well until we have the entire collection 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.920
 made 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.989
 but we already have all the cauliflower fried 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.330
 for in the oil that we have left over 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.330
 we throw the half finite split onion 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.230
 so I know because before 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.470
 while being powerful 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.710
 meanwhile we will go crushing the 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.710
 Garlic 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:47.810
 It is good and the onion is almost 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.140
 garlic and if we incorporate it to the 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.140
 scallions 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.220
 if it is so that it was done a little 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.410
 Be careful not to burn under 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.410
 that does not bitter 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.070
 next 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.660
 we take a little bit of 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.690
 in the urine that we have used to 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.580
 batter the cauliflower 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.120
 a little bit like that 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.120
 we miss it 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.210
 but come on or because life for 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.400
 take away the raw flavor this will make 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.400
 the sauce does not thicken and is more tied 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.120
 we miss 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.120
 a splash of white wine 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.620
 we let the alcohol evaporate 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.250
 You see how the sauce is going 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.620
 and we add a little broth this 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.440
 it's cauliflower broth to collect the 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.160
 cauliflower that saved 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.160
 we miss 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.030
 let's say the sauce 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.820
 we throw a little parsley 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.660
 and this without further blame the fire 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.660
 and we add it 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.569
 to our cauliflower 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.900
 about this 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:59.090
 we keep casting 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.780
 the broth to swallow everything that has 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.780
 the pan was left 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.520
 searching 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:19.629
 and we cover it with water 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.560
 with our sufficient 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.729
 The last thing that we would have left is when 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.880
 is cooking for a little while it would be 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:46.370
 incorporate split cooked eggs 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.000
 then more or less chubby but this 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.000
 we see it again 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:56.360
 at this point we incorporate 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.360
 a cooked boiled egg 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.720
 and we have to try the salt point 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.030
 I 've tried it and it 's a little bland 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.750
 over a little salt 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:14.060
 and now he has to cook over medium heat 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.970
 with 10 minutes enough because the 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.230
 cauliflower we have already caught it before 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.020
 let's wait and then we present a 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.000
 plate 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.550
 Well, here we have the dish 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.210
