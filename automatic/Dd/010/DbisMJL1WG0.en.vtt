metonymy smooth smooth is quick
that's<00:01:26.040> nice<00:01:26.400> through<00:01:26.760> their<00:01:26.970> leather<00:01:27.720> collar

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that's nice through their leather collar

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.970 
that's nice through their leather collar
if<00:01:28.260> that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.190 

stay<00:01:33.980> on<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.400> brakes<00:01:34.610> that's<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.540> best<00:01:35.840> yet

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
stay on the brakes that's the best yet

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.860 
stay on the brakes that's the best yet
brilliant<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:38.030> reason<00:01:38.300> why<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:38.570> was<00:01:38.720> so

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
brilliant the reason why that was so

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.600 
brilliant the reason why that was so
good<00:01:39.080> it<00:01:39.350> was<00:01:39.560> constant<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.130> break<00:01:40.370> all

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
good it was constant on the break all

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.430 
good it was constant on the break all
the<00:01:40.730> time<00:01:40.940> he<00:01:41.480> wasn't<00:01:41.750> on<00:01:41.870> and<00:01:41.990> off<00:01:42.110> does<00:01:42.320> that

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
the time he wasn't on and off does that

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.950 
the time he wasn't on and off does that
make<00:01:42.560> sense<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.370> you<00:01:43.790> can<00:01:43.940> go<00:01:44.060> in<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.240> bit<00:01:44.360> faster

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
make sense so you can go in a bit faster

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.600 
make sense so you can go in a bit faster
and<00:01:45.320> look<00:01:45.470> at<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.680> speed<00:01:45.950> of<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.190> time<00:01:46.430> we've

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
and look at the speed of the time we've

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.790 
and look at the speed of the time we've
caught<00:01:46.820> up<00:01:46.970> on<00:01:47.060> this<00:01:47.210> Ferrari<00:01:47.600> by<00:01:47.870> giving<00:01:48.710> your

don't<00:02:07.090> stay<00:02:07.390> well<00:02:07.630> solve<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.110> be<00:02:08.170> smooth<00:02:08.590> okay

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
don't stay well solve a be smooth okay

decelerating<00:04:45.060> they<00:04:46.060> have<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.330> get<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.480> car

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
decelerating they have to get a car

on<00:04:57.379> the<00:04:57.499> brakes<00:04:57.770> much<00:04:58.280> better<00:04:58.580> with<00:04:58.819> that<00:04:58.939> now

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
on the brakes much better with that now

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.209 
on the brakes much better with that now
down<00:04:59.419> a<00:04:59.449> gear<00:04:59.689> down<00:05:00.469> the<00:05:00.650> guests<00:05:00.919> I<00:05:01.009> haven't

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:01.219

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
was a lot smoother with the way limbs

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.050 
was a lot smoother with the way limbs
and<00:06:01.979> constant<00:06:02.370> radius<00:06:02.639> with<00:06:02.819> the<00:06:02.880> steering

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
and constant radius with the steering

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.689 
and constant radius with the steering
wheel<00:06:03.300> you're<00:06:03.960> smooth<00:06:04.259> just<00:06:04.860> fill<00:06:05.190> up<00:06:05.340> massive

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
wheel you're smooth just fill up massive

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.850 
wheel you're smooth just fill up massive
your<00:06:06.180> smooth<00:06:06.569> with<00:06:06.810> the<00:06:06.840> braking<00:06:07.259> is<00:06:07.380> constant

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
your smooth with the braking is constant

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.740 
your smooth with the braking is constant
and<00:06:07.979> smooth<00:06:08.280> and<00:06:08.520> you<00:06:08.940> master<00:06:09.270> the<00:06:09.389> throttle

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
and smooth and you master the throttle

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.779 
and smooth and you master the throttle
or<00:06:09.900> within<00:06:10.080> you<00:06:10.830> know<00:06:10.979> that<00:06:11.130> short<00:06:11.460> period<00:06:11.639> of
