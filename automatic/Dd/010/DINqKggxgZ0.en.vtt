00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
to enable speed hack right here and the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.080 
to enable speed hack right here and the
reason<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.620> guy<00:02:37.740> put<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.070> here<00:02:38.310> was<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.880> test

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
reason the guy put in here was to test

game so i usually put this bead hack
around<00:02:46.560> 200<00:02:47.430> because<00:02:47.910> i<00:02:48.060> find<00:02:48.240> that<00:02:48.450> after

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
around 200 because i find that after

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.890 
around 200 because i find that after
around<00:02:48.990> 200<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:50.070> gets<00:02:50.370> kind<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.700> laggy<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.330> on

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
around 200 it gets kind of laggy and on

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.260 
around 200 it gets kind of laggy and on
and<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.560> can't<00:02:52.800> really<00:02:52.890> use<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.250> very<00:02:53.370> well<00:02:53.550> so

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
more time it's not like some sort of a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.250 
more time it's not like some sort of a
trick<00:02:59.580> photoshop<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.720> kind<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.050> thing

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
trick photoshop that kind of thing

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.930 
trick photoshop that kind of thing
you're<00:03:02.010> doing<00:03:02.040> 200<00:03:02.520> you<00:03:03.360> click<00:03:03.570> apply<00:03:03.930> then

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
now you can see it's going a whole lot

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.600 
now you can see it's going a whole lot
faster<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.120> really<00:03:10.050> awards<00:03:10.500> we<00:03:10.830> have<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.370> whole

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
faster and really awards we have a whole

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.420 
faster and really awards we have a whole
