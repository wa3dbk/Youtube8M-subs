aspects that lend to the state will be
designed<00:01:03.030> we're<00:01:04.030> gonna<00:01:04.119> start<00:01:04.449> with<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.869> step

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
designed we're gonna start with the step

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.020 
designed we're gonna start with the step
back<00:01:05.470> here<00:01:05.740> that<00:01:05.950> you<00:01:06.040> see<00:01:06.250> on<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.520> transom

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
back here that you see on the transom

back here that you see on the transom
what<00:01:07.960> this<00:01:08.140> does<00:01:08.410> is<00:01:08.620> reduces<00:01:09.130> drag<00:01:09.430> and

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
what this does is reduces drag and

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.160 
what this does is reduces drag and
friction<00:01:09.730> and<00:01:10.420> makes<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.840> boat<00:01:10.990> more

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
friction and makes the boat more

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.850 
friction and makes the boat more
efficient<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:13.000> next<00:01:13.300> component<00:01:13.870> of<00:01:14.200> staple<00:01:14.680> V

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
efficient the next component of staple V

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.520 
efficient the next component of staple V
is<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.670> after<00:01:16.060> pod<00:01:16.270> you'll<00:01:16.720> notice<00:01:17.110> that<00:01:17.380> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
is the after pod you'll notice that the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.230 
is the after pod you'll notice that the
fiberglass<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.310> after<00:01:18.610> pod<00:01:18.820> actually

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
fiberglass the after pod actually

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.720 
fiberglass the after pod actually
extends<00:01:19.660> beyond<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.110> motors<00:01:20.560> what<00:01:21.280> this<00:01:21.460> does

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
extends beyond the motors what this does

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.030 
extends beyond the motors what this does
is<00:01:21.910> gives<00:01:22.090> you<00:01:22.330> an<00:01:22.450> extended<00:01:22.870> running<00:01:23.590> surface

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
is gives you an extended running surface

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.620 
is gives you an extended running surface
which<00:01:24.280> will<00:01:24.400> help<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.670> boat<00:01:24.790> get<00:01:25.060> up<00:01:25.180> on<00:01:25.330> plane

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
which will help the boat get up on plane

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.440 
which will help the boat get up on plane
much<00:01:25.870> quicker<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.670> amount<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.940> dead<00:01:28.180> rise

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
much quicker the amount of dead rise

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.350 
much quicker the amount of dead rise
that<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.840> boat<00:01:29.020> has<00:01:29.260> throughout<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.950> whole

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that the boat has throughout the whole

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.800 
that the boat has throughout the whole
given<00:01:31.360> a<00:01:31.510> smooth<00:01:31.900> stable<00:01:32.290> ride<00:01:33.810> finally

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
given a smooth stable ride finally

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.899 
given a smooth stable ride finally
another<00:01:35.320> unique<00:01:35.680> feature<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:36.159> Four<00:01:36.490> Winds

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
another unique feature to Four Winds

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.510 
another unique feature to Four Winds
is<00:01:37.270> unique<00:01:37.810> shape<00:01:38.200> of<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.650> chines<00:01:38.950> they<00:01:39.310> kind

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
is unique shape of the chines they kind

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.220 
is unique shape of the chines they kind
of<00:01:39.580> have<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.700> little<00:01:39.850> curve<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.210> them<00:01:40.630> here<00:01:40.900> and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
of have a little curve to them here and

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.110 
of have a little curve to them here and
this<00:01:41.740> is<00:01:41.920> what<00:01:42.100> lends<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.640> lateral

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
this is what lends to the lateral

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.690 
this is what lends to the lateral
stability<00:01:43.330> of<00:01:43.659> your<00:01:43.870> boat<00:01:44.050> so<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.159> addition<00:01:45.400> to

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
stability of your boat so in addition to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.500 
stability of your boat so in addition to
faster<00:01:46.630> planing<00:01:47.110> more<00:01:47.409> efficiency<00:01:48.510> the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
faster planing more efficiency the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.600 
faster planing more efficiency the
lateral<00:01:49.960> stability<00:01:50.200> you'll<00:01:50.740> see<00:01:50.950> not<00:01:51.220> only<00:01:51.250> at

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
lateral stability you'll see not only at

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.760 
lateral stability you'll see not only at
the<00:01:51.729> dock<00:01:51.940> when<00:01:52.210> you're<00:01:52.330> sitting<00:01:52.659> still<00:01:52.960> but

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
the dock when you're sitting still but

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.050 
the dock when you're sitting still but
the<00:01:53.890> real<00:01:54.040> test<00:01:54.340> is<00:01:54.430> when<00:01:54.580> you're<00:01:54.700> out<00:01:54.820> on<00:01:54.970> the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
the real test is when you're out on the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.420 
the real test is when you're out on the
water<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.360> taking<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.840> tight<00:01:56.050> turn<00:01:56.380> some<00:01:57.190> boats

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
water and taking a tight turn some boats

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.890 
water and taking a tight turn some boats
I'm<00:01:57.760> sure<00:01:58.030> that<00:01:58.210> you've<00:01:58.300> ridden<00:01:58.600> in<00:01:58.720> you'll
