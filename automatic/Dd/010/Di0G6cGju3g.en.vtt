00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.360
 instead of a review because if I did not read 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.759
 of the series in the same way I think that already 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.219
 I do not know why they are here this is a 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:19.630
 prequel there and I think they should first 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.630
 read the whole saga that is behind me 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.310
 I'm going to talk about the lethal virus of 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.360
 zinc 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.960
 of good from the saga of my hands 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.960
 is 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.710
 I liked it very much I could not believe what 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.110
 quick I was going through the pages was like 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.579
 an oasis and reading reading and then another 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.649
 title to another chapter to another that tuteló 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.409
 because they are very fast very agile 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.540
 they ended the chapters and you 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.420
 they leave you spicy you have to continue to follow 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.250
 and emma loved this book as well as 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.949
 I said is a prequel to everything that 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.409
 happens in my runner has first a 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.210
 prologue and then an epilogue the prologue and 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.230
 the epilogue are rather about things from 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.740
 what will happen in the labyrinth 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:16.150
 and this and the story happens 13 years 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.400
 before it was from the study that 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.680
 good will happen does not understand what the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.870
 labyrinth because the solar sisters are 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.930
 give just one year before this book and 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.510
 they are explained here 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.220
 we find that marc and triune 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.170
 they live in a settlement of 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.570
 survivors of solar flares 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.630
 and they live together with I think it's a 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.659
 military doctor and a former soldier who 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.390
 llama nalec and the hna 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.689
 what happens is that they come from nowhere or 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.890
 no I do not know how we aircraft called 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.740
 brics 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.979
 to attack your settlement begin to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.630
 throw darts that have clear a virus 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.180
 lethal and people die 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.650
 instantly but later in the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.869
 progress of the book the virus is also going 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.479
 progressing people get slower 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.280
 she goes crazy before she dies and every time 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.229
 they take more people to die 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.869
 so we already know how it becomes 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.880
 the 40 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.590
 good keeps people in what I 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.180
 I really like that you are in this book 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.730
 is that it is very very agile plus you have two 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.200
 stories you have the story that you 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.989
 I just said that they attack the feeling 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.340
 of Marc and Trina and they are forced 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.010
 to get out of there and try to look for the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.170
 responsible and are involved forme 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.330
 these new and not yet called france and 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.819
 more things for more or less than 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.370
 let's discover how the virus was 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.050
 it was done because I really had 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.970
 understood something like that I 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.090
 I do not know the bryant remembered that I understood from 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.460
 virus when I was reading proof of 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.610
 fire 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.050
 but here they make it clearer and you give 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.390
 tell more about the things that happened 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.580
 so I liked it a lot and besides you have 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.050
 the memories of March of the day when 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.360
 the solar calls happened that he 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.070
 I was with trina that's why I 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.320
 are they two together are friends of the 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.720
 childhood and both lost their family 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.820
 only if they have a between them that is that 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.400
 they were neighbors because they were together in the 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.690
 moment when the flares happened 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.020
 solar 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.530
 and as for the story according to me 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.989
 what happens here if it is related to 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.400
 the saga of my hands 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.969
 directly almost in fact you can drop 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.510
 a spoiler here ahead is about 1 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:39.609
 minute or something remove the video if they want 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.900
 but according to me I had in the edition that 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.299
 he left in the united states they climbed his 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.609
 notebook of the killers 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.739
 in this edition it is clarified that one of the 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.560
 from here 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.650
 in fact Teresa 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.500
 so 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.629
 and who read it and did not know this already because 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.510
 we know who I mean 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:04.120
 can be Teresa and in the end 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.730
 if these hundreds put themselves and at the end of 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.069
 book in the epilogue is the moment in 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.840
 that they take the cruel team in that 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.939
 they take tomás from his house and they take it 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.470
 to start the tests even 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.079
 so far as it is told that it 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.210
 let's call tomas then the truth 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.000
 which is a very very good book to me 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.070
 like the truth I'm already registered 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.250
 because I left but I do not like 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.680
 expert us from the east first time that 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.930
 I like the two Latin covers that 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.260
 that the Americans but is that 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.360
 medians of art are this a nice me 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.910
 I guess this one is that this is this 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.310
 love here this is alex the soldier that the 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.830
 aesthetic solar flares and everything 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.639
 I love the color palette 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:57.759
 It is magnificent and it gives you 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.759
 the end of all history 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:06.260
 Americans then 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.260
 until the first one is to run or die 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.420
 steel versa pesadísimo and it is so 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.360
 you take running in the environment with a 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.700
 lamp and it looks like it's forever 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.100
 labyrinth here back I guess these 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.310
 are the arbitrator's dealings as his 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.950
 skeletons and ccoo itself and they really are 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.080
 very good things I really like the 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.090
 editions of de vargas and rivas are 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.160
 excellent editions you'll look at the 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.919
 same and it looks like I have a 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.590
 trauma with this I have to buy sagas and 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:39.290
 they look different different be 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.090
 as you have a tall one and another one 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.010
 short as with the games of the 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.040
 hungry 'of ocean the first edition by 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.110
 at least not the injuries will run 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.790
 die are super well-kept mineral 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.780
 they are very rich then this is 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:56.800
 fireproof 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.380
 and finally we have the deadly cure that 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.000
 is already more on the side of purple and 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.980
 all that but very beautiful because all 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.080
 all combine and with each other then this is 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.330
 one of the favorites I really like how 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.490
 write james turner I fell in love I think 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.240
 more with 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.370
 with the lethal virus so go 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.990
 buy us the truth is very good I 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.479
 I say that it would be best if they read 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.970
 first the trilogy and at the end this one 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.319
 it gets more interesting to see it like that but 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.550
 if they want it is a prequel to them 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.289
 and they will understand a little more than 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.789
 what happens in the other books but yes 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:34.090
 I would recommend that you read this answer 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:36.490
 until the end as it is public and that 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.720
 it's all for today I'll see you later unless 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:45.360
 write me another video today I want to think 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.360
 but if I leave them very good 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.080
 because if
