00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.190 
mazes here which is kind of neat because
it's<00:02:31.610> like<00:02:31.790> playing<00:02:32.090> pacman<00:02:32.420> again<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.140> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
it's like playing pacman again for the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.490 
it's like playing pacman again for the
first<00:02:33.410> time<00:02:33.770> I<00:02:34.280> don't<00:02:34.610> have<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.270> preferred<00:02:36.110> path

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
first time I don't have a preferred path

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.990 
first time I don't have a preferred path
through<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.130> maze<00:02:37.280> yet

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
through the maze yet

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.940 
through the maze yet
in<00:02:38.450> fact<00:02:38.690> my<00:02:38.870> only<00:02:39.080> real<00:02:39.200> strategy<00:02:39.320> at<00:02:39.830> this

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
in fact my only real strategy at this

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.040 
in fact my only real strategy at this
point<00:02:40.070> is<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:41.000> try<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.240> get<00:02:41.450> all<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.660> ghosts

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
point is to try to get all the ghosts

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.810 
point is to try to get all the ghosts
behind<00:02:42.290> me<00:02:42.770> so<00:02:43.070> I<00:02:43.100> know<00:02:43.550> where<00:02:43.670> they<00:02:43.790> are

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
behind me so I know where they are

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.270 
behind me so I know where they are
otherwise<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:45.170> run<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.350> risk<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.710> just

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
otherwise you run the risk of just

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.280 
otherwise you run the risk of just
running<00:02:46.460> straight<00:02:46.820> into<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:47.120> ghost<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.720> the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
running straight into a ghost and the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.240 
running straight into a ghost and the
larger<00:02:48.620> mazes

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
larger mazes

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.890

add<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.370> unique<00:02:49.910> challenge<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.750> have

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
add a unique challenge in that you have

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.450 
add a unique challenge in that you have
to<00:02:50.930> pay<00:02:51.200> attention<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.650> what<00:02:51.890> dots<00:02:52.160> you've

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
to pay attention to what dots you've

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.580 
to pay attention to what dots you've
eaten<00:02:52.700> because<00:02:53.330> just<00:02:53.960> when<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:54.200> think<00:02:54.350> you're

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
eaten because just when you think you're

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.440 
eaten because just when you think you're
done<00:02:54.620> you're<00:02:55.040> at<00:02:55.160> you're<00:02:55.310> actually<00:02:55.640> not<00:02:55.820> and

done you're at you're actually not and

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.570 
done you're at you're actually not and
maybe<00:02:56.630> you've<00:02:56.840> left<00:02:57.020> one<00:02:57.230> or<00:02:57.350> two<00:02:57.470> dots<00:02:57.710> on<00:02:58.040> the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
maybe you've left one or two dots on the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.340 
maybe you've left one or two dots on the
other<00:02:58.700> side<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.120> maze<00:02:59.300> so<00:02:59.570> hopefully

all<00:04:03.170> right<00:04:03.350> I've<00:04:03.500> been<00:04:03.650> informed<00:04:03.950> by<00:04:04.160> Greg

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
all right I've been informed by Greg

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.360 
all right I've been informed by Greg
next<00:04:04.850> door<00:04:04.970> that<00:04:05.210> it's<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.570> kite<00:04:06.010> it's<00:04:07.010> a<00:04:07.160> kite

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
next door that it's a kite it's a kite

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.600 
next door that it's a kite it's a kite
it<00:04:07.490> doesn't<00:04:07.730> look<00:04:07.850> anything<00:04:08.150> like<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.570> kite

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
it doesn't look anything like a kite

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.790 
it doesn't look anything like a kite
or<00:04:11.150> like<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.420> try<00:04:11.720> like<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.050> triangle<00:04:12.320> monster

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
or like a try like the triangle monster

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.520 
or like a try like the triangle monster
yes<00:04:13.010> that's<00:04:13.220> a<00:04:13.280> good<00:04:13.430> one<00:04:14.200> there's<00:04:15.200> some<00:04:15.380> other

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
yes that's a good one there's some other

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.500 
yes that's a good one there's some other
differences<00:04:15.980> if<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.580> food<00:04:16.940> items<00:04:17.269> or

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
differences if the food items or

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.750 
differences if the food items or
whatever<00:04:17.989> they<00:04:18.709> are<00:04:18.739> touched<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.519> power

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
whatever they are touched the power

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.120 
whatever they are touched the power
pellets<00:04:20.269> they<00:04:20.450> spontaneously<00:04:20.959> combust<00:04:21.920> I

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
pellets they spontaneously combust I

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.730 
pellets they spontaneously combust I
think<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.670> when<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.360> items<00:04:23.720> run<00:04:23.990> over<00:04:24.410> dots

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
think and when the items run over dots

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.590 
think and when the items run over dots
the<00:04:25.070> dots<00:04:25.220> become<00:04:25.640> worth<00:04:25.820> more<00:04:26.000> points<00:04:26.060> but

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
the dots become worth more points but
