wood and stone and cobble stone and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.170 
wood and stone and cobble stone and

glass you know whatever that that type
of<00:00:51.210> stuff<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:52.170> yeah<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.879> three<00:00:54.329> very

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
of stuff but yeah so we have three very

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.959 
of stuff but yeah so we have three very
well<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.800> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.219> look<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.550> same<00:00:56.760> homes

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
well to kind of look in the same homes

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090 
well to kind of look in the same homes
which<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.360> even<00:00:57.660> weirder<00:00:57.899> because<00:00:58.440> there's

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
which is even weirder because there's

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.250 
which is even weirder because there's
actually<00:00:59.550> walls<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.600> around<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.230> these

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
actually walls up around all these

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.990 
actually walls up around all these
builds<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.250> couldn't<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.910> each

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
builds so we couldn't see what each

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.880 
builds so we couldn't see what each
other<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.300> building<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.530> them<00:01:04.619> kind

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
other was building and two of them kind

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.670 
other was building and two of them kind
of<00:01:05.010> came<00:01:05.159> out<00:01:05.189> looking<00:01:05.850> similar<00:01:06.560> but<00:01:07.560> yeah

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
of came out looking similar but yeah

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.380 
of came out looking similar but yeah
we'll<00:01:07.830> start<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.520> house<00:01:08.820> number<00:01:08.850> one

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
we'll start off here at house number one

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.250 
we'll start off here at house number one
which<00:01:09.979> kind<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.010> looks<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.310> peanut<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
which kind of looks like a peanut and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.590 
which kind of looks like a peanut and
then<00:01:13.260> we'll<00:01:13.350> come<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.180> like<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.330> like

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
then we'll come up here and like it like

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.910 
then we'll come up here and like it like
it<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> last<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.320> they're<00:01:16.590> not<00:01:16.710> very

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it in the last one they're not very

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.440 
it in the last one they're not very
furnished<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.759> basically<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
furnished it's basically what the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.140 
furnished it's basically what the
outside<00:01:18.570> looks<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.159> I<00:01:20.159> mean<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:20.909> judge

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
outside looks like I mean you can judge

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
outside looks like I mean you can judge
it<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> inside<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.930> you'd<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.500> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it on the inside if you'd like if you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.679 
it on the inside if you'd like if you
want<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.759> pretty<00:01:24.150> much<00:01:24.299> I

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
want to do that but we pretty much I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.530 
want to do that but we pretty much I
mean<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.220> these<00:01:26.640> these<00:01:27.180> two<00:01:27.420> over

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
mean as you can see these these two over

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.560 
mean as you can see these these two over
here<00:01:27.659> more<00:01:28.170> outside<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.640> one's<00:01:29.880> more<00:01:30.270> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
here more outside and that one's more I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.859 
here more outside and that one's more I
guess<00:01:31.380> inside<00:01:31.770> yeah<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.810> is

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
