00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.630
 once they have built you 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.619
 wait a few days and you 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:16.290

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.119

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.280
 to settle in a city is a 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.240
 bartender but he does not find life for 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.590
 to install 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.810
 do you want them to 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.900
 get settled here and it's the same 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.540
 will have to go see husband and ask him 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.140
 that she builds then then 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.430
 how to work there in the cafe good I 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.170
 I'll see if I can 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.380
 work like that I could a little 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.490
 to show you how to do no I know 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.930
 not if it works at night but hey we go 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.460
 see it all but I do not think it 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.650
 walk for you will still explain 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.650
 like that with nemo if I found them 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:08.050

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.500

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.500

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.530
 good I can not be unfair what I have 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.010
 noticed is that I think we can 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.959
 work that from both of them 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.660
 minors up to 18 hours I think so here 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.930
 so to work at the cafe it's not 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.150

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.540
