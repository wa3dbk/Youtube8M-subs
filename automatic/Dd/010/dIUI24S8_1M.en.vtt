windows<00:00:08.480> are<00:00:08.630> one<00:00:08.750> of<00:00:08.870> the<00:00:08.930> most<00:00:09.110> common

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
windows are one of the most common

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.379 
windows are one of the most common
services<00:00:09.950> that<00:00:10.100> we<00:00:10.219> apply<00:00:10.430> graphics<00:00:10.879> to<00:00:11.030> but

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
services that we apply graphics to but

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.480 
services that we apply graphics to but
they're<00:00:11.540> also<00:00:11.660> one<00:00:11.930> of<00:00:11.990> the<00:00:12.080> most<00:00:12.200> difficult

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
they're also one of the most difficult

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.799 
they're also one of the most difficult
because<00:00:13.490> of<00:00:13.759> their<00:00:13.880> high<00:00:14.030> surface<00:00:14.300> tension

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
because of their high surface tension

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.810 
because of their high surface tension
but<00:00:15.469> even<00:00:15.710> this<00:00:15.830> application<00:00:16.460> can<00:00:16.550> be<00:00:16.670> easy

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
but even this application can be easy

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.140 
but even this application can be easy
with<00:00:16.970> a<00:00:17.090> few<00:00:17.150> simple<00:00:17.360> techniques<00:00:19.150> first

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
with a few simple techniques first

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.120 
with a few simple techniques first
follow<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:20.810> steps<00:00:21.080> outlined<00:00:21.259> in<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.859> video

a<00:00:25.369> large<00:00:25.670> printed<00:00:26.090> graphic<00:00:26.449> that<00:00:26.600> will<00:00:26.750> be

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
a large printed graphic that will be

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.509 
a large printed graphic that will be
viewed<00:00:27.140> only<00:00:27.380> from<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.830> outside<00:00:28.310> of<00:00:28.340> the

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
viewed only from the outside of the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.150 
viewed only from the outside of the
glass<00:00:28.840> water<00:00:29.840> is<00:00:30.050> not<00:00:30.199> necessary<00:00:30.830> for<00:00:30.920> this

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
glass water is not necessary for this

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.770 
glass water is not necessary for this
application<00:00:31.760> because<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.119> streaks<00:00:32.540> left

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
application because the streaks left

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.560 
application because the streaks left
behind<00:00:33.140> by<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.320> squeegee<00:00:33.830> won't<00:00:34.040> be<00:00:34.190> seen

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
behind by the squeegee won't be seen

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.850 
behind by the squeegee won't be seen
this<00:00:35.570> means<00:00:35.809> you<00:00:35.989> can<00:00:36.140> use<00:00:36.170> vinyl<00:00:36.590> with<00:00:36.830> a

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
this means you can use vinyl with a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.130 
this means you can use vinyl with a
water-based<00:00:37.489> or<00:00:37.760> an<00:00:38.210> airy<00:00:38.420> grass<00:00:38.690> adhesive

water-based or an airy grass adhesive
but<00:00:39.559> this<00:00:39.769> is<00:00:39.949> still<00:00:40.129> a<00:00:40.190> difficult

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
but this is still a difficult

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.950 
but this is still a difficult
application<00:00:41.269> because<00:00:41.570> of<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.720> high<00:00:41.930> energy

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
application because of the high energy
