reviewing the Air Hogs hyper track now
this<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:15.200> an<00:01:15.320> RC<00:01:15.800> car<00:01:15.830> but<00:01:16.400> what<00:01:16.490> makes<00:01:16.700> it

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
this is an RC car but what makes it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.760 
this is an RC car but what makes it
different<00:01:16.880> than<00:01:17.360> most<00:01:17.510> other<00:01:17.750> RC<00:01:18.290> cars<00:01:18.560> are

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
different than most other RC cars are

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.520 
different than most other RC cars are
these<00:01:19.250> these<00:01:19.850> are<00:01:19.910> these<00:01:20.210> deep<00:01:20.570> treads<00:01:21.140> on<00:01:21.350> it

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
these these are these deep treads on it

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.469 
these these are these deep treads on it
as<00:01:21.620> you<00:01:21.860> can<00:01:22.040> see<00:01:22.220> we<00:01:22.850> drove<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.210> through<00:01:23.240> all

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
as you can see we drove it through all

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.800 
as you can see we drove it through all
different<00:01:23.720> terrain<00:01:24.200> dirt<00:01:25.100> mud<00:01:25.670> snow<00:01:26.210> held<00:01:26.690> up

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
different terrain dirt mud snow held up

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.840 
different terrain dirt mud snow held up
really<00:01:27.020> well<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.890> other<00:01:28.100> thing<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.729> will

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
really well the other thing you will

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.640 
really well the other thing you will
notice<00:01:29.000> about<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.420> is<00:01:29.660> that<00:01:29.900> it's<00:01:30.080> dual<00:01:30.290> sided

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
notice about it is that it's dual sided

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.590 
notice about it is that it's dual sided
so<00:01:31.010> it<00:01:31.100> flips<00:01:31.369> right<00:01:31.670> over<00:01:31.970> again<00:01:32.300> you<00:01:32.420> saw

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
so it flips right over again you saw

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.359 
so it flips right over again you saw
that<00:01:32.780> in<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.020> opening<00:01:33.350> video<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:34.070> run<00:01:34.250> it

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
that in the opening video you run it

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.580 
that in the opening video you run it
into<00:01:34.520> trees<00:01:34.940> run<00:01:35.330> it<00:01:35.450> off<00:01:35.570> ledges<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:36.320> it<00:01:36.470> can

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
into trees run it off ledges and it can

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.410 
into trees run it off ledges and it can
flip<00:01:36.800> over<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:37.340> drive<00:01:37.610> on<00:01:37.790> either<00:01:38.000> sides

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
flip over and drive on either sides

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.109 
flip over and drive on either sides
pretty<00:01:38.899> cool<00:01:39.229> dual<00:01:39.649> side<00:01:40.040> in<00:01:40.250> there<00:01:40.430> now<00:01:40.940> we're

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
pretty cool dual side in there now we're

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.249 
pretty cool dual side in there now we're
going<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.360> get<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:41.570> go<00:01:41.690> in<00:01:41.810> here<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.050> show<00:01:42.110> you

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
going to get it go in here to show you

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.020 
going to get it go in here to show you
something<00:01:42.649> else<00:01:42.800> which<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:43.009> cool<00:01:43.399> here<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:43.910> is

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
something else which is cool here it is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.480 
something else which is cool here it is
emotion<00:01:44.660> independent<00:01:45.530> suspension<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.340> maybe

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
emotion independent suspension and maybe

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.710 
emotion independent suspension and maybe
from<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:46.820> angle<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.149> little<00:01:47.300> bit<00:01:47.390> easier<00:01:47.660> to

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
from this angle a little bit easier to

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.510 
from this angle a little bit easier to
see<00:01:47.810> as<00:01:48.020> we're<00:01:48.200> turning<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:48.770> but<00:01:49.160> as<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:49.369> see

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
see as we're turning it but as you see

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.190 
see as we're turning it but as you see
you've<00:01:49.850> got<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.060> independent<00:01:50.660> suspension

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
you've got that independent suspension

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.480 
you've got that independent suspension
makes<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.530> really<00:01:51.770> good<00:01:51.920> for<00:01:51.950> going<00:01:52.280> over

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
makes it really good for going over

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.580 
makes it really good for going over

so it's not hanging out then you can
unroll<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.090> pull<00:02:29.299> the<00:02:29.390> cable<00:02:29.720> out<00:02:29.840> plug<00:02:30.410> it

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
unroll it you pull the cable out plug it

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.320 
unroll it you pull the cable out plug it
into<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.799> jack<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.580> hyper<00:02:31.760> track<00:02:32.120> and

into that jack on the hyper track and
start<00:02:32.630> charging<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.200> up<00:02:33.350> takes<00:02:34.130> about<00:02:34.510> 30-40

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
start charging it up takes about 30-40
