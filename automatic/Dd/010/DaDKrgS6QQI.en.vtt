little bit more about the laser sight

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.980 
little bit more about the laser sight
and<00:00:11.519> why<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.730> guys<00:00:11.940> should<00:00:12.000> be<00:00:12.420> using<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.840> or

and why you guys should be using it or

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.900 
and why you guys should be using it or
why<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.530> should<00:00:13.830> not<00:00:14.040> be<00:00:14.219> using<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.759> will

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
why you should not be using it I will

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
tell you guys why I am using it in

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.250 
tell you guys why I am using it in
battlefield<00:00:17.640> 4<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.029> why<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.720> not<00:00:19.080> been

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
battlefield 4 and why I have not been

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.560 
battlefield 4 and why I have not been
using<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.920> belfie<00:00:20.310> 3<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.150> first<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.449> all

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
using it in belfie 3 so first of all

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.540 
using it in belfie 3 so first of all
what<00:00:21.810> does<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.050> laser<00:00:22.260> sight<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.310> pretty

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
what does the laser sight do it's pretty

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.460 
what does the laser sight do it's pretty
obvious<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.210> decreases<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.960> hip<00:00:25.170> spread

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
obvious it decreases the hip spread

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.740 
obvious it decreases the hip spread
which<00:00:25.680> may<00:00:25.890> which<00:00:26.430> means<00:00:26.670> hip<00:00:27.029> firing<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.630> be

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
which may which means hip firing will be

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.419 
which may which means hip firing will be
more<00:00:27.930> accurate<00:00:28.080> which<00:00:28.529> normally<00:00:28.949> should<00:00:28.980> not

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
more accurate which normally should not

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.550 
more accurate which normally should not
really<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.420> don't<00:00:30.689> know<00:00:30.840> interest<00:00:31.230> us<00:00:31.380> as

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
really like I don't know interest us as

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.170 
really like I don't know interest us as
aggressive<00:00:31.949> or<00:00:32.219> better<00:00:32.460> said<00:00:32.610> recon<00:00:32.940> players

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
aggressive or better said recon players

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.880 
aggressive or better said recon players
because<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.690> want<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:33.989> accurate<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.500> go

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
because we want to be accurate and go

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.250 
because we want to be accurate and go

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.680 
scope into your scope in order to kill a
target<00:00:44.399> because<00:00:44.789> by<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.120> time<00:00:45.239> you're

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
target because by the time you're

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.900 
target because by the time you're
skilled<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.140> you're<00:00:46.289> already<00:00:46.620> dead<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.070> hip

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
skilled in you're already dead so hip

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.790 
skilled in you're already dead so hip
firing<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> good<00:00:49.379> option<00:00:49.440> if

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
firing really can be a good option if

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.260 
firing really can be a good option if
you're<00:00:49.920> playing<00:00:50.100> really<00:00:50.280> aggressively<00:00:50.789> also

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
you're playing really aggressively also

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.970 
you're playing really aggressively also
can<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.690> really<00:00:52.079> handy<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.500> someone<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.860> able

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
can be really handy if someone is able

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.260 
can be really handy if someone is able
to<00:00:53.190> sneak<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:53.850> some<00:00:54.210> reason

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
to sneak up on you for some reason

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.660 
to sneak up on you for some reason
because<00:00:54.780> your<00:00:55.110> superhuman<00:00:55.620> powers<00:00:56.070> fails<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
because your superhuman powers fails and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.610 
because your superhuman powers fails and
then<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.260> matter

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
then for that matter

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.170 
then for that matter
it's<00:00:58.859> basically<00:00:59.219> better<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.969> turn

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it's basically better to just turn

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
it's basically better to just turn
around<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> quick<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:02.190> quick

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
around and get a quick really quick

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.070 
around and get a quick really quick
hipfire<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> guy<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.570> order<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.809> kill<00:01:03.960> them

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
hipfire to the guy in order to kill them

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.500 
hipfire to the guy in order to kill them
off<00:01:04.199> because<00:01:04.949> normally<00:01:05.519> most<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.030> time<00:01:06.240> in

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
off because normally most of time in

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.969 
off because normally most of time in
battlefield<00:01:06.930> 4<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.170> long<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.860> not

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
battlefield 4 as long as they do not

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.740 
battlefield 4 as long as they do not
have<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.310> defensive<00:01:08.700> armor<00:01:09.000> perk<00:01:09.180> available

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
have the defensive armor perk available

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.660 
have the defensive armor perk available
or<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.170> or<00:01:10.619> whatever<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.280> called

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
or on or whatever it's called

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.359 
or on or whatever it's called
wha-wha-wha<00:01:12.270> then<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.500> will<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.040> 1<00:01:14.250> at

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
wha-wha-wha then you will get a 1 at

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
wha-wha-wha then you will get a 1 at
kill<00:01:14.610> within<00:01:15.000> close<00:01:15.210> range<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.960> again

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
kill within close range which again

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.410 
kill within close range which again
leads<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.189> death<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.729> opponent<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
leads to the death of your opponent and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780 
leads to the death of your opponent and
again<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.590> legislators<00:01:20.009> basically<00:01:20.400> helping

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
again the legislators basically helping

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.240 
again the legislators basically helping
you<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.470> so<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> reason<00:01:22.860> why<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> have

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you with that so the reason why I have

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.590 
you with that so the reason why I have
not<00:01:23.430> been<00:01:23.580> using<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.150> battlefield<00:01:24.570> 3

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
not been using it in battlefield 3

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.570 
not been using it in battlefield 3
though<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.170> even<00:01:25.590> though<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.070> hipfire

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
though was even though the hipfire

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.700 
though was even though the hipfire
spread<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.570> sv-98<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.350> battlefield<00:01:28.680> 3

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
spread with the sv-98 in battlefield 3

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.649 
spread with the sv-98 in battlefield 3
was<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> lot<00:01:29.159> better<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.420> in

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
was a lot better it's because in

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.149 
was a lot better it's because in
battlefield<00:01:31.049> 3<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> gunplay<00:01:31.829> was<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> lot

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
battlefield 3 the gunplay was a lot

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.850 
battlefield 3 the gunplay was a lot
snappier<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.630> way<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.049> game<00:01:34.079> played

the enemy and it was kind of like for me

the enemy and it was kind of like for me
that<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.700> image<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> scope<00:01:51.659> was<00:01:51.840> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
that the the image of the scope was so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.649 
that the the image of the scope was so
crisp<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.159> clear<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.850> did<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.240> wanted

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
crisp and so clear that I did not wanted

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.560 
crisp and so clear that I did not wanted
to<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:55.079> abstracted<00:01:55.710> by<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> red<00:01:56.159> dot<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:57.540> I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
to be abstracted by a red dot so what I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.359 
to be abstracted by a red dot so what I
did<00:01:57.750> was<00:01:58.049> basically<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.500> putting<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> off<00:01:59.130> or

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
did was basically just putting it off or

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.039 
did was basically just putting it off or
turning<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.939> off<00:02:00.060> or<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.540> taking<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.930> off

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
turning it off or just taking it off

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.200 
turning it off or just taking it off
altogether<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.649> belfie<00:02:01.920> 3<00:02:02.130> because<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.939> felt

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
altogether in belfie 3 because I felt

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.700 
altogether in belfie 3 because I felt
like<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.509> was<00:02:03.630> more<00:02:03.840> accurate<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
like it was more accurate with it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.980 
like it was more accurate with it
however<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.759> battlefield<00:02:06.180> 4<00:02:06.210> since<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> game

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
however in battlefield 4 since the game

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.660 
however in battlefield 4 since the game
is<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.530> more<00:02:07.710> broken<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.429> gun

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
is a little bit more broken and the gun

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.180 
is a little bit more broken and the gun
mechanics<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.050> work<00:02:10.259> out<00:02:10.440> quite<00:02:10.709> as<00:02:10.979> well

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
mechanics do not work out quite as well

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.520 
mechanics do not work out quite as well
most<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.360> time

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
most of the time

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.830 
most of the time
I<00:02:13.620> think<00:02:14.190> because<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.850> blurry<00:02:15.090> scopes<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I think because of the blurry scopes and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.540 
I think because of the blurry scopes and
just<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.350> way<00:02:16.500> everything<00:02:16.860> handles<00:02:17.370> it's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
just the way everything handles it's

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.670 
just the way everything handles it's
just<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.120> lot<00:02:18.270> better<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.630> just<00:02:18.990> go<00:02:19.319> with<00:02:19.500> it

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
just a lot better to just go with it

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.090 
just a lot better to just go with it
because<00:02:19.800> having<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:21.030> few<00:02:21.810> hips<00:02:22.080> spread<00:02:22.170> or<00:02:22.560> just

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
because having a few hips spread or just

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.030 
because having a few hips spread or just
a<00:02:23.310> better<00:02:24.060> accuracy<00:02:24.450> from<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.200> hip<00:02:25.319> really

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
a better accuracy from the hip really

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.590 
a better accuracy from the hip really
makes<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.400> little<00:02:26.640> easier<00:02:27.090> again<00:02:27.390> if

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
makes it a little easier again if

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.330 
makes it a little easier again if
someone<00:02:27.810> sneaks<00:02:28.080> up<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.319> you<00:02:28.470> or<00:02:28.890> if<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.069> just

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
someone sneaks up on you or if you just

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.940 
someone sneaks up on you or if you just
have<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.580> get<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> quick<00:02:30.120> shot<00:02:30.270> off<00:02:30.480> also<00:02:31.440> now

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
have to get a quick shot off also now

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.520 
have to get a quick shot off also now
that<00:02:32.130> you're<00:02:32.310> able<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.640> switch<00:02:33.450> or<00:02:34.200> better

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
that you're able to switch or better

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.770 
that you're able to switch or better
choose<00:02:35.280> between<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.850> red<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> green<00:02:36.450> laser

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
choose between a red and a green laser

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.410 
choose between a red and a green laser
side<00:02:37.080> again<00:02:37.430> greens<00:02:38.430> normally<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.120> colored

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
side again greens normally the colored

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.080 
side again greens normally the colored
is<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.750> easiest<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:41.010> pursue<00:02:41.550> by<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.790> human

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
is the easiest to pursue by the human

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.479 
is the easiest to pursue by the human
eye<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:43.080> again<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:43.950> more<00:02:44.100> personal

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
eye so again it's more personal

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.400 
eye so again it's more personal
preference<00:02:45.090> thing<00:02:45.420> if<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.930> want<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.140> go<00:02:46.230> with

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
preference thing if you want to go with

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.380 
preference thing if you want to go with
red<00:02:46.650> or<00:02:46.830> green<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.760> think<00:02:47.970> greens<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
red or green but I think greens the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.020 
red or green but I think greens the
color<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:50.250> easiest<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.790> follow

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
color it's like the easiest to follow

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.070 
color it's like the easiest to follow
it's<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.420> most<00:02:52.370> recognizable<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:54.150> if<00:02:54.690> you're

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
it's the most recognizable so if you're

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.380 
it's the most recognizable so if you're
having<00:02:55.320> trouble<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.459> fixating<00:02:57.300> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
having trouble just like fixating the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.050 
having trouble just like fixating the
center<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.750> your<00:02:57.870> screen<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.800> extra<00:02:59.580> like

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
center of your screen that extra like

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.300 
center of your screen that extra like
little<00:03:00.569> red<00:03:00.780> or<00:03:01.019> green<00:03:01.290> dot<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:01.920> have<00:03:02.190> in

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
little red or green dot that you have in

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.740 
little red or green dot that you have in
the<00:03:02.370> middle<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.670> your<00:03:02.760> scope<00:03:02.970> really<00:03:03.390> can<00:03:03.569> help

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
the middle of your scope really can help

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.960 
the middle of your scope really can help
your<00:03:03.930> acquiring<00:03:04.380> targets<00:03:04.800> again<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:05.819> more

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
your acquiring targets again it's more

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.610 
your acquiring targets again it's more
of<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> personal<00:03:06.450> preference<00:03:06.660> thing<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.380> in

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
of a personal preference thing and in

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.100 
of a personal preference thing and in
belfie<00:03:07.980> 3<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.670> actually<00:03:09.000> kind<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.420> threw<00:03:09.930> my

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
belfie 3 it actually kind of threw my

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.259 
belfie 3 it actually kind of threw my
aim<00:03:10.380> off<00:03:10.590> more<00:03:10.950> than<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.250> would<00:03:11.610> help<00:03:11.819> me<00:03:12.060> or

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
aim off more than it would help me or

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.690 
aim off more than it would help me or
yeah<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.080> know<00:03:13.290> what<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.470> mean<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:14.280> felt

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
yeah you know what I mean I just felt

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.100 
yeah you know what I mean I just felt
like<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:14.880> benefit<00:03:15.120> 3<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.330> was<00:03:15.510> accurate<00:03:15.870> enough

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
like in benefit 3 I was accurate enough

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.860 
like in benefit 3 I was accurate enough
were<00:03:16.319> more<00:03:16.709> accurate<00:03:16.860> without<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.690> since<00:03:18.690> I

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
were more accurate without it since I

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.690 
were more accurate without it since I
know<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.440> cannot<00:03:19.739> be<00:03:19.920> as<00:03:20.070> accurate<00:03:20.310> in

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
know that you cannot be as accurate in

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.030 
know that you cannot be as accurate in
battlefield<00:03:21.150> 4<00:03:21.180> however<00:03:21.540> it's<00:03:22.530> probably<00:03:23.010> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
battlefield 4 however it's probably a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.250 
battlefield 4 however it's probably a
lot<00:03:23.220> better<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.670> just<00:03:23.910> do<00:03:24.660> more<00:03:24.840> hipfiring

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
lot better to just do more hipfiring

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.289 
lot better to just do more hipfiring
altogether<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:25.890> would<00:03:26.100> say<00:03:26.310> because<00:03:26.579> even

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
altogether I would say because even

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.300 
altogether I would say because even
though<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:27.630> kind<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:27.989> goes<00:03:28.230> against<00:03:28.980> all<00:03:29.130> my

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
though this kind of goes against all my

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.699 
though this kind of goes against all my
rules<00:03:29.549> everything<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.269> I've<00:03:30.390> ever<00:03:30.420> said<00:03:30.900> it

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
rules everything that I've ever said it

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.400 
rules everything that I've ever said it
just<00:03:32.040> still<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:33.060> don't<00:03:33.209> know<00:03:33.420> makes<00:03:33.870> sense<00:03:34.140> like

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
just still I don't know makes sense like

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.920 
just still I don't know makes sense like
it<00:03:35.280> just<00:03:35.519> helps<00:03:35.880> try<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.299> out<00:03:36.450> for<00:03:36.600> yourself

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
it just helps try it out for yourself

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.140 
it just helps try it out for yourself
and<00:03:37.230> as<00:03:37.860> for<00:03:38.220> giving<00:03:38.250> away<00:03:38.700> your<00:03:38.730> precision

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
and as for giving away your precision

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.090 
and as for giving away your precision
again<00:03:39.750> if<00:03:39.959> you're<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.170> toddler<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.620> can<00:03:40.890> just

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
again if you're a toddler you can just

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.979 
again if you're a toddler you can just
bind<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.549> so<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.090> turns<00:03:42.299> off<00:03:42.510> as<00:03:42.660> soon<00:03:42.870> as

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
bind it so that it turns off as soon as

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.660 
bind it so that it turns off as soon as
you're<00:03:43.170> basically<00:03:43.709> aiming<00:03:44.250> down<00:03:44.459> your<00:03:44.519> sights

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
you're basically aiming down your sights

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.670 
you're basically aiming down your sights
but<00:03:45.630> don't<00:03:45.930> forget<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.260> as<00:03:46.350> soon<00:03:46.500> as<00:03:46.560> you're

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
but don't forget it as soon as you're

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.630 
but don't forget it as soon as you're
aiming<00:03:46.920> through<00:03:47.100> your<00:03:47.250> scope<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.579> scope

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
aiming through your scope the scope

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.449 
aiming through your scope the scope
glint<00:03:48.090> will<00:03:48.239> appear<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:49.190> everyone<00:03:50.190> will<00:03:50.310> see

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
glint will appear and everyone will see

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.069 
glint will appear and everyone will see
you<00:03:50.579> again<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.060> really<00:03:51.450> doesn't<00:03:51.750> make<00:03:51.870> that

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
you again so really doesn't make that

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.509 
you again so really doesn't make that
much<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.500> difference<00:03:52.620> when<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.130> comes<00:03:53.310> to

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
much of a difference when it comes to

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.099 
much of a difference when it comes to
just<00:03:53.790> giving<00:03:54.239> away<00:03:54.390> your<00:03:54.420> position<00:03:54.660> because

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
just giving away your position because

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.830 
just giving away your position because
also<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.549> blinding<00:03:56.910> effect<00:03:57.239> has<00:03:57.570> been

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
also the the blinding effect has been

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.890 
also the the blinding effect has been
reduced<00:03:58.260> dramatically<00:03:59.010> like<00:03:59.579> you<00:04:00.420> normally

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
reduced dramatically like you normally

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.870 
reduced dramatically like you normally
won't<00:04:01.350> recognize<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:01.799> most<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.370> time<00:04:02.640> so

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
won't recognize it most of the time so

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.970 
won't recognize it most of the time so
again<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.900> really<00:04:04.200> doesn't<00:04:04.590> give<00:04:04.769> you're

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
again it really doesn't give you're

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.890 
again it really doesn't give you're
giving<00:04:05.700> away<00:04:05.760> your<00:04:05.850> position<00:04:06.120> all<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.660> much

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
giving away your position all that much

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.740 
giving away your position all that much
so<00:04:07.769> think<00:04:08.370> about<00:04:08.549> using<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.090> try<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.570> out

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
so think about using it and try it out

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.060 
so think about using it and try it out
and<00:04:09.930> let<00:04:09.989> me<00:04:10.170> know<00:04:10.320> in<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.560> comment<00:04:10.859> section

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
and let me know in the comment section

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.319 
and let me know in the comment section
down<00:04:11.100> below<00:04:11.220> what<00:04:11.519> you<00:04:11.670> think<00:04:11.880> about<00:04:12.000> laser

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
down below what you think about laser

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.400 
down below what you think about laser
sight<00:04:12.600> again

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
sight again

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.259 
sight again
battlefield<00:04:13.920> 3<00:04:13.980> was<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.489> lot<00:04:14.700> more<00:04:14.880> snappier

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
battlefield 3 was a lot more snappier

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.330 
battlefield 3 was a lot more snappier
and<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:16.289> I<00:04:16.440> didn't<00:04:16.799> feel<00:04:16.979> like<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.190> was

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
and and I didn't feel like it was

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.890 
and and I didn't feel like it was
helping<00:04:17.760> me<00:04:17.850> all<00:04:18.030> that<00:04:18.180> much<00:04:18.359> because<00:04:18.539> I<00:04:18.690> was

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
helping me all that much because I was

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.060 
helping me all that much because I was
always<00:04:19.109> going<00:04:19.410> for<00:04:19.530> headshots

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
always going for headshots

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.039 
always going for headshots
now<00:04:20.430> I'm<00:04:20.549> belfry<00:04:20.850> for<00:04:21.120> since<00:04:21.359> I<00:04:21.450> have<00:04:21.659> to<00:04:21.810> rely

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
now I'm belfry for since I have to rely

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.050 
now I'm belfry for since I have to rely
a<00:04:22.080> little<00:04:22.260> bit<00:04:22.470> more

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
a little bit more

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.500 
a little bit more
like<00:04:23.810> noscoping<00:04:24.620> i<00:04:24.860> think<00:04:25.730> that's<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.090> way<00:04:26.480> to

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
like noscoping i think that's the way to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.120 
like noscoping i think that's the way to
go<00:04:26.720> about<00:04:26.840> yeah<00:04:27.139> i<00:04:27.320> think<00:04:27.440> smart<00:04:27.800> off<00:04:27.950> for<00:04:28.070> now

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
go about yeah i think smart off for now

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.530 
go about yeah i think smart off for now
so<00:04:28.340> i<00:04:28.370> hope<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:28.580> enjoyed<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:28.850> video<00:04:28.910> let's<00:04:29.360> go
