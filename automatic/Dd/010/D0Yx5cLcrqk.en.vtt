00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
learned right away that I wasn't popping

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.400 
learned right away that I wasn't popping
a<00:00:09.269> tail<00:00:09.480> when<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.780> would<00:00:09.929> come<00:00:10.050> up<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.200> the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
a tail when I would come up to the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.959 
a tail when I would come up to the
borough<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.889> that's<00:00:11.010> partly<00:00:11.309> because<00:00:11.370> I

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
borough of and that's partly because I

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.970 
borough of and that's partly because I
was<00:00:12.570> afraid<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.960> was<00:00:13.080> going<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.259> fall<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:13.710> that

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
was afraid I was going to fall on that

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.070 
was afraid I was going to fall on that
means<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.790> obviously<00:00:15.240> had<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.750> fear<00:00:15.960> of

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
means I obviously had that fear of

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.650 
means I obviously had that fear of
falling<00:00:16.230> still<00:00:17.029> doing<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.119> rolling<00:00:18.480> all
