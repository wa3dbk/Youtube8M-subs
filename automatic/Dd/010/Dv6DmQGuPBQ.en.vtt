00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.250
 this then buhl gate to the orient asia and 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.259
 europe borders here on the bosporus directly 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.460
 together 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.080
 for several weeks come in 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.779
 istanbul is also germany and turkey 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.270
 very close to the first Turkish 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.320
 German university founded in one 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.939
 northern suburb of the metropolis around 120 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.730
 students have their middle of september 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.170
 Bachelor's degree in law bwl 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.160
 or how murat anli in mechatronics 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.590
 especially in engineering 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.579
 so the 18-year-old one of the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.530
 Germans learn a lot 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.450
 will be qualified engineer is 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.770
 German very important because I think 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.570
 Germany is in the field of engineering 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.820
 the world's number one 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.590
 Most freshmen addresses murat 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.020
 so far, however, hardly German 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.730
 for him and his fellow students it says 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.870
 so only for a year 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.730
 cramming language 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.189
 only then can he with his subject 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.479
 Start studying because that almost happens 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.479
 exclusively on germany 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.820
 they have with theirs 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.290
 technical training already started and 20 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 first semester are in germany 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.280
 have grown up or have German-speaking 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.920
 attended high schools in Turkey 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.640
 german is mother tongue for you 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.650
 the reasons for her college was because 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.720
 I quite appreciate the German standard 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.920
 be honest because so in 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.380
 Germany is so everything has 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.150
 really a system everything is really going 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.829
 according to this system, according to the rules 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.840
 and that exists here for example in the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.079
 turkey not now so i wanted to go in 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.759
 live in a different country 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.189
 my country where I come from better 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.780
 said and I think that I am here 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.780
 much better in turkey 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.920
 have chances to climb 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.810
 a total of nine Turkish and nine 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.570
 German professors teach at the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.940
 new uni are the german lecturers 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.590
 never permanently on the spot but commuting 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.710
 between istanbul and their respective 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.430
 homeland uni bears your personnel costs 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.290
 german academic exchange service the 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.360
 building in which currently teaches 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.310
 only provisories will be 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.860
 actual construction work should be next 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.610
 begin year and complete by 2017 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.890
 be on the university line and 35 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.680
 millions have been invested so far 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.030
 main part of turkey germany 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.530
 wants to be around four in the future 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.530
 million euro annually 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.070
 here at the turkish embassy in 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.510
 berlin is the new university for you 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.340
 long overdue step 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.930
 Finally, Germany was for the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.810
 Turkey is one of the most important partners 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.170
 worldwide the american justice is 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.440
 for over 100 years in turkey 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.260
 the French almost 50 years now and 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.940
 that Germany likes to over 100 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.459
 Gymnasium in Germany in Turkey 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.250
 has and still no university 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.200
 that was incomprehensible to us and 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.430
 that's why I'm all the more happy about that 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.410
 it finally worked 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.800
 she has a significant share in it 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.870
 rita sweetmouth former 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.489
 Bundestag President of the Cdu today 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.680
 introduces you from germany 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:28.320
 important body of turkish german 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:32.190
 university also political moment passed 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.500
 If Turkey experienced you want us 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.740
 but not in the eu I experienced 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.080
 delays 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.790
 Germany hopes for a uni 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.750
 also an important signal for the 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.180
 development of the Turkish 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.730
 civil society a fortiori after the 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.620
 excursions around the geopark in june 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.820
 At that time, the police had against 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.250
 demonstrators on the central 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.990
 taksim-platz cracked hard 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.950
 a topic that also the students of the 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.450
 new uni moves something on the 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.120
 taksim-platz has happened 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.600
 I did not like that 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.810
 not allowed to happen 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.590
 we do not have any perfect 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.870
 100 percent democracy worked 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.930
 but that people are now on the 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.820
 streets to prove their opinion that 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.620
 is then a push we see only necessary 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.480
 had 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.010
 The university administration does not believe 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.780
 that it is between German and 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.210
 Turkish side to dispute over 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.180
 teaching contents will not be included either 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.720
 ask the respective one 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.630
 understanding of democracy of both countries 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.760
 affect 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.480
 why should not you in 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.490
 Political sciences different 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.560
 opinions against face 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.150
 and then discuss it 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.640
 to draw correct conclusions 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.550
 we do not understand our task now 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.720
 in how to approach missionaries like that 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:53.140
 but first on the in the country 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.680
 to hear and discuss 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.390
 to shape what is going on in the country 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.980
 for the German Turkish relationship is 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.530
 the common university already now 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.720
 milestone for the students like murat 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.490
 Bartsch is supposed to jump in 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.380
 to become a successful career 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.500
 whether in Germany or in the 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.500
 Turkey
