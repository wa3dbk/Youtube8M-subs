00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.660
 heliose I teach starts early 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.679
 today for a new video 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.759
 so bravo and run in the title that 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.949
 can really interest you this 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.140
 video that I explain to you and finally I 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.560
 will show you the players who are 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.939
 good actually on this horse 14 v who are going 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.849
 to be finally much less good whatever 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.260
 in either it's at sophie's 15 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.300
 so here you can already see the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.700
 players then I wanted detailed with 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.190
 statistical value on this season so 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.620
 we will start with nike then our 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.540
 levels we can see his stats with his 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.750
 5 stars technical gesture 88 in dribbling 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.640
 etc a big hits a good speed 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.370
 this season his eight matches and where 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.320
 no goal so here I think that on this 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.370
 point 15 will forget it I do not think 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.190
 he's rising and 5 stars gesture 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.030
 technical unless with the portugal of the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.210
 world he does he pass a fucking cut 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.030
 of the world but otherwise I do not think then 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.670
 so gimenez that make ultra chic 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.110
 and the game speed 86 87 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.420
 dribble one to four stars gesture 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.790
 technical I believe but this season 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.890
 it's playing eleven matches and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.049
 only goals 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.610
 so here I think that on fifa 15 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.240
 even completely forget it then I can 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.240
 roof of the christian benteke then 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.740
 he the most quoted player of the game good 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.630
 Well, that's it, it's 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.060
 force with a big hit that makes 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.220
 that it has dropped in addition it has been lo 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.799
 the trick it is to smoke big ones 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.670
 bombs then joins the high school 24 matches 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.770
 9 goals 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.000
 so that's not a damn record 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 it's not a kite to have completely 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.820
 shit help 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.200
 so here are letters know the season 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.939
 last he had it was third 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.860
 top scorer 3 front row so 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.130
 this is a bit normal society but 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.409
 the fa 15 will be a commonplace player to my 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.979
 notice on fall tall had put because he 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.049
 was hurt 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.119
 because he's hurt what's he 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.920
 injured for 6 months or during a 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.969
 much of the season I do not think so 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.079
 that they dried up even though it's 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.560
 a very good attacker 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.060
 then mario gomez elsewhere gomez who 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.200
 had a big season the year 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.580
 last if I believe so that's it 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.860
 1 6 2 general he is really very very 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.120
 hey there he did just eight games 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.250
 and 3 goals 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.260
 so in fact I do not know at all I 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.700
 think he was hurt I think he 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.030
 was injured for a good part of 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.099
 the season 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.170
 but here he has scored that three goals in 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.750
 eight matches so I do not think we're going 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.450
 see him too much in the next fifa 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.709
 then antonio di natale and who had 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.870
 been hyper wind last season the ace 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.420
 and 26 games and 8 goals including 4 on 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.069
 penalty so here it is still 85 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.019
 general speed 86 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.810
 here you can see his stats this is 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.239
 that's the guy he 's 36 is so 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.400
 full of shit help and then bah I 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.790
 think next year its next 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.099
 fifa 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.660
 we do not see him anymore with his 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.890
 only eight goals including four 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.250
 penalties not great 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.299
 then two brunettes who's a fucking 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.590
 see on this figure 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.940
 here is a little revelation then 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.620
 well he did not play the first 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.700
 part season in chelsea has virtually 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.010
 not after he was transferred 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.350
 what is it called a tax of 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.700
 gourgues I do not know what he's doing 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.530
 there but I thought he did it 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.530
 eight matches did not put a goal I believe 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.139
 not that he made a decisive pass 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.410
 so that's going to be an average player I 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.090
 thought 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.120
 it will be much less strong than on 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.880
 your daughter I think to be an average player 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.950
 so then to finish there was teach 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.150
 so who would have said just not at all 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.670
 that he did last season but there 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.000
 this season his seven matches and only one 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.790
 goal 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.540
 so here you could see that stage 87 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.670
 in dribble 92-80 lie 4 stars gestures 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.170
 techniques and bad foot so on 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.030
 this fifa is really a great player 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.709
 but this area did nothing at all 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.690
 only seven games for one goal so 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.569
 it's really that slab so 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.269
 so here's the guys for 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.590
 this little video 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.730
 here I am wrong to do it because 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.340
 that I had wondered a little 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.599
 players who will be able to be 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.889
 really improved for the next fifa 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.419
 and instead the players who are going 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.130
 to be that dropped 1 that will be dried 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.319
 what is that for this first 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.060
 part so no I want to see do a 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.109
 for players who on the counter your 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.979
 time the players who are going 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.750
 Ben they will be boosted for a 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.540
 who will start with yvon 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.970
 how to say that they are going to be 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.290
 that a good camp ravaux who are not 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.510
 necessarily good on his wife girl they 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.650
 are on the next so here is he 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.780
 do not know we say a comment because 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.100
 I have forgotten a lot of it that's for sure 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.960
 do not hesitate to tell me the players who 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.060
 are going to be dried like this and the 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.560
 players who are going to be pretty much improved 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.080
 since I have some ideas but 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:46.710
 do not hesitate to tell me so good to 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:49.500
 go there too this video you liked 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.850
 what to let go of the green thumb subscribe you 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.080
 that's not the case and then that's it - 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.070
 comments the players I forgot 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.070
