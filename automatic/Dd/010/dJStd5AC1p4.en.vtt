tested even at our beyond military
specifications<00:02:15.640> would<00:02:16.420> be<00:02:16.660> shaking<00:02:17.140> bake<00:02:17.530> and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
specifications would be shaking bake and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.940 
specifications would be shaking bake and
vibration<00:02:18.610> drop<00:02:19.240> tests<00:02:19.630> all<00:02:20.319> types<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.800> things

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
vibration drop tests all types of things

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.590 
vibration drop tests all types of things
so<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.340> think<00:02:21.460> we're<00:02:21.880> pretty<00:02:21.910> rugged<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.540> I've

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
so we think we're pretty rugged so I've

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.940 
so we think we're pretty rugged so I've
got<00:02:22.750> something<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.110> want<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.290> show<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.560> and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
got something I want to show you and

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.140 
got something I want to show you and
still<00:02:24.160> going<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.370> think<00:02:24.550> let<00:02:24.730> me<00:02:24.790> get<00:02:24.910> this<00:02:25.000> on

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
still going to think let me get this on

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:35.390 
still going to think let me get this on
the<00:02:25.270> back

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.880 

so<00:02:36.400> this<00:02:36.610> little<00:02:36.880> guy<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.350> full-up

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
so this little guy is a full-up

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.180 
so this little guy is a full-up
