00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.250
 hello guys and girls ran is here from 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.510
 again this time we'll talk about pete pete and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.700
 how good is that trailer 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.440
 first of all highlight that normally 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.869
 I do not play scary games because in 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.119
 essence do not usually scare me that 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.220
 I mean, considered that the most 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.009
 poor to put fear to the player is with 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.500
 the shock by surprise is the one wow it was 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.750
 unfortunately if it has been what has most 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 proliferated the industry we also know 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.500
 because it is 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.410
 and the publicity they got thanks to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.149
 all the let's player that shouted before 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.800
 the smallest things 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.629
 trying to make us believe that closing 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.699
 a window will make you fall from the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.409
 fright chair and what many will think 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.390
 developers that will be the way to 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.400
 the success no doubt that I gave to several of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.710
 them a lot of money but that does not mean 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.380
 that you create in great games all of them 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.509
 they fell into oblivion or they will be remembered 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.759
 As a passing fad I would like to do 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.550
 a special mention the amnesia of dark 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.229
 descent that I think that while they do not 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.910
 they did perfectly they got 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.679
 create an interesting story with a 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.380
 meditation stronger than the rest 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.179
 because if friends that's what I'm looking for 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.910
 in a scary game I know it can sound 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:30.030
 strange but I'll try to explain the 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.860
 ambience and history the scares 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.450
 they are an instant element even in your 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.920
 own house can happen to you if you 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.780
 close the door by a flurry of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.580
 wind if your sister hits you a scare 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.440
 coming out from the bathroom his creation is 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.899
 very simple but its effect is also 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.880
 very very simple is more the third time 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.130
 that your sister scares you, you're going to be 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.820
 prepared and there will be no scares but only 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.440
 annoying 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.120
 and that's what happens to many of 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.729
 these games can not avoid falling into the 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.100
 easy way instead when they have a 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.680
 good atmosphere or a great story or 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.690
 plot as you want to call it makes the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.790
 fear go to another level creates 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.290
 feelings of discomfort insecurity 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.570
 break with certain concepts 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.910
 pre-established that the player already has 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.560
 are the best ways to break little to 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.750
 little with the calm of the player and get 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.550
 your heart an example of the simplest 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.860
 a girl half of a park is the most 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.480
 normal of the world but when you see that 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.239
 same girl swaying in the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.520
 swings with a metallic screech in 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.840
 half a night without a moon illuminated 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.030
 just by the flashes of your 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.100
 flashlight you can not avoid anything else that 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.380
 worry in the back of your head 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.880
 you start asking yourself questions makes you a 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.120
 girl these hours in the middle of the park 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.209
 because you are alone because you keep playing 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.560
 as if it were the most normal all these 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.840
 they are the fine threads of horror 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.430
 sliding towards your heart 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.650
 the setting has made something 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.870
 simple be scary there's more 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.640
 details such as aesthetics or your own 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.830
 beauty lack of it in the environment 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.930
 but I do not want to dwell on this area 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.180
 the story or plot is also very 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.769
 important because it makes values ​​the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.959
 characters as living beings as 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.700
 real people but simply their 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.260
 flight in cannon fodder only that occur 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.680
 the typical movies of assassins in 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.080
 series 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.269
 the monsters have more personality 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.860
 that the protagonists but you are more 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.209
 Attentive to see how they are charged 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.519
 another thing 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.530
 the observing reader values ​​a character 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.630
 in a story it is very complicated but 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.849
 is key because those characters have 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.190
 that feel human so you care 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.500
 your well-being the way to get that 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.049
 is to analyze them during the plot to give them 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.510
 fears give motivations justify 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.069
 his actions and that are many things that 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.870
 they are difficult to create if you are not a 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.670
 good scriptwriter because you believe that still 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.140
 games like the original silent hill 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.660
 that were feelings of fear or 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.879
 discomfort because we feel the fear that 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.680
 Harry feels to regain his daughter 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.480
 part of empathizing with him in everything 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.459
 moment and if you have ever 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.930
 asked if it's the same reason for the 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.640
 that when a dog comes out on him 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.959
 he is animal instantly his life is more 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.150
 important than any other 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.640
 secondary character the dog for very 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.349
 taught that this is still a dog 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.569
 with that with only a couple of minutes in the 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.159
 screen in help we will feel it as a 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.079
 be alive like a real animal 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.549
 you understand and unlike the rest of 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.379
 actors that have to convince us of 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.030
 that those characters that they are 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.980
 interpreting are real that many 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.599
 Sometimes they do not get what will make us 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.730
 worry more about the death of this one 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.680
 chuchillo that we feel real that of 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.419
 any other but good I'm just 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.039
 trying to highlight two details that 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.530
 they seem very important I do not want 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.780
 to extend myself more already I made a speaking of the 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.120
 fear and all that but as you can see I have 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.250
 many things to tell and maybe I do 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.440
 in other videos later the reason 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.000
 why we are here is because of piti is 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.280
 very important that you realize a 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.770
 thing the title and I 've seen it two 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.949
 ways seen as play ball trailer 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.620
 or play ball teaser which means trailer 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.940
 playable or playable teaser is key that 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.500
 let us realize that this is not a 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.759
 game have not even said that this one 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.160
 is going to be the style that they directed 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.800
 selene hills I'll put it in large print 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.630
 at no time have they recognized this 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.670
 as the demo of the game 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.590
 who is behind this game are two 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.320
 great artists are guillermo del 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.940
 hyo kojima bull they are great and 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.890
 you can give us an idea of the desire 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.290
 that I have to play this game is great 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.240
 fan of the saga the big fan of the two the 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.950
 perfect combination for me but there's no 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.650
 have illusions that it will be like 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.510
 the teaser a teaser is a tasting of what 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.040
 that could be what we have 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.140
 accustomed in the world of videogames 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.060
 to pre-rendered videos or even 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.270
 recorded with real people to give 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.770
 a more vivid or realistic air but then 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.840
 the games have never been as they have 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.400
 come out in those teaser so I do not 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.960
 it would surprise at all that the game 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.760
 was completely different from what 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.530
 we are seeing on the screen is more 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.300
 Kojima already sent us one of those balls 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.000
 curves a few years ago with metal gear 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.560
 solid 2 of which the demo was the only 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.840
 section that would play with solid snake 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.640
 throughout the game then on the rest 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.620
 of the game changes the story changes the 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.420
 interactivity with the environment including the 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.700
 protagonist I still believe that I know 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.170
 few that justifies his decision but it was 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.850
 a very strong blow for all 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.830
 I sincerely believe that we are 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.570
 directing something like his new 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.760
 engine is incredible the proven in the 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.940
 great silo non-stop and this teaser is 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.430
 done with it but 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.890
 I do not know if I could stand a world 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.510
 open as the trailer is not a little 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.630
 that comes out at the end giving that level of 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.090
 detail in addition these two artists are not 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.340
 of those who say ah well they liked that 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.560
 so let's change everything to please them 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.600
 he has his ideas and his project and what 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.270
 they will keep until the end I am sure 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.520
 of it the truth I see many shadows in 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.170
 this project and that's why I tell you that if 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.240
 well, you can delude us with the idea of 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.820
 silence hills do not expect the same 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.740
 experience lived in pitti because as 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.220
 his name well indicates is a trailer 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.220
 playable 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.889
 well guys just tell you that as soon as 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.169
 come out the silent kills game I'll 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:48.139
 I'll play in the channel, I'll definitely have fun 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:50.209
 very very well spending a lot of time in 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.669
 the comments I want you to put something 

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:54.619
 which is very very interesting at least in 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.149
 my opinion what was your fear of 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:59.209
 children what is it that terrified us what is 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:07:01.039
 what made you not be able to be alone 

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:03.649
 the night you are afraid of whatever the 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.839
 closet like from the closet monster to 

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:08.419
 the darkness that was what most 

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:10.399
 I was terrified when I was little I did not have 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.039
 no fear in particular that I 

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:14.479
 remember well something that I left 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:15.740
 paralyzed by that has always called me 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:18.199
 a lot of attention and I was interested 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.849
 very much so I'm wanting to know 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:23.569
 what were our fears more 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:25.339
 dark have share these videos 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:27.740
