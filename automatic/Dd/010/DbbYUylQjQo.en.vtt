00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.760
 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.500
 let's make a chocolate mousse 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:21.500
 with biscuit we are going to need 75 grams 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.199
 of chocolate fondant a spoonful and 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.439
 half of milk we will need two eggs 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.349
 I have put one in addition 37 grams 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.000
 of butter and a pinch of salt and as 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.000
 We are going to put some cookies on the base 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.460
 crushed and as adornment we are going to 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.460
 Grate a little white chocolate we 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.530
 to start making the mousse first 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.020
 what we are going to do is melt the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.020
 chocolate with milk in the microwave 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.809
 next we are going to incorporate the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.809
 Butter 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.130
 and we're going with the same heat 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.130
 chocolate the candle let's remove 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.840
 now let's take a yolk here 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.840
 mix with sugar 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.650
 and the clear will be left in another 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.650
 container for mounting 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.250
 Now we will mix well with sugar 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.359
 next we will add the chocolate 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.359
 and we will mix well 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.520
 and we will be here the clear that we 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.520
 lack 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.090
 let's take a little bit of salt and 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.090
 let's ride the whites 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.939
 As you can see, we have finished assembling 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.369
 the whites and the way to check if 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:10.660
 they are well mounted is to turn it around 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.660
 if they do not fall out they are well assembled and 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.580
 now we are going to add them let's do a little bit 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.250
 we are going little by little 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.050
 bit 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.050
 and stirring from the bottom up 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.600
 so that the egg whites do not fall 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.890
 then shred we have the cookie 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.890
 that will serve as our base 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.659
 and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.780
 we will throw it at the base of the cup where 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.829
 let's ride the bike and now 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.829
 we will ride the mousse 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.200
 now we will put it in the fridge as a 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.090
 time for the mousse to harden and for 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.510
 Last we are going to roll the chocolate 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.510
