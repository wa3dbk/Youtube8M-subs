00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Modest Tastes cuisine from armful loves 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.400
 In this section, we frequently use Turkish cuisine ... 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.960
 we will share the description of a sauce 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.360
 We will learn about "Tomato Sauce" 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.720
 but as always, let's take a look at the ingredients before 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.120
 1 kilo tomato 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.440
 1 piece of medium onion 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.880
 1 garlic cloves 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.000
 5 tablespoons olive oil 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 1 teaspoon powdered sugar 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.560
 and 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.080
 Let's start by chopping the onion very finely 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.440
 now we have 1 tooth garlic and let's chop it up 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.280
 let's go by the fire to roast now 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.280
 put the pot on fire 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.600
 Add 5 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.480
 and the onion we eat, add garlic 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.120
 these materials will be gripped a little more than usual 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.960
 In the meantime, we continue to grate tomatoes 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.200
 our onions are roasted, we also grate our tomatoes 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.080
 we can pass the robot, what we have 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 now we can combine it with onion 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.520
 Our onions are more than normal 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.720
 now we're adding tomatoes 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.840
 candy... 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.360
 and adding salt 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.200
 carrot and green pepper in some sources 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.520
 but in the simplest way, tomato sauce consists of these materials. 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.800
 our tomato sauce took a very good consistency 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800
 I recommend you do with tomatoes in season 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.840
 You can keep the fridge for 3-4 days 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.840
 you can use it in all kinds of food 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.840
 We learned a recipe for a multi-purpose sauce 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.080
 "Tomato Sauce" can now be used anywhere 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.600
 I wish you to try and remember us as soon as possible 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.120
 goodbye...
