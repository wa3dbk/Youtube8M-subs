00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.980
 well i am already smartphone i am here 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.019
 still with you with a video on one shot 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.330
 the mode then only sniper of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.510
 colors of the vans air warfare because I have 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.970
 since you liked the latest video and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.949
 since I'm too strong 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.890
 then every game I do 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.789
 I practically get a similar gameplay 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.040
 also short anyway this time for 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.850
 differentiate we are not in live bing 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.620
 webcam 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.110
 because otherwise I should have made the video 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.620
 alone but we are with my friend in 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.280
 six-year old clothes 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.930
 events on youtube closed channels of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.600
 all this but beautiful are not you are not 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.129
 five, however, I appreciate but will have a little 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.870
 must go to a 6 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:14.040
 and there is also war between that had to 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:15.570
 are 6 do the mode said earlier 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.700
 is a free for all 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.220
 only sniper with the chirco elk zoom 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.860
 and because it only makes me use that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.250
 that I have to learn to use that iron 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.259
 alabama co however the map should 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.689
 be solar that I can't stand in 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.520
 reality but apparently not bad for 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.490
 unsafe because it is the one for tightening 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.750
 ambit dress we wanted to answer a 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.899
 couple of you who said to do 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.939
 one on one against one with ron 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.159
 the main problem that I am not there 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.720
 maps to make one on one this 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.390
 not all large so one would come 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.729
 cagata, however, as soon as we succeed 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.570
 have a cod 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.549
 more decent on which to do it 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.340
 surely we do here in the meantime 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.950
 you are seeing augias mar to defend 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.670
 hacker package 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.870
 attention but above all me 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.650
 at least a year because in the match it was 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:21.280
 closed with the parenthesis I wanted to open 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.769
 a small parenthesis not just March I 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.780
 finds it unprepared to respond to various 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.690
 questions related to all weapons maps 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.299
 as for me with beauty that is one knows 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.910
 nor how do you love base 2 fair are played 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.980
 very little but above all that I am not 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.290
 I'm the one in the game but it 's okay 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.599
 yes I am the fourth sure that took care of the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.700
 I look at that though but I respect that though 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:51.640
 let's remember he did some careers a bit 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.209
 on youtube therefore it is not strictly a 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.130
 gamer at the time and I had never played 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.709
 why can not clearly 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.989
 keep face to face but not clearly 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:09.970
 but all this is relative all that is 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:13.109
 relative we are therefore only because 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.440
 we are not going to go into these 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:19.930
 then explain it to Marco who kept going 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.600
 no now now there is in the dream there 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.750
 night einstein did find the side 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.260
 green of relativity according to which everything 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.000
 it is relative 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.940
 I don't even know a shit myself 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.940
 cross and I thought the kebabbaro barreled 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.130
 anyway nothing 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.200
 the game is almost over 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.420
 so guys , I always remember you 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.680

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.690
 pollicione what a beautiful powerful to say 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.120
 always fear with whom you would like to see 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.780
 other videos and above all with that 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:00.080
 people make comments anyway from 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.880
 mars all bye next 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.570

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.570
 do
