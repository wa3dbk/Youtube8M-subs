control<00:01:50.140> we<00:01:51.140> don't<00:01:51.170> know<00:01:51.620> exactly<00:01:51.740> how<00:01:52.100> to

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
control we don't know exactly how to

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.450 
control we don't know exactly how to
program<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:52.910> but<00:01:53.120> we<00:01:53.210> can<00:01:53.390> show<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.660> that<00:01:53.990> all

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
program it but we can show you that all

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.690 
program it but we can show you that all
three<00:01:55.460> accesses<00:01:56.300> are<00:01:56.540> are<00:01:57.229> working<00:01:57.700> there's

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
three accesses are are working there's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.390 
three accesses are are working there's
also<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:59.030> servo<00:01:59.840> feed<00:02:00.170> on<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.650> knee<00:02:00.800> for<00:02:01.220> power

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
also a servo feed on the knee for power

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.420 
also a servo feed on the knee for power
elevation<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.620> I<00:02:03.620> will<00:02:03.770> show<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:03.979> show<00:02:04.340> you

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
elevation and I will show it show you

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.130 
elevation and I will show it show you
some<00:02:04.610> close-ups<00:02:05.030> at<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.270> table<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.930> ways

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
some close-ups at the table and the ways

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.139 
some close-ups at the table and the ways
and<00:02:06.530> you'll<00:02:07.310> see<00:02:07.490> that<00:02:07.640> everything<00:02:08.000> is

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
and you'll see that everything is

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.320 
and you'll see that everything is
working<00:02:09.020> fine<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:10.130> head<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.790> a<00:02:10.820> little<00:02:11.000> loud

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
working fine the head is a little loud

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.479 
working fine the head is a little loud
we'll<00:02:11.600> see<00:02:11.810> if<00:02:11.870> we<00:02:11.989> can<00:02:12.170> show<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.400> as

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
we'll see if we can show that to you as

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.380 
we'll see if we can show that to you as
well

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
well

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.120 
well
aside<00:02:14.900> from<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.110> have<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.590> see<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.830> really

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
aside from that have to see a really

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.690 
aside from that have to see a really
nice<00:02:16.310> machine<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:19.130> there's<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.340> coolant

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
nice machine and there's a coolant

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.620 
nice machine and there's a coolant
system<00:02:20.060> as<00:02:20.209> well

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
system as well

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.960 
system as well
and<00:02:21.110> there<00:02:21.650> is<00:02:21.770> some<00:02:21.980> spindle<00:02:22.370> tooling<00:02:22.820> which

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
and there is some spindle tooling which

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.850 
and there is some spindle tooling which
I<00:02:23.150> will<00:02:23.360> add<00:02:23.690> some<00:02:24.080> still<00:02:24.920> pictures<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:26.860> to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
I will add some still pictures to the to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:54.420 
I will add some still pictures to the to
the<00:02:27.950> description

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.220 

that's<00:02:55.000> plugged<00:02:55.299> in<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.599> can<00:02:55.750> just<00:02:55.900> show<00:02:56.019> the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
that's plugged in you can just show the

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.140 
that's plugged in you can just show the
servo<00:02:56.920> people<00:02:57.250> working

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:15.720 

I<00:03:03.269> think<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.019> turned<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.349> off

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:31.110 

maybe<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.569> power<00:03:16.959> elevation<00:03:17.709> on<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.980> name

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.059 

and<00:03:31.690> I'll<00:03:31.810> give<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.050> some<00:03:32.230> close-ups<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:32.920> the

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
and I'll give you some close-ups of the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:04:17.199 
and I'll give you some close-ups of the
machine<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.790> table<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.450> ways

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.150 

which<00:04:17.720> could<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.079> just<00:04:18.320> show<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.709> spindle

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
which could you just show the spindle

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.409 
which could you just show the spindle
going<00:04:19.430> up<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:19.669> down<00:04:19.759> again<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.120> don't<00:04:20.269> know

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
going up and down again I don't know

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:37.600 
going up and down again I don't know
that<00:04:20.479> I<00:04:20.630> got<00:04:20.900> that

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.210 

you're<00:04:38.210> satisfied

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
you're satisfied

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.100 
you're satisfied
we<00:04:40.340> have<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.610> vertical<00:04:41.030> travel<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:41.960> have

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
we have the vertical travel and you have

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.090 
we have the vertical travel and you have
the<00:04:42.260> glossary<00:04:42.530> travel<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:44.830> there<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:45.920> have

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
the glossary travel and there you have

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.280 
the glossary travel and there you have
it
