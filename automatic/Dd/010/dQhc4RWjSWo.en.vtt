00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
pink shades of blush so this one is very

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.900 
pink shades of blush so this one is very
personal<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.810> me<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> color<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.850> I

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
personal to me and it is a color that I

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.929 
personal to me and it is a color that I
absolutely<00:00:24.359> love<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.369> feel<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:26.789> it's

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
absolutely love it is a I feel like it's

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.939 
absolutely love it is a I feel like it's
a<00:00:27.029> mix<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> bronze<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.380> rosy<00:00:28.710> color

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
a mix of like a bronze and a rosy color

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
a mix of like a bronze and a rosy color
which<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.760> why<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.939> think<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.390> such<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.570> perfect

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
which is why I think it's such a perfect

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.350 
which is why I think it's such a perfect
blush<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.669> some<00:00:32.700> reason<00:00:33.239> you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
blush because if for some reason you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.639 
blush because if for some reason you
don't<00:00:33.510> want<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.750> wear<00:00:33.870> too<00:00:34.050> much<00:00:34.200> color<00:00:34.469> on

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
don't want to wear too much color on

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.680 
don't want to wear too much color on

in your other makeup but you want a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.540 
in your other makeup but you want a
little<00:00:42.570> hint<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.170> like<00:00:43.680> rosiness<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.430> your

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
cheeks this is such a good color because

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.680 
cheeks this is such a good color because
it<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> balance<00:00:47.940> between<00:00:48.090> just

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
it really is a balance between just

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.330 
it really is a balance between just
being<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.989> bronzer<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.770> being<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.100> blush

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
being a bronzer and just being a blush

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.610 
being a bronzer and just being a blush
so<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.809> little<00:00:52.140> bit<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> on

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
so like I have it a little bit of it on

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.260 
so like I have it a little bit of it on
right<00:00:52.890> now<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.460> thought<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:53.820> perfect

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
right now and I thought it was perfect

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.389 
right now and I thought it was perfect
for<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.570> makeup<00:00:54.930> look<00:00:55.110> today<00:00:55.140> because<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.800> had<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
for my makeup look today because I had a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.299 
for my makeup look today because I had a
little<00:00:56.910> purple<00:00:57.270> liner<00:00:57.510> under<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.680> light

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
little purple liner under and a light

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.639 
little purple liner under and a light
purple<00:00:59.520> lip<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> felt<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
purple lip so I felt like this is a

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.429 
purple lip so I felt like this is a
really<00:01:01.980> nice<00:01:02.390> blush<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.660> wear<00:01:03.840> because<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> did

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
really nice blush to wear because I did

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.990 
really nice blush to wear because I did
want<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.739> little<00:01:04.979> color<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.640> these<00:01:05.790> aren't

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
want a little color because these aren't

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.300 
want a little color because these aren't
that<00:01:06.299> bold<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.200> still<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> didn't<00:01:08.010> want<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that bold but still I didn't want it to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.130 
that bold but still I didn't want it to
clash<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> thought<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> would<00:01:09.540> go<00:01:09.840> really

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
clash so I thought it would go really

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.230 
clash so I thought it would go really
really<00:01:10.470> nicely<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.640> gonna<00:01:11.729> go<00:01:11.909> ahead<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
really nicely so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.300 
really nicely so I'm gonna go ahead and
put<00:01:12.390> even<00:01:12.720> more<00:01:12.750> odds<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:13.950> bit<00:01:14.070> closer

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
put even more odds a little bit closer

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.950 
put even more odds a little bit closer
up<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.880> guys<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.299> take<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.630> look<00:01:15.689> at

excited about because it was five

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.909 
excited about because it was five
dollars<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.540> did<00:03:08.989> have<00:03:09.139> to<00:03:09.230> pay<00:03:09.379> ship<00:03:09.620> being<00:03:09.799> in

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:09.919
