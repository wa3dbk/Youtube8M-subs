stores we've actually set our store up
by<00:01:22.830> silhouette<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.610> doesn't<00:01:24.150> make<00:01:24.299> sense<00:01:24.570> to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
by silhouette it doesn't make sense to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.899 
by silhouette it doesn't make sense to
do<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.869> by<00:01:25.110> size<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:26.159> all<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> designers

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
do it by size because all the designers

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.850 
do it by size because all the designers
have<00:01:27.150> different<00:01:27.479> size<00:01:27.659> charts<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.619> could

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
have different size charts so you could

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.789
