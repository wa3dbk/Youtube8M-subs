so<00:06:20.540> he<00:06:20.720> does<00:06:20.930> warp<00:06:21.530> out<00:06:21.710> of<00:06:21.920> here<00:06:22.160> or<00:06:22.340> and

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
so he does warp out of here or and

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.150 
so he does warp out of here or and
thinking<00:06:23.810> so<00:06:24.050> is<00:06:24.500> there<00:06:24.710> something<00:06:24.890> else<00:06:25.040> we

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
thinking so is there something else we

thinking so is there something else we
need<00:06:25.340> to<00:06:25.400> do<00:06:25.640> here<00:06:26.470> we<00:06:27.470> have<00:06:27.590> to<00:06:27.680> go<00:06:27.830> to<00:06:27.890> the

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
need to do here we have to go to the

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:59.320
