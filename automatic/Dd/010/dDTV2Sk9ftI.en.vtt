 roulette the recipe of the day is 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.990
 steamed pork ribs for two 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.639
 we need pork ribs 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.410
 from potatoes to big ones like the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.930
 fist a tablespoon of oil 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.119
 of olive 10 g of butter 10 centilitres of 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.699

 provence salt and pepper for 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.320
 this recipe where we will need 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.160
 a pressure cooker 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.449
 I have to admit that it's not my 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.740
 best friend I do not know why 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.170
 I have an irrational fear of casseroles 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.120
 minutes we will first start with 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.050
 to melt the fat in the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.210
 casserole of just could do 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.530
 brown the meat or melted butter it 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.159
 can put the little pork ribs 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.159
 loved 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.270
 when the meat and real bone comes off 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.270
 all kinds of fund 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.450
 during that time I had peeled the 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.200
 potatoes and cut them in half 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.200
 in length 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.800
 the pork ribs are golden I 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.570
 remove from the casserole 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.460
 I put the potatoes in the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.720
 pressure cooker I do not remove the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.250
 fat since the idea is 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.560
 really to wrap them with the material 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.630
 fat that is well scented so I 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.250
 stirs for good envelopes and go 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.500
 come see 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:31.070
 here they are well wrapped it's 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:35.660
 perfect I pepper I dirty and I perfume 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.730
 with herbs from Provence I have 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.880
 then the pork ribs on the apples 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.880
 earthen 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.539
 they are raised from the pan 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.539
 I add the white wine 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.710
 lot lots on about the same amount 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.619
 May 20th, close the pressure cooker 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.420
 and now we're going up in pressure 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.090
 until it whistles at that moment 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.369
 we lower the heat and cook 10 to 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.470
 12 minutes 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.239
 let's go to dressage right there I 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.340
 will set everything on a plate but 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.340
 of course it's one per person 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.689
