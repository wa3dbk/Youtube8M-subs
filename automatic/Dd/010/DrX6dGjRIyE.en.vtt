get<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.490> out<00:01:56.549> without<00:01:56.700> turning<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.030> off<00:01:57.119> so

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
get it out without turning it off so

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.270 
get it out without turning it off so
that's<00:01:57.719> another<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.170> Wow<00:01:58.469> using<00:01:59.219> a

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
and why try that's the micro batino

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.460 
and why try that's the micro batino
board<00:02:38.959> why<00:02:39.950> try<00:02:40.160> we'll<00:02:40.340> drive<00:02:40.549> around<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.470> try

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
board why try we'll drive around and try

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.930 
board why try we'll drive around and try
to<00:02:42.500> avoid<00:02:42.890> bumping<00:02:43.099> into<00:02:43.400> this<00:02:43.580> thing<00:02:43.879> and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
to avoid bumping into this thing and

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:51.580 
to avoid bumping into this thing and
over<00:02:44.180> here<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.360> little<00:02:44.480> bit<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:50.470> what's<00:02:51.470> kind

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
over here a little bit and what's kind

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.319 
over here a little bit and what's kind
of<00:02:51.680> special<00:02:52.010> about<00:02:52.160> why<00:02:52.340> try<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.670> my<00:02:52.880> son

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
of special about why try it my son

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.000 
of special about why try it my son
actually<00:02:53.450> inspired<00:02:53.930> me<00:02:54.079> he<00:02:54.200> wanted<00:02:54.470> he<00:02:54.890> wanted

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
actually inspired me he wanted he wanted

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.259 
actually inspired me he wanted he wanted
to<00:02:55.190> robot<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.549> turn<00:02:55.760> with<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:55.910> front<00:02:56.239> wheel

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
to robot that turn with the front wheel

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.059 
to robot that turn with the front wheel
had<00:02:56.900> three<00:02:57.110> wheels<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.470> turn<00:02:57.590> with<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.769> front

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
had three wheels and turn with the front

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.670 
had three wheels and turn with the front
and<00:02:58.599> it's<00:02:59.599> actually<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.959> stupid<00:03:00.230> way<00:03:00.319> to<00:03:00.349> steer

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
and it's actually a stupid way to steer

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.160 
and it's actually a stupid way to steer
if<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.130> have<00:03:01.310> two<00:03:01.670> motors<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.690> can<00:03:02.870> steer

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
if you have two motors you can steer

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.170 
if you have two motors you can steer
right<00:03:03.590> without<00:03:03.709> turning<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.459> it's<00:03:04.849> actually

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
right without turning and it's actually

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.110 
right without turning and it's actually
difficult<00:03:05.299> because<00:03:05.750> if<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.799> turn<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.880> front

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
difficult because if you turn the front

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.600 
difficult because if you turn the front
and<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.329> wheels<00:03:08.959> are<00:03:09.200> going<00:03:09.860> straight<00:03:09.980> it'll

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
and the wheels are going straight it'll

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.949 
and the wheels are going straight it'll
just<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.000> two<00:03:11.150> bills<00:03:11.329> going<00:03:11.480> straight<00:03:11.720> we'll

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
just the two bills going straight we'll

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.420 
just the two bills going straight we'll
just<00:03:12.140> drive<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.530> forward<00:03:12.739> despite<00:03:13.040> turn<00:03:13.310> the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
just drive you forward despite turn the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.800 
just drive you forward despite turn the
wheel<00:03:13.549> so<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.730> had<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:13.970> match<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.329> angles<00:03:14.660> and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
wheel so I had to match the angles and

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.690 
wheel so I had to match the angles and
things<00:03:14.989> but<00:03:15.560> it's<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.099> was<00:03:16.190> kind<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.519> fun

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
things but it's a it was kind of a fun

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.069 
things but it's a it was kind of a fun
learning<00:03:16.910> experience<00:03:17.450> of<00:03:17.630> doing<00:03:17.780> something

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
learning experience of doing something

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.379 
learning experience of doing something
stupid<00:03:18.350> just<00:03:19.160> academically<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.030> figure<00:03:20.239> out

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
stupid just academically to figure out

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.590 
stupid just academically to figure out
would<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.109> work<00:03:21.350> yeah<00:03:21.859> sure<00:03:22.160> oh<00:03:22.519> yeah<00:03:23.329> which

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
would it work yeah sure oh yeah which

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.420 
would it work yeah sure oh yeah which
one<00:03:23.780> let's<00:03:24.109> see<00:03:24.200> gravity<00:03:24.410> that's<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.889> bigger

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
one let's see gravity that's the bigger

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.520 
one let's see gravity that's the bigger
one<00:03:25.639> pick<00:03:26.299> up<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.569> pad<00:03:26.870> with<00:03:27.079> it<00:03:27.200> because<00:03:27.410> I

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
one pick up the pad with it because I

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.629 
one pick up the pad with it because I
don't<00:03:27.739> want<00:03:27.859> him<00:03:27.950> driving<00:03:28.069> around<00:03:28.310> too<00:03:28.519> much

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
don't want him driving around too much

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.259 
don't want him driving around too much
so<00:03:29.450> this<00:03:29.569> is<00:03:29.600> grabby<00:03:30.049> and<00:03:30.380> he's<00:03:30.920> kind<00:03:31.100> of<00:03:31.269> he

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
so this is grabby and he's kind of he

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.729 
so this is grabby and he's kind of he
started<00:03:32.600> out<00:03:32.720> with<00:03:32.870> this<00:03:33.049> sort<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.319> triangular

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
started out with this sort of triangular

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.470 
started out with this sort of triangular
crack<00:03:34.130> thing<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:34.639> I<00:03:34.670> was<00:03:34.940> kind<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.150> naming<00:03:35.389> him

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
crack thing so I was kind of naming him

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.770 
crack thing so I was kind of naming him

this is actually the frame of this is

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.680 
this is actually the frame of this is
based<00:04:39.740> off<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.220> very<00:04:40.490> first<00:04:40.760> robot<00:04:41.120> I<00:04:41.150> made<00:04:41.480> is

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
based off the very first robot I made is

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.540 
based off the very first robot I made is
the<00:04:42.230> start<00:04:42.500> here<00:04:42.650> robot<00:04:42.980> and<00:04:43.250> let's<00:04:43.400> make

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
the start here robot and let's make

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.210 
the start here robot and let's make
robots<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.200> it's<00:04:45.200> an<00:04:45.380> easy<00:04:45.530> start<00:04:45.890> but<00:04:46.190> the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
robots and it's an easy start but the

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.190 
robots and it's an easy start but the
wheels<00:04:46.490> have<00:04:46.700> like<00:04:46.970> all<00:04:47.240> dried<00:04:47.720> up<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:48.050> said

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
wheels have like all dried up and said

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.190 
wheels have like all dried up and said
it<00:04:48.350> like<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:49.460> doesn't<00:04:49.850> turn<00:04:49.940> real<00:04:50.120> good<00:04:50.270> so<00:04:50.480> but

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
it like it doesn't turn real good so but

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.950 
it like it doesn't turn real good so but
right<00:04:51.500> now<00:04:51.620> she's<00:04:51.860> not<00:04:52.420> drawing<00:04:53.420> anything<00:04:53.660> but

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
right now she's not drawing anything but

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.200 
right now she's not drawing anything but
she<00:04:54.080> does<00:04:54.230> look<00:04:54.470> around<00:04:54.800> but<00:04:55.640> I<00:04:55.730> see<00:04:55.910> where<00:04:56.060> she

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
she does look around but I see where she

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.060 
she does look around but I see where she
had<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.390> opportunity<00:04:56.840> yeah<00:04:56.960> well<00:04:57.680> she<00:04:57.950> will

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
had the opportunity yeah well she will

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.980 
had the opportunity yeah well she will
eventually<00:04:58.220> have<00:04:58.670> a<00:04:58.700> pen<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:58.970> draw<00:04:59.150> stuff<00:04:59.570> how

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
eventually have a pen and draw stuff how

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.540 
eventually have a pen and draw stuff how
long<00:05:00.140> does<00:05:00.230> it<00:05:00.320> take<00:05:00.500> to<00:05:00.530> take<00:05:01.100> you<00:05:01.220> to<00:05:01.340> make<00:05:01.520> a

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
long does it take to take you to make a

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.670 
long does it take to take you to make a
robot<00:05:01.910> like<00:05:02.210> this<00:05:02.480> start<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:02.990> finish<00:05:03.230> not<00:05:03.500> that

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
robot like this start to finish not that

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.380 
robot like this start to finish not that
long<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:04.070> can<00:05:04.190> probably<00:05:04.400> do<00:05:04.700> it<00:05:04.730> in<00:05:04.910> a<00:05:05.000> weekend

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
long you can probably do it in a weekend

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.000 
long you can probably do it in a weekend
I<00:05:05.540> mean<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:06.110> longest<00:05:06.410> part<00:05:06.590> is<00:05:06.740> probably

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
I mean the longest part is probably

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.320 
I mean the longest part is probably
ordering<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.490> parts<00:05:07.640> and<00:05:07.850> waiting<00:05:08.060> for<00:05:08.210> him

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
ordering the parts and waiting for him

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.760 
ordering the parts and waiting for him
and<00:05:08.390> everybody's<00:05:08.750> like<00:05:08.780> I<00:05:09.050> can't<00:05:09.530> wait<00:05:09.620> to<00:05:09.650> my

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770

robotics and stuff so this is a shield

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.360 
robotics and stuff so this is a shield
that<00:05:28.400> he<00:05:28.640> made<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:30.020> it's<00:05:30.620> the<00:05:30.770> robot<00:05:31.070> builders

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
that he made and it's the robot builders

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.040 
that he made and it's the robot builders
shield<00:05:31.610> and<00:05:31.760> once<00:05:31.880> again<00:05:32.000> it's<00:05:32.360> a<00:05:32.780> it's<00:05:32.990> a

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
bunch of pins for sensors and pins to

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.270 
bunch of pins for sensors and pins to
run<00:05:39.050> service<00:05:39.410> so<00:05:39.530> you<00:05:39.590> could<00:05:39.770> run<00:05:39.950> you<00:05:40.190> could

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
run service so you could run you could

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.340 
run service so you could run you could
build<00:05:40.460> a<00:05:40.730> pretty<00:05:41.270> complex<00:05:41.600> robot<00:05:41.960> with<00:05:42.170> that

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350
