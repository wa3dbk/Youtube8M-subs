00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.540
 hi everyone today I present you some 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.380
 how many curiosities of skyrim have I gone 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.120
 watching and I've been recording good we're going to 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.910
 start with the first the first 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.860
 we can see a kind of hidden sword 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.580
 what is 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.050
 in a small lake north of Basin 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.630
 dreary wind where were the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.939
 giant and well we can see an arm a 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.970
 skeleton holding a sword that yes 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.149
 well it is very powerful and although there is no 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:35.320
 nothing especially good yes we can 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:37.899
 see an arm with a sword that is 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.920
 quite unusual in Skyrim can only be 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.920
 see on this site 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.239
 well the next the next 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.500
 curiosity is the summit the leap of the 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:02.920
 bards and refers to the jumps of 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.560
 Faith of the game Assassin's Creed 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.430
 can jump and die so it can 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.909
 jump and live if you talk to a ipc that 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.909
 is under 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.159
 I think it challenges you to jump and jump well 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.390
 because it gives you money 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.390
 and work yourselves 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.729
 the next curiosity is a 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.729
 reference that makes pacman that is 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.229
 framed in the ndong house the 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.170
 found I have looked at other houses and 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.650
 it was not and it's a reference to pacman 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.480
 with a broken cheese if you have seen 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.670
 I'm going to teach a little bit we're going to see nothing 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.890
 the more we enter through the door we continue to 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:07.230
 this room and here we have a heavy 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.470
 party with several garlic 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.020
 well you see that the eye is an egg and 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.350
 clearly is a reference is a is 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.350
 a joke 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.940
 in white race we can also see 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.280
 a curiosity that is in the center of 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.720
 the city ​​and that is the white tree of 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.090
 white race that also has a 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.450
 own mission where we get the whip 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.730
 of the nettles and is based on it in the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.780
 white tree of the Lord's movie 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:44.430
 of the rings of the great tree of mines 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.410
 tirith that he did not have not flourished and 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.090
 that's a reference be two rings 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.090
 like many in this game 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.350
 finally in this video of curiosities 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.110
 I'm going to show a curiosity what good 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.390
 what 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.550
 it seems bullshit but hey I 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:18.710
 wanted to poke likewise is the house of 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:21.800
 the secret of anise in your own home 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.020
 when you go to this lady's house 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.840
 apparently as she herself says that 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.700
 it's a normal signal that does nothing 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.890
 As you search through your house you see that there is 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.940
 a kind of trapdoor and you can download 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:39.530
 to a basement that is quite gloomy 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.800
 with fog with alchemy that does not 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.370
 plot nothing good and when you download you can 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.519
 see that effectively 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.110
 it's like a crow witch or something or 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.120
 belonging to 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.030
 a group of d 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.760
 of necromancer something quite more seen in 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.670

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.650

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.840
