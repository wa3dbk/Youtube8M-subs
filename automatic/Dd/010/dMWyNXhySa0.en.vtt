00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
to dampen it and the reason for that its

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.110 
to dampen it and the reason for that its
own<00:00:43.739> apt<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.070> go<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> work<00:00:44.370> tomorrow<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.910> I

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
own apt to go to work tomorrow and I

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.119 
own apt to go to work tomorrow and I
don't<00:00:45.149> want<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:46.020> wet<00:00:46.410> hair<00:00:46.440> because

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
don't want to do it on wet hair because

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.209 
don't want to do it on wet hair because
it<00:00:47.160> will<00:00:47.370> take<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.969> long<00:00:48.379> to<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.530> dry<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
it will take so long to get dry when I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.200 
it will take so long to get dry when I
get<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> won't<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.940> dry<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.930> dampen<00:00:52.739> it

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
get up it won't be dry so I dampen it

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.080 
get up it won't be dry so I dampen it
make<00:00:54.210> sure<00:00:54.239> that's<00:00:54.690> fully<00:00:55.379> detangled<00:00:59.090> make

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
make sure that's fully detangled make

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.020

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
mine it's smooth over you know don't do

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.240 
mine it's smooth over you know don't do
it<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:27.440> tight<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:27.710> you're<00:01:27.950> obviously

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
it so tight that you're obviously

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:54.999 
it so tight that you're obviously
pulling<00:01:28.640> your<00:01:28.760> hair<00:01:28.910> out<00:01:28.970> but<00:01:31.150> tight<00:01:32.150> enough

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.350

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
make sure it's to tangle all the way you

that<00:02:18.300> mistake<00:02:18.360> while<00:02:19.350> my<00:02:19.560> relax<00:02:19.920> here<00:02:20.190> when<00:02:20.310> I

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
that mistake while my relax here when I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.460 
that mistake while my relax here when I
was<00:02:20.520> first<00:02:20.640> when<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.180> over<00:02:21.690> this<00:02:22.319> is

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
was first when you do over this is

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.360 
was first when you do over this is
my<00:02:22.620> first<00:02:23.310> roller<00:02:24.150> stick<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:24.900> fully<00:02:25.709> natural

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
my first roller stick on fully natural

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.030 
my first roller stick on fully natural
hair<00:02:27.350> so<00:02:28.350> let's<00:02:28.830> hope<00:02:29.010> for<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.250> best<00:02:30.890> which<00:02:31.890> I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
hair so let's hope for the best which I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.100 
hair so let's hope for the best which I
think<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.370> will<00:02:32.459> be<00:02:32.580> okay<00:02:32.880> because<00:02:34.160> Dave<00:02:36.110> I've

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
think it will be okay because Dave I've

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
and on my relax here so how hard can it

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:56.400 
and on my relax here so how hard can it
be

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:10.740 

unlike<00:02:57.220> over<00:03:08.760> I'm<00:03:09.760> just<00:03:10.000> damping<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.600> with

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
unlike over I'm just damping it with

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.930 
unlike over I'm just damping it with
water<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.710> olive<00:03:12.430> oil<00:03:14.430> I'm<00:03:15.430> not<00:03:15.550> picnicking

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
Joe in it which I probably should have

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:38.980
