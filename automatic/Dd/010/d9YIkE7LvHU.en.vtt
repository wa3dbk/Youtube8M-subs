00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.090
 Hello everyone and welcome one in which 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.090
 today we have the day to arrange with me 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:27.640
 this video because the constant sounds 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:30.250
 I grew up but since I will be very punctual and 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.860
 they will have a video almost more I hope that what 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.370
 enjoy sharing it and now 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.410
 let's start and good to start I want 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.410
 First of all, ask for their forgiveness 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.540
 these dates are not adequate but 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.000
 I had no other choice then good 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.430
 We can first moisturize the hair 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.760
 that these oil droplets are used 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.210
 of argan good let's start with the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.210
 face 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.720
 one 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.100
 as a refresher for the eyes to 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.100
 the dark circles and all that 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.830
 this like this moisturizer as average 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.710
 late but you also get a solar factor 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.540
 then you can facilitate me more than 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.670
 apply with the blocker and then the 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.140
 cream then this one comes two for one of 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.140
 easier dream 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.000
 and be it because the balance as 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.950
 waiting for the penalties 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.370
 and that would be the thread part of that 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.990
 what I normally do for when 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.710
 I put on my makeup and those things 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.710
 then scholarship holder 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.820
 well, clearly or with a beauty like 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.820
 goals that easier 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.960
 who 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.110
 so 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.140
 here 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.430
 now we will continue with the dinners then 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.890
 what I do is buy as a 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.890
 transparent nazas tab and he used it 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.390
 for dinner only then are they 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.810
 insult us spain 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.630
 it was close 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.630
 one destination the other 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.380
 when I do not want it to be very 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.060
 loaded it so I'm just put 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.870
 ready but for the eyes you can use 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.370
 like a rose with coffee is something very 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.370
 simple and easy to do 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.170
 and I'm going to use it as a coffee 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.520
 many videos have been seen 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.440
 first frame and then first more and 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.760
 then let's blur we 're going to 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.530
 worry if they have left game or things 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.730
 well for the style 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.730
 everything can be blurred 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.989
 and because this is something very simple 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.819
 It has taken pretension and striking 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.459
 because it can serve for the day until 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.989
 for college the university and what 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.989
 I will use a concealer 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.030
 I'm thinking about making a draw but 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.840
 I do not know you have to why not 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.340
 I do not know how it is done then would like 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.830
 as on how it's done because I 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.450
 I would like to have a detail with some of 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.310
 you because I do not know 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:57.620
 I think they have supported me a lot 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.629
 and I would like to give you a detail 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.569
 also the cut mark of the piece 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:09.069
 what do I feel under the presents 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:09.069
 that we did not know then the cat line 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.050
 to win it to wear this one look at my 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.050
 eyes 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:37.460
 it would be a bit of outline 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:39.680
 and now with a pencil or in my days 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.860
 and a little bit of brightness 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.810
 and if we have the makeup now we're going 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.470
 with him and good now we go with the 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.120
 hair then I have it smooth 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.199
 times and I want it with more fondita 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.539
 because sometimes it 's the same always 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.940
 then I'm going to make some very 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.960
 fresh very relaxed and very easy to 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.960
 do that is the most important thing 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.810
 meanwhile let's go 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.820
 so 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.820
 let's roll up 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.110
 and we will expect to count 15 seconds the 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.470
 I want 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.570
 and how could they see this was for this 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.090
 address 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.620
 because it stays like this now in the next 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.020
 male that we are going to catch we are going to catch it 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.480
 we're going to roll it up for the other side 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.930
 with that to make more loose knowing more 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:57.060
 natural and with much more volume 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.060
