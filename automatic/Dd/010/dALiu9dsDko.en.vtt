00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.160
 ah 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.240
 it's as if less another moment that 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.840
 they saw it in the title van gogh great 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.210
 5 online this king and asia and how 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.029
 they listened like that is not and they wonder 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.160
 where can I see this interest, why not even more 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.170
 no less is in this location 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.960
 I'm going to give them right now here in 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.790
 the desert right here in this part 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.890
 where are you seeing on the map right here 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.840
 is this historic van gogh 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.790
 civilians then in a little thing before to 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.310
 those who do not know what van houtte is 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.469
 maingot was a city like it is right now 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.420
 the tall and blind build but in san 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.510
 Andreas and San Andreas is the game that 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.570
 inspired the big one missing because it 's like no 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.640
 I can tell you fire in game of black ops 1 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.679
 and then they did black ops studies or 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.750
 be this is the big larks fruits 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.180
 mastered that they do not know or the san 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.040
 Andrew taught them is just this game 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.290
 in fact I have it bought I bought it 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.900
 long ago he taught them this is the great 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.030
 defect san andreas this is the game that 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.040
 it was before it was from playstation 2 and 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.080
 thanks to this game they did what was 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.020
 doing the big one missed 5 in fact the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.439
 city is planned in california 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.039
 its particularity is located what is going 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.960
 making the angels and san francisco 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.390
 but san francisco did not appear here 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.920
 because because they replaced it with the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.509
 mike angels and they focused on massa in 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.490
 the city of what the saints are doing 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.579
 what is all this and blend control that is 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.219
 like the desert not then let's go to 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.020
 point to all this and but first thing 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.640
 what they will have to do is enter this 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.500
 store and once they have entered 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.840
 they will have to take out a weapon they want 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.969
 and they will have to kill the manager there 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.250
 once done this now you can see 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.869
 the historical that is here as they see it 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.670
 I got here just do stars 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.890
 I'm going to talk to Lester to have them removed 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.599
 the stars then I'm going to 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.579
 teach this interest that I to the 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.079
 I really thought it was great that they 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.329
 put this and they have agreed to 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.160
 his game past and apart he sees 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.989
 pretty good no and this makes me think 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.910
 in a new possibility that just 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.739
 Now I'm going to tell you how you see here 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.370
 we zoom in there where is the 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.680
 employee 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.470
 there is the employee with courage highway 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.010
 already they saw pinche muerto pinche zombie or 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.489
 I killed him and the dead man is alive 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.110
 what fart scared me this mom to end 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.750
 right here as you are seeing it next 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.689
 of the zombie pimp there with what they see is very 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.299
 crazy doing the historical adventures or 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.010
 whether they can not see it and I see 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.510
 I'm going to put them with sniper and 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.950
 now let's put the original image 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.959
 so that you realize that there is 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.180
 here as you see this guy is breathing 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.860
 and moving is already dead is that 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.090
 act is that they are here as they see it already 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.159
 we are seeing what the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.870
 ventures and is the little sign not now 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.879
 eliocroca side of this I will have put 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.010
 the little sign and now let's put it like that 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.079
 to make the comparison with the 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.819
 we are also going to remove the reticle as well 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.799
 it looks much better and next to this 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.920
 You will see a small box which I am going to 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.900
 show that you are doing the entry of 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.760
 welcome to the adventures and for which 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.650
 do not know the adventures were part of 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.109
 casino of big points to andrás and if 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.599
 they do not understand me it was like a parody 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.280
 say so a representation a 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.920
 little bit of what he's doing 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.920
 the vegas as you know las vegas is where 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.780
 are all the casinos of the USA and it's in 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.970
 the desert in fact that if you were going 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.680
 to what was going to be the adventures that 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.980
 that's what it was called because in big cars 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.959
 san andreas we have 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.819
 so to speak, four regions have 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.099
 like what is doing blind with trini 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.900
 in part he lives like that because there he is 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.610
 located the hill exiled then 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.099
 we understand what we are doing in the forest 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.650
 chile with the forest and apart from that 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.209
 we have sun iron saints and 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.400
 adventures the truth that I love 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.230
 and I wanted to tell you a little theory 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.000
 that I have not me that maybe they can 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.540
 take out some great cars in the future 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.220
 five episodes from from san andreas or 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.890
 something like that not to see that there would be enough 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.260
 well and that in this one we do not put the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.660
 saints or that they put us rather what 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.010
 is doing the good luck and sant fierro 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.170
 which is a city ​​to me which 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.970
 He loved what he was doing 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.440
 adventure is more than anything right could you 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.169
 play the casino and all that also for 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.030
 this is believed that there may be some dlc 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.350
 of casinos then that you liked 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.780

 take out the shotgun to kill him to see with

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.880
 moves to die and I want to see his face 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.100

 I miss this to see I want to see you in the 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.520

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.040
 I finish it but I want to see if it continues 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.620
