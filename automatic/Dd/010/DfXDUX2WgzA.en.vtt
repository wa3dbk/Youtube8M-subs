00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.710
 locker room for a moment stop us

 never managed to do anyone in the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.110
 history of juventus had hit 11 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.200
 consecutive victories knowing here is the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.840
 There have been history of Juventus 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.129
 extraordinary teams not to witness 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.680
 that they really are something 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.739
 incredible merit of the boys merit of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.039
 all the people who contributed to 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.500
 this achievement of this success 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.390
 by the technical staff of the soft company 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.650
 technician for warehouse workers and gardeners 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.020
 all the people who allowed us 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.060
 to get this incredible record 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.510
 now let's try to continue 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.310
 victories so who will come after us 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.080
 will find a little harder to try to 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.330
 beat what we have built 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.520
 mixed we stay on the race or was one 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.500
 race very difficult because recover 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.240
 Cagliari in this field that is hard and 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.740
 it will be hard for anyone it was not easy 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.890
 for no one according to tel aviv was 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.970
 overflowing, however, let's not forget that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.040
 the cagliari 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.320
 in this genre went blocked the 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.700
 naples on a1 the rome is blocked 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.770
 at the Olympic 0 0 this 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.540
 testimony that our direct 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.100
 competitors had not found life 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.920
 easy against this cagliari who 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 I think it's a great team in pink 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.270
 owns players that surely 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.980
 they can aspire to important levels 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.580
 anything 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.980
 well it was not easy to recover afterwards 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.930
 that goal taken 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.230
 we were good at putting things back to 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.750
 place and then in the second half it was 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:13.010
 managed to spread also a accomplice 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.010
 important and growing physical condition 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:21.920
 story of the great white who embraces 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.220
 the true 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.220
 Now 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.490
 Yup
