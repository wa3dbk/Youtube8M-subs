just<00:02:26.400> won't<00:02:26.580> hurt<00:02:26.819> us<00:02:27.260> like<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.410> guy<00:02:28.620> for

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
just won't hurt us like this guy for

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:42.360 
just won't hurt us like this guy for
example<00:02:30.290> they<00:02:31.290> just<00:02:31.440> kill<00:02:31.650> him

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.789 

so<00:02:43.269> by<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.450> end<00:02:43.569> of<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.319> usually<00:02:44.590> get

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
so by the end of this you usually get

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.970 
so by the end of this you usually get
around<00:02:45.010> like<00:02:45.159> 53<00:02:45.730> kills<00:02:45.970> or<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.390> with<00:02:47.260> no<00:02:47.709> debt

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
around like 53 kills or so with no debt

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
hackers out there right now a Peter Pan

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.390 
hackers out there right now a Peter Pan
came<00:04:14.780> out<00:04:14.930> with<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.139> new<00:04:15.319> hack<00:04:15.680> for<00:04:16.130> being

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
came out with the new hack for being

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.050 
came out with the new hack for being
invisible<00:04:16.669> on<00:04:17.620> normal<00:04:18.620> public<00:04:18.829> matches<00:04:19.160> where

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
invisible on normal public matches where

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.090 
invisible on normal public matches where
you<00:04:20.120> don't<00:04:20.209> have<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.539> be<00:04:20.660> host<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:21.739> can

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
you don't have to be host so you can

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.610 
you don't have to be host so you can
just<00:04:22.130> join<00:04:22.400> any<00:04:22.699> match<00:04:22.940> any<00:04:23.440> single<00:04:24.440> game<00:04:24.590> that

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
just join any match any single game that

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.909 
just join any match any single game that
you<00:04:24.800> want<00:04:25.009> and<00:04:25.270> he's<00:04:26.270> made<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.110> new<00:04:27.350> hack<00:04:27.590> that

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
you want and he's made a new hack that

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.850 
you want and he's made a new hack that
um<00:04:28.900> that<00:04:29.900> will<00:04:30.080> let<00:04:30.229> you<00:04:30.289> be<00:04:30.410> in<00:04:30.470> this<00:04:30.650> bowl

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
um that will let you be in this bowl

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.140 
um that will let you be in this bowl
where<00:04:31.099> you<00:04:31.190> sit<00:04:31.580> in<00:04:31.610> front<00:04:31.729> of<00:04:31.880> people<00:04:32.090> and

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
where you sit in front of people and

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150 
where you sit in front of people and
they<00:04:32.270> won't<00:04:32.449> get<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.660> see<00:04:32.840> you<00:04:32.960> he<00:04:33.919> hasn't

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
they won't get to see you he hasn't

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.640 
they won't get to see you he hasn't
released<00:04:34.370> yet<00:04:34.610> he<00:04:35.599> wants<00:04:35.810> 5000<00:04:36.410> subscribers

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
released yet he wants 5000 subscribers

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.370 
released yet he wants 5000 subscribers
so<00:04:37.639> if<00:04:38.060> any<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.330> you<00:04:38.419> want<00:04:38.630> that<00:04:38.840> could<00:04:39.199> really

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
so if any of you want that could really

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.100 
so if any of you want that could really
bad<00:04:39.620> go<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:40.460> as<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:40.849> channel<00:04:41.389> and<00:04:41.599> subscribe<00:04:41.690> to

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
bad go to as a channel and subscribe to

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.629 
bad go to as a channel and subscribe to
them<00:04:42.229> and<00:04:42.380> then<00:04:43.310> he'll<00:04:43.550> release<00:04:43.880> the

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
them and then he'll release the

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.820 
them and then he'll release the
invincible<00:04:46.639> code<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.030> invisible<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:48.500> it'll

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
invincible code and invisible so it'll

00:04:48.830 --> 00:05:06.119 
invincible code and invisible so it'll
be<00:04:48.860> cool

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.279 

and<00:05:06.309> by<00:05:06.879> the<00:05:06.909> way<00:05:07.059> i'm<00:05:07.179> on<00:05:07.300> level<00:05:07.509> like<00:05:07.629> i'm

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.489 
and by the way i'm on level like i'm
only<00:05:08.439> level<00:05:08.969> 21<00:05:09.969> on<00:05:10.179> this<00:05:10.330> guy<00:05:10.509> this<00:05:11.229> was<00:05:11.379> all

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:11.499 
only level 21 on this guy this was all

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:13.409 
only level 21 on this guy this was all
from<00:05:11.649> hacking<00:05:12.039> I've<00:05:12.219> made<00:05:12.550> him<00:05:12.759> like<00:05:12.969> a<00:05:13.149> couple

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
from hacking I've made him like a couple

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.509 
from hacking I've made him like a couple
days<00:05:13.659> ago<00:05:13.949> so<00:05:16.499> he's<00:05:17.499> not<00:05:17.709> like<00:05:18.099> the<00:05:18.129> greatest

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:18.519 
days ago so he's not like the greatest

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.999 
days ago so he's not like the greatest
but<00:05:18.999> he's<00:05:19.029> my<00:05:19.449> hacking<00:05:19.809> guy<00:05:19.929> so<00:05:20.259> whenever<00:05:20.860> I

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
but he's my hacking guy so whenever I

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.409 
but he's my hacking guy so whenever I
went<00:05:21.159> to<00:05:21.249> hack<00:05:21.429> I<00:05:21.610> was<00:05:21.729> come<00:05:21.879> on<00:05:21.999> to<00:05:22.089> him<00:05:22.239> and

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
went to hack I was come on to him and

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:33.690 
went to hack I was come on to him and
just<00:05:22.479> hack

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.730 

and<00:05:34.210> also<00:05:34.360> that's<00:05:34.720> it<00:05:34.930> goes<00:05:35.290> really<00:05:35.440> fast

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
and also that's it goes really fast

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.640 
and also that's it goes really fast
depending<00:05:36.280> on<00:05:36.460> how<00:05:36.640> small<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.240> level<00:05:37.780> is<00:05:37.870> like

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
depending on how small the level is like

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.930 
depending on how small the level is like
I<00:05:38.770> was<00:05:38.890> playing<00:05:39.070> shipment<00:05:39.490> one<00:05:39.580> time<00:05:39.790> with

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
I was playing shipment one time with

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.670 
I was playing shipment one time with
shipment<00:05:40.510> with<00:05:40.600> one<00:05:40.840> time<00:05:41.020> with<00:05:41.170> hacks<00:05:41.380> and

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
shipment with one time with hacks and

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.590 
shipment with one time with hacks and
the<00:05:42.490> game<00:05:42.670> ended<00:05:43.030> within<00:05:43.240> like<00:05:43.480> a<00:05:43.510> couple

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
the game ended within like a couple

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.450 
the game ended within like a couple
minutes<00:05:43.960> because<00:05:44.320> its<00:05:44.830> shipment<00:05:45.310> in<00:05:45.430> the

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
minutes because its shipment in the

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:53.910 
minutes because its shipment in the
levels<00:05:45.880> like<00:05:46.150> tiny<00:05:46.720> has<00:05:47.080> anything<00:05:47.850> so

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.650 

and<00:05:54.490> some<00:05:54.670> people<00:05:54.760> are<00:05:54.940> really<00:05:54.970> dumb<00:05:55.360> because

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
and some people are really dumb because

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.600 
and some people are really dumb because
they<00:05:55.840> know<00:05:55.990> I'm<00:05:56.080> hacking<00:05:56.310> then<00:05:57.310> they<00:05:57.430> won't

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
they know I'm hacking then they won't

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.360 
they know I'm hacking then they won't
even<00:05:57.700> run<00:05:57.970> to<00:05:58.090> me<00:05:58.210> for<00:05:58.660> some<00:05:58.810> odd<00:05:58.990> reason<00:05:59.370> they

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
even run to me for some odd reason they

even run to me for some odd reason they
won't<00:06:00.550> even<00:06:00.640> run<00:06:00.910> they'll<00:06:01.120> just<00:06:01.270> try<00:06:01.750> and

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
won't even run they'll just try and

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.990 
won't even run they'll just try and
attack<00:06:02.140> me<00:06:02.410> even<00:06:03.250> though<00:06:03.340> they'll<00:06:03.490> fail<00:06:03.730> every
