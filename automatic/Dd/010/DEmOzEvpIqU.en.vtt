00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.099
 ok so the theme would be treeless 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.540
 It started for me over ten years ago 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.059
 then here also on the equitana 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.980
 At that time the first treeless papers came 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.630
 from italy that were the torsion side 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.320
 at that time they were in favor of the distance 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.250
 used 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.890
 today, everyone actually knows this 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.140
 theme treeless saddle 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.140
 But there are so many and so much 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.870
 it was a lot of bad treeless page 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.790
 Just now my concern is that I'm around 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.040
 give them a better buying guide 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.300
 or also give information to 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 if you can get such a saddle 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.710
 just want to buy a bit 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.760
 talk about what's up there but 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.950
 first I would like again briefly on 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.370
 enter the biomechanics of the horse 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.539
 that means a horse needs that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.120
 yes my previous speaker here already 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.829
 all kinds of running actually needs 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.350
 a certain attitude about orderly 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.290
 to be able to walk and this attitude can 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.549
 It certainly will not take it if it is 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.360
 pain in the back has by one 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.360
 inappropriate saddle 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.070
 you see here that should show 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.950
 which energies during riding in 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.950
 this region of the satellite position-act 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.930
 that often happens, you know it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.920
 have a note here behind his kyle 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.750
 pillow and then the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.990
 Motion energy from the backhand 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.009
 then it can hurt here and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.869
 lead to pressure 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.299
 or if the pillow channel here in 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.030
 this area is not far enough then 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.930
 also press the cushions of a saddle 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.189
 The spine continues to look like horses 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.680
 can change 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.320
 within a minute just because of it 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.540
 right here and then here in 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.630
 the curve so that's the saddle situation 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.270
 is changing in this area or 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.070
 But the saddle situation changes because 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.259
 the horse's head down has the back 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.930
 leipzig on here has it's driving upside down 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.969
 above and it forms a low back 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.700
 and if you imagine her now 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.679
 have a whopping and this saddle will 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.440
 just in a certain condition 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.940
 So, for example, when trying it on here 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.190
 the horse has galloped afterward 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.180
 further down then the back presses here 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.180
 pure in the saddle
