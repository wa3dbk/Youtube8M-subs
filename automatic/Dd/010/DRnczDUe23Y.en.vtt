00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
to rob that awesome vault I think it'd

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.250 
to rob that awesome vault I think it'd
be<00:06:51.080> even<00:06:51.200> better<00:06:51.350> if<00:06:51.590> we<00:06:52.280> could<00:06:52.310> do<00:06:52.490> it<00:06:52.610> without

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
be even better if we could do it without

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.320

officers I think that'd probably be

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.090

better<00:06:57.710> but<00:06:58.430> um<00:06:59.050> it<00:07:00.050> was<00:07:00.170> good<00:07:00.200> it<00:07:00.650> was<00:07:00.740> good<00:07:00.770> I
