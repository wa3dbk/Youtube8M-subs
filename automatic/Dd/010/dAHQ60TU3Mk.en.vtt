SIM card slots for normal SIM cards it's

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.620 
SIM card slots for normal SIM cards it's
pretty<00:01:28.560> seldom<00:01:28.950> right<00:01:29.100> now<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.490> over<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:30.509> is

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
pretty seldom right now and over here is

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.529 
pretty seldom right now and over here is
a<00:01:30.869> micro<00:01:31.649> SD<00:01:31.950> card<00:01:32.219> reader<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.179> expand

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
a micro SD card reader so you can expand

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.190 
a micro SD card reader so you can expand
the<00:01:33.630> memory<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.890> battery<00:01:35.250> has<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> capacity<00:01:35.579> of

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
the memory the battery has a capacity of

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.230 
the memory the battery has a capacity of
1800<00:01:37.200> million<00:01:37.469> per<00:01:37.590> hours<00:01:37.649> so<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.490> guess<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
1800 million per hours so I guess you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.620 
1800 million per hours so I guess you
get<00:01:39.359> quite<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.899> nice<00:01:40.259> battery<00:01:40.979> life<00:01:41.219> with<00:01:41.399> this

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
get quite a nice battery life with this

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.190 
get quite a nice battery life with this
the<00:01:42.630> display<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.289> name<00:01:44.159> implies<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:45.200> 4.5

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the display as the name implies is 4.5

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.800 
the display as the name implies is 4.5
inch<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.740> pretty<00:01:49.740> nice<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.640> my<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.240> my<00:01:51.299> opinion

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
inch so pretty nice for my in my opinion

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.120 
inch so pretty nice for my in my opinion
because<00:01:51.929> I<00:01:52.229> really<00:01:52.649> don't<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:53.299> tablets<00:01:54.920> as<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
because I really don't like tablets as a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.300 
because I really don't like tablets as a
resolution<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:58.700> 854<00:01:59.700> by<00:01:59.999> 480<00:02:00.689> pixel<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.890> it's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
resolution of 854 by 480 pixel so it's

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.539 
resolution of 854 by 480 pixel so it's
not<00:02:02.579> HD<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.329> as<00:02:03.539> you<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:04.439> when<00:02:04.679> you<00:02:04.829> when

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
not HD but as you can see when you when

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.859 
not HD but as you can see when you when
i<00:02:05.640> zoom<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.499> can<00:02:07.499> still<00:02:08.210> see<00:02:09.210> it's

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
i zoom in here you can still see it's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.000 
i zoom in here you can still see it's
pretty<00:02:10.170> nice
