00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.170
 welcome again to this channel in 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:08.170
 the one that we're going to be reviewing this 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.240
 free online soccer application 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.780
 with this application you will be able to see 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.490
 football matches live from your 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.529
 tablet or your smartphone 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.900
 this application requires flash player 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.359
 so yes is that if you do not have it then 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.609
 get it there I leave the link in the 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.830
 description but let's see it is a 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.980
 very simple application where we go 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.219
 to have on this side channels as you see 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.739
 shows sports channels and espx fox and 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.059
 then there says channel 18 in 2 but 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.680
 that's not so important is what 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.289
 important is this section that says 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.420
 matches in this you will be able to see the 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.820
 matches that are going to happen or those that are 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.370
 happening right now I do not know if there are any of 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.739
 we are going to see if this is still 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.600
 and you just have to put it 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.820
 show an advertisement message 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.699
 you just put it no thanks and then it goes 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.559
 to appear another advertising message and 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.949
 alone is going to close but look like 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.259
 come there is the game and it started 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.450
 reproduce and is a very good 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.930
 application because in fact it does not cut 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.880
 it does not get stuck and well I really like it 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.310
 a lot to be able to watch matches that do not 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.920
 are happening on open television and 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.690
 I can see them from my tablet and then 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.990
 well enjoy a good match 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.250
 football at any time we are going to 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.619
 wait for the ad to be removed 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.960
 only here the seconds are advancing 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:37.640
 3 2 1 and ready the ad is removed and now 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.550
 I can be here watching this game and 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.590
 here you have an option on the little screen 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.750
 if you want to change the size of the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.940
 player you can change it too 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.240
 but this time we're not going to 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.149
 want to change and ready that simple 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.550
 the application but very useful and if you 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.600
 wants to leave simply press back you 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.960
 send message you want 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.310
 the party yes and ready here you can good 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.009
 shows you another ad you give no 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.049
 thanks but and that's it 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.300
 here you can see the agenda of matches 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.060
 what is going to happen what is happening and 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.709
 simple application very good and it 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.730
 I recommend you remember that you should have 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:20.350
 installed flash player and something else if your 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.610
 device is samsung some 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.480
 interfaces have problems with this 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.420
 application like these samsung widgets 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.450
 Well, this application has problems with 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.760
 touchwiz yes it is if it is not jelly beans and ya 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.340
 You have Jay Levine and he has these guys 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.650
 Well, you can use it very well if you do not 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.239
 you have your tweet you are going to have problems and 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.130
 It is not going to be able to use but I hope that you 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.459
 have liked this application and if you 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.870
