00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.010 
in the parks he said he would just be
walking<00:02:02.100> around<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:03.000> he<00:02:03.360> would<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.840> an

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
walking around and he would see an

alligator<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:05.329> you<00:02:06.329> know<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> couple<00:02:06.840> of

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
alligator like you know a couple of

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.339 
alligator like you know a couple of
yards<00:02:07.170> away<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.270> apparently<00:02:09.270> they<00:02:09.899> don't

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
yards away and apparently they don't

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.240 
yards away and apparently they don't
feel<00:02:10.679> threatened<00:02:11.160> by<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.370> unless<00:02:11.940> you

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
feel threatened by you unless you

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.160 
feel threatened by you unless you
like<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.370> certain<00:02:12.730> number<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.150> feet<00:02:13.270> from<00:02:13.990> them

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
like a certain number of feet from them

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.110 
like a certain number of feet from them
and<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.560> think<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:14.920> like<00:02:15.070> 13<00:02:15.550> feet<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.090> like

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and I think it's like 13 feet is like

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.750 
and I think it's like 13 feet is like
the<00:02:16.990> danger<00:02:17.410> zone<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:18.160> if<00:02:18.280> you're<00:02:18.430> more<00:02:18.610> than

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
the danger zone but if you're more than

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.820 
the danger zone but if you're more than
13<00:02:19.180> feet<00:02:19.420> away<00:02:19.540> from<00:02:19.690> them<00:02:19.960> they<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.410> don't

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
13 feet away from them they like don't

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.290 
13 feet away from them they like don't
consider<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.550> threat<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.970> they're<00:02:22.120> just

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
the thought that counts I only have five

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.150 
the thought that counts I only have five
of<00:03:10.030> these<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:10.900> did<00:03:11.080> keep<00:03:11.320> one<00:03:11.380> for<00:03:11.770> myself

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
of these and I did keep one for myself

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.400 
of these and I did keep one for myself
because<00:03:12.489> you<00:03:13.239> know<00:03:13.450> my<00:03:13.690> dad<00:03:13.870> bought<00:03:14.050> me<00:03:14.230> these

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
because you know my dad bought me these

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.949 
because you know my dad bought me these
teeth<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:14.980> figured<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.670> better<00:03:16.060> keep<00:03:16.600> one<00:03:16.750> for

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
teeth so I figured I better keep one for

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.050 
teeth so I figured I better keep one for
myself<00:03:17.320> so<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.680> he<00:03:17.890> still<00:03:18.430> feels<00:03:18.670> like<00:03:18.880> it

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
myself so that he still feels like it

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.830 
myself so that he still feels like it
