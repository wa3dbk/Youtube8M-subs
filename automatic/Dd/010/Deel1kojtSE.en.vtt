00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.450

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.070
 ask for intervention and we ask 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:22.279

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:24.200
 of the care intervention 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.610
 what a valenti five with jon m of campanita 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.610
 university for agenda quest 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.840
 hello good morning roll of the world 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.730
 I wanted to know if he appeared the best 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.160
 match of the madrid of the three d league 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.160
 we would do now I go match was a good 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.230
 party started in the past 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.270
 in the game with a lot of intensity 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.270
 after 15 minutes of the team 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.429
 I've started playing with more rhythm 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.460
 first time it was nine good had 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.200
 played 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.870
 plus 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.540
 I believe that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.100
 on the computer my life half an hour 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.090
 tomás 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.250
 when the mister tomás 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.890
 gonzález-martín de bbc the public has 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.869
 applauded and chanted the disc name 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.159
 the name of madrid especially that 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.869
 many applause has also created 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.740
 Christian for his goal he needed to 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.509
 goal to Christian 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.090
 we are seeing better army modric 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:29.119
 last year what do you think of the 3 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.659
 I think we played a game 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:37.700
 fantastic also and Christian disco 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.970
 marked by him is good to mark no no 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.190
 I had trouble with this more 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.920
 to score a goal for a striker is 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:52.500
 always a good thing 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.500
 nothing else I create a disc 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.049
 I was doing very well 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.590
 It seems that he plays a lot of time here 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:06.429
 has personality of ability 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.560
 a very good player for us 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.980
 changing the environment was good but it was 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.400
 well I think the stadium has helped the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.159
 team to play everything well 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.010
 or the politics of everyone talking about 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.840
 stadium and the environment of the given theme two 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.950
 assists but there has been a bit of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.890
 impatience 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.970
 with him you do not understand this or he stops you has not 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.330
 understood understood 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.740
 I think everything was very clear one thing 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.090
 benzema were 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.540
 a little bit of pita 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.040
 di maria 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.040
 all the whole stadium 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:00.390
 he spoke applauded and Maria sr fans 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.680
 they look at the work a lot, I do not think 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.349
 I thought 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.379
 in a different position from him not 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:12.579
 you need to work a lot more I think it's 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:15.120
 a signal today very clear for all the 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.120
 work 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.570
 is applauded 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.060
 for another day of pomegranate with a bad face 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.049
 said today he has not been headline 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.030
 he talks about going to england 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.030
 how is it as it should be 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.400
 it's normal that he's not happy I do not 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.069
 they like players who are happy 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.480
 to be on the bench not dissatisfied 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:48.280
 it's normal outside 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.200
 technical decision to put 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.069
 di maria who has 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.849
 much rhythm a lot of intensity 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.849
 and nothing more 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.120
 a few days ago I wanted to ask you if 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.860
 until now he is aware of if he is going to 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.880
 have the template as it is 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.600
 if you are going to see entry movements to 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.600
 Exit movement 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.760
 no no no no I do not really know what is going to 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.750
 spend tomorrow 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:20.489
 no no no I can not say it there is that 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:24.560
 template is there may be that 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.560
 anything changes in input 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.050
 exit 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.340
 how have you seen the green here but I do not know 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.810
 if you could confirm that fabio 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.139
 coentrao is going to stay in madrid not 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.139
 is going to leave 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.139
 I think everyone unhappy 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.760
 because it is true that 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.710
 I understood that 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:49.060
 I wanted to leave more 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.920
 really for everyone, it was not 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.380
 there is no desiderio I did not have the 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.800
 I described that the saliva I decided from 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.460
 take off 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.949
 I think the whole club players 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.000
 the trainer arranged is very happy 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.000
 of this decision 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:14.840
 or friendship and pass what happens tomorrow 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.100
 this is the best template that you have 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.100
 had in his career as a coach 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.150
 it's difficult that 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.020
 that is to say that it is the best template and 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.020
 template because 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.400
 I've been lucky to train 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.620
 fantastic team players is a 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.900
 very good template I am very happy to 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.080
 this 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:44.419
 I'm going to work to improve the game 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.419
 because I think with these players 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.000
 and then good we do the last two 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.000
 questions 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.219
 now mister huántar of active towers 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:59.659
 of the country that I wanted to ask you if in 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:06:02.449
 its modules either the 4-4-2 or the 4-3-3 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:05.930
 that sometimes uses disk is the player 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:10.210
 to which you give more freedoms more 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:13.139
 licenses to move as they want 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.719
 they move us 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.270
 disco is a player who has a lot 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:21.270
 quality in the center of the field not in the 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.689
 defensive work band is in the band 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.569
 because we needed to put the ball is 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:32.759
 free to look for a position in the 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:35.340
 center of the field between the two lines the 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.830
 defensive of the adversary is doing 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:42.810
 very well because it has the ability to 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:45.520
 put yourself in the right position of the field 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.139
 here mister back sergio valentine's 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.819
 radio 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.099
 a couple of days ago here when 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:52.539
 game before Betis said that what more 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:54.280
 he was worried about one of the things that 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:56.830
 he was worried was that the team was 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.449
 divided in two and there was not much 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.909
 solidarity in the midfield cree 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:04.779
 that your staff is correcting 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:06.909
 It is more satisfied in this sense 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:09.789
 defensive work was good we have 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:11.889
 recovered many balls in the field of 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:15.300
 create we have just pressed well on 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:15.300
 all the first time 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.540
 for this cause I think the team all 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.420
 they are working well 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.750
 and that day we have improved 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.750
 thank you
