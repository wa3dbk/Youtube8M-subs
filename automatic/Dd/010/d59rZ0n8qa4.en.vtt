00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 So size does not matter 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.040
 only people say a small space 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.210
 have equal and has dreadnought 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.340
 not this problem 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.780
 the men of hunter development have 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.849
 namely, the nose seems full of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.920
 demanding depri military shooters 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.720
 like spec ops the line and tinker 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 Instead, just next to the 1 and 2 on 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.529
 a multiplayer spaceship shooter 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.539
 you never ran big pots 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.699
 most likely to be compared with one 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.590
 World of tanks occur in this world of 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.449
 very thick spaceships two five-team 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.750
 in multiplayer battles against each other 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.090
 on 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.730
 currently only in the team of the commercial 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.870
 Mode more modes are planned 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.460
 for us but not yet playable and 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.460
 also for the time being secret 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.840
 5 spaceships are available 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.820
 on the one hand the really big ones 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.950
 Devices such as the devastating 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.110
 well-armed destroyers as well as the 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.360
 extremely heavily armored dredd north 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.820
 Both spaceships are real flying 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.440
 Fortress but so dynamic in your flight 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.300
 behave like a snail with 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.700
 war foot inflammation in 100 meters run 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.800
 it would be a little more supple 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.800
 He wants to grab the tactical 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.200
 cruiser that works as a healer 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.140
 artillery cruiser on precise 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.390
 distance shots is optimized or the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.000
 small nimble corvette like one 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.550
 special web drive jumps into combat- 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.110
 strikes and then please very quickly 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.979
 again it disappears because it is 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.720
 hardly a hit tolerates the first 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.550
 Play sample made the alphaversion 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.680
 by dreadnought already have fun 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.030
 especially since every spaceship class 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.070
 their own advantages and disadvantages 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.869
 brings and a skillful use of 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.729
 two different main weapons and four 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.400
 freely selectable special skills 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.560
 despite presumably requires in the free to 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.930
 play model acts dreadnought therefore very much 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.060
 designed for team play and everything else 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.800
 as a casual who is not reasonable in the team 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.600
 communicates and a skill 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.850
 Assembled spaceship mix in the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.550
 The battle leads quickly lost 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.740
 the very slow game mechanics is the 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.330
 ball but getting used to but good 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.979
 trettner and orientates himself 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.140
 classic ship fighting in those 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.000
 gunloaded dreimaster slowly 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.200
 maneuver out and each other's 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.420
 decks to lump 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.459
 this feeling has the studio also good 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.989
 captured and the inertia itself 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.910
 smaller ships required by the player 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.799
 a measure of patience and foresight that 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.900
 in today's action title otherwise rather the 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.250
 exception is 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.209
 Conversely, the tough movement of the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.400
 ships but also the patience 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.360
 strain and inexperienced players 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.440
 frustrate 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.870
 who quickly turn into a helpless one 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.120
 maneuver position and death are imminent 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.860
 they even notice it 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.239
 despite the real 4 engine, we missed it 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.560
 in addition, try it again 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.180
 a bit of the necessary stuff 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.250
 if a destroyer at his 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.230
 explosion quasi dissolves your smoke and 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.769
 weapons strikes only colorful lights on 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.660
 to pull oneself 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.670
 that just does not convey that 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.860
 brute impression you get from 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.910
 to hope for such a huge weapon system 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.370
 would 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.780
 otherwise, however, it is an interesting one 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.000
 tactical science fiction shooter with 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.930
 much potential, however, even with 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.930
 many questions
