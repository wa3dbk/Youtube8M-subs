spent<00:02:01.689> like<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.079> next<00:02:02.290> four<00:02:02.469> or<00:02:02.590> five<00:02:02.740> years

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
spent like the next four or five years

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.469 
spent like the next four or five years
really<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.399> kind<00:02:03.729> of<00:02:03.880> trying<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.180> solidify

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
really to kind of trying to solidify

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.460 
really to kind of trying to solidify
that<00:02:04.899> sort<00:02:05.259> of<00:02:05.320> style<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:06.130> then<00:02:06.340> figure<00:02:07.060> out

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
that sort of style and then figure out

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.410 
that sort of style and then figure out
where<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.619> take<00:02:08.799> it<00:02:08.860> in<00:02:09.130> my<00:02:09.280> own<00:02:09.429> direction<00:02:10.000> and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
where to take it in my own direction and

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.780 
where to take it in my own direction and
then<00:02:10.630> sort<00:02:11.320> of<00:02:11.380> ironically<00:02:11.860> enough<00:02:12.040> about

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
then sort of ironically enough about

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.670 
then sort of ironically enough about
four<00:02:13.540> years<00:02:13.720> after<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:14.049> really<00:02:14.350> started

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
four years after I really started

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.710 
four years after I really started

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
delving into that was when I ended up

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.800 
delving into that was when I ended up
get

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
that's already like a completely

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.580 
that's already like a completely
different<00:02:50.150> animal<00:02:50.510> all<00:02:50.870> together<00:02:51.049> you<00:02:51.440> know

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
different animal all together you know

so it's like it's it's more trying to
find<00:02:55.549> this<00:02:55.790> balance<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.510> almost<00:02:56.870> backing<00:02:57.350> it

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
find this balance of almost backing it

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.699 
find this balance of almost backing it
off<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.680> little<00:02:58.010> bit<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:59.180> where<00:02:59.360> like<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.680> know

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
like they're a little shorter so I can

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.340 
like they're a little shorter so I can
keep<00:04:28.180> everything<00:04:28.420> sort<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.750> tighter<00:04:28.990> into<00:04:29.230> my

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
keep everything sort of tighter into my

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.930

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
body but they've got a really nice

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.060 
body but they've got a really nice
balanced<00:04:31.510> fulcrum<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.290> they<00:04:32.350> never<00:04:32.500> feel<00:04:32.800> too

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
balanced fulcrum and they never feel too

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.980 
balanced fulcrum and they never feel too
heavy<00:04:33.340> but<00:04:33.850> I<00:04:33.880> can<00:04:34.090> still<00:04:34.330> get<00:04:34.450> a<00:04:34.510> lot<00:04:34.690> of<00:04:34.780> power

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
heavy but I can still get a lot of power

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.200 
heavy but I can still get a lot of power
out<00:04:35.320> of<00:04:35.350> them<00:04:35.590> and<00:04:35.890> it's<00:04:36.370> like<00:04:36.430> versus<00:04:37.180> like
