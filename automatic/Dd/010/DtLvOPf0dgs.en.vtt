India<00:01:24.049> well<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> think<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.860> recognized<00:01:26.549> by

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
India well I think as as recognized by

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.200 
India well I think as as recognized by
India<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.409> space<00:01:28.680> technology<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.880> very

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
India the the space technology is a very

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.899 
India the the space technology is a very
powerful<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.829> very<00:01:31.860> important<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.759> if

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
powerful one and a very important one if

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
powerful one and a very important one if
a<00:01:33.030> country<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.840> progress<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
a country is going to progress and I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.950 
a country is going to progress and I
think<00:01:35.400> they<00:01:35.579> recognized<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:36.840> they

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
think they recognized this then they

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
think they recognized this then they
make<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.380> investment<00:01:38.009> they've<00:01:38.670> been<00:01:38.939> very

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
make the investment they've been very

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.330 
make the investment they've been very
clever<00:01:39.659> about<00:01:39.960> their<00:01:40.409> investment<00:01:41.009> because

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
clever about their investment because

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.280 
clever about their investment because
they<00:01:41.520> used<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.939> buy<00:01:42.150> their<00:01:42.509> satellites<00:01:43.079> they

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
they used to buy their satellites they

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
they used to buy their satellites they
used<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.590> buy<00:01:43.770> their<00:01:44.070> equipment<00:01:44.450> but

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
used to buy their equipment but

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.300 
used to buy their equipment but
gradually<00:01:46.020> they've<00:01:46.229> transferred<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.040> over

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
gradually they've transferred that over

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.550 
gradually they've transferred that over
to<00:01:47.430> manufacturing<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.299> themselves<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.140> you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
to manufacturing it themselves and you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.410 
to manufacturing it themselves and you
always<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> next<00:01:50.850> target

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
always have to have the next target

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.569 
always have to have the next target
they've<00:01:51.630> always<00:01:52.020> beat<00:01:52.290> they've<00:01:52.920> always<00:01:53.130> been
