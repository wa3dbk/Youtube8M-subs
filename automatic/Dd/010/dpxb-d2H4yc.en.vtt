 hello welcome to my channel our house 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.809
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.809
 make some rich chilaquiles 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.240
 they are very easy to make very few 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.090
 ingredients and the truth is that they are 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.320
 very rich so I invite you to follow 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.320
 watching my channel 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.150
 and the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.610
 is going to be corn 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.220
 We are going to cut this tortilla 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.810
 small pieces as pictures 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.410
 I think 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.140
 oil, we're going to need cheese too 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.550
 parmesan of this dry 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.340
 and we're going to need tomato sauce in 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.850
 this case I have one that is salsa 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.800
 of chile and is the brand the duck well 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.160
 that I invite you to continue seeing the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.160
 video 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.870
 what we are going to do in a pot 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.510
 we are going to put oil and when 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.990
 hot let's put the tortilla up 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.990
 that is golden 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.710
 ok how can you tell about the 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.530
 tortillas has some toast left 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.950
 I put on a plate with a napkin for 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.130
 that absorbed all the oil and now 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.640
 I put them back in the pot now what 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.860
 we will do we will add 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.860
 the can of tomato sauce 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.780
 and we're going to mix it well so that all 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.780
 the tortillas 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.850
 if they come 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.050
 of salazar and from there what we are going to do 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.520
 we are going to add the oven and also 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.520
 let's incorporate all 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.160
 and once everything is well incorporated 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.830
 we are going to add the cheese 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.530
 and we are going to cover it, we are going to leave it to 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.980
 very low heat to melt the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.980
 cheese 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.240
 and nothing better where he was hard as a 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.790
 minute maybe two and they turn it off and in addition 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.960
 they leave it so that with the steam it 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.960
 melt the cheese well 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.230
 and here are the tools as they can 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:52.430
 see already has melted cheese and then 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.469
 has the corn and so the red sauce this 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.239
 lauro is that very good bolt are good 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:03:01.840

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:07.150
 this is optional but you can put 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.150

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.500
