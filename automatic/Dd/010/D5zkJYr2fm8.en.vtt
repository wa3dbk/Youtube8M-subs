well<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.060> mean<00:00:27.199> like<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.740> somebody

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
well but I mean like it's just somebody

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.769 
well but I mean like it's just somebody
wanted<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:29.820> anyway<00:00:30.150> i'm<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
wanted to do but anyway i'm going to

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.500 
wanted to do but anyway i'm going to
show<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.900> how<00:00:31.080> how<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> made<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.510> basically

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
show you how how I made it basically

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.110 
show you how how I made it basically
took<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> regular<00:00:35.210> toy<00:00:37.610> car<00:00:38.610> battery<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.300> uh

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
took a regular toy car battery and uh

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.299 
took a regular toy car battery and uh
just<00:00:42.120> splice<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.629> lines<00:00:42.840> kept<00:00:43.770> all<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> wire

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
just splice the lines kept all the wire

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.490 
just splice the lines kept all the wire
you<00:00:44.520> know<00:00:44.640> kept<00:00:44.910> wire<00:00:45.450> massage<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> same<00:00:46.170> same

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
you know kept wire massage the same same

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.160 
you know kept wire massage the same same
gauge<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.250> got<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.539> positive<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.110> negative

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
gauge I got the positive and negative

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.130 
gauge I got the positive and negative
both<00:00:49.770> marked<00:00:50.300> left<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> charger<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.930> there

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
both marked left the charger on there

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.959 
both marked left the charger on there
I'm<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.440> eventually<00:00:52.649> put<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> cover<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
I'm going eventually put a cover on it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.500 
I'm going eventually put a cover on it
so<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.390> doesn't<00:00:54.420> get<00:00:54.750> all<00:00:54.899> dirty<00:00:56.210> yr<00:00:57.210> stayed

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
so it doesn't get all dirty yr stayed

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.889 
so it doesn't get all dirty yr stayed
the<00:00:57.660> same<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.129> here<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.699> just<00:01:00.660> uh

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the same and what I have here is just uh

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.429 
the same and what I have here is just uh
just<00:01:01.440> some<00:01:01.949> connectors<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.609> made<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.229> you

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
just some connectors I made and if you

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.740 
just some connectors I made and if you
want<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> names<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.790> these<00:01:05.880> connectors<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
want the names of these connectors you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.899 
want the names of these connectors you
could<00:01:06.900> definitely<00:01:07.049> email<00:01:07.650> me<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.070> I'll<00:01:08.220> or

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
could definitely email me and I'll or

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
could definitely email me and I'll or
you<00:01:09.030> could<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.180> message<00:01:09.630> me<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.810> youtube<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you could just message me on youtube and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.660 
you could just message me on youtube and
I<00:01:10.860> definitely<00:01:11.250> get<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> information<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
I definitely get the information to you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.010 
I definitely get the information to you
the<00:01:14.670> reason<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.970> don't<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.240> an<00:01:15.330> inline<00:01:15.630> fuse

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the reason I don't have an inline fuse

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.190 
the reason I don't have an inline fuse
on<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.340> comes<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
on this is because it comes with the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.920 
on this is because it comes with the
internal<00:01:19.200> self<00:01:19.590> resetting<00:01:20.130> fuels<00:01:20.930> this

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
internal self resetting fuels this

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.469 
internal self resetting fuels this
battery<00:01:22.290> comes<00:01:22.560> from<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.280> kid's<00:01:23.820> toy<00:01:23.970> once

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
battery comes from a kid's toy once

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.359 
battery comes from a kid's toy once
again<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:25.049> embark<00:01:25.740> information<00:01:26.280> I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
again I can embark information I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.810 
again I can embark information I
ain't<00:01:26.490> trying<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> advertise<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.450> here<00:01:28.820> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
ain't trying to advertise on here and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.109 
ain't trying to advertise on here and
you<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.930> from<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.670> normal<00:01:32.670> gauge<00:01:32.850> wire

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
you can see from that normal gauge wire

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.679 
you can see from that normal gauge wire
this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> regular<00:01:34.470> 6<00:01:34.979> volt<00:01:35.220> battery<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.729> 9.5

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
this is a regular 6 volt battery at 9.5

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.219 
this is a regular 6 volt battery at 9.5
amps<00:01:37.200> per<00:01:37.259> hour<00:01:38.180> I<00:01:39.180> figured<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.810> could<00:01:39.960> control

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
amps per hour I figured I could control

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.289 
amps per hour I figured I could control
the<00:01:40.409> voltage<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.770> little<00:01:41.070> better<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.579> by

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the voltage a little better just by

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.940 
the voltage a little better just by
stepping<00:01:42.600> down<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> gauge<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> wire<00:01:43.409> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
stepping down the gauge of the wire and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.940 
stepping down the gauge of the wire and
you<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:44.970> keeping<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> nice<00:01:45.689> length<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
you know keeping it a nice length you

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.240 
you know keeping it a nice length you
know<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.590> purpose<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
know for you know just the purpose of a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.880 
know for you know just the purpose of a
dropping<00:01:51.210> their<00:01:51.329> voltage<00:01:51.720> down<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.259> then

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
dropping their voltage down and then

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.550 
dropping their voltage down and then
what<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> did<00:01:53.640> was<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.299> went<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.079> got<00:01:55.170> some

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
what I did was I went and got some

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.569 
what I did was I went and got some
regular<00:01:55.979> LED<00:01:56.570> flashlights<00:01:57.649> hmm<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.430> know<00:01:59.460> I

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
regular LED flashlights hmm you know I

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.749 
regular LED flashlights hmm you know I
cut<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> heads<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> men<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.500> know

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
cut the heads on the men you know

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.190 
cut the heads on the men you know
mounted<00:02:02.759> them<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> sides<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.930> lamp

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
a simple retrofit I'm not trying to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.890 
a simple retrofit I'm not trying to
really<00:02:19.500> get<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.760> all<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.000> all<00:02:21.360> off<00:02:21.600> into

it but i can not be shorts the future
videos<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.470> act<00:02:25.650> like<00:02:25.860> for<00:02:26.370> now<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.490> just<00:02:26.610> want

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
videos that act like for now I just want

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.480 
videos that act like for now I just want
to<00:02:26.940> keep<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.240> simple<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.900> uh<00:02:28.500> like<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:28.890> said<00:02:29.010> I

got<00:02:30.150> everything<00:02:30.570> mark<00:02:30.810> positive<00:02:31.320> negative<00:02:31.620> if

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
got everything mark positive negative if

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:41.240 
got everything mark positive negative if
I'm<00:02:32.760> not<00:02:33.000> mistaken<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:36.420> positive<00:02:38.480> was<00:02:40.250> trying

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
I'm not mistaken the positive was trying

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.700 
I'm not mistaken the positive was trying
to<00:02:41.310> remember<00:02:41.460> well<00:02:41.820> actually<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:43.110> when<00:02:43.560> you

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
to remember well actually and when you

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.230 
to remember well actually and when you
if<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.070> ever<00:02:44.220> do<00:02:44.520> disassemble<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
if you ever do disassemble the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.820 
if you ever do disassemble the
flashlight<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:46.260> look<00:02:46.440> at<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> way<00:02:46.710> the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
flashlight just look at the way the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.310 
flashlight just look at the way the
battery<00:02:47.130> pack<00:02:47.160> goes<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.150> I'm<00:02:48.990> more<00:02:49.230> than

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
battery pack goes in and I'm more than

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.170 
battery pack goes in and I'm more than
sure<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.620> polarity<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.190> on<00:02:50.400> there<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.940> so

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
sure the polarity is on there for you so

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.080 
sure the polarity is on there for you so
you<00:02:51.510> know<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.410> actual<00:02:53.010> case<00:02:53.490> of<00:02:53.820> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
you know and that actual case of the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.470 
you know and that actual case of the
flashlight<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:56.400> believe<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
flashlight is the I believe it's the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.630 
flashlight is the I believe it's the
negative<00:02:57.960> side<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.650> UM<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.930> diodes<00:03:01.640> but

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
negative side of the UM the diodes but

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.030 
negative side of the UM the diodes but
anyway<00:03:03.000> there<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.050> is<00:03:04.140> for<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.560> I'm<00:03:04.650> going<00:03:04.920> on

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
anyway there it is for you I'm going on

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.460 
anyway there it is for you I'm going on
and<00:03:05.220> light<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.460> up<00:03:08.840> close<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.050> curtain<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:10.380> you

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
and light it up close the curtain so you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.730 
and light it up close the curtain so you
kind<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:10.800> see<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.010> light<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.580> mean<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:13.290> sunny

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
kind of see the light I mean the sunny

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.380 
kind of see the light I mean the sunny
outside<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:14.670> know<00:03:15.000> it's<00:03:15.180> kind<00:03:15.330> of

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
outside so you know it's kind of

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.820 
outside so you know it's kind of
defeating<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.840> purpose<00:03:15.990> with<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.290> mother<00:03:16.590> sure

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
defeating the purpose with a mother sure

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.760 
defeating the purpose with a mother sure
you<00:03:16.950> can<00:03:17.100> see<00:03:17.490> just<00:03:17.820> how<00:03:18.570> intensity<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.410> and

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
you can see just how intensity is and

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.680 
you can see just how intensity is and
like<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.520> said<00:03:20.580> it's<00:03:20.880> almost<00:03:21.150> time<00:03:21.390> for<00:03:21.660> a

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
like I said it's almost time for a

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.530 
like I said it's almost time for a
charge<00:03:21.990> on<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.260> battery<00:03:22.380> but<00:03:23.150> still<00:03:24.150> shows

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
charge on the battery but still shows

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.380 
charge on the battery but still shows
pretty<00:03:25.020> good<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.460> actual<00:03:26.790> switch<00:03:27.150> i'm

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
pretty good and the actual switch i'm

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.070 
pretty good and the actual switch i'm
using<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:31.200> head<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.560> flashlight<00:03:33.080> now

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
using is the head of the flashlight now

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.200 
using is the head of the flashlight now
you<00:03:34.170> can<00:03:34.260> hit<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.410> little<00:03:34.620> clicky<00:03:34.890> click<00:03:35.210> just

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
you can hit a little clicky click just

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.440 
you can hit a little clicky click just
ahead<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.570> flashlight<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.340> mean<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:39.030> fell

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450

asleep<00:03:39.840> with<00:03:39.990> this<00:03:40.200> thing<00:03:40.440> on<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.800> woke<00:03:41.160> up

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
asleep with this thing on and woke up

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.430 
asleep with this thing on and woke up
the<00:03:41.430> next<00:03:41.550> morning<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.990> know<00:03:43.110> still

shining just a sprite you know
everything<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.750> fine<00:03:45.990> so<00:03:46.740> I<00:03:46.770> consider<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.250> a

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
everything is fine so I consider that a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.660 
everything is fine so I consider that a
successful<00:03:47.970> retrofit<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.340> like<00:03:50.340> i<00:03:50.430> said<00:03:50.550> i've

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
successful retrofit and like i said i've

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.880 
successful retrofit and like i said i've
been<00:03:50.820> using<00:03:51.000> this<00:03:51.270> battery<00:03:51.630> for<00:03:51.930> quite<00:03:52.620> a

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
been using this battery for quite a

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.430 
been using this battery for quite a
while<00:03:55.010> that's<00:03:56.010> pretty<00:03:56.280> much<00:03:56.430> it<00:03:56.490> once<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.660> the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
while that's pretty much it once the the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.560 
while that's pretty much it once the the
battery<00:03:58.830> no<00:03:59.430> starch<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.500> show<00:04:01.790> where<00:04:02.790> I'll

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
battery no starch the show where I'll

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.750 
battery no starch the show where I'll
gonna<00:04:03.960> put<00:04:04.080> on<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.410> charger<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.040> we'll<00:04:05.640> be

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
gonna put on the charger and we'll be

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.940 
gonna put on the charger and we'll be
right<00:04:05.940> back<00:04:06.060> at<00:04:06.270> it<00:04:06.300> again<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:07.590> if<00:04:07.770> I<00:04:07.890> get

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
right back at it again and if I get

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.770 
right back at it again and if I get
tired<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.550> i<00:04:08.640> can<00:04:08.790> always<00:04:09.120> take<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.570> stuff
