00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
flashlight or something in there so that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.319 
flashlight or something in there so that
you<00:00:43.350> guys<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.829> see<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> there's<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> little

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you guys can see it there's a little

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.700 
you guys can see it there's a little
dangling<00:00:45.660> ball<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.110> obviously<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> hole

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
dangling ball and obviously the hole

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.020 
dangling ball and obviously the hole
isn't<00:00:46.890> big<00:00:47.100> enough<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.520> cat<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.910> get

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
isn't big enough for a cat to get

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.520 
isn't big enough for a cat to get
through<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.360> mean<00:00:48.570> that's<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.050> palm<00:00:49.379> of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
through I mean that's like the palm of

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.970 
through I mean that's like the palm of
my<00:00:49.620> hand<00:00:49.920> unless<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> very<00:00:51.000> small<00:00:51.420> cat

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
my hand unless you have a very small cat

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.520 
my hand unless you have a very small cat
so<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:53.940> stick<00:00:54.120> their<00:00:54.270> paws<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.750> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
so they can just stick their paws in and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.139 
so they can just stick their paws in and
I<00:00:55.620> find<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.309> great<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.550> two<00:00:56.850> cats

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
I find it's really great for two cats

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.029 
I find it's really great for two cats
because<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.050> side<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.920> one

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
because one can be on that side and one

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.439 
because one can be on that side and one
can<00:00:59.219> be<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.489> side<00:01:01.370> so<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:03.030> kind<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
can be on that side so it's kind of a

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.080 
can be on that side so it's kind of a
great<00:01:03.660> toy<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:03.899> two<00:01:04.199> cats<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:04.619> well<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.640> then

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
great toy for two cats as well and then

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.219 
great toy for two cats as well and then
something<00:01:06.420> else<00:01:06.510> has<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> nice<00:01:07.049> thing<00:01:07.200> about

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
something else has a nice thing about

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.469 
something else has a nice thing about
this<00:01:07.710> cardboard<00:01:08.610> she's<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.840> after<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.229> now

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
this cardboard she's going after it now

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.520 
this cardboard she's going after it now
this<00:01:12.479> cardboard<00:01:12.990> insert<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:16.439> know

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
this cardboard insert is that you know

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.450 
this cardboard insert is that you know
they're<00:01:16.710> obviously<00:01:16.979> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> put<00:01:17.340> their

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
they're obviously going to put their

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.429 
they're obviously going to put their
back<00:01:17.670> paws<00:01:17.939> down<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.900> their<00:01:18.990> front<00:01:19.229> paws

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
back paws down here and their front paws

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.200 
back paws down here and their front paws
or<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.310> they're<00:01:20.430> gonna<00:01:20.490> use<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.939> scratch

or what they're gonna use to scratch

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.380 
or what they're gonna use to scratch
with<00:01:21.409> so<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.860> actually<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.820> used<00:01:24.090> four

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
with so this actually can be used four

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.969 
with so this actually can be used four
times<00:01:24.420> because<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.320> then<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.799> switch

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
times because you can then just switch

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.600 
times because you can then just switch
it<00:01:26.130> around<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:28.380> their<00:01:28.530> front<00:01:28.799> paws<00:01:29.250> again

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it around to for their front paws again

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.910 
it around to for their front paws again
once<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.180> part<00:01:30.720> gets<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.170> know<00:01:31.290> nasty<00:01:31.799> up

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
once this part gets you know nasty up

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.080 
once this part gets you know nasty up
here<00:01:31.950> then<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.460> switch<00:01:32.670> her<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330 
here then you can switch her out and
then<00:01:33.180> switch<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.570> over<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> you've<00:01:35.159> got

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.440 
other one would be like hitting the top
with<00:02:11.160> their<00:02:11.280> paws<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> other<00:02:12.180> one<00:02:12.300> was

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
with their paws is the other one was

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.850 
with their paws is the other one was
scratched

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
scratched

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.470 
scratched
I<00:02:13.070> think<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.580> would<00:02:13.700> be<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.910> lot<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.060> fun<00:02:14.330> to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
I think that would be a lot of fun to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.470 
I think that would be a lot of fun to
watch<00:02:21.040> there<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.250> there's<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.520> ball<00:02:22.730> for

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
watch there it is there's the ball for

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.670 
watch there it is there's the ball for
an<00:02:23.570> instant<00:02:23.930> we<00:02:23.990> can<00:02:24.140> see<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.410> ball<00:02:26.440> its<00:02:27.440> own

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
an instant we can see the ball its own

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.220 
an instant we can see the ball its own
elastic<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:28.520> then<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.880> springs<00:02:29.300> back<00:02:29.480> when<00:02:29.930> he

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
elastic so then it springs back when he

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.600 
elastic so then it springs back when he
lets<00:02:30.500> go

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
lets go

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.390 
lets go
I<00:02:32.230> guess<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.410> ball<00:02:33.590> probably<00:02:33.860> wouldn't<00:02:34.190> be<00:02:34.280> as

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
I guess the ball probably wouldn't be as

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.520 
I guess the ball probably wouldn't be as
effective<00:02:34.940> if<00:02:35.300> they<00:02:35.720> could<00:02:35.900> actually<00:02:36.050> get<00:02:36.380> in

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
effective if they could actually get in

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.990 
effective if they could actually get in
there<00:02:36.680> because<00:02:36.830> they'd<00:02:37.070> probably<00:02:37.310> tear<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.850> up

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
there because they'd probably tear it up

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.910 
there because they'd probably tear it up
but<00:02:38.990> I<00:02:39.490> think<00:02:40.490> it<00:02:40.610> would<00:02:40.670> be<00:02:40.790> fun<00:02:41.740> that's<00:02:42.740> it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
but I think it would be fun that's it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.610 
but I think it would be fun that's it
for<00:02:43.130> now<00:02:43.250> bye
