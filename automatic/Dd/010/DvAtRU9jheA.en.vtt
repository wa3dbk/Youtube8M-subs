shoulder yeah it's it's not very good
but<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> brain<00:00:59.219> bot<00:00:59.399> himself<00:00:59.879> looks<00:01:00.120> very

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
but the brain bot himself looks very

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.290 
but the brain bot himself looks very
cool<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.399> interesting<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
cool and what was interesting is on the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
cool and what was interesting is on the
back<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.750> package<00:01:04.199> there<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.189> no<00:01:05.309> brain

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
back of the package there is no brain

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
back of the package there is no brain
bot<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.000> his<00:01:06.240> shoulders<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.110> I'm<00:01:07.290> very

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
bot on his shoulders so I'm very

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.010 
bot on his shoulders so I'm very
confusing<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.640> man<00:01:09.450> he<00:01:09.659> does<00:01:09.840> come

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
confusing with that man he does come

confusing with that man he does come
with<00:01:10.170> another<00:01:10.530> brain<00:01:11.040> bot<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.880> others

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
with another brain bot and some others

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.380 
with another brain bot and some others
in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> set<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.960> these<00:01:13.470> guys<00:01:13.799> now<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:15.090> say
