00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 discuss this topic with our guest 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.560
 is in fisherman's studio 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.870
 St. Petersburg in Italy kempinski 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.870
 car wash 22 is a football expert Mikhail 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.820
 man michael i greet you so 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.280
 the top of the organization fell for a bribe 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.260
 substance and money laundering it's about 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.690
 several generations of corrupt and 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.300
 huge amounts lasted a quarter 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.800
 century as a good day first but 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.230
 look first let's you and me 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.300
 We will follow the generally accepted rules and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.890
 until the courts passed until they were convicted 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.890
 we won't say they hit 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.690
 the existence of corruption of course as 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.629
 reasonable people are unlikely we will 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.399
 doubt that investigators have 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.110
 bodies and prosecutors that switzerland that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.629
 united states something on these people 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.910
 there is some texture but 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.410
 Still, the assessment of the factory before the court here 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.739
 because everything is not so easy there 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.570
 from a legal point of view, what does it say about 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.760
 jablotron persona new ways not 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.320
 involved in this process but still 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.390
 responsible for his subordinates or 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.690
 may still be such an attack on 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.479
 his connection with the upcoming elections and you 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.369
 You know, I doubt that of course 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 due to the previous due to some 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.990
 internal competition in fifa one of 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.119
 the parties decide to involve the prosecutor 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.650
 Switzerland Prosecutor's Office America completely 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.600
 unpredictable consequences because 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.820
 it is completely understandable that if these 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.009
 guys will start digging something on a digger not 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.689
 can anything is known FIFA 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.720
 this is one big happy big family 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.780
 football family so of course there 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.580
 there may be some 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.430
 some kind of struggle for inner power 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.350
 some internal trends but i don't 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.190
 I doubt that what we see now 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.729
 and 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.860
 initiated not from within fifa various 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.450
 experts said the scandal will affect 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.670
 the choice of the country mistress of two future 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.170
 world soccer championships here today 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.140
 Fifa officials said 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.509
 that everything remains in its place say 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.259
 if the likelihood that a football holiday 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.759
 we will take away well, you know unconditionally 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.190
 The probability of such there is yes if we 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.399
 speak in terms of probability i would 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.470
 said so it must be clearly understood that 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.720
 however bad it is in quotes 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.130
 naturally bad would not be fifa in 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.040
 the eyes of the world community 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.739
 but another organization that is full 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.280
 powerfully hold the world championship 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.080
 Appoint the World Cup today is not 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.090
 that's why take away the World Cup 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.819
 may already can only fifa 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.380
 Well, how to select to cancel it in Russia 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.560
 for example, to spend somewhere else 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.040
 At the same time, this is not the first 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.230
 Attempt to pressure on FIFA as known those 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.510
 same British journalists and before that there 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.840
 tried to dig up some materials and 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.250
 appeals periodically 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.100
 review the voting results but still 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.590
 far fifa to all these appeals but i would 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.360
 more on it looked as 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.760
 the interaction of different forces who each 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.420
 forces have their interests here definitely 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.579
 There are some forces that would like to ooze 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.070
 with one purpose or another to hold a championship 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.930
 somewhere else at the same time itself 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.820
 FIFA itself is certainly 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.519
 also force is also a player on 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.260
 this market and it is still firmly 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.030
 demonstrates sending unambiguous 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.049
 signals that she does not change anything 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.090
 intends to 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.820
 and this applies to the championship of Russia and 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.680
 Cup in Qatar to which it will reach 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.350
 Well, that is now it is some kind of next 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.640
 step in this big chess game than 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.609
 end of the party of course we are now 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.190
 can not speak but what is the assessment 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.739
 If I give expert I consider cancellation 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.239
 Championship in Russia is extremely unlikely 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.519
 well, just already trite time at all 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.500
 little remains here is the abolition of sideratov 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.120
 Qatar probably 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.880
 a bit more possible simply because 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.190
 there really is time 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.740
 somewhere so Michael is it worth the wait 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.070
 a fundamental change in the work of everything 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.260
 world football 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.030
 you know this is difficult questions to in 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.300
 the short term is certainly no 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.700
 because fifa must also understand this 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.500
 some kind of such 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.959
 self-regulatory organizations that are not 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.090
 submits to any government 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.750
 one side yes that is she 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.190
 international organization which 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.230
 acts solely in accordance with 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.030
 own charter and let's say 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.070
 the international community so much 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.290
 account the whole world just trusted fifa 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.060
 world championships theoretically 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.260
 after all , we can spend tomorrow too 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.060
 Soccer World Cup 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.799
 just for some reason won't come to us 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.919
 Cristiano Ronaldo and Leonel Messi play 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.390
 Yes, FIFA will come and this is a question 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.760
 such public trust 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.950
 public confidence is certain 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.680
 undermined and certainly somehow will 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.360
 move but it is not a prospect of two years 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.669
 not prospects 5 years and we do not even 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.500
 perspective 20 years and here in 50 years 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.810
 maybe there will be some other structure 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.669
 because all these little bricks 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.160
 undermining public trust 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.900
 they will ultimately end up in 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.580
 some one big pile which 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.610
 outweigh and 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.510
 some reforms will hold but 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.970
 short term i think that 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.040
 FIFA threatens nothing thanks mikhail 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.960
 for a detailed response corruption 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.419
 scandal FIFA its likely consequences 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.210
 we discussed with a football expert 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.370
 Mikhail Mun corruption scandal 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.810
 Safe discuss with review andreevich 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.919
 According to Yu-ri us he is with us on the line 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.140
 bono connections 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.150
 Vyacheslav I welcome you whether it is worth 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.490
 wait for a major job change 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.440
 of all world football if any 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.430
 official German comment 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.430
 football federations 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.180
 because of course world football is waiting 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.860
 system changes that existed 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.050
 blotter on must go back in time 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.180
 President of the German Football Union 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.460
 wolfgang no swing he called the news about 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.440
 The arrests shocking called her harmful to 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.990
 of all football and said it would be very 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.910
 shocked if all the charges are completely 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.500
 will be confirmed 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.930
 german rt channel this month 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.880
 showed a documentary about corruption 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.400
 FIFA where a lot of essential 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.800
 mini given to the Russian World Cup 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.230
 whether to associate this movie with 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.080
 today's arrests and does that mean 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.030
 let it be informal but talk about 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.540
 Carrying the World Cup from Russia after all 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.440
 underway 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.570
 I think the investigation has begun 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.700
 much earlier than it was shown and filmed 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.670
 film about the need to address Russia 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.920
 the right to hold the championship of Germany 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.180
 speak for a long time over connected not only even 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.190
 not so much with suspicions in 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.750
 bribery but from the politics of the sea 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.510
 Ukraine’s relations especially in recent 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.110
 months i think now that point of view 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.700
 supporters will get a little more though 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.500
 Angela Merkel Chancellor FRG said that 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.800
 let's separate politics and sport 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.080
 and what they say in Europe about person 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.310
 blatter he though not involved in this 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.620
 criminal process 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.350
 but still responsible for its 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.080
 subordinates whether his career ended 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.790
 according to German experts or can 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.440
 be this attack on him due to 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:49.090
 upcoming elections the fact that 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.010
 childhood passed immediately before 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.350
 elections of course leads to certain 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.630
 thoughts because of course it would be strange 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.310
 give bribe-takers if you suspect 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.970
 confirmed to calmly participate 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:02.710
 the choice therefore I do not exclude that the decision 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.450
 about arrests was postponed 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.190
 concerns for pablo waste former head 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.260
 german soccer union that's one 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.370
 summer he said today that to solve 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.320
 Problems 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.690
 probably not enough just not to allow 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.930
 the next election of Wattara as president 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.750
 FIFA problems much deeper time 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:21.340
 thank you Vyacheslav possible consequences 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:25.650
 corruption scandal fifa we discussed 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.650
 with columnist 2 Vyacheslav Yurinova
