00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.250 
cross the threshold
we're<00:06:15.690> doing<00:06:15.930> 50<00:06:16.320> 51<00:06:17.190> 52<00:06:17.780> because<00:06:18.780> you<00:06:18.990> allowed

we're doing 50 51 52 because you allowed

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.560 
we're doing 50 51 52 because you allowed
for<00:06:19.530> speed<00:06:19.770> to<00:06:19.980> drop<00:06:20.190> off<00:06:20.400> that's<00:06:21.060> why<00:06:21.270> I<00:06:21.300> kept

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
for speed to drop off that's why I kept

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.840 
for speed to drop off that's why I kept
safe
