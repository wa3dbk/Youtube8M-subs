00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:02.260 

so<00:00:01.189> we<00:00:01.280> now<00:00:01.400> have<00:00:01.579> the<00:00:01.670> P<00:00:01.880> tronic<00:00:02.239> transmission

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:02.270 
so we now have the P tronic transmission

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.769 
so we now have the P tronic transmission
in<00:00:02.990> the<00:00:03.050> 3000<00:00:03.649> series<00:00:03.679> extra<00:00:04.359> and<00:00:05.359> that<00:00:05.510> means

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
in the 3000 series extra and that means

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:07.509 
in the 3000 series extra and that means
that<00:00:06.019> we've<00:00:06.170> got<00:00:06.200> full<00:00:06.889> control<00:00:07.069> of<00:00:07.340> the

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
that we've got full control of the

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:09.549 
that we've got full control of the
transmission<00:00:08.059> using<00:00:08.629> the<00:00:08.719> joystick<00:00:08.929> here<00:00:09.440> on

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
transmission using the joystick here on

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.589 
transmission using the joystick here on
the<00:00:09.679> armrest<00:00:10.040> so<00:00:10.790> it<00:00:10.940> got<00:00:11.059> directs<00:00:11.509> and

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
the armrest so it got directs and

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.140 
the armrest so it got directs and
changes<00:00:12.019> forward<00:00:12.589> to<00:00:12.679> reverse<00:00:13.009> and<00:00:13.280> also<00:00:13.910> gear

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
changes forward to reverse and also gear

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.800 
changes forward to reverse and also gear
changes<00:00:14.660> right<00:00:15.259> at<00:00:15.469> your<00:00:15.559> fingertips<00:00:16.810> also

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
changes right at your fingertips also

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.240 
changes right at your fingertips also
the<00:00:17.930> great<00:00:18.080> thing<00:00:18.110> about<00:00:18.350> this<00:00:18.650> transmission

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
the great thing about this transmission

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.970 
the great thing about this transmission
is<00:00:19.340> we<00:00:19.730> can<00:00:19.880> use<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:20.600> touchscreen<00:00:20.990> here<00:00:21.380> to

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
is we can use the touchscreen here to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.380 
is we can use the touchscreen here to
control<00:00:22.280> the<00:00:22.340> different<00:00:22.610> transmission<00:00:23.180> modes

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
control the different transmission modes

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.080 
control the different transmission modes
so<00:00:24.260> we<00:00:24.350> have<00:00:24.440> drive<00:00:24.740> mode<00:00:25.070> which<00:00:25.340> allows<00:00:25.640> fully

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
so we have drive mode which allows fully

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.730 
so we have drive mode which allows fully
automatic<00:00:26.600> shifting<00:00:26.960> much<00:00:27.380> like<00:00:27.620> an

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
automatic shifting much like an

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.040 
automatic shifting much like an
automatic<00:00:28.040> car<00:00:28.370> but<00:00:29.180> longer<00:00:29.390> journeys<00:00:29.840> we

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
automatic car but longer journeys we

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.400 
automatic car but longer journeys we
have<00:00:30.200> cruise<00:00:30.470> control<00:00:30.560> as<00:00:31.100> well<00:00:32.350> you<00:00:33.350> also

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
have cruise control as well you also

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.680 
have cruise control as well you also
have<00:00:33.710> altered<00:00:34.070> shift<00:00:34.249> mode<00:00:34.460> for<00:00:34.850> field<00:00:35.089> use<00:00:35.179> so

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
have altered shift mode for field use so

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.939 
have altered shift mode for field use so
we<00:00:35.809> can<00:00:35.929> tell<00:00:36.109> the<00:00:36.230> tractor<00:00:36.589> where<00:00:36.739> you<00:00:36.800> want

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
we can tell the tractor where you want

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.160 
we can tell the tractor where you want
it<00:00:37.039> to<00:00:37.129> shift<00:00:37.370> up<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.760> shift<00:00:38.269> down<00:00:38.359> based<00:00:39.079> on

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
it to shift up and shift down based on

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.139 
it to shift up and shift down based on
engine<00:00:39.499> load<00:00:39.679> and<00:00:39.920> if<00:00:40.670> we<00:00:40.760> want<00:00:40.909> to<00:00:40.940> drive

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
engine load and if we want to drive

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.180 
engine load and if we want to drive
manually<00:00:41.629> we<00:00:41.870> can<00:00:42.019> do<00:00:42.109> that<00:00:42.260> as<00:00:42.379> well<00:00:42.409> in<00:00:42.949> power

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
manually we can do that as well in power

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.309 
manually we can do that as well in power
shift<00:00:43.399> mode<00:00:43.609> we<00:00:44.149> can<00:00:44.179> decide<00:00:44.600> when<00:00:45.050> to<00:00:45.079> change

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:45.319 
shift mode we can decide when to change

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:48.040 
shift mode we can decide when to change

here at your fingertips one of the great

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.600 
here at your fingertips one of the great
things<00:04:23.530> about<00:04:23.620> this<00:04:23.830> new<00:04:24.010> tractors<00:04:24.490> the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
things about this new tractors the

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.670 
things about this new tractors the
headland<00:04:24.970> turn<00:04:25.150> assist<00:04:25.540> so<00:04:26.200> this<00:04:26.350> allows<00:04:26.650> us

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
headland turn assist so this allows us

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.220 
headland turn assist so this allows us
to<00:04:26.980> program<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.820> sequence<00:04:28.450> of<00:04:28.570> functions<00:04:28.780> and

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
to program a sequence of functions and

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.570 
to program a sequence of functions and
let<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.800> try<00:04:29.950> to<00:04:29.980> play<00:04:30.250> through<00:04:30.490> them

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
let the try to play through them

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.360 
let the try to play through them
automatically<00:04:31.620> we've<00:04:32.620> got<00:04:32.830> up<00:04:32.980> to<00:04:33.130> five

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
automatically we've got up to five

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.130 
automatically we've got up to five
different<00:04:33.610> sequences<00:04:34.330> we<00:04:34.570> can<00:04:34.720> choose<00:04:34.930> from

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
different sequences we can choose from

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.720 
different sequences we can choose from
so<00:04:35.410> one<00:04:35.620> could<00:04:35.770> be<00:04:35.860> ploughing<00:04:36.310> one<00:04:36.520> could<00:04:36.670> be

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
so one could be ploughing one could be

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.880 
so one could be ploughing one could be
drilling<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.240> kind<00:04:37.450> of<00:04:37.540> thing<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:37.900> then<00:04:38.740> we

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
drilling that kind of thing and then we

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.650 
drilling that kind of thing and then we
just<00:04:39.070> simply<00:04:39.430> pick<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:40.030> function<00:04:40.420> that<00:04:40.510> we

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
just simply pick the function that we

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.480 
just simply pick the function that we
want<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.960> use<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.800> first<00:04:42.040> one<00:04:42.160> could<00:04:42.430> be

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
want to use the first one could be

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.880 
want to use the first one could be
lifting<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.090> front<00:04:43.210> linkage<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:44.500> we<00:04:44.710> could

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
lifting the front linkage and we could

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.270 
lifting the front linkage and we could
have<00:04:45.130> switch<00:04:45.700> off<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.090> front<00:04:46.480> pto<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.280> then

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
have switch off the front pto and then

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.920 
have switch off the front pto and then
for<00:04:48.610> example<00:04:48.670> we<00:04:49.000> might<00:04:49.240> want<00:04:49.420> to<00:04:49.450> operate<00:04:49.660> the

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
for example we might want to operate the

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.500 
for example we might want to operate the
blue<00:04:50.110> spool<00:04:50.380> valve<00:04:50.730> so<00:04:51.730> we<00:04:51.850> can<00:04:52.000> program<00:04:52.300> that

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
blue spool valve so we can program that

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.230 
blue spool valve so we can program that
into<00:04:52.750> our<00:04:52.780> sequence<00:04:53.260> as<00:04:53.440> well<00:04:54.120> once<00:04:55.120> we've

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
into our sequence as well once we've

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.820 
into our sequence as well once we've
created<00:04:55.390> a<00:04:55.750> sequence<00:04:56.080> we<00:04:56.410> can<00:04:56.560> then<00:04:56.680> either

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
created a sequence we can then either

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.530 
created a sequence we can then either
play<00:04:57.160> through<00:04:57.430> manually<00:04:57.850> using<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.330> white

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
play through manually using the white

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.470 
play through manually using the white
button<00:04:58.840> here<00:04:58.990> on<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.140> joystick<00:04:59.400> or<00:05:00.400> we<00:05:01.210> can

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
button here on the joystick or we can

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.690 
button here on the joystick or we can
link<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.200> functions<00:05:02.590> together<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:03.130> have<00:05:03.550> the

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
link the functions together and have the

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.100 
link the functions together and have the
track<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.030> play<00:05:04.210> through<00:05:04.450> them<00:05:04.570> automatically

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
track to play through them automatically

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.410 
track to play through them automatically
for<00:05:05.380> us<00:05:05.500> so<00:05:06.160> it's<00:05:06.310> incredibly<00:05:06.790> flexible<00:05:07.000> and

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
for us so it's incredibly flexible and

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.750 
for us so it's incredibly flexible and
very<00:05:08.110> easy<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.440> use

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
very easy to use

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.190 
very easy to use
we<00:05:09.760> now<00:05:09.880> have<00:05:10.120> an<00:05:10.210> advanced<00:05:10.570> work<00:05:10.930> like
