00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.729
 Huh-I say that the reef is not working well Rock and roll riffs and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.729
 It is to say 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.730
 It was a little packed in that said so that also is difficult may feel that aimed ne This Is 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.450
 Kedomo is 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.250
 See you again 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:26.310
 Biz thinks that I will try to draw 5 strings and 6 strings so I can not get on well 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.310
 I hear say Well your question 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.090
 Well, you guys are listening in triples 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.360
 Pig kid this certainly contributes 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.320
 Hmm 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.320
 Don tan 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.950
 It is said that it won't change even if the other yumbomi has changed, so if you pull it, you can pull it 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.130
 It is also a scene that is good 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.230
 Rather 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:55.260
 me 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:59.010
 That would 4 items and bought even when blowing the matter, for example, of 5 whistle 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.360
 It feels like it hits San Grande, so I can draw 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.980
 Then it is said that it is 43 years 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.530
 There is a wider-range acid as the view tones come together 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.250
 For example , I thought that only 5 cases 6 yen high 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.250
 me 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.050
 tan tan 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.770
 me 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.770
 me 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.310
 ni 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.479
 nani 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.310
 A'e' this or say echo punch Naa sound ne quite picking itself is large 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.740
 By can you of 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:46.570
 By the way I think that Mr. t will come out 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.770
 As there was a force to come to the rhythm, it would come out if you go to the rhythm 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.850
 Hm as a way 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.550
 And say if you want to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.780
 Cats pointing to sounds in these people 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.440
 If you clear the mud, it will float when you can see good luck a little 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.600
 I someone 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.390
 But it's increased a little bit, but 5 strings 4 strings 3 strings 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.390
 Follow me 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.830
 That it is firmly holding only root 6-string 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.640
 Hmm 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.620
 I do not feel that it is a little above the talc 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.600
 Taking to do so 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:26.250
 It's a collaboration and it's eh 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.250
 5 of 10 plate Standing will Neun 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.890
 It has exceeded 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.890
 And then 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:43.140
 Here is no structure Kudaka at all 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:49.100
 Not not look very good but it is such form Nde and 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.100
 I think that the sound with momentum comes out when 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.100
 me 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.100
