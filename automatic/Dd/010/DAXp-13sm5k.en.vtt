00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 lost that as is years been 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.940
 Celtic and I welcome you to a 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.570
 small carnal advancement that has us 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.429
 tomás or about alpha build 1 of 0.9 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.320
 minecraft pocket edition zero point 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.150
 ok that's the first thing that has come out of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.740
 minecraft edition is to say that official 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.789
 images are showing us that they are 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.820
 working now yes 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.829
 his mother might delay all 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.329
 but look these are the images that 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.939
 have been going out so far not 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.320
 to something else before before we 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.880
 let's clarify a very important point 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.160
 because I was checking in several networks 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.280
 social and been checking more than anything 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.399
 this several people there are they publish in 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.729
 in my videos or in others that already 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.440
 it came out at 0.9 point zero I did not carnal 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.329
 this is totally an error or that has not 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.070
 left at 0.1 point zero has not left 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.350
 not even an increase of 0.9 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.790
 points 0 ok one of those has not come out yet 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.129
 it's going to come out in a few months 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.600
 meats ok still nothing comes out here not 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.070
 be fooled into being people who do not 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.420
 they want there is someone who calls 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.269
 attention the freedom the people I know 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.680
 but good the official thing that has come out in 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.110
 these moments are these images that 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.700
 I bring you the first one that will do that nothing 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.560
 plus two is very little but good at 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.479
 go ahead and tone the first one is ok 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.790
 it would be channels these as you are seeing is 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.350
 a vision if you can call it I think that 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.270
 is the maximum meat that you have 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.490
 right now in minecraft 0.8 point one 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.689
 obviously because of editing 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.340
 nothing else shows us how they can see and 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.990
 it comes as a small title that put you 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.890
 takes or that is version 0.9 points the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.350
 alpha wild 1 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.670
 this this is what you do not want to deal with 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.130
 say or what I 'm working for you 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.190
 more than anything in the rendering in the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.659
 viewing distance or this would be 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.330
 as the maximum race is for them to see 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.540
 the difference the maximum of 0.8 point 1 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.790
 that would be the normal at 0.9 point 0 that 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.690
 already in that they did it like that 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.009
 different visions and different worlds 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.200
 so that devices can run 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.810
 mid-range pulling to low 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.540
 like me and that is not the vision that 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.310
 you have 0.1 point 0 in alpha in the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.890
 normal version not in the normal view the 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.100
 true the ultimate carnal view would be 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.080
 is ok I think there are 512 blocks of 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.940
 rendering as you can see there 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.340
 flesh pieces that do not reach 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.220
 render I know why because it's 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.870
 working in annexes 5 and if not bad 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.970
 I remember they said there in what 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.110
 they posted the most for the moment 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.350
 specific than in carnal devices 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.910
 of range like ours the average low or 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.410
 well I do not know the same it 's good they're worth 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.850
 has a super tablet well boy in the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.010
 tables worry if they are going to run 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.330
 ok that kind of organizations if there is 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.239
 for tablets for devices 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.090
 them but for android devices 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.040
 mid-range they said that up to five 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.959
 years will be when you can render 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.970
 this type of visualizations in the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.560
 devices ok and not because I 'm going to see 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.790
 realizations but because they are going to have a 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.640
 pleasure new devices that already 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.410
 bring this kind of graphics not even pex 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.360
 carnal that's bad news but 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.590
 this would be the maximum view at 0.9 point 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.970
 zero so they check that it's a great 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.380
 difference between this one that is the raisin 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.790
 which is what we have now as 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.310
 maximum this would be the maximum it looks 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.390
 pretty pretty terrain but what is not 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.980
 reaches to be visualized in what is 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.450
 presumed obviously also do not end 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.890
 they are just starting but I still do not see 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.420
 the biomes as well as what advances 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.310
 different languages did not give us the 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.319
 desert and the forest 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.090
 same and there I'm running away 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.120
 something but you arrive then 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.410
 because chingón there is no tell me now yes 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.420
 that I guess they are more behind 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.560
 maniero or not put it I know but it is 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.000
 more than anything what it analyzes you of 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.319
 advance not the visualization that is going to 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.450
 have to see that yes it is enough 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.430
 milestone now yes that which has 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.489
 chingones devices like brands 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.380
 that like the apple and the tablets 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.780
 and those things for you forever 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.840
 carnal of us in poverty 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.239
 we suffer otherwise one so important 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.360
 they said that if you wanted to have this 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.150
 rendering 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.660
 in the devices the battery only 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.300
 it would last 15 carnal minutes 15 minutes 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.390
 having the minecraft to everything that gives 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.640
 what is cannon this I do not know if it is 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.850
 true I read it like this here we know that 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.100
 my English is bad but we have 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.900
 been law that you would not last 15 minutes 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.700
 obviously he's just working on 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.070
 this is not yet how it can be 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.900
 this type of visualizations to the putting 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.970
 in to maybe a little bit further back to 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.850
 that you can render it in your 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.150
 Android device could also be 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.580
 make that change that is not 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.620
 consume as much of battery this this type 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.480
 Of applications 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.270
 but good channels that's all I tell them 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.500
 in 0.9 it also did not come out that that area 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.600
 you do not have to have until now are the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.090
 official pictures of motion of shots 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.770
 are more than anything sorry tommaso and then 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.090
 I hope you liked meats and 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.169

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.730
 new thing that is coming out here the 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.200
 keep channel before either side and 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.260
 if you are not here channels because you have not 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.490
 come out ok do not be fooled you know
