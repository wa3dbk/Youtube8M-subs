00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.620
 saved of the games spaces are doctor 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.719
 white we are here today with the review 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.230
 of a fifa footballer 15 latest teams 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.779
 a player we had already seen below 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.750
 under because because it's mario 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.420
 gomez its version if with man of the 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.920
 match the series a is some ground of 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.539
 wins for the man of the match because 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.699
 we already have trouble in his second b 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.500
 69 but there is also gomez after the first 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.990
 version we have already reviewed neither 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.329
 got another after the successes of the 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.430
 fiorentina in europa league was me 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.489
 really liked the version 83 let's see if 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.859
 this 84 person is better starting 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.409
 as always from the speed that speed 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.539
 he is not terribly ill with gomez and my discreet 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.219
 opinion is not a very fast attacker 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.289
 because in any case acceleration is done 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.809
 quite catch up and speed 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.949
 maximum is not excellent with 80 so it is 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.319
 quite a value 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.999
 in the average of the attackers because neither 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:00.100
 too slow perhaps with a light but 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.929
 it's not even as fast as a doubt though 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.659
 90 of physical strength is felt 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:07.450
 therefore he is able to win the clashes 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.540
 physical and and you must use gomez 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.820
 so in the last 25 meters it can be 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.190
 lethal with regard to shooting was 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.750
 already splendid in version 83 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.820
 especially with regards to the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.400
 finalization and shooting power e 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.970
 also in this version 84 it is confirmed 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.640
 on excellent levels of finalization 92 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.440
 88 potential weakest 4-star shot 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.500
 so you can shoot either right or 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.360
 of left some improvement in the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.310
 long shot because in any case 78 which is not 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.440
 bad is not an exceptional value but not 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.900
 it's not even that bad a value though 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.000
 gomez confirms himself as an attacker 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.790
 be used within the area 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.690
 of rigor to finalize the action 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.480
 as for dribbling instead 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.680
 we have 75 on the card that is 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.570
 represented mainly by control 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.790
 of ball with 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.440
 21 which is good for an attacker 15 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.000
 long casts 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.440
 gomez manages to stop the ball 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.030
 put it down pretty well e 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.300
 realizing these are excellent 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.070
 statistics for a striker who must 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.050
 finalize the game where i am 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.030
 problems that were the same then of the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.190
 version 83 because it cannot solve them 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.830
 are the two-star skill stars skill 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.130
 just and 68 of agility so it is neither nor 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.950
 particularly agile or able to 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.320
 skip the opponent's fender charges 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.690
 sure you can overcome them by physical strength or 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.520
 maybe you don't have to overcome them because 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.920
 received the ball is simply pulled 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.620
 however you understand maybe you have three ski stars 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.170
 it would have been slightly better though 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.570
 so a problem that was in the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.940
 pressure 83 there is also for 74 that ad 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.890
 some may annoy others but no 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.560
 so depending on how you play it can 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.590
 give you more or less headaches this 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.989
 dribbling not at the top step 64 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.540
 even here it is not a problem because gomez 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.910
 we must use for final 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.080
 finalize the action and not to start 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.030
 to create game 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.489
 net improvement is almost known 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.910
 both in the accuracy of the head that 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.090
 from 89 to 98 then a large hub 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.950
 grade in this field and test gomez 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.320
 very much engage the opposing defenses e 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.079
 he knows how to commit them even in situations 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.870
 different then maybe on the long throw 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.450
 of the goalkeeper he is good of head to 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.670
 break it for the various exteriors for i 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.120
 midfielders then to pick up the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.400
 team 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.920
 on these aspects gomez really is 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.769
 really good as a player 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.190
 chemistry you're recommended for marion e 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.560
 gomez hunter or motor all go e 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.180
 two increase the speed but one by one 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.030
 interventino especially for those who want 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.840
 maybe even have it in a bit of 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.299
 shooting from outside 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.920
 in his repertoire while engine goes 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.799
 increase dribbling the passage that 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.670
 we have seen are a little his faults 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:59.100
 sure if you don't feel like putting them 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.960
 maybe the hunter also goes well 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.270
 and paradoxically 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.400
 because the bold increase a bit of everything 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.750
 so three that need the available 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.940
 in the end I remind you that the climate is becoming 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.800
 the basic is undervalued but is one of the 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.320
 more yes because it goes to improve all 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.570
 statistics therefore for players like 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.820
 gomez can do what is good for me too 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.170
 you are there I have to use it better than 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.360
 wordpress that is not noticed 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.400
 particularly as so as in the 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.810
 version 83 because it has a good 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.900
 positioning indeed a very good one 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.380
 positioning with 94 I would say 4 3 2 1 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.880
 standard with gervinho and callejon in the 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.680
 his second enhanced version he has 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.510
 excellent excellent state then in a 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.890
 midfield now the classic of serious 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.830
 we all know it from the beginning 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.260
 marquis with a very solid defense 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.790
 very inexpensive therefore in general one 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.190
 story that doesn't cost much because gomes 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.690
 it costs between 40 and 60 thousand wounded but in the 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.390
 price we will get there then when we talk 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.250
 of the cons and or gomez is fine 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.370
 also in a 4 2 3 1 of germany 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.400
 because he is German and can be tied 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.810
 easily the bundesliga then royce 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.340
 bell arabs and then behind completed 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.070
 pleasure with a bundesliga so maybe 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.330
 a goodman gustavo and then sought after 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.280
 to put a defense of the bayern monk 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.890
 which now costs no more 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.930
 very much with the addition of bishek for 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.030
 don't even put rafinha 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.620
 in conclusion gomez I liked in the 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.960
 his second version man of the match a 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.840
 a decent speed has a great shot 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.300
 an excellent 4-star foot shooting power 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.580
 weak has the physical strength has an excellent 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.350
 precision of head which are i 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.880
 problems of this player 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.860
 well he definitely needs one 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.110
 team behind because it can't find you there 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.810
 played alone so you need that 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.300
 maybe someone creates for him the game 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.520
 cost because it is cheap but 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.920
 this player cannot be found because a 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.110
 60,000 credits I would say take it 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.360
 the problem that is not found on the market 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.340
 so it's really hard to master 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.960
 take possession of this player if 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.510
 you are lucky though try it because it is me 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.129
 really liked it so much and another against 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.369
 and what not 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:58.899
 so stronger than the less certain version 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:00.759
 there have been two improvements 

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:02.349
 people I like a lot though there 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.269
 I would say if you can't find this one 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.709
 version you could settle for 

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:07.779
 first version of man of the match that 

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:10.689
 it also costs a little less 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:12.279
 in the end they are very very similar to you 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.909
 what do you think if you have tried this 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.860
 player 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.860
 we will see each other soon
