00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
real tiny are hard to see and those

real tiny are hard to see and those
three<00:00:04.350> tiny<00:00:04.650> hairs<00:00:04.950> are<00:00:05.310> called<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.580> trigger

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
three tiny hairs are called the trigger

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.080 
three tiny hairs are called the trigger
hand<00:00:06.890> and<00:00:07.890> also<00:00:08.250> if<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.400> look<00:00:08.550> inside<00:00:08.760> these

hand and also if you look inside these
traps<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.510> lot<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.840> them<00:00:09.929> have<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.230> reddish

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
traps a lot of them have that reddish

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.950 
traps a lot of them have that reddish
tint<00:00:10.950> tool<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.340> reddish<00:00:11.670> color<00:00:11.940> they<00:00:12.840> also

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
tint tool that reddish color they also

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.070

have<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> sweet<00:00:13.710> smell<00:00:14.150> so<00:00:15.150> these<00:00:15.299> also<00:00:15.570> attract

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
have a sweet smell so these also attract

have a sweet smell so these also attract
deep<00:00:16.320> they're<00:00:17.250> called<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.640> flytrap<00:00:18.119> but

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
deep they're called the flytrap but

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.060 
deep they're called the flytrap but
their<00:00:19.470> main<00:00:19.619> insect<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.279> trains<00:00:21.740> what<00:00:22.740> happens

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
their main insect of trains what happens

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.640 
their main insect of trains what happens
ant<00:00:23.340> crawls<00:00:23.670> up<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.090> there<00:00:24.330> kid<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.289> he<00:00:25.380> has<00:00:25.500> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
ant crawls up in there kid and he has to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.529 
ant crawls up in there kid and he has to
tickle<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.279> those<00:00:26.400> hairs<00:00:26.699> has<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.210> hit<00:00:27.420> it

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
tickle one of those hairs has to hit it

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.929 
tickle one of those hairs has to hit it
at<00:00:27.630> least<00:00:27.840> twice<00:00:28.080> for<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.529> clothes<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
at least twice for the clothes and the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.460 
at least twice for the clothes and the
reason<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.390> come<00:00:30.630> takes<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.929> lot<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.140> energy

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
reason is come takes a lot of energy

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.430 
reason is come takes a lot of energy
trap<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.309> close<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.850> back<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.230> doesn't

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
trap to close and back up so it doesn't

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.290 
trap to close and back up so it doesn't
want<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.620> waste<00:00:34.770> energy<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.880> if<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.090> raining

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
want to waste energy so if it's raining

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.700 
want to waste energy so if it's raining
out<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> rain<00:00:37.050> drop<00:00:37.320> hits<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.680> of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
out here in the rain drop hits one of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.040 
out here in the rain drop hits one of
those<00:00:37.860> hairs<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.640> not<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> close<00:00:39.239> all

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
those hairs it's not going to close all

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.760 
those hairs it's not going to close all
right<00:00:40.140> has<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.559> hit<00:00:40.710> at<00:00:40.829> least<00:00:41.010> twice<00:00:42.770> so

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
right has to be hit at least twice so

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.100 
right has to be hit at least twice so
the<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.370> ant<00:00:44.550> hits<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.030> hair<00:00:45.239> twice<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the the ant hits that hair twice and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.740 
the the ant hits that hair twice and
that<00:00:46.200> trap<00:00:46.500> closes<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.100> less<00:00:47.280> than<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.489> second

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.299 

if<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.930> insect<00:00:52.379> were<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.800> say<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.219> was

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
if the insect were to get out say it was

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580 
if the insect were to get out say it was
a<00:00:53.340> real<00:00:53.489> tiny<00:00:53.760> ant<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.239> big<00:00:54.420> trap<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.469> that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
a real tiny ant in a big trap and that

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.869 
a real tiny ant in a big trap and that
ant<00:00:55.800> might<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.100> able<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> crawl<00:00:56.489> out<00:00:56.520> in

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
ant might be able to crawl out in

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.939 
ant might be able to crawl out in
between<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.780> he<00:00:57.960> crawls<00:00:58.230> out<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
between there if he crawls out when the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.040 
between there if he crawls out when the
trap<00:00:59.190> actually<00:00:59.399> knows<00:00:59.820> can<00:01:00.239> figure<00:01:00.719> out<00:01:00.780> where

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
trap actually knows can figure out where

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
trap actually knows can figure out where
there<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.230> an<00:01:01.320> insect<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:02.010> there's<00:01:02.940> not

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
there is an insect in there there's not

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.050 
there is an insect in there there's not
him<00:01:03.420> go<00:01:03.570> ahead<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.840> grow<00:01:03.960> back<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.850> but<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:05.939> he

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
him go ahead and grow back up but if he

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240 
him go ahead and grow back up but if he
did<00:01:06.240> catch<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.590> over<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> next<00:01:07.979> day

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
did catch that in and over the next day

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
did catch that in and over the next day
or<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.430> it'll<00:01:08.909> go<00:01:09.030> ahead<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.299> close<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.540> real

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
or so it'll go ahead and close up real

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.770 
or so it'll go ahead and close up real
tight<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.680> once<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.280> gets<00:01:11.430> closed<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.180> it'll

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
tight and once it gets closed up it'll

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.080 
tight and once it gets closed up it'll
fill<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.320> those<00:01:13.500> digestive<00:01:13.680> juices<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
fill up with those digestive juices and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.940 
fill up with those digestive juices and
it'll<00:01:15.270> dissolve<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.869> insect<00:01:16.320> absorb<00:01:16.740> those

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it'll dissolve that insect absorb those

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.210 
it'll dissolve that insect absorb those
nutrients<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.670> then<00:01:17.820> it'll<00:01:17.939> grow<00:01:18.150> back<00:01:18.360> open

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
nutrients and then it'll grow back open

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.289 
nutrients and then it'll grow back open
and<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.400> whole<00:01:20.520> process<00:01:20.759> usually<00:01:21.150> takes

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
and that whole process usually takes

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.340 
and that whole process usually takes
about<00:01:21.540> three<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:22.020> five<00:01:22.229> days<00:01:23.000> now<00:01:24.000> each<00:01:24.900> trap

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
about three or five days now each trap

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.890 
about three or five days now each trap
can<00:01:26.070> only<00:01:26.250> eat<00:01:26.490> about<00:01:26.520> three<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.299> five<00:01:27.479> meals

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
can only eat about three to five meals

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.050 
can only eat about three to five meals
before<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.560> trap<00:01:28.890> dies<00:01:29.220> off<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.820> has<00:01:29.939> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
before that trap dies off and has to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.740 
before that trap dies off and has to
grow<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> new<00:01:30.360> leaf<00:01:30.810> or<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.350> new<00:01:31.530> trap<00:01:32.750> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
grow a new leaf or in that new trap and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.100 
grow a new leaf or in that new trap and
so<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.340> also<00:01:35.579> even<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.390> doesn't<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
so and also even if it doesn't have a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.499 
so and also even if it doesn't have a
meal<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.799> know<00:01:38.759> trigger<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.299> closes

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
meal so you know trigger and it closes

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.510 
meal so you know trigger and it closes
up<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.020> grows<00:01:40.170> back<00:01:40.439> okay<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.369> can

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
up and it grows back okay you can

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.130 
up and it grows back okay you can
usually<00:01:41.670> only<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.390> probably<00:01:42.869> eight<00:01:43.079> or

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
usually only do that probably eight or

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.300 
usually only do that probably eight or
nine<00:01:43.380> times<00:01:43.409> before<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.220> dies<00:01:44.369> off<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:47.189> we

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
nine times before it dies off so we

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.550
