goes<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.020> roots<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.560> think<00:03:02.800> of<00:03:02.920> what<00:03:03.040> humans

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
goes to the roots I think of what humans

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.300 
goes to the roots I think of what humans
are<00:03:03.790> about<00:03:04.260> we're<00:03:05.260> raising<00:03:05.470> our<00:03:05.800> food<00:03:06.040> we're

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
are about we're raising our food we're

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.550 
are about we're raising our food we're
taking<00:03:06.670> care<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:06.940> each<00:03:07.150> other<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:08.380> very

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
taking care of each other it's very

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.830 
taking care of each other it's very
direct<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.520> not<00:03:09.760> abstract<00:03:10.270> it's<00:03:10.660> not

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
direct it's not abstract it's not

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.140 
direct it's not abstract it's not
removed<00:03:11.320> it's<00:03:12.310> not<00:03:12.780> corporate<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:14.940> think<00:03:15.940> those

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
removed it's not corporate I think those

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.400 
removed it's not corporate I think those
are<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.450> things<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:16.900> are<00:03:16.989> making<00:03:17.290> it

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
are the things that are making it

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.580 
are the things that are making it
popular<00:03:17.650> but<00:03:18.010> we<00:03:18.130> do<00:03:18.280> 11<00:03:18.730> shares

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590

and a lot of people split them so we

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.790 
and a lot of people split them so we
