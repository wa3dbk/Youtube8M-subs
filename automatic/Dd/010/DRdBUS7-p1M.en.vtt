its but I'm yeah whatever so yeah we got
this<00:04:05.150> nice<00:04:05.360> freeway<00:04:05.840> now<00:04:06.110> it<00:04:06.380> says<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:06.770> know

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
this nice freeway now it says you know

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.410 
this nice freeway now it says you know
special<00:04:07.310> handling<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:07.850> everything<00:04:07.910> so<00:04:08.330> we

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
special handling and everything so we

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.090 
special handling and everything so we
can<00:04:08.510> do<00:04:08.660> things<00:04:08.900> like<00:04:09.020> this<00:04:09.440> which<00:04:09.709> is<00:04:09.739> great

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
can do things like this which is great

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.250 
can do things like this which is great
so<00:04:10.820> yeah<00:04:11.120> normal<00:04:11.510> freeway<00:04:11.870> obviously

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
so yeah normal freeway obviously

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.600 
so yeah normal freeway obviously
couldn't<00:04:12.590> do<00:04:12.680> that<00:04:12.950> but<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.250> mean<00:04:13.370> yeah<00:04:13.520> it

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
couldn't do that but I mean yeah it

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.340 
couldn't do that but I mean yeah it
seems<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.910> handle<00:04:14.209> like<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.420> pcj<00:04:14.840> would

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
seems to handle like the pcj would

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.020 
seems to handle like the pcj would
actually<00:04:15.860> that's<00:04:16.100> probably<00:04:16.730> what<00:04:16.940> I<00:04:16.970> would

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
actually that's probably what I would

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.000 
actually that's probably what I would
compare<00:04:17.510> it<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.230> yeah<00:04:18.709> very<00:04:18.890> interesting

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
compare it to so yeah very interesting

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.920 
compare it to so yeah very interesting
let's<00:04:19.700> just<00:04:19.820> say<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.090> other<00:04:20.180> bike<00:04:20.419> said<00:04:20.750> that

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
let's just say the other bike said that

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.510 
let's just say the other bike said that
weird<00:04:21.079> air<00:04:21.200> all<00:04:21.380> had<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.620> property<00:04:22.070> too<00:04:22.220> but

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
weird air all had that property too but

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.830 
weird air all had that property too but
the<00:04:22.610> freeway<00:04:22.940> was<00:04:23.060> probably<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.450> best<00:04:23.630> one

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
the freeway was probably the best one

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.870 
the freeway was probably the best one
which<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.169> could<00:04:24.350> possibly<00:04:25.040> choose<00:04:25.280> from<00:04:25.610> there

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
which I could possibly choose from there

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.180 
which I could possibly choose from there
so<00:04:26.270> yeah<00:04:27.080> good<00:04:27.410> stuff<00:04:27.620> thank<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:27.919> mister
