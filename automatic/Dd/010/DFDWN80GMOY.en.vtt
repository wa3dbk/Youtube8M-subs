00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and then the controls are electronic

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.800 
and then the controls are electronic
instead<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.610> mechanical<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.240> then<00:02:15.420> sequel

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
a representation of all of that so this

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.360 
a representation of all of that so this

sequel though is is not how far away
from<00:02:44.490> production<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.450> well<00:02:46.080> actually<00:02:46.260> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
from production is it well actually the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.010 
from production is it well actually the
sequel<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.460> forerunner<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.360> vehicle<00:02:48.750> that

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020

you'll see us stepping up to our next 00
playing<00:03:14.040> maybe<00:03:14.250> something<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.940> order<00:03:15.060> of

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
playing maybe something on the order of

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.120 
playing maybe something on the order of
a<00:03:15.480> thousand<00:03:15.990> so<00:03:16.170> we<00:03:16.290> can<00:03:16.440> really<00:03:16.620> begin<00:03:16.800> to

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
a thousand so we can really begin to

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.550 
a thousand so we can really begin to
learn<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.700> real<00:03:18.450> world<00:03:18.660> settings<00:03:18.930> everything

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
learn in real world settings everything

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.110 
learn in real world settings everything
we<00:03:19.680> need<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.920> know<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.130> go<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.370> mass<00:03:20.700> mass

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
we need to know to go to mass mass

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.090 
we need to know to go to mass mass
production<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.020> I<00:03:22.230> think<00:03:22.650> you're<00:03:22.830> going<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.040> be

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
production so I think you're going to be

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.980 
production so I think you're going to be
looking<00:03:23.220> at<00:03:23.459> technology<00:03:23.700> that's<00:03:24.390> pretty<00:03:24.750> much

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
looking at technology that's pretty much

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.020 
looking at technology that's pretty much
proven<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:25.650> terms<00:03:25.860> of<00:03:25.980> its<00:03:26.100> capabilities<00:03:26.880> by

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
proven in terms of its capabilities by

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.120 
proven in terms of its capabilities by
the<00:03:27.090> end<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:27.510> decade<00:03:27.770> that<00:03:28.770> hopefully

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
the end of this decade that hopefully

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.240 
the end of this decade that hopefully
2013<00:03:30.090> 2<00:03:30.209> 2015<00:03:31.200> will<00:03:31.410> will<00:03:31.680> really<00:03:31.950> begin<00:03:32.100> to

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
2013 2 2015 will will really begin to

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.920 
2013 2 2015 will will really begin to
start<00:03:32.550> work<00:03:32.730> toward<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.060> tipping<00:03:33.570> point<00:03:33.840> for

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
start work toward that tipping point for

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.980 
start work toward that tipping point for
these<00:03:34.170> kinds<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.560> cars<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:35.010> trucks<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.970> for<00:03:36.600> GM

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
these kinds of cars and trucks so for GM

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.630 
these kinds of cars and trucks so for GM
is<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.800> fuel<00:03:38.490> cell<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:39.709> leapfrogging<00:03:40.709> strategy

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
is is fuel cell a leapfrogging strategy

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.000 
is is fuel cell a leapfrogging strategy
right<00:03:41.880> because<00:03:42.239> today<00:03:42.989> hybrids<00:03:43.560> are<00:03:43.680> all<00:03:43.860> the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
right because today hybrids are all the

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.140 
right because today hybrids are all the
rage<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:45.680> fuel<00:03:46.680> cells<00:03:47.040> in<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.730> sense<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.120> mean

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
rage and fuel cells in a sense I mean

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.330 
rage and fuel cells in a sense I mean
you're<00:03:48.840> putting<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.140> lot<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.290> eggs<00:03:49.500> in<00:03:49.770> in<00:03:50.130> that

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
you're putting a lot of eggs in in that

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.060 
you're putting a lot of eggs in in that
bath<00:03:50.520> well<00:03:50.910> it's<00:03:51.690> one<00:03:51.900> basket<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.530> we've<00:03:52.890> put

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
bath well it's one basket that we've put

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.010 
bath well it's one basket that we've put
eggs<00:03:53.280> into<00:03:53.550> but<00:03:53.850> actually<00:03:53.880> our<00:03:54.300> strategy<00:03:54.989> is

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
eggs into but actually our strategy is

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.260 
eggs into but actually our strategy is
to<00:03:55.170> displace<00:03:55.739> petroleum<00:03:56.370> we<00:03:56.760> think<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.120> auto

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
to displace petroleum we think the auto

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.830 
to displace petroleum we think the auto
industry<00:03:57.989> is<00:03:58.200> very<00:03:58.470> vulnerable<00:03:59.430> being<00:04:00.000> 98%

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840

independence or the economic impact of

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.740 
independence or the economic impact of
importing<00:04:07.830> so<00:04:08.040> much<00:04:08.280> petroleum<00:04:08.970> we<00:04:09.510> just

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
importing so much petroleum we just

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.210 
importing so much petroleum we just
don't<00:04:09.870> think<00:04:10.170> for<00:04:10.350> business<00:04:10.680> reasons<00:04:10.770> that

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
don't think for business reasons that

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.490 
don't think for business reasons that
makes<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.550> whole<00:04:11.670> lot<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.880> sense<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.600> be<00:04:13.170> ninety

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
makes a whole lot of sense to be ninety

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.140

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
eight percent dependent on petroleum so

as<00:05:12.990> hydrogen<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.800> then<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:14.670> can<00:05:14.850> create<00:05:15.120> it

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300

and<00:05:29.280> how<00:05:29.460> you<00:05:29.760> approach<00:05:30.270> it<00:05:30.300> that's<00:05:30.690> where

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
and how you approach it that's where

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.660 
and how you approach it that's where
we're<00:05:31.080> headed<00:05:31.110> so<00:05:31.560> we<00:05:32.160> don't<00:05:32.340> think<00:05:32.430> we<00:05:32.580> have

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
we're headed so we don't think we have

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.370 
we're headed so we don't think we have
our<00:05:32.700> eggs<00:05:32.940> in<00:05:33.120> one<00:05:33.150> basket<00:05:33.300> I<00:05:33.840> think<00:05:34.050> we've<00:05:34.140> got

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
our eggs in one basket I think we've got

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.100 
our eggs in one basket I think we've got
some<00:05:35.010> really<00:05:35.220> nice<00:05:35.520> eggs<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.870> bigger

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
some really nice eggs and the bigger

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.320 
some really nice eggs and the bigger
basket<00:05:37.470> of<00:05:37.890> energy<00:05:38.310> diversity<00:05:38.970> and<00:05:39.150> that's

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
basket of energy diversity and that's

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.320 
basket of energy diversity and that's
what<00:05:39.450> we're<00:05:39.600> really<00:05:39.780> trying<00:05:40.140> to
