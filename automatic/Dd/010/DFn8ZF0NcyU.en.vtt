00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.370 
so one of the other things that we get a

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.890 
so one of the other things that we get a
lot<00:00:12.490> of<00:00:12.549> questions<00:00:12.940> above<00:00:13.150> when<00:00:13.420> people<00:00:13.750> come

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
lot of questions above when people come

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.850 
lot of questions above when people come
over<00:00:13.930> is<00:00:14.500> our<00:00:14.830> masks<00:00:16.200> we<00:00:17.200> have<00:00:17.349> two<00:00:17.619> different

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
over is our masks we have two different

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.040 
over is our masks we have two different
styles<00:00:18.400> of<00:00:18.490> mass<00:00:18.700> and<00:00:19.090> you<00:00:19.119> can<00:00:19.630> kind<00:00:19.840> of<00:00:19.900> see

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
styles of mass and you can kind of see

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.409 
styles of mass and you can kind of see
here<00:00:20.320> we<00:00:20.439> have<00:00:20.590> the<00:00:20.830> profile<00:00:21.220> series<00:00:21.520> and<00:00:21.939> then

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419 
here we have the profile series and then

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.269 
here we have the profile series and then
we<00:00:22.570> have<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:22.900> enemy<00:00:23.200> series<00:00:23.590> on<00:00:23.770> the<00:00:23.860> back<00:00:24.040> row

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
we have the enemy series on the back row

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.250 
we have the enemy series on the back row
here<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:26.260> now<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.880> know<00:00:27.970> we<00:00:28.660> are<00:00:29.080> the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
here right now you know we are the

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.679 
here right now you know we are the
number<00:00:29.500> one<00:00:29.529> mask<00:00:29.830> in<00:00:30.099> the<00:00:30.130> NHL<00:00:30.640> a<00:00:30.970> lot<00:00:31.449> of<00:00:31.570> guys

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
number one mask in the NHL a lot of guys

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.450 
number one mask in the NHL a lot of guys
wearing<00:00:32.019> our<00:00:32.169> mass<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:32.739> so<00:00:33.010> we<00:00:33.100> get<00:00:33.250> a<00:00:33.280> lot<00:00:33.400> of

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
wearing our mass and so we get a lot of

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.130 
wearing our mass and so we get a lot of
questions<00:00:33.879> about<00:00:34.030> who's<00:00:34.390> wearing<00:00:34.629> what<00:00:34.720> and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
questions about who's wearing what and

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.380 
questions about who's wearing what and
what's<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.410> difference<00:00:35.769> and<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:37.000> simplest

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
what's the difference and the simplest

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.570 
what's the difference and the simplest
way<00:00:37.570> to<00:00:37.600> explain<00:00:37.780> is<00:00:38.199> that<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:39.129> profile

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
way to explain is that the profile

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.420 
way to explain is that the profile
series<00:00:39.879> that<00:00:40.269> you<00:00:40.360> see<00:00:40.570> here<00:00:41.019> is<00:00:41.200> a<00:00:42.160> more

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
series that you see here is a more

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.010 
where we're using our latest greatest
technologies<00:01:00.190> and<00:01:00.640> we<00:01:01.359> want<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.629> make<00:01:01.750> them<00:01:01.870> as

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
technologies and we want to make them as

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.439 
technologies and we want to make them as
lightweight<00:01:02.230> as<00:01:02.410> possible<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:03.789> have<00:01:04.000> some

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
lightweight as possible we have some

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.050 
lightweight as possible we have some
more<00:01:04.629> advanced<00:01:04.960> foams<00:01:05.320> we<00:01:06.100> have<00:01:06.310> flat<00:01:06.820> wire

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
more advanced foams we have flat wire

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.520 
more advanced foams we have flat wire
cages<00:01:07.509> so<00:01:08.080> this<00:01:08.740> is<00:01:08.950> basically<00:01:10.530> traditional

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
cages so this is basically traditional

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.430 
cages so this is basically traditional

an<00:01:17.440> example<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:18.069> can<00:01:18.220> see<00:01:18.429> here<00:01:18.880> this<00:01:19.840> is<00:01:20.020> a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
an example you can see here this is a

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.169 
an example you can see here this is a

number one mask out there for about 15

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.190 
number one mask out there for about 15
years<00:01:35.890> now<00:01:36.209> when<00:01:37.209> you<00:01:37.300> look<00:01:37.539> at<00:01:37.780> something

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
like an enemy 9 same type of shape so

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.430 
like an enemy 9 same type of shape so
you<00:01:42.039> get<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.520> same<00:01:42.789> look<00:01:42.819> that<00:01:43.259> has<00:01:44.259> been

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
you get that same look that has been

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.100 
you get that same look that has been
very<00:01:44.649> popular<00:01:44.890> but<00:01:45.819> now<00:01:45.970> you're<00:01:46.179> looking<00:01:46.390> at<00:01:46.810> a

them<00:01:59.860> in<00:01:59.979> one<00:02:00.130> mask<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:01.090> can<00:02:01.239> see<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.899> flat

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
them in one mask you can see the flat

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.620 
them in one mask you can see the flat
wire<00:02:02.380> cage<00:02:02.770> here<00:02:03.190> this<00:02:04.119> has<00:02:04.270> been<00:02:04.390> really

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
wire cage here this has been really

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.419 
wire cage here this has been really
great<00:02:04.840> because<00:02:05.289> most<00:02:05.560> goalies<00:02:05.950> need<00:02:06.129> to<00:02:06.280> wear

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
great because most goalies need to wear

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.260 
great because most goalies need to wear
a<00:02:06.459> certified<00:02:06.879> wire<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.410> this<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.619> allowing

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
a certified wire and this is allowing

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.020 
a certified wire and this is allowing
for<00:02:10.270> better<00:02:10.300> vision<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.560> does<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:11.770> by

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
for better vision and it does that by

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.059 
for better vision and it does that by
having<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.300> bars<00:02:13.510> as<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.260> can<00:02:14.410> see<00:02:14.590> obviously

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
having the bars as you can see obviously

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.340 
having the bars as you can see obviously
they're<00:02:15.310> flat<00:02:15.550> this<00:02:15.819> way<00:02:15.970> they're<00:02:16.720> flat<00:02:16.989> here

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
they're flat this way they're flat here

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.550 
they're flat this way they're flat here
and<00:02:17.500> then<00:02:18.010> they're<00:02:18.130> also<00:02:18.310> angled<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.420> that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
and then they're also angled so that

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.290 
and then they're also angled so that
versus<00:02:20.560> being<00:02:20.710> just<00:02:21.010> straight<00:02:21.610> ahead<00:02:21.730> there

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
versus being just straight ahead there

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.650 
versus being just straight ahead there
at

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
at

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.050 
at
the<00:02:22.810> angled<00:02:23.350> down<00:02:23.620> if<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.670> were<00:02:24.880> looking

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
the angled down if you were looking

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.970 
the angled down if you were looking
through<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.480> mask<00:02:25.690> because<00:02:26.410> when<00:02:26.830> you're<00:02:26.950> a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
through the mask because when you're a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.590 
through the mask because when you're a
goal<00:02:27.160> year<00:02:27.430> you're<00:02:27.790> really<00:02:27.970> looking<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.450> little

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
goal year you're really looking a little

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.800 
goal year you're really looking a little
bit<00:02:28.810> down<00:02:29.110> you're<00:02:29.320> not<00:02:29.440> just<00:02:29.770> looking<00:02:29.920> up<00:02:30.810> so

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
bit down you're not just looking up so

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.010 
bit down you're not just looking up so
that<00:02:32.020> gives<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.620> opportunity<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.990> have<00:02:34.990> a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
that gives you the opportunity to have a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.010 
that gives you the opportunity to have a
little<00:02:35.200> bit<00:02:35.320> better<00:02:35.500> vision<00:02:35.860> in<00:02:36.100> there<00:02:36.280> and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
little bit better vision in there and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.020 
little bit better vision in there and
then<00:02:38.020> on<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.290> inside<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.800> mask<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.880> can

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
then on the inside of the mask you can

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.630 
then on the inside of the mask you can
see<00:02:40.740> we<00:02:41.740> have<00:02:41.770> what<00:02:42.160> we<00:02:42.190> call<00:02:42.460> our

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
see we have what we call our

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.150 
see we have what we call our
mechanically<00:02:43.120> attached<00:02:43.480> liner<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.110> this<00:02:45.010> is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
mechanically attached liner and this is

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
mechanically attached liner and this is
great<00:02:45.430> because<00:02:45.930> mask<00:02:46.930> last<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.500> long<00:02:47.620> time<00:02:47.680> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
great because mask last a long time and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.970 
great because mask last a long time and
the<00:02:49.180> only<00:02:49.360> thing<00:02:49.510> that<00:02:49.780> can<00:02:49.870> break<00:02:50.080> down<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.710> on

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
the only thing that can break down is on

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.040 
the only thing that can break down is on
the<00:02:51.130> liner<00:02:51.340> on<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.550> inside<00:02:51.690> when<00:02:52.690> it's<00:02:52.840> just

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
the liner on the inside when it's just

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.470 
the liner on the inside when it's just
glued<00:02:53.320> in<00:02:53.470> there<00:02:53.710> over<00:02:54.490> time<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.910> glue<00:02:55.120> is

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
glued in there over time the glue is

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.630 
glued in there over time the glue is
going<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.810> be<00:02:55.900> affected<00:02:56.140> by<00:02:56.500> getting<00:02:57.370> really

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
going to be affected by getting really

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.060 
going to be affected by getting really
cold<00:02:57.850> then<00:02:58.300> really<00:02:58.570> warm<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.350> wet<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.710> then

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
cold then really warm and wet and then

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.090 
cold then really warm and wet and then
dry<00:03:00.630> this<00:03:01.630> liner<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.380> attached<00:03:02.740> through<00:03:03.010> the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
dry this liner it's attached through the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.160 
dry this liner it's attached through the
hardware<00:03:03.490> you<00:03:03.640> see<00:03:03.820> here<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.210> basically

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
hardware you see here and basically

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.890 
hardware you see here and basically
you've<00:03:05.770> got<00:03:05.980> four<00:03:06.250> different<00:03:06.640> foams<00:03:06.880> as<00:03:07.180> your

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
you've got four different foams as your

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.750 
you've got four different foams as your
the<00:03:08.560> foams<00:03:08.800> that<00:03:08.920> are<00:03:09.070> close<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.520> shell

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
the foams that are close to the shell

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.100 
the foams that are close to the shell
those<00:03:10.030> are<00:03:10.180> going<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.360> be<00:03:10.450> your<00:03:10.600> harder<00:03:10.900> foams

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
those are going to be your harder foams

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.050 
those are going to be your harder foams
and<00:03:11.350> then<00:03:11.830> as<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.010> work<00:03:12.310> your<00:03:12.340> way<00:03:12.520> closer<00:03:12.940> to

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
and then as you work your way closer to

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.510 
and then as you work your way closer to
the<00:03:13.150> face<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.380> different<00:03:14.740> layers<00:03:15.100> of

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
the face you have different layers of

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.840 
the face you have different layers of
gel<00:03:15.730> foam<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.440> see<00:03:17.620> here<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:18.490> give<00:03:18.640> some

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
gel foam like you see here to give some

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.170 
gel foam like you see here to give some
added<00:03:19.150> protection<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.900> added<00:03:20.170> comfort<00:03:21.180> so

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
added protection and added comfort so

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.560 
added protection and added comfort so
this<00:03:22.600> liner<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.080> going<00:03:23.320> to<00:03:23.410> be<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> lot<00:03:23.800> more

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
this liner is going to be a lot more

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.030 
this liner is going to be a lot more
advanced<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.660> technical<00:03:26.230> than<00:03:26.410> something

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
advanced and technical than something

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.630 
advanced and technical than something
the<00:03:27.160> profile<00:03:27.580> series<00:03:27.850> so<00:03:29.459> that's<00:03:30.459> the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
the profile series so that's the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.040 
the profile series so that's the
basically<00:03:30.880> differences<00:03:31.450> new<00:03:31.630> for<00:03:31.870> this<00:03:31.990> year

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
basically differences new for this year

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.660 
basically differences new for this year
is<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.560> profile<00:03:32.980> 950<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.240> profile<00:03:34.660> 940

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
is the profile 950 and the profile 940

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.920 
is the profile 950 and the profile 940
these<00:03:36.670> have<00:03:36.910> been<00:03:37.060> very<00:03:37.450> well<00:03:37.660> accepted

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
these have been very well accepted

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.340 
these have been very well accepted
because<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:39.190> 960<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.030> fairly<00:03:40.990> high<00:03:41.020> price

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
because the 960 is a fairly high price

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.070 
because the 960 is a fairly high price
point<00:03:41.620> mask<00:03:42.150> whereas<00:03:43.150> now<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:43.390> can<00:03:43.720> get<00:03:43.900> that

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
point mask whereas now you can get that

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.550 
point mask whereas now you can get that
same<00:03:44.470> style<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.280> shape<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:46.660> two<00:03:47.350> different

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
same style and shape in two different

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.949 
same style and shape in two different
price<00:03:48.550> points<00:03:48.580> so<00:03:49.209> we're<00:03:49.720> pretty<00:03:49.840> excited

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
price points so we're pretty excited

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.430 
price points so we're pretty excited
about<00:03:50.410> our<00:03:50.530> mouse<00:03:50.650> lineup<00:03:50.980> for<00:03:51.130> this<00:03:51.190> year<00:03:51.370> so

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
about our mouse lineup for this year so

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.870 
about our mouse lineup for this year so
one<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.620> other<00:03:53.739> things<00:03:53.830> that<00:03:54.190> we<00:03:54.550> do<00:03:54.670> get<00:03:54.850> a

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
one of the other things that we do get a

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.240 
one of the other things that we do get a
lot<00:03:55.000> of<00:03:55.060> questions<00:03:55.480> about<00:03:55.600> is<00:03:56.080> our<00:03:56.860> different

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
lot of questions about is our different

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.790 
lot of questions about is our different
composite<00:03:57.700> sticks<00:03:58.080> we<00:03:59.080> have<00:03:59.290> two<00:03:59.620> different

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
composite sticks we have two different

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.490 
composite sticks we have two different
styles<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.430> composites<00:04:01.030> one<00:04:01.630> being<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.989> RX

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
styles of composites one being the RX

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.280 
styles of composites one being the RX
series<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:03.160> then<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:04.300> supreme<00:04:04.690> series<00:04:05.110> that

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
series and then the supreme series that

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.830 
series and then the supreme series that
you<00:04:05.380> can<00:04:05.500> see<00:04:05.650> here<00:04:05.860> I<00:04:05.890> have<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.130> total<00:04:06.310> one

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
you can see here I have the total one

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.580 
you can see here I have the total one
the<00:04:07.840> main<00:04:08.050> difference<00:04:08.620> is<00:04:08.860> in<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.459> shape<00:04:09.700> and

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
the main difference is in the shape and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.050 
the main difference is in the shape and
when<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.620> say<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.400> there<00:04:12.550> is<00:04:12.640> different

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
when I say that that there is different

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.039 
when I say that that there is different
shapes<00:04:13.270> what<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.570> mean<00:04:13.840> is<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:15.400> RX<00:04:15.790> we<00:04:16.570> have<00:04:16.780> a

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
shapes what I mean is the RX we have a

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.680 
shapes what I mean is the RX we have a
flat<00:04:17.320> paddle<00:04:17.650> so<00:04:18.580> on<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.000> front<00:04:19.270> of<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.419> stick

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
flat paddle so on the front of the stick

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.020 
flat paddle so on the front of the stick
the<00:04:19.959> paddles<00:04:20.350> flat<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:21.609> does<00:04:21.850> two

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
the paddles flat and that does two

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.420 
the paddles flat and that does two
things<00:04:22.060> it<00:04:22.570> helps<00:04:22.870> reduce<00:04:23.410> weight<00:04:23.740> because

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
things it helps reduce weight because

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.040 
things it helps reduce weight because
you're<00:04:24.640> taking<00:04:24.850> away<00:04:25.150> some<00:04:25.419> material<00:04:25.870> and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
you're taking away some material and

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.230 
you're taking away some material and
then<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.740> also<00:04:26.919> is<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.340> better<00:04:27.580> surface<00:04:27.880> for

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
then it also is a better surface for

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.650 
then it also is a better surface for
real

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
real

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.320 
real
so<00:04:29.230> versus<00:04:29.650> having<00:04:29.890> like<00:04:30.640> you<00:04:30.760> can<00:04:30.940> see<00:04:31.090> on<00:04:31.210> the

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
so versus having like you can see on the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.630 
so versus having like you can see on the
back<00:04:31.480> versus<00:04:31.990> having<00:04:32.170> a<00:04:32.380> rounded<00:04:32.800> shape<00:04:33.010> where

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
back versus having a rounded shape where

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.010 
back versus having a rounded shape where
the<00:04:33.820> puck<00:04:34.030> is<00:04:34.060> going<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.360> deflect<00:04:34.690> a<00:04:34.810> little

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
the puck is going to deflect a little

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.480 
the puck is going to deflect a little
bit<00:04:35.140> differently<00:04:35.530> depending<00:04:35.710> on<00:04:36.100> where<00:04:36.250> it's

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
bit differently depending on where it's

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.050 
bit differently depending on where it's
the<00:04:36.670> flat<00:04:37.480> surface<00:04:38.140> is<00:04:38.350> great<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.820> know<00:04:39.910> it's

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
the flat surface is great you know it's

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.590 
the flat surface is great you know it's
a<00:04:40.120> great<00:04:40.300> shape<00:04:40.540> for<00:04:40.780> deflecting<00:04:41.350> rebounds

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
a great shape for deflecting rebounds

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.000 
a great shape for deflecting rebounds
wherever<00:04:43.600> you<00:04:43.660> need<00:04:43.750> them<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:44.050> go<00:04:44.170> now<00:04:44.950> the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
wherever you need them to go now the

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.440 
wherever you need them to go now the
supreme<00:04:45.580> series<00:04:46.230> has<00:04:47.230> some<00:04:47.710> similar<00:04:48.450> geometry

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
supreme series has some similar geometry

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.140 
supreme series has some similar geometry
but<00:04:50.350> it's<00:04:50.530> actually<00:04:50.710> got<00:04:51.190> what<00:04:51.760> we<00:04:51.850> call<00:04:52.000> an

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
but it's actually got what we call an

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.340 
but it's actually got what we call an
ergonomic<00:04:52.780> back<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:55.030> front<00:04:56.020> of<00:04:56.290> the

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
ergonomic back and the front of the

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.110 
ergonomic back and the front of the
paddle<00:04:56.680> is<00:04:56.770> actually<00:04:57.310> a<00:04:57.460> little<00:04:57.640> bit<00:04:57.880> concave

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
paddle is actually a little bit concave

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.870 
paddle is actually a little bit concave
and<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:59.530> has<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.740> little<00:05:00.100> bit<00:05:00.220> different<00:05:00.580> twist

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
and it has a little bit different twist

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.870 
and it has a little bit different twist
as<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.360> get<00:05:01.510> up<00:05:01.660> here<00:05:01.920> if<00:05:02.920> you<00:05:03.250> want<00:05:03.610> to<00:05:03.700> look

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
as you get up here if you want to look

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.490 
as you get up here if you want to look
in<00:05:04.060> here<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:04.570> can<00:05:04.750> kind<00:05:04.990> of<00:05:05.080> see<00:05:05.140> the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
in here you can kind of see the

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.420 
in here you can kind of see the
different<00:05:05.920> shapes<00:05:06.250> of<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:07.150> two<00:05:07.330> paddles<00:05:08.430> so

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
different shapes of the two paddles so

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.550 
different shapes of the two paddles so
it's<00:05:09.640> kind<00:05:09.820> of<00:05:09.910> like<00:05:09.970> we<00:05:10.330> have<00:05:10.510> in<00:05:10.540> whether<00:05:11.380> it

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
it's kind of like we have in whether it

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.520 
it's kind of like we have in whether it

new<00:05:38.740> for<00:05:38.950> this<00:05:39.040> year<00:05:39.100> you<00:05:39.940> can<00:05:40.120> see<00:05:40.360> that<00:05:40.390> it's

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
new for this year you can see that it's

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.710 
new for this year you can see that it's
got<00:05:40.900> this<00:05:41.200> this<00:05:42.070> weave<00:05:42.400> in<00:05:42.670> here<00:05:43.030> and<00:05:43.180> what

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
got this this weave in here and what

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.470 
got this this weave in here and what
that<00:05:43.870> is<00:05:43.900> is<00:05:44.050> it's<00:05:44.410> Anna<00:05:44.620> negra<00:05:44.950> fiber<00:05:45.480> and

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
that is is it's Anna negra fiber and

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.720 
that is is it's Anna negra fiber and
what<00:05:47.050> that<00:05:47.200> material<00:05:47.710> is<00:05:47.860> is<00:05:48.160> it's<00:05:48.340> something

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
what that material is is it's something

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.820 
what that material is is it's something
that's<00:05:48.940> extremely<00:05:49.360> lightweight<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.530> it's

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
that's extremely lightweight and it's

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.550 
that's extremely lightweight and it's
extremely<00:05:51.250> durable<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:52.000> the<00:05:52.720> benefit<00:05:53.169> of<00:05:53.200> it

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
extremely durable and the benefit of it

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.340 
extremely durable and the benefit of it
is<00:05:53.740> that<00:05:54.070> it's<00:05:54.640> a<00:05:55.030> weave<00:05:55.300> so<00:05:55.690> when<00:05:56.200> it's

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
is that it's a weave so when it's

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.400 
is that it's a weave so when it's
getting<00:05:56.470> hit<00:05:56.919> it's<00:05:57.580> got<00:05:57.790> some<00:05:58.000> flex<00:05:58.330> so<00:05:59.080> when

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
getting hit it's got some flex so when

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.560 
getting hit it's got some flex so when
you<00:05:59.470> think<00:05:59.680> about<00:05:59.800> your<00:06:00.130> goalie<00:06:00.490> taking<00:06:01.210> shots

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
you think about your goalie taking shots
