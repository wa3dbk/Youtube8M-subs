00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 according to the apostle Paul's gun to the Corinthians 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.950
 chapter 1 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.259
 Paul the apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:10.879
 and brother timoteo 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.919
 to the church of God that is in Corinth with all the saints that are 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.219
 in all quiet 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.310
 grace and peace to you from God our father 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.499
 and of the Lord Jesus Christ 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.879
 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ father of mercy 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:28.699
 ace asked for all consolation 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.980
 which comforts us in all our tribulations so that we can also 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.550
 we comfort those who are in any tribulation 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.410
 through the consolation with which we are consoled by God 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.190
 because in the way that the afflictions of Christ abound in us 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.900
 so also our consolation abounds with Christ himself 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.390
 but if we are or manned is for your consolation and salvation 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.809
 or if we are comforted 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.410
 it is for your consolation and salvation 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.329
 which is operated in suffering the same hobbies that we also 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.910
 we suffer 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.170
 and our hope for you is firm 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.400
 we know that just as you are companions in afflictions, 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.520
 you are in consolation 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.620
 because brothers we do not want you to ignore and about our crew that does not 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.080
 it happened in asia 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.390
 we were overwhelmed overwhelmingly beyond our strength 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.060
 so that we still take the hope of preserving life 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.840
 but we had a death sentence in ourselves 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.090
 so that he does not trust we do in ourselves but in God who resurrects the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.940
 dead 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.330
 which freed us and frees us and in whom we hope will still rid us of 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.630
 so big death 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.760
 also cooperating on our behalf with prayer 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.390
 so that many people may be given thanks in our favor 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390
 for the tone granted to us by means of many 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.630
 because our sixth glory the testimony of our conscience that with 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.840
 Simplicity and sincerity of God 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.479
 not with human wisdom 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.180
 but with the grace of God 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.580
 we have led ourselves in the world and much more with you 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.240
 because we write other things that he did 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.179
 or you also understand and I hope that until the end you will understand 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.890
 as you have also partly understood that we are your glory 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.840
 as well as you ours for the day of the Lord Jesus 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:26.040
 with this confidence I wanted to go first to you so that you had a second 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:31.079
 grace and for you pass to Macedonian and from Macedonia come again to 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.469
 you and be routed by you to Judea 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.529
 so when proposing in this 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.689
 use perhaps lightness 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.129
 or what you plan to do 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.409
 I think it according to the flesh so that there is in me yes and no 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.969
 more as God is faithful our word you are not yes and no 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:52.050
 because the son of god jesus christ 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.999
 that among you has been preached by us for min silvano and timoteo 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:58.969
 It has not been a sign 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.839
 more acids and in it 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:03.839
 because all the promises of God are in him 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.929
 and in him amen 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:07.359
 through us 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.309
 for the glory of God 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:14.479
 and the one who confirms us with you in Christ and the one who did not solve is God the 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.619
 which also has sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit in our 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:19.849
 hearts 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.329
 but I invoke God as a witness over my soul that for being lenient with 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.579
 you have not yet gone to Corinth 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.059
 what he taught us we read about your faith 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:34.349
 but we collaborate for your joy because for the party and
