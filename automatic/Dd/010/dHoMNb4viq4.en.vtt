00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 all my friends my name is portugal 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.230
 and I'm max and today we do that 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.380
 whole times a little different we have 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.719
 here a theory opened 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.299
 be the one piece and these em 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.760
 we read silly nice music 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.090
 inferior and then we discuss 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.609
 about that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.670
 So, lean back and enjoy 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.920
 the theory on the moon pretended 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.050
 long time a kingdom by the name 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.460
 Citizen the technology in this kingdom 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.050
 was far advanced 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.550
 an example for example was the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.270
 robot and the weapons you 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.649
 create 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.149
 they have the moon because of 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.430
 Leave resource scarcity and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.290
 emigrated from the moon to the earth with 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.250
 a self-constructed ship that 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.469
 they call pluto 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.200
 also in the cover story of enel 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.090
 You want a secret organization 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.730
 here makes use of itself and explained 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.800
 therefore the citizen war on it then 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.120
 The citizens transformed two weapons 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.809
 to win the war 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.100
 they were named poseidon and uranus 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.559
 poseidon runs below the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.180
 seabed the tide of the sea 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.159
 change by a barrier against 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.900
 to build enemy ships and with 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.760
 the weapon uranus solved the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.560
 natural disasters and prevented 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.360
 so the climate by earthquakes and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.520
 Outbreaks of undersea volcano 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.000
 became the red line and that came world 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.400
 educated 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.860
 the ocean was divided into four 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.530
 The cannons of poseidon are from her 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.960
 homeland fairways made the ball neckar 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.540
 now sand is a trend 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.220
 for the calculation of seawater has and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.909
 the water is the solid form of santa 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.280
 take 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.439
 later the cannonballs fell into the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.960
 Seabed and it was to the doctors 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.270
 These doctors are today as stones 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.439
 the devil's users are known for their powers 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.119
 also rob with theirs 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.070
 extraordinary weapons lost the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.960
 people from the moon in the war after 100 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.579
 years the survivors fight 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.680
 Hidden weapons so they do not get in 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.170
 hands of the organization device and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.030
 took that as the medium assumed that 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.590
 for half a moon stands around 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.479
 to recognize each other because the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.560
 organization tried all humans of 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.630
 moon to destroy 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.030
 this organization gave itself the name 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.399
 World Government and they eliminated theirs 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.299
 they abused 20 soldiers 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.520
 send to the moon 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.620
 for any traces and proofs for her 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.599
 existence of the moon to eliminate humans 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.180
 the descendants of these soldiers are 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.620
 known today as world aristocrats and 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.530
 are treated like kings 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.510
 that also explains the spacesuits the 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.860
 Survivors built a small one 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.349
 island for the world government 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.569
 The name of this island can not be found 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.970
 hvar unicorn on hid them 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.709
 individual parts of the pony glyphs 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.989
 true story because you are human 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.970
 tell about the actions of the world government 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.099
 wanted on the island of june one could 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.870
 final weapon of the citizens very the 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.930
 ability to blues all four blues again 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.440
 to unite a borloo the name of 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.390
 weapon from deep through the weapon one piece 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.519
 would break the red line and the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.049
 location of the world government marica was 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.049
 sinking in the ocean 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.510
 so is the theory heard and now 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.390
 let's talk about it 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.609
 so portugals almost you are thinking 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.129
 in any case, the theory is super blatant 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.540
 There is a lot of real reason for that 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.709
 synonymous in the whole sense of something I find 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.359
 it with the spacesuits of the weather 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.380
 have that just leaves too much 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.569
 lets conclude 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.099
 I just think it's more good because of you 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.230
 yes has the body of enel yet 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.700
 had and the fact the room and 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.530
 special from up there I think 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.000
 it mega well done somehow I think 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.470
 also a verdi so has that 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.540
 actually supposedly of mexicans 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.590
 written dry must say there 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.950
 has the real thought over it 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.540
 made 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.060
 I think it's really good too 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.489
 you just have to say to the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.169
 example also with the service to 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.769
 crescent represent so that they do 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.620
 recognize 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.299
 I think that's really cool because I mean mine 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.040
 if you listen to her 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.379
 he thinks you look real but it in 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.460
 moment however it could be 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.410
 because 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.920
 you just make so many arguments 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.260
 inside which the act just looks real 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.520
 let this be another big storm 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.300
 kindled ignited I think really blatant or 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.100
 Also that the svp is still the weapon 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.990
 the direct line can destroy 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.730
 This would also form the blue 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.380
 So that somehow fits everything together 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.560
 land and thereby also the fish 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.200
 people are destroyed because he 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.180
 human under red line lies and the 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.370
 fish will be destroyed and thereby 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.220
 also the prediction of the mermaid 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.010
 then it was clear that rafi will be the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.100
 the fish will destroy the island 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.570
 it has and then everything will be 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.340
 just like that was and that is why the 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.560
 arche maybe and that's just the way it is 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.400
 power because it's just really there 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.770
 correct sense 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.530
 that would also explain, for example 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.600
 why the world government has never been to the 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.730
 unicorns has looked and why 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.050
 the complete grant line along single 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.300
 does not have to be just from the 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.000
 Backside simply the unicum can go 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.860
 because the of the untraceable is yes 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.200
 maybe only two can 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.020
 committee a theory that only this 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.880
 yes, my friends can go to this island 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.660
 I would say just do it yourself 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.250
 thoughts about it and then I say already 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.450
 goodbye and fallen 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.610
 has a thumbs up 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.480
 subscribe to something a shorter one 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.980
 theory 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.860
 let's start with a different way 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:22.750
 to pack than usual and say so 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:26.860
 me and ph and what i have left for a moment 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.090
 wanted to comment if any intro 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.620
 do something among you 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.740
 if he might make us an intro 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.940
 because we are not so talented in it 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.560
 Anything that pleases us 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.700
 I just make the praise 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.290
 my description and you can 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.610
 Just let the bug fly the logo 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.050
 not in the description we do that 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.570
 not so that your complete intro 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.340
 could do what logistics did 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.139
 the intro but please not so cheap 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.939
 so 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.580
 no dubstep intro or somehow 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:52.979
 electro intro must already have style 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.659
 have to have that just because and pirates 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.319
 so it has to look moderate 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:56.939
 to have style 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.830
 that would be really cool of 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:03.439
 you and then I would say we see 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.439
 us in the next video so then peace
