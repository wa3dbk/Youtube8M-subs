00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
um in robot mode but we'll get that

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:12.899 
um in robot mode but we'll get that
transformed<00:02:12.069> really<00:02:12.310> quick

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
okay so let's get this guy transformed

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.890 
okay so let's get this guy transformed
into<00:03:03.650> bot<00:03:04.520> mode<00:03:04.730> same<00:03:05.150> with<00:03:05.300> this<00:03:05.390> guy<00:03:05.570> here

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
into bot mode same with this guy here

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.350 
into bot mode same with this guy here
and<00:03:06.050> I<00:03:06.980> suppose<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.580> little<00:03:07.850> dude<00:03:08.030> here<00:03:08.270> as

have a comparison shot and take a look
and<00:03:11.360> see<00:03:11.480> all<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.720> beautiful<00:03:12.680> differences

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
and see all the beautiful differences

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.980 
and see all the beautiful differences
between<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:14.090> three<00:03:14.120> here<00:03:14.510> they<00:03:14.630> are<00:03:14.780> all

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
transformed in their bot mode here is

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.680 
transformed in their bot mode here is
