00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.449
 who arrives or does not come to bring some 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.449
 but preached 2% of them 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.190
 the new sound of haiti peace leads the software 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.559
 will be from r 15 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.580
 now let's gain experience by chance 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.950
 was too much to see the graph of 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.930
 pizza now we need to fasten f3 chips 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.430
 we also have a function because we 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.950
 we can see with direction we are 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.540
 looking pressed but 93 h plus 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.309
 we can see the same from there because we 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.020
 we can also see the possibility of it 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.020
 beyond the scale level of our maps 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.579
 no mob - armed assault rain it 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.379
 we continue to attack the creative way 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.090
 particle effect acquired by the peak 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.530
 a blog is a little more transparent 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.530
 to decrease the lag in the game 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.620
 there is a new item in the game called 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.420
 sent the anvil when we can 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.670
 to change the name of an item in 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.320
 exchange of experience in addition to 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:12.300
 the more you use the more damaged it 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:14.130
 the anvil will also have gravity 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.960
 can escape with furniture and objects 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.210
 the greater the height, the greater the damage, but also 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.860
 greater damage and stimulates option 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.660
 to multiplayer mode where we can 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.220
 enable or disable preview 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.539
 of other users' covers 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.399
 these covers were officially 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.440
 acquired by players who visited 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.630
 online with the part of a program 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.820
 external we can modify how it will be 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.530
 the explosion of a tripod we can change 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.340
 as much as the distance that the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.340
 explosion will not pass 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.570
 ah ah ah ah
