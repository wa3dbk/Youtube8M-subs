00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.560
 take less and add dates here 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.439
 we will be all this out 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.770
 This is my mass 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:04.439
 It turned out from dates and seeds 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:10.380
 actually this is our dough for the first 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:13.830
 cakes to taste very similar to halva but 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.989
 property can already eat leave 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.000

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.709
 layer 2 layer takes half a lemon zest 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.010
 dried apricots 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:29.160
 dried apricots also need 200 grams of dried apricots like me 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.430
 already said i soaked before 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.880
 water at this stage we have it all 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.810
 grind dried apricots with lemon zest 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.920
 add another peeled almond nut 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.620
 soaked about 200 grams and 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.430
 grind further so the second layer in 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.459
 which we have dried apricots almonds and 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:59.120
 lemon is also ready for a very fun 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:02.760
 shade and amazingly delicious fragrant 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.640
 smells like lemon put off until 100 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.459
 and we will do the third layer so 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.680
 third layer 150 grams of coconut chips 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:16.319
 and here I have two tablespoons 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:21.000
 vegetable oil here also add a spoon 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:23.340
 honey and almonds are also 200 grams since 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.510
 the mass is somewhat dry 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.840
 add lemon juice to it 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.019
 more plastic so ready my three layers 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.630
 now i will form our one i take 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.170
 detachable form you can take just 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.630
 cover the bowl and polyethylene with us 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.150
 your permission will shape everything 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:50.610
 with my hands and a cistern I will grease the oil a little 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.829
 but just for me to be 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:04:00.659
 it's easier to extract it all literally 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:06.030
 a few drops of olive oil pen first layer 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:09.319
 dates and sunflower seeds and start 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:14.099
 handles it evenly across 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.259
 the bottom of our form all the first layer laid 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:22.350
 Now take a second layer which 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:24.979
 consists of dried apricots almond lemon and such 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.870
 in the same way actually distribute it 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:31.740
 such a cake despite its calorie content 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.930
 it is useful enough it is not those calories 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.740
 which we get if we eat 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:42.180
 let's say sponge cake with fat cream 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:45.570
 these calories rather go to energy they are to 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:51.050
 us in the tank and now the turn of the third 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:58.229
 layer is we have almond coconut 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:05:02.460
 coconut oil and plus by the way such 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:06.080
 cakes even in that the shelf life of them 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:10.590
 big enough compared to normal 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.510
 not raw cakes as each one himself 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.990
 to myself 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:19.680
 the ingredient itself can be stored 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.370
 long tightly tamped to 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.729
 our one would be convenient to cut so that it does not 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.860
 crumble note that 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.990
 if you prepare such a current 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.180
 let loose in a bowl that you make 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:40.650
 polyethylene you need in the future but i 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.380
 turn this cake like mine 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.040
 I will not turn it over now 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.370
 follow 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.680
 what stage i will decorate it from above a 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.860
 if you turn it over 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:58.290
 decorate best one so before serving at 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:01.290
 me that dried lemon is very tasty 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.450
 and if you haven't tried it 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:07.440
 these little lemons 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:11.730
 wild amazingly delicious can be a little bit 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:16.010
 they push here and then I take 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:22.520
 sprinkle almond chips on top 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:22.520
 I distribute between our lemon my 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.230
 press in a little bit so that she doesn't 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.150
 crumbled 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:36.000
 Now our cake is covered with a film and 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:40.580
 put in a cold place in the fridge 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.130
 for example if you eat it 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:47.970
 right now you have very little time 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:53.120
 you can put it for half an hour all 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:56.520
 we will eat his camera tomorrow 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:00.650
 so cut will show you the beasts 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:05.390
 tomorrow and so the night has passed my cake already 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:09.840
 I lay down frozen all the ingredients 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:14.100

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.270
 baking 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:34.270
 Now I will try a piece and say my 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:37.510
