how to play double stops well you

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.970 
how to play double stops well you
basically<00:00:09.540> play<00:00:09.809> two<00:00:09.870> notes<00:00:10.019> at<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.440> time<00:00:10.469> and

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
basically play two notes at a time and

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.480 
basically play two notes at a time and
whatever<00:00:11.490> combination<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:13.009> is<00:00:14.009> entirely

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
whatever combination that is is entirely

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.430 
whatever combination that is is entirely
up<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.900> keep<00:00:16.049> them<00:00:16.170> close

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
up to you you can keep them close

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:28.810 
up to you you can keep them close
together

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:37.340 

or<00:00:29.820> further<00:00:30.420> apart

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:47.430 

and<00:00:38.350> combinations<00:00:39.070> thereof<00:00:45.990> so<00:00:46.990> really<00:00:47.290> it's

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
and combinations thereof so really it's

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.950 
and combinations thereof so really it's
just<00:00:47.560> a<00:00:47.800> matter<00:00:47.830> of<00:00:48.130> using<00:00:48.910> you<00:00:49.240> know<00:00:49.360> your

first finger is going to drop in
occasionally<00:01:00.880> as<00:01:01.540> needed<00:01:02.170> but<00:01:02.650> when<00:01:02.860> you're

occasionally as needed but when you're
doing<00:01:03.130> a<00:01:03.370> lot<00:01:03.489> of<00:01:03.670> picking<00:01:03.910> stuff<00:01:04.120> if<00:01:04.360> you've

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
doing a lot of picking stuff if you've

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.450 
doing a lot of picking stuff if you've
got<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.600> choice<00:01:04.870> between<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.500> two<00:01:05.530> go<00:01:06.220> for<00:01:06.370> the

got a choice between the two go for the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.370 
got a choice between the two go for the
second<00:01:06.820> one<00:01:07.000> you've<00:01:07.420> got<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.690> little<00:01:07.930> bit<00:01:08.110> more

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
second one you've got a little bit more

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.230 
second one you've got a little bit more
space<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:08.890> work<00:01:09.010> with<00:01:09.070> you're<00:01:09.729> gonna<00:01:09.910> be<00:01:10.060> less

likely to get jammed up because of the

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.290 
likely to get jammed up because of the
proximity<00:01:12.190> of<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.490> first<00:01:12.729> finger<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.210> the

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
possibilities for double stops or really

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.040 
possibilities for double stops or really
pretty<00:01:20.380> much<00:01:20.560> any<00:01:20.920> kind<00:01:21.160> of<00:01:21.280> stops<00:01:21.550> so<00:01:22.050> that

would those are just some examples of of

what you can do again you can engage a

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.880 
what you can do again you can engage a
pedal<00:01:29.670> leading<00:01:30.670> into<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.000> as<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:32.560> know<00:01:32.800> with

pedal leading into it as you know with
it<00:01:33.040> with<00:01:33.190> a<00:01:33.220> lower<00:01:33.940> to<00:01:34.810> kick<00:01:35.020> things<00:01:35.229> off<00:01:35.440> it's

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
it with a lower to kick things off it's

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.830 
it with a lower to kick things off it's
always<00:01:36.130> good<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.520> with<00:01:37.060> pedal<00:01:37.330> steel<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.720> give

always good to with pedal steel to give

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.330 
always good to with pedal steel to give
the<00:01:37.960> impression<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.500> you're<00:01:38.650> coming<00:01:39.130> from

somewhere and going somewhere too
you<00:01:41.770> don't<00:01:41.950> want<00:01:42.069> to<00:01:42.160> be<00:01:42.250> just<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:43.630> is<00:01:43.840> kind

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
of static it's a lot less interesting

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.809 
of static it's a lot less interesting
than<00:01:46.259> which<00:01:47.259> is<00:01:47.440> reaching<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.069> same<00:01:48.250> result

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
to the next in a sort of a rigid way so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.040 
to the next in a sort of a rigid way so
that's<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.319> for<00:02:18.470> double<00:02:18.770> stops
