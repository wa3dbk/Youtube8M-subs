00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hey people and welcome 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.980
 to a new video 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.899
 I have the promised one for you today 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.330
 dm hall review and that's what I have 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.950
 just two last wm I 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.440
 turned so interesting 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.089
 selected products and those you stop 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.379
 most often asked that me 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.180
 she should just rate it that way 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.260
 should judge and so and I have me 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.640
 for today I think that the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.439
 simple products sometimes notes 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.970
 I've been distributing that in one lately 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.769
 video by marie funkkanal snooki 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.109
 provided and I thought that was really good 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.160
 So maybe you like it too 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.260
 can you even in the comments 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.390
 Write and then I'll just say 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.520
 with the first product is the one 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.930
 base of p2 and that's not just green 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.180
 from the packaging but also the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.890
 liquid in there is green and that 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.420
 This is because the product checks 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.719
 should cover and move 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.160
 world stage halt bread neutralized 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.050
 However, I had the feeling now 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.350
 the part just did not do anything else 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.969
 as your face just turns into a giant 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.949
 glitter ball and so really 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.600
 it has also covered my redness 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.980
 not i had the feeling that is more 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.170
 the face a bit happier 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.460
 Maybe it makes you look like that 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.840
 directly over a little bit 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.330
 but did not really disappear 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.580
 That's why I would give the product a four 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.020
 minus give it continues with the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.119
 second product that makes it a foundation 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.520
 from l'oreal and indeed the lumiread 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.590
 make-up relatively expensive for drugstore 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.960
 proportions it has 12 13 euro 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.670
 tasted and I would just have one 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 bit more expected so I'd of 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.150
 Foundation at the end of a 3 because I give 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.799
 just had the feeling that she was not 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.479
 so long on my face received 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.009
 as other foundations might have been 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.720
 They are also easy for my skin type 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.400
 a bit too fluid and lice with one 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.619
 dry skin would be even better 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.360
 come on but I would you there 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.409
 the perfect match foundation from l'oreal 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.820
 I recommend a lot for me 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.189
 better and even two more 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.780
 euro cheaper or so but that is 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.280
 just very fast right now too 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.270
 at the warmer temperatures of mine 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.700
 face disappeared 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.500
 and although I get the result and directly 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.790
 after the application was ok it was 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.380
 me then 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.820
 not quite the money worth the next 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.500
 two products for not yet around 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.770
 a lot better these two of thalia 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.970
 and indeed almost once a total screen 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.570
 one can say and once one 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.180
 reloading 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.070
 the night cream gets from me a 1 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.560
 I think so awesome 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.210
 I have it now two to three weeks 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.890
 and used every day 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.340
 I think she really donates that way 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.600
 perfect amount of moisture and siri 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.820
 stoll and has a really nice 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.920
 consistency and price performance 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.260
 ratio is just right 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.410
 I totally recommend that means 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.209
 by the way of perfection main proceedings 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.430
 a night cream and the second cream of 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.640
 barea comes from the same series 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.209
 means to perfection majid irxleben 2 in 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.860
 Everything is so perfect and that's great 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.320
 interesting that is so greyish 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.000
 if she gets out of the tube and has 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.560
 he was called this client goes with 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.780
 globules in the formulation and the 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.060
 then burst open when the catch so 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.130
 distributed on the skin and then you have 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.900
 yes, this slight make up effect 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.459
 the skin so have my call 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.870
 the cream works very well i 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.760
 just think if you have a darker time 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.170
 or maybe some cellar then scratches 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.430
 perhaps not quite too hard 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.440
 on if the opacity really is now 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.850
 only very minimal but it is just 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.370
 this very slight krausch you there 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.470
 that's why I would make the cream a one 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.760
 minus first product i have in 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.440
 very recently in 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.720
 seen various wooden drogerie and 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:20.380
 be from this jug to ios lip balm 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:22.180
 this loop i find that part 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.310
 okay but it has me now 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.900
 knocked out the ios or the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.060
 from w7 I find much better 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.250
 him I have the feeling that the 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.510
 lip balm is too hard and thereby 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.489
 not quite as much on the lips 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.989
 That's why I would come somehow 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.510
 the lip balm at the end only a three 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.680
 minus 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.350
 I'm just there in the 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.540
 Call the better products 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.640
 and yes I can not be so happy 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.350
 play next but something on each 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.930
 case of a 1 gets then there is still 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.880
 a one plus because it just like that 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.370
 This is effective from Schwarzkopf 's 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.840
 Immediately creates volume brother of otherwise 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.580
 so crazy you just spread one 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.630
 a little bit of the approaches and 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.060
 then you can probably a bit 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.770
 high sachets and your hair is a 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.780
 couple really long really upwards 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.220
 and it is much more volume there is 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.140
 before i do not know how this brother 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.300
 you can do it that way 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.680
 slightly sticky and I fax in the 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.630
 consistency so I do not think he is 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.790
 feels especially nice on the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.570
 hands but the effect is just real 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.040
 I just think so convincing lives 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.330
 yes I totally recommend it 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.100
 next two products come from 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.410
 sales and I actually think 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.270
 pretty good the first gets a 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.250
 1 smooth one in any case that is 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.410
 thus the best eyebrow product 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.630
 you have also used and that 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.940
 the long lasting brews the pillars of 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.850
 patrice in the lye new paths in 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.760
 assortment that means only 40 nutzli 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.770
 presence and that is like a kind 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.420
 felt pen but is quite very thin and 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.770
 you can do it both for the 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.360
 paint eyebrows if you like that 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.190
 about my hair color is then 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.260
 that's really perfect, I just think 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.820
 you can dose it so well and 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.530
 in that the color is really very 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.450
 bright and not so much 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.910
 one must also get out of this pen 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.350
 just do not be so careful and you 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.880
 At the end I find really very much 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.380
 beautiful eyebrows and can stop 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.900
 really very precise and natural 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.340
 So, everything is recommended and 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.230
 the second product is the new one 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.600
 diaper bronzing powder i want that 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.310
 say everything from me as me 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.010
 think it's really good though 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.320
 I still like the alverde baked 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.820
 but rather browsing and the price 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.820
 from the similar so point deductions 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.980
 That's why I really ask 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.840
 just finds that a little bit 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.280
 too much of the product on the brush 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.320
 So it's already recorded 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.030
 almost a bit on foot direction 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.620
 too crumbly and that's what I wear 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.060
 sometimes a little too much of it 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.260
 So at least I have it too 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.120
 handmade as I am not quite so 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.340
 knew how to do that and 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.990
 his face is dead 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.940
 but if you do that after a few days 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.590
 the school climate has worked out 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.060
 actually I think it's really a nice 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.500
 product and then it is already too 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.540
 the last two products of it 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.740
 both hair products and the first one is 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.919
 unfortunately until we fell by the 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.200
 each one of alverde couple mask avocado 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.270
 and shea butter and that's me first 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.610
 did not like it comes only 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.600
 so hard out of this one so you 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.190
 I think so too if I do 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.440
 just like that which for consistency 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.150
 it's so insane in here that 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.710
 one would think that somehow I 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.930
 rather in a package or something 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.760
 have to pack because I press so opel 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.590
 may we get out of it at all 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.570
 and simply does not care effectively 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.940
 simply not so convincing me 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.530
 would give it a 4 and after the 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.030
 last product do not have very many 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.389
 of you in the comments under the 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.740
 last dm hall asked that includes the 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.570
 republic topics which I found positive 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.190
 he is obviously correct 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.010
 nice smell but what the effect 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.050
 at all but somehow I have 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.639
 So hoping for a bit more they 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.169
 has donated a bit of moisture 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.000
 a bit so the fresh fought but 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.880
 do not stop everything and there I find 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.680
 For example, the orange moisture because 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.539
 he better which my hair 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.090
 something does not fit and still exists 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.410
 I had not noticed that right now 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.510
 that's why I just did not work for mine 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.830
 the perfect product i could have too 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.169
 need and then not again 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.479
 buy and therefore really say 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.430
 that gets a three plus of about 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.320
 Ten products housing maybe has it 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.940
 you brought something and has them 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.350
 somehow write euro notes times 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.139
 if you want to test the products 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.639
 the herner must have the commissioner me 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:13.979
 link in the end now mine 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.389
 last two videos and then could 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:17.250
 to see again and again 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.600
 otherwise you can also like me 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.800
 just let me know if I'm with that 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.260
 these notes for the products 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.449
 should keep forgetting and then 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.779
 I want to say makes it and the closer 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:27.779
