00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.709 
what Penn State did last year college
football<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.310> mean<00:02:16.519> they<00:02:16.700> played<00:02:16.969> a<00:02:16.999> season<00:02:17.329> is

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719 
football I mean they played a season is

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.649 
football I mean they played a season is
it<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.439> a<00:02:18.499> unit<00:02:19.159> the<00:02:19.370> team<00:02:19.609> rallied<00:02:20.090> us<00:02:20.269> against

the<00:02:20.780> world<00:02:21.040> type<00:02:22.040> thing<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.549> maybe<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.420> will

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
the world type thing so maybe that will
