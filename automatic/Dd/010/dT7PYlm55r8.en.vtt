an<00:01:02.739> adventure<00:01:03.730> in<00:01:04.230> anti-gravity<00:01:05.230> a<00:01:07.230> different

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
an adventure in anti-gravity a different

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.570 
an adventure in anti-gravity a different
adventure<00:01:09.160> and<00:01:09.820> anti-gravity<00:01:11.040> because<00:01:12.040> we

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
adventure and anti-gravity because we

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.440 
adventure and anti-gravity because we
are<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.960> are<00:01:13.990> conquering<00:01:14.950> gravity<00:01:15.580> as<00:01:15.820> we<00:01:16.180> as

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
are we are conquering gravity as we as

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.430 
are we are conquering gravity as we as
we<00:01:16.510> make<00:01:16.900> music<00:01:17.320> music<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:17.890> movement<00:01:19.440> the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
we make music music is movement the

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.730 
we make music music is movement the
moment<00:01:21.430> music<00:01:21.880> stops<00:01:22.270> gravity<00:01:23.230> takes<00:01:23.530> over

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
moment music stops gravity takes over

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.470 
moment music stops gravity takes over
again<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.320> rate<00:01:26.590> at<00:01:26.860> which<00:01:26.890> we<00:01:27.340> move<00:01:27.640> the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
again so the rate at which we move the

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.620 
again so the rate at which we move the
energy<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:29.440> takes<00:01:29.470> to<00:01:29.890> move<00:01:30.340> whether<00:01:30.850> we

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
energy that it takes to move whether we

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.250 
energy that it takes to move whether we
move<00:01:31.900> like<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.590> mudslide<00:01:33.580> or<00:01:34.120> we<00:01:34.780> move<00:01:34.990> like

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
move like a mudslide or we move like

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.370 
move like a mudslide or we move like
like<00:01:35.880> Niagara<00:01:36.880> Falls<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:40.180> still<00:01:40.600> it's<00:01:41.020> still

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
like Niagara Falls it's still it's still

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.690 
like Niagara Falls it's still it's still
movement<00:01:41.950> so<00:01:42.790> I<00:01:42.820> think<00:01:43.420> there's<00:01:43.930> an<00:01:44.680> eye

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
movement so I think there's an eye

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.340 
movement so I think there's an eye
already<00:01:46.030> explain<00:01:46.329> this<00:01:46.479> I<00:01:46.630> think<00:01:46.930> there's<00:01:47.289> a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
already explain this I think there's a

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.130 
already explain this I think there's a
physical<00:01:47.710> analogy<00:01:48.549> to<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:48.909> microcosmic<00:01:49.659> and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
physical analogy to the microcosmic and

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.240 
physical analogy to the microcosmic and
the<00:01:50.530> macrocosmic<00:01:51.570> which<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.750> how<00:01:52.930> I<00:01:52.990> get<00:01:53.250> young

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
the macrocosmic which is how I get young

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.270 
the macrocosmic which is how I get young
people<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.759> sit<00:01:55.000> still<00:01:55.360> when<00:01:55.630> they<00:01:55.840> play

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
people to sit still when they play

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.130 
people to sit still when they play
because<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.520> think<00:01:57.579> a<00:01:57.820> lot<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.119> this<00:01:58.539> body

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
because I think a lot of this body

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.139 
because I think a lot of this body
English<00:01:59.560> that<00:02:00.009> goes<00:02:00.219> on<00:02:00.720> is

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
English that goes on is

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:11.850 
English that goes on is
counterproductive<00:02:07.289> because<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:11.080> all<00:02:11.680> the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
counterproductive because of all the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.490 
counterproductive because of all the
competition<00:02:12.670> out<00:02:12.880> there<00:02:13.239> I<00:02:13.269> think<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.780> young

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
competition out there I think that young

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.600 
competition out there I think that young
people<00:02:14.530> think<00:02:15.299> that<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:17.560> more<00:02:17.830> they<00:02:18.130> show

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
people think that the the more they show

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.520 
people think that the the more they show
how<00:02:18.970> much<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.569> music<00:02:19.840> affects<00:02:20.739> them<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:22.530> more

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
how much the music affects them the more

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.569 
how much the music affects them the more
likely<00:02:23.560> they'll<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.940> sell<00:02:25.239> tickets<00:02:26.579> over

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
likely they'll be to sell tickets over

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.289 
likely they'll be to sell tickets over
there<00:02:28.329> colleague<00:02:28.900> in<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.319> next<00:02:29.709> studio<00:02:30.610> who

doesn't move and yet that becomes a

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.020 
doesn't move and yet that becomes a
distraction<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.819> listener<00:02:38.489> it's<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.670> very

distraction to the listener it's a very

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.110 
distraction to the listener it's a very
delicate<00:02:40.420> line<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:42.040> performer<00:02:43.019> treads
