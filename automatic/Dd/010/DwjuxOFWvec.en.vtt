except<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> US<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.770> that's<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:32.009> thing<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.400> I

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
except the US so that's one thing that I

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.850 
except the US so that's one thing that I
think<00:01:32.549> should<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.270> changed<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.560> Fatal

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
think should be changed for the Fatal

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
think should be changed for the Fatal
Frame<00:01:34.979> Wii<00:01:35.250> U<00:01:35.400> game<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.759> should<00:01:35.909> come<00:01:36.060> out<00:01:36.150> for

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
Frame Wii U game it should come out for

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.230 
Frame Wii U game it should come out for
as<00:01:36.540> many<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.740> many<00:01:37.920> regions<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.670> possible

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and if they did that it would really

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.999 
and if they did that it would really
benefit<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> sales<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> Wii<00:01:42.990> U<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> not

doing<00:01:48.869> pretty<00:01:49.049> well<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.290> Japan<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.399> more

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
doing pretty well in Japan the more

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.550 
doing pretty well in Japan the more
places<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.119> they<00:01:51.630> release<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> fail<00:01:52.200> frame

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
places that they release a fail frame

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.310 
places that they release a fail frame
game<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.250> better<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:54.570> why<00:01:54.780> should<00:01:55.020> there<00:01:55.140> be<00:01:55.200> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
game the better so why should there be a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.030

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
take into account with the gamepad and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.899 
take into account with the gamepad and
how<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.680> game<00:02:01.920> has<00:02:01.979> been<00:02:02.369> used<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:02.700> games

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
how the game has been used for games

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.490 
how the game has been used for games
like<00:02:03.090> zombiu<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.960> lego<00:02:04.110> city<00:02:04.380> undercover

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
like zombiu and lego city undercover

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980 
like zombiu and lego city undercover
that<00:02:05.219> you're<00:02:05.399> holding<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.299> up<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.659> moving

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
that you're holding it up and moving

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.619 
that you're holding it up and moving
around<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.469> room<00:02:07.649> false<00:02:08.220> 360<00:02:08.910> degrees<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
around the room false 360 degrees and

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.969 
around the room false 360 degrees and
you<00:02:10.170> can

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
you can

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.390 
you can
and<00:02:11.099> other<00:02:11.430> objects<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.180> that's<00:02:13.400> it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
and other objects so that's it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.339 
and other objects so that's it
practically<00:02:15.150> develops<00:02:15.599> itself<00:02:15.989> when<00:02:16.260> you

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
practically develops itself when you

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.339 
practically develops itself when you
think<00:02:16.590> about<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.810> can<00:02:18.989> use<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
think about it it's that you can use the

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.570 
think about it it's that you can use the
game<00:02:19.530> now<00:02:19.739> you'd<00:02:19.890> be<00:02:20.010> able<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.220> use<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
game now you'd be able to use the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.680 
game now you'd be able to use the
gamepad<00:02:20.790> as<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.569> camera<00:02:21.870> obscura<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:24.239> think

deeper level of immersion thanks to the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.660 
deeper level of immersion thanks to the
gamepad<00:02:43.470> because<00:02:43.769> you're<00:02:43.860> holding<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.340> up<00:02:44.489> to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
gamepad because you're holding it up to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.330

the TV screen to take a picture of a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.280 
the TV screen to take a picture of a
ghost<00:02:47.549> but<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.450> ghost<00:02:48.660> can<00:02:48.810> change<00:02:49.079> its

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
ghost but the ghost can change its

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.289 
ghost but the ghost can change its
position<00:02:49.440> all<00:02:49.980> around<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.489> then<00:02:50.760> instead<00:02:51.180> of

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
position all around you then instead of

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.080 
position all around you then instead of
moving<00:02:51.900> an<00:02:52.200> analog<00:02:52.650> stick<00:02:52.829> just<00:02:53.160> moving<00:02:53.609> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
moving an analog stick just moving the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.300 
moving an analog stick just moving the
gamepad<00:02:54.599> around<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.680> right<00:02:55.859> if<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.129> hear

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
gamepad around to the right if you hear

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.369 
gamepad around to the right if you hear
the<00:02:56.459> ghost<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.000> right<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.569> can<00:02:57.780> again

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
the ghost to the right so you can again

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.500 
the ghost to the right so you can again
keep<00:02:58.620> battling<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.160> ghost<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.670> also

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
keep battling that ghost and also

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.410 
keep battling that ghost and also
similar<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.349> a<00:03:01.530> zombie<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:02.060> can<00:03:03.060> use<00:03:03.269> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
similar to a zombie you can use the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.470 
similar to a zombie you can use the
gamepad<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:04.260> maybe<00:03:04.920> scan<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> room<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.150> search

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
gamepad to maybe scan a room and search

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.680 
gamepad to maybe scan a room and search
for<00:03:06.660> important<00:03:07.170> items<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.680> might<00:03:07.829> need

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
for important items that you might need

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.240 
for important items that you might need
so<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.730> say<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.150> because<00:03:13.250> survival

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
so and I say this because survival

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.839 
so and I say this because survival
horror<00:03:14.700> games<00:03:15.260> survival<00:03:16.260> horror<00:03:16.440> games<00:03:16.849> they

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
horror games survival horror games they

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.550 
horror games survival horror games they
do<00:03:17.910> have<00:03:18.269> these<00:03:18.419> do<00:03:18.660> still<00:03:18.930> have<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.109> fan<00:03:19.380> base

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
do have these do still have a fan base

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.890 
do have these do still have a fan base
despite<00:03:20.099> what<00:03:20.370> some<00:03:20.579> people<00:03:20.639> have<00:03:21.030> said<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.569> I

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
despite what some people have said and I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.250 
despite what some people have said and I
think<00:03:22.319> that<00:03:22.739> if<00:03:23.069> Nintendo<00:03:23.940> encouraged<00:03:24.840> Tecmo

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
think that if Nintendo encouraged Tecmo

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.710 
think that if Nintendo encouraged Tecmo
Koei<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:26.010> take<00:03:26.430> advantage<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:27.060> what<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.329> Wii<00:03:27.540> U

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
Koei to take advantage of what the Wii U

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.890 
Koei to take advantage of what the Wii U
can<00:03:27.930> do<00:03:28.169> and<00:03:28.590> put<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.310> fail<00:03:29.609> frame<00:03:30.000> game<00:03:30.329> on<00:03:30.599> the

can do and put a fail frame game on the

can do and put a fail frame game on the
Wii<00:03:31.049> U<00:03:31.079> then<00:03:31.889> they<00:03:32.280> can<00:03:32.459> show<00:03:32.639> that<00:03:32.819> yes<00:03:33.000> fatal

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
Wii U then they can show that yes fatal

Wii U then they can show that yes fatal
frame<00:03:33.919> well<00:03:34.919> the<00:03:35.669> survival<00:03:36.150> horror<00:03:36.359> genre<00:03:36.450> and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
fatal frames still have a large fan base

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.670 
fatal frames still have a large fan base
and<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:41.660> survival<00:03:42.660> horror<00:03:42.900> has<00:03:43.169> not<00:03:43.380> died
