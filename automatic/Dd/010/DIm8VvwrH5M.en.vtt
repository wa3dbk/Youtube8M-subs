00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.920
 a video response to a 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.549
 the channel mm 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.690

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:31.679

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.309
 before downloading or where it is there is good 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.940
 disable the antivirus primarily with 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.840
 avast I find it very annoying and it ends 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.950
 taking the ace as false-positives 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.570

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.110
 of the tires a little bit to do - ink 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.540
 the one he repeats 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.540
