00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello my gamers greet you jayson's 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.880
 new today I come to do the gameplay 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.610
 of the game resistance burning skies for 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.929
 feet vita this is the main menu 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.389
 then we have the modality of a 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.640
 player and multiplayer and this is for the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.730
 official contract to play online 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.369
 then we will accept and then 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.340
 let's play the multiplayer then 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.769
 the game needs online code step 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.650
 online then we go to the modality at 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.960
 less here we look for the game to play 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.620
 online of all modes can be 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.750
 team duel duel all against 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.840
 all his survival that is killing 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.340
 the soldiers and the first ones yes leaving 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.050
 the soldiers and for that they show 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.400
 soldiers become first and so 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.570
 successively until killing the last 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.030
 Soldier is already our equipment 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.700
 we have three modalities this game 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.490
 mind is commented as the maps are 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.740
 very big are cool 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.760
 sing the way of all the weapons that 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.950
 we have then at the level 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.900
 depending on the level come it's going to be more 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.900
 easy so then it's 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.750
 the counter of this rifle type and they are 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.020
 many times with the submachine gun also 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.500
 it's macana and this is the sugar side 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.440
 hitch see then let's say the improvements 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.890
 if you do not want to be able to make 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.660
 our weapon say let's damage the projectile 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.760
 all together shoots both projectiles at 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.070
 the time that they shoot shoot the 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.190
 two castles connect it 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.320
 and we also have the pomegranate fruits 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.100
 the nothing of needles on the one of 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.130
 fragmentation and then we have to go 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.370
 to spill our equipment equipment 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.950
 so then to my favorite and 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.990
 statistics let's say the total score the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.200
 deaths that we have made the deaths the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.020
 proportion assists precision be 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.229
 has everything well counted the table the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.460
 leaders of the best goal number one 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.580
 has that score and so on 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.880
 descending 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.590
 68 times enough audio options 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.290
 controls credits 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.130
 then until like the the player 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.890
 let say 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.440
 is for a new game options 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.660
 also the cultural audios the tco 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.210
 head 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.380
 I've been playing online for a while now 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:45.200
 then already enabled my weapons in 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.840
 all levels to place all the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.520
 new that is the first that effective is 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.770
 of 8 players 4 against 4 to play it 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.710
 online 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.980
 by dell or by teams to canada for 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:03.640
 choose let's say the floors that we want and 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.550
 ready and to our map 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.670
 its very cool game let's see what they 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.270
 seems to think that they become the root of 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.510
 low if they like it if they wanted it 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.080
 so also did her story 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.920
 to play 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.830
 later on I will be more specific and 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.050
 every game is because in the had 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.600
 so long to select what 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.860
 we want to use and here to load the 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.970
 crossbow 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.970
 sakari orava 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.970
 where are those that you will see 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.800
 I was 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.280
 the time 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.940
 but regenerate 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.360
 but the crossbow 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:55.100
 and we run with low arrow 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.100
 the little let's go, we run 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:03.220
 let's say the map how 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.170
 let's see depending on how many 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.210
 let's say deaths with him by teams that 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.080
 we're 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.080
 so 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.050
 the first two are our enemies 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.100
 before the soldiers seems the only duty 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.100
 of all 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.500
 graphics are very good but here it 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.660
 we use the touch part of the rear 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.930
 I ground the touch screen for let's say 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.440
 knife throw the grenade and load 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.440
 our 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.960
 then they drag her into them 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.960
 now after killing her 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.559
 but no 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.430
 do not count 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.360
 and if we kill him 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.360
 reason 100 points 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.910
 in the experience then he is arrested 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.639
 It has a good graphic and 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.979
 and 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.979
 you can see that it is throwing back 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.260
 there they are sent to the great 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.050
 external armed 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.900
 in my friend solder 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.979
 there are 6 for the younger how much are we going 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.650
 low we press select appears 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:40.510
 then we are 3 against 2 and says the 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:44.040
 proportion and all be specific 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.040
 are our friends 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.970
 let's go with x 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.110
 we feel it close 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.500
 well characterize the other 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.200
 three types of weapons 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.270
 we send the show to be the zoom 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.289
 it will be late 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:40.180
 as it appears in gaza were to notice the 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.180
 others on the fence 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.680
 of g 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.550
 navigating by bike you will see 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.210
 very well 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:52.400
 this kind of losing for three deaths 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.039
 and so is the game to say you liked it 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.780
