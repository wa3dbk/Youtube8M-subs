here's<00:00:10.010> how<00:00:10.130> to<00:00:10.190> thread<00:00:10.460> a<00:00:10.670> basic<00:00:11.090> class<00:00:11.389> 15

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:11.930 
here's how to thread a basic class 15

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:12.660 
here's how to thread a basic class 15
machine

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
machine

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.070 
machine
so<00:00:13.840> take<00:00:14.840> thread<00:00:15.290> from<00:00:15.830> up<00:00:16.040> here<00:00:16.779> and<00:00:17.779> you<00:00:17.900> just

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
so take thread from up here and you just

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.690 
so take thread from up here and you just
kind<00:00:18.290> of<00:00:18.320> set<00:00:18.619> it<00:00:18.650> into<00:00:19.040> that<00:00:19.189> loop<00:00:19.400> right

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
kind of set it into that loop right

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.460 
kind of set it into that loop right
there<00:00:19.910> look<00:00:20.840> for<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:21.050> requirements

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
there look for the requirements

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.320 
there look for the requirements
threading<00:00:21.800> you<00:00:21.890> just<00:00:22.099> set<00:00:22.340> it<00:00:22.369> in

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.050 

you<00:00:26.330> bring<00:00:26.599> it<00:00:26.720> down<00:00:27.070> around<00:00:28.070> these<00:00:28.669> two

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
you bring it down around these two

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.470 
you bring it down around these two
little<00:00:29.419> plates<00:00:29.810> that<00:00:30.710> are<00:00:30.769> behind<00:00:31.480> the

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
little plates that are behind the

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.729 
little plates that are behind the
tension<00:00:33.379> wheel<00:00:33.559> you<00:00:34.550> bring<00:00:34.820> it<00:00:34.910> up<00:00:35.410> below<00:00:36.410> this

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
tension wheel you bring it up below this

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.490 
tension wheel you bring it up below this
little<00:00:36.980> thread<00:00:37.190> guide<00:00:37.840> and<00:00:38.840> you<00:00:38.989> can<00:00:39.199> pull

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
little thread guide and you can pull

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.480 
little thread guide and you can pull
like<00:00:40.220> that<00:00:40.329> so<00:00:41.329> that's<00:00:41.480> set<00:00:41.839> in

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.170 

now<00:00:45.360> down<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.680> between<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.000> little

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
now down in between this is a little

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.060 
now down in between this is a little
water<00:00:48.360> thing<00:00:48.630> here<00:00:48.810> in<00:00:49.200> between<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.860> wire<00:00:50.040> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
water thing here in between the wire and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.690 
water thing here in between the wire and
this<00:00:50.760> metal<00:00:50.940> plate<00:00:52.010> this<00:00:53.010> front<00:00:53.310> faceplate

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
this metal plate this front faceplate

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.150 
this metal plate this front faceplate
wherever<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.390> call<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.770> you<00:00:55.770> want<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> just

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
wherever you call it you want to just

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.200 
wherever you call it you want to just
slide<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> thread<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.420> there<00:00:58.820> there<00:00:59.820> just

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
slide the thread in there there just

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.150 
slide the thread in there there just
kind<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.450> threads<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.680> happens<00:01:02.040> without

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
kind of threads in it happens without

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.140 
kind of threads in it happens without
you<00:01:02.430> really<00:01:02.640> seeing<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.180> happens

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.930 

now<00:01:07.150> it's<00:01:07.390> holding<00:01:07.780> on<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.430> now<00:01:09.430> up<00:01:09.700> to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
now it's holding on to that now up to

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.240 
now it's holding on to that now up to
this<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.119> gooseneck<00:01:10.590> which<00:01:11.590> some<00:01:11.890> machines

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
this a gooseneck which some machines

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.950 
this a gooseneck which some machines
will<00:01:12.490> just<00:01:12.670> let<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:12.850> slide<00:01:13.270> it<00:01:13.450> in<00:01:13.570> but<00:01:13.750> others

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
will just let you slide it in but others

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.649 
will just let you slide it in but others
you<00:01:14.110> actually<00:01:14.500> have<00:01:14.650> to<00:01:14.830> thread<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.220> in<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.600> you

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
you actually have to thread it in so you

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.680 
you actually have to thread it in so you
get<00:01:16.869> it<00:01:16.960> through<00:01:17.170> there<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.610> now<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:18.850> have<00:01:19.150> its

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
get it through there so now you have its

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.130 
get it through there so now you have its
going<00:01:20.020> from<00:01:20.680> here<00:01:21.070> through<00:01:21.880> here<00:01:22.270> through

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
going from here through here through

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.600 
going from here through here through
here<00:01:23.500> through<00:01:24.190> here

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.499 

hey<00:01:27.610> bring<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:27.939> straight<00:01:28.119> down<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.600> faceplate

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
hey bring it straight down the faceplate

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.940 
hey bring it straight down the faceplate
take<00:01:31.509> it<00:01:31.630> into<00:01:31.810> this<00:01:31.930> little<00:01:31.990> loop<00:01:32.409> right

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
take it into this little loop right

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.320 
take it into this little loop right
there

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.000 

set<00:01:37.330> around<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.780> wire

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
set around that wire

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.840 
set around that wire
and<00:01:40.610> you're<00:01:40.880> ready<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.180> thread<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:42.140> needle

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
and you're ready to thread the needle

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.730 
and you're ready to thread the needle
which<00:01:43.850> of<00:01:44.000> course<00:01:44.170> like<00:01:45.170> with<00:01:45.320> most<00:01:45.560> machines

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
which of course like with most machines

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.850 
which of course like with most machines
goes<00:01:47.770> towards<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.900> rest<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:51.320> machine

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.480 

there<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:54.950> have<00:01:55.130> it

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
there you have it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.090 
there you have it
top<00:01:56.000> thread

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
top thread

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
in threads poking out so you bring the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.190 
in threads poking out so you bring the
thread<00:02:12.920> back<00:02:13.270> there's<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.390> little<00:02:14.660> slip<00:02:14.990> right

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
thread back there's a little slip right

there pull through that and then you're
wrapped<00:02:19.490> around<00:02:19.640> like<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.150> just<00:02:20.660> slide<00:02:20.900> it

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
wrapped around like this just slide it

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.780 
wrapped around like this just slide it
over<00:02:21.140> until<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.920> goes<00:02:22.070> through<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.490> plate

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
over until it goes through that plate

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.910 
over until it goes through that plate
and<00:02:23.030> you're<00:02:23.900> ready<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.140> go<00:02:25.690> flip<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:26.930> up<00:02:27.140> make

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
and you're ready to go flip that up make

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.510 
and you're ready to go flip that up make
sure<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.490> pointing<00:02:28.880> up<00:02:30.160> slide<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.190> onto

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
sure this is pointing up slide it onto

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.760 
sure this is pointing up slide it onto
the<00:02:31.670> peg<00:02:31.940> until<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.510> clicks<00:02:33.970> now<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:36.380> get<00:02:36.560> the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
the peg until it clicks now to get the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.110 
the peg until it clicks now to get the
bottom<00:02:37.190> thread<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.580> come<00:02:37.760> up

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
bottom thread to come up

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.729 
bottom thread to come up
hold<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:38.600> loosely<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:39.709> not<00:02:39.860> too<00:02:40.100> strongly

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
hold this loosely but not too strongly

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.540 
hold this loosely but not too strongly
go<00:02:42.739> down<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:44.450> then<00:02:45.020> right<00:02:45.200> there<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.370> gets
