00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.570
 and such less as they are up to 100 soles 

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:08.010
 inside gameplay of plants against 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.300
 zombies for the xbox 360 version 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.030
 right now we have what are 14 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.260
 completed flags in this gameplay 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.850
 let's get what are the 15 and 16 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.760
 so you must be very careful 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.350
 because in this wave we are going to leave 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.390
 many enemies of the giants so 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.930
 in this gameplay I will try to make 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.660
 plus 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.530
 although it is another greater another throws more 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.880
 close to for our good and not 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.460
 We are inside these enemies 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.290
 little ones that also then there are 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.800
 they launch and we are in danger of being 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.800
 eat our 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.690
 our crops good extra harvests 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.019
 plants and then in this gameplay I started 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.739
 with what is a dance cobs one 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.670
 plant that of 100 soles that throw what 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.820
 which are the balloons or flying enemies 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.229
 the normal pumpkin the clone that throws 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:16.650
 smoke the cherry the chili of 25 that is 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:23.990
 a mini pump and the mink pump 59 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.990
 good and throw you then if there are several 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.920
 You must be very careful with 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.790
 taught that trout so that we do not 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.190
 are going to kill because there are times that we 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.670
 we trust and we think that our 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.860
 pumpkins are at 100 but it is not like that 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.250
 Sometimes the zombies are eating little 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.870
 little bit and we do not realize so 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.360
 some plant that you see is already average 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.920
 damaged average so what I can 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.870
 recommend is to implant again 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.750
 what is a pumpkin when there are many 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.119
 enemies I do not recommend you to use 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.580
 the clone because as you see right now 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.090
 it started spinning a little bit and it takes a little 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.369
 in 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.399
 in general what is the pumpkin since 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.329
 we use what is the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.610
 Wind plant to be carried 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.459
 his knuckles balloons and then while 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.379
 also throw what are the ears 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.530
 for us to go kill those who 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.530
 they carry the tractors and the other zombies 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.170
 and then we're going to launch what will be the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.530
 wind should look very well of what 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.599
 of the zombies that carry the balloon do not 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.819
 trollear and go to go to go to 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.270
 go ahead because then we realize or 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.340
 we are distracted and then we have to put 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.930
 a lot of attention so that we do not leave 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.930
 pass one and lose 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.700
 just use the jockers 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.110
 and then nothing we already have the flag 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.180
 and right now I 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.870
 and next strategy 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.659
 it would be minimum minimum to plant a 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.210
 a spear closer because in the zombies 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.470
 big 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.470
 if we need them 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.989
 so it's up to you as suns 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:35.030
 also remember not to let the 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:37.600
 of the balloons and well then more than anything 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.600
 we almost reached what the flag is 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.600
 16 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.760
 those plants that protect the is 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.250
 around I really like the truth 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.150
 They are very very good and right now almost 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.189
 we put together what are the 600 soles for 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.810
 complete what would be a 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:03.200
 distance were given consideration 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.590
 to try to buy another spear more 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.590
 behind 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.629
 for example you have to bucket the balloon there 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.370
 times that once they are playing a 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.630
 gameplay that mail happened to me runs without 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.700
 little girls 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:24.970
 so we almost got what is the 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.970
 16 flag only lack of this zombie 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.150
 they see chewing gum and eating 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.100
 what is the plant but it does not matter 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.830
 why use what is a spear 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.460
 corncobs I think you like gameplay 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.630
 remember assassin soul and well let's go 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.790
 see how it goes in the next 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.790
 gameplay greetings take care a lot bye
