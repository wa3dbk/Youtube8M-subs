00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:08.099
 Well, let's continue now, there are various motion control elements . 

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:12.120
 Dechotto I would like to variously try to think 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.010
 Yes let's keep dragging and dropping in the future 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:21.160
 Yes it is a little or huge 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:22.000
 It's kind of feeling that this row is too badly damaged and you are like this in such a form 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.350
 Transform 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.620
 I did one reciprocation a while ago I want to explain a bit against the scale this time 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:35.520
 As time goes on and on 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:38.420
 Just It is this area around here 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.519
 I came out to have 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:47.380
 Turn on the Yes scale First of all here, because say 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:52.140
 And in the state that I pulled 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:58.710
 It looks like this, where the scale is dropped to 0 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.540
 Yes then if this is 0 then the time axis will move and it will come out 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.290
 It becomes a form 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.619
 Now I kinda want to preview drink hey here but is one tips 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.540
 Ne 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.770
 It is the range of the preview 9 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.280
 It can be defined by deciding by the arrangement of the work area 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.000
 It is convenient because it is also a study short putt to hear the command with this command key 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.710
 The 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.710
 Yes, just select 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.740
 Yes 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.880
 It feels like this 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.659
 So here is one problem 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.710
 This is the way but it's actually here 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.490
 The anchor point in the middle is the main thing 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:45.810
 It will be the axis of something that appears or rotates 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:51.140
 Here is this anchor point, but let's move this value a little bit x 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:54.340
 And y move in the x direction like this 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.340
 And this time yes 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:05.180
 If you do so, what kind of movement is it? 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:07.189
 In this way, from here on the bottom right to the center, ie from the anchor point to the center 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.300
 It will be expanded 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:15.070
 I wonder if the place is a bit like this 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.070
 Let's preview 3 with this 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:34.940
 It is surprisingly important element of say this anchor point it is in the form, such as that 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:38.540
 Let's go through a little more about this 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.860
 Now this Kedomo women I'm doing E' 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:47.840
 Yes previous store kun little or ride to it is to say here 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:52.180
 I think it will be huge again, it's a high victory here 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:57.310
 It is have mast here now, for example, 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:01.209
 I would like to do an action to rotate it when I went to 8 kyu 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:07.359
 Select the rotation you have to have a 9 is the rotation 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:11.739
 And if you bring it here, put a zero here 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.170
 0.0 Yes it is taking to say that this zero is not indicate what body 10 clause 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.230
 0 points 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.560
 Reid has been in April again and again 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.940
 If you hit 360, it will be one turn 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.520
 It is a frequency. You need to select one within 10 times. 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:32.400
 Then let's beat the city here 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:35.780
 If you do so at first, it will be from 0 to 1 and it will be husband's reverse rotation 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:41.180
 Clockwise is an integer and 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:45.020
 Pan clockwise will be negative It is when such sounds negative here 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.130
 When you move to the next key frame, it automatically enters the next key frame 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:55.800
 In this or not I if the look I wonder this or I am Yone down koa 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:04:00.210
 Says Te Yo' and with you so Let's get driving and minus 1 and criticism 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:07.460
 It went high with a feeling of saying 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:07.460
 And now it rotates eye on at the now the other one will fall and the negative 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:15.560
 This means that once store and first in one rotation is not anymore one rotation 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.220
 And once again 10 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:25.389
 It does not matter if you turn it already, so let's make it negative ion 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.389
 Come on, I would like to see for a moment what would happen 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:51.069
 It's moving like this 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.759
 It's moving here because this anchor point is in the middle now 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.780
 Right 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:05:00.160
 I would like to move it again above this anchor point 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:06.260
 I did it in the place of the point, but this time the amper point tool in the right upper left 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:09.440
 You can use drag and drop when you can use 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.300
 Shall I just go around this jaw if there is 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.270
 Then say what happens 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.270
 Yes this time you will be turning so big 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.300
 Now the high point changes according to this place 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:31.240
 Just remember there, for example 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:35.500
 Of course if it was the end then this is the central axis 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.100
 Another one Yes here not is Kedomo has been incredible buzz buzzing move 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.150
 Little to 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:45.290
 What I would like to explain is what is called motion blur 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:50.000
 So and say, motion blur switcher chip I have been a sitting height, but this motion blur 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:54.800
 Cold of layer I want to apply after main switch 1 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.090
 By pressing these two, it will take with motion blur and now it will be out 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.240
 I'm new, but this is a fast move 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:04.660
 Thing to show the afterimage against Layer 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:09.310
 It is an afterimage effect, so if you are moving fast 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:10.630
 The big point is that it can be shown in smooth movement without ticking 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.569
 It has become 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:20.699
 If you look at the lamp review for a moment, it looks like this 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:24.899
 This is why there are two buttons and turn off the main switch to make multiple layers later 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:30.110
 If you if you want to arrange says I Do not need only in this layer This layer Japanese-style room 

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:34.249
 It 's a big point to use sub switches 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.249
 It is a feeling of é€¡ 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:44.509
 Well these anchor points and motion blur 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:46.869
 It seems like I want to firmly hold down the basics in this area. 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.869
 I will
