that I saw in Woolies the other day

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:42.099 
that I saw in Woolies the other day
which<00:00:40.100> is<00:00:40.219> all<00:00:40.339> about<00:00:40.550> 5<00:00:40.940> eyelash<00:00:41.300> extensions

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
which is all about 5 eyelash extensions

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.540 
which is all about 5 eyelash extensions
in<00:00:42.980> a<00:00:43.039> mascara<00:00:43.519> brush<00:00:43.909> etc<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:44.859> so<00:00:45.859> I<00:00:45.890> am<00:00:46.309> using

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
in a mascara brush etc so so I am using

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.369 
in a mascara brush etc so so I am using
this<00:00:46.760> at<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.030> moment<00:00:47.149> I<00:00:47.420> do<00:00:47.480> like<00:00:47.839> it<00:00:48.170> and

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
this at the moment I do like it and

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.259 
this at the moment I do like it and
that's<00:00:48.530> why<00:00:48.800> this<00:00:48.859> is<00:00:49.219> quite<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.489> close-up

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
that's why this is quite a close-up

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.360 
that's why this is quite a close-up
video<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:51.499> I<00:00:51.530> can<00:00:51.769> show<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.039> how<00:00:52.249> it

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
video so that I can show you how it

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.809 
video so that I can show you how it
works<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.120> basically<00:00:53.539> there<00:00:53.870> are<00:00:53.899> two<00:00:54.819> there's

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:55.819 
works so basically there are two there's

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:58.569 
works so basically there are two there's
two<00:00:55.879> brushes<00:00:56.539> one<00:00:57.199> is<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.620> mascara<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.399> one

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
two brushes one is the mascara and one

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.250 
two brushes one is the mascara and one
is<00:00:58.819> the<00:00:59.030> fiber<00:00:59.329> lash<00:01:00.280> extension<00:01:01.989> product<00:01:02.989> and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
is the fiber lash extension product and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.670 
is the fiber lash extension product and
so<00:01:03.829> what<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:04.129> do<00:01:04.309> is<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:05.330> open<00:01:05.720> both<00:01:06.650> of

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
so what you do is that you open both of

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.010 
so what you do is that you open both of
them<00:01:06.890> up<00:01:07.190> you<00:01:08.180> don't<00:01:08.299> need<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.570> work<00:01:08.719> too

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
them up you don't need to work too

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.139 
them up you don't need to work too
quickly<00:01:09.350> but<00:01:09.740> it<00:01:09.979> helps<00:01:10.579> to<00:01:10.700> sort<00:01:10.850> of<00:01:10.939> work<00:01:11.119> a

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
quickly but it helps to sort of work a

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.020 
quickly but it helps to sort of work a
bit<00:01:11.360> quickly<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:13.100> what<00:01:13.310> they<00:01:13.460> say<00:01:13.759> is<00:01:14.000> that

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
bit quickly and what they say is that

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.569 
bit quickly and what they say is that
when<00:01:14.540> you<00:01:14.689> put<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.140> mascara<00:01:15.409> on<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.310> fiber

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
when you put the mascara on the fiber

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.639 
when you put the mascara on the fiber
needs<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:17.060> go<00:01:17.180> on<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:18.020> know<00:01:18.049> before<00:01:18.500> that

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
needs to go on you know before that

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.350 
needs to go on you know before that
dries<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.490> we're<00:01:19.610> just<00:01:19.759> going<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:19.939> do<00:01:20.090> it<00:01:20.119> now

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
dries so we're just going to do it now

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.999 
dries so we're just going to do it now
and<00:01:20.390> you<00:01:20.780> can<00:01:20.930> sort<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.289> tie<00:01:21.500> me<00:01:21.560> if<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:21.860> like

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
and you can sort of tie me if you like

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.359 
and you can sort of tie me if you like
but<00:01:22.610> it's<00:01:23.060> pretty<00:01:23.329> quick<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:24.740> just<00:01:24.950> put<00:01:25.189> on

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
but it's pretty quick so you just put on

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:34.179 
but it's pretty quick so you just put on
the<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.920> mascara<00:01:28.430> first<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:29.210> all<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.070> you

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
the the mascara first of all so that you

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.179 
the the mascara first of all so that you
can<00:01:34.369> see<00:01:34.640> that<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.780> then<00:01:36.680> you've<00:01:36.829> got<00:01:37.039> this

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
can see that and then you've got this

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:43.090 
can see that and then you've got this
little<00:01:39.130> brush<00:01:40.130> here<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:41.259> that<00:01:42.259> brushes<00:01:42.799> on

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
little brush here and that brushes on

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.580 
little brush here and that brushes on
the<00:01:43.430> fibers<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.450> as<00:01:44.570> soon<00:01:44.750> as<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:45.049> do<00:01:45.409> it<00:01:45.560> you

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
the fibers and as soon as you do it you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.490 
the fibers and as soon as you do it you
can<00:01:45.829> actually<00:01:46.219> see<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:47.600> it's<00:01:47.869> building<00:01:48.140> up

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
can actually see that it's building up

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.709 
can actually see that it's building up
the<00:01:48.859> volume<00:01:49.579> and<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.939> length<00:01:50.179> of<00:01:50.420> your<00:01:50.539> lashes

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
the volume and the length of your lashes

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.679 
the volume and the length of your lashes
it<00:01:51.350> does<00:01:51.590> clump<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.280> little<00:01:52.520> bit<00:01:52.670> but<00:01:53.210> then<00:01:53.390> once

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
it does clump a little bit but then once

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.899 
it does clump a little bit but then once
you<00:01:53.810> actually<00:01:53.929> go<00:01:54.380> over<00:01:54.799> with<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.460> mascara

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
you actually go over with the mascara

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.279 
you actually go over with the mascara
brush<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.509> kind<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.869> brushes<00:01:57.259> that<00:01:57.409> out<00:01:59.109> if<00:02:00.109> you

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
brush it kind of brushes that out if you

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.050 
brush it kind of brushes that out if you
go<00:02:00.439> on<00:02:00.560> their<00:02:00.710> website<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:01.399> kind<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:01.700> think<00:02:01.850> that

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
go on their website I kind of think that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.450 
go on their website I kind of think that
they've<00:02:02.240> got<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.689> I'll<00:02:02.749> have<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.990> link<00:02:03.020> below

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
they've got and I'll have the link below

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.550 
they've got and I'll have the link below
they've<00:02:04.460> got<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.939> girl<00:02:05.179> that's<00:02:05.509> wearing<00:02:05.929> it<00:02:06.289> but

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
they've got a girl that's wearing it but

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.609 
they've got a girl that's wearing it but
it's<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.920> bit<00:02:07.070> scary<00:02:07.219> the<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.869> length<00:02:09.140> lash

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
it's a bit scary the the length lash

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.830 
it's a bit scary the the length lash
that<00:02:09.649> they've<00:02:10.100> given<00:02:10.399> her<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.690> can

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
that they've given her and you can

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.630 
that they've given her and you can
obviously<00:02:12.110> see<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.379> it's<00:02:12.650> very<00:02:12.709> very<00:02:13.069> fake<00:02:13.370> I

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
obviously see that it's very very fake I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.160 
obviously see that it's very very fake I
probably<00:02:14.150> do<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.450> about<00:02:14.629> twice

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
probably do it about twice

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.820 
probably do it about twice
and<00:02:16.260> then<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:18.120> that's<00:02:18.569> enough<00:02:18.959> for<00:02:19.170> me<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.680> I

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and then and that's enough for me and I

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.260 
and then and that's enough for me and I
kind<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.310> think<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.790> gives<00:02:21.000> me<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
kind of think that that gives me the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.690 
kind of think that that gives me the
volume<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.739> length<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.190> I'm<00:02:23.310> looking

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
volume and the length that I'm looking

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.100 
volume and the length that I'm looking
for<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.120> are<00:02:24.330> looking<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.840> go<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.959> little

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
for if you are looking to go a little

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.449 
for if you are looking to go a little
bit<00:02:25.290> longer<00:02:25.410> than<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.770> can<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.190> know<00:02:26.310> build

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
bit longer than you can you know build

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.640 
bit longer than you can you know build
it<00:02:26.640> up<00:02:26.700> as<00:02:26.880> much<00:02:27.000> as<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.300> want<00:02:27.480> really<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:29.520> so

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
it up as much as you want really and so

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.880 
it up as much as you want really and so
and<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:32.040> see<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:34.110> profile<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.800> that

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
and you can see the the profile of that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.540 
and you can see the the profile of that
lash<00:02:35.280> now<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.420> think<00:02:36.540> it's<00:02:36.810> quite<00:02:37.050> good<00:02:37.550> but

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
lash now so I think it's quite good but

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.130 
lash now so I think it's quite good but
but<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.239> just<00:02:39.420> gives<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> really<00:02:39.989> quick

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
but that just gives you a really quick

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.309 
but that just gives you a really quick
idea<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.680> how<00:02:41.190> fast<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.209> don't<00:02:43.200> really

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
idea of how fast it is I don't really

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.650 
idea of how fast it is I don't really
have<00:02:43.560> any<00:02:43.709> issues<00:02:43.830> if<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.340> do<00:02:44.400> put<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.150> on<00:02:45.330> too

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
have any issues if I do put it on too

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.449 
have any issues if I do put it on too
thick<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:46.080> does<00:02:46.290> irritate<00:02:46.590> my<00:02:47.040> eye<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.220> little

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
thick it does irritate my eye a little

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.170 
thick it does irritate my eye a little
bit<00:02:47.810> but<00:02:48.810> that's<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.290> me<00:02:49.850> making<00:02:50.850> sure<00:02:51.000> that

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
bit but that's just me making sure that

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.350 
bit but that's just me making sure that
I<00:02:51.209> manage<00:02:51.660> how<00:02:52.100> how<00:02:53.100> much<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.400> put<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:53.700> guess<00:02:54.239> the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
I manage how how much I put on guess the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.940 
I manage how how much I put on guess the
other<00:02:54.510> thing<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.750> really<00:02:54.780> liked<00:02:55.170> about<00:02:55.319> this<00:02:55.650> is

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
other thing I really liked about this is

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.390 
other thing I really liked about this is
that<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.489> has<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:57.650> life<00:02:58.650> span<00:02:58.799> of<00:02:59.069> three<00:02:59.370> years

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
that it has a life span of three years

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.580 
that it has a life span of three years
so<00:03:00.299> it's<00:03:00.450> not<00:03:00.569> like<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.930> goes<00:03:01.080> off<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.350> six

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
so it's not like it goes off in six

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.590 
so it's not like it goes off in six
months<00:03:01.860> like<00:03:01.950> at<00:03:02.100> other<00:03:02.190> mascaras<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.480> a

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
months like at other mascaras and it's a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.440 
months like at other mascaras and it's a
bee<00:03:03.780> wax<00:03:04.080> fiber<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.799> it's<00:03:04.950> natural<00:03:05.430> as<00:03:05.580> well<00:03:05.760> so

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
bee wax fiber so it's natural as well so

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.110 
bee wax fiber so it's natural as well so
I<00:03:06.480> guess<00:03:06.930> out<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.200> 10<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.920> would<00:03:08.040> give<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.580> an<00:03:08.850> H

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
I guess out of 10 I would give this an H

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.830 
I guess out of 10 I would give this an H
I<00:03:09.590> really<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:11.370> thickness<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
I really like the thickness of the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.900 
I really like the thickness of the

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
fact that it's got longevity of three

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.750
