00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:10.410
 and today we are going with a question to get very 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.680
 juicy because I sincerely 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.289
 even more the first question the 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.930

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.680
 six months I could not define myself between a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.840
 and another because Madrid lives very 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.470
 quiet very well but new york is your 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.359
 major and netflix but neither fits 28 you 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.220
 family supported you when you told them 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.199
 that you were going to dedicate to making videos 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.790
 I did not know that I was going to dedicate myself to 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.699
 make videos now I dedicate myself to it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.050
 I started foolishly for wow come I 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.820
 I'm also going to do it and they support me 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.530
 totally initially 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.210
 if you were not the one you would be 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.250
 comedy would not have set up a company 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.800

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.780

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.830
 different from the ones you 've already seen in 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.960

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.780
 university in primary education is that 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.880
 he does it in English so a teacher has 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.650
 finished like this is never good to doubt is 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.260
 end in life nancy girls in 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.530
 How happy are you, counting that 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.370
 there are no serious diseases and that I do not 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.090
 I can complain 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.100
 I think I 'm happy at 85% 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.320
 ever felt that he was famous not 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.270
 I'm famous you had to always be 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.880
 perfect very much in front of the canons of 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.380
 beauty to perfection is not something that 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.380
 As you can see, it gives me exactly the same 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.850
 and this is the part of fashion that most 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.970
 I hate and beauty plans should not 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.369
 exist from here spit mental 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.080
 we mentally spit out the canons of 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.210
 beauty seems to me one and a half of 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.800
 alicia ruiz 11 what do you do if 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.690
 someday you wake up sad with zero 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.610
 I do not want to do things 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.990
 because I like too much what I do and 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.940
 I do not know if it's good or bad because yesterday 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.950
 for example today I am arriving on a Monday 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.420
 for this Sunday night at one 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.100
 in the morning I was doing crisis 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.110
 about things that I'm going to do so 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.789
 Imagine zero if I did not get up without 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.709
 you want what I do is see more youtubers 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.800
 these stops that motivate me motivate the 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.800
 life to get with my cecilio channel 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.580
 tips of your outfit is dedicated to the 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.590
 collaboration I would love not to 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.050
 I discard so very attentive to the channel 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.480
 14 is ready the best experience in your 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.550
 life could not say could not say just 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.380
 a real one but I think the best 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.209
 professional experience was turning the 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.090
 camera the first day that came to me 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.819
 Maria's head makes a youtube channel 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.830
 because all that has derived some 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.720
 brutal experiences because I told you 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.310
 million trips I felt that all the 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.560
 trips but I think this has been the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.660
 decision that has changed my life the most and 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.130
 therefore the best meat the 0-3 te 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.019
 like to get married you have a family 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.580
 numerous in the future is not not one of 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.440
 my priorities I love that people 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.170
 have your priorities but it's not mine 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.530
 I do not like it for me for my person 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.620
 at the moment my 23 years later, no 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.569
 I know a thousand 915 which is what you hate the most 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.120
 Envy is the world thing 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.950
 disgusting of the world people stepping on 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.050
 one another to be the best 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.220
 there are people bugging the good of 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.380
 the big ones 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.120
 simply being superior to them is 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.160
 something that I can not stand envy is what 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.380
 more hate and I look for more than lies 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.890
 because pious lies and they are the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.100
 top 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.800
 angela towards 3b the way of being that you 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.690
 like to live like crazy that gives hard life 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.970
 Well, with kisses, I say if I like to live at 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.830
 crazy is what I do I really get up 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.750
 with a plane ticket and I piro like that is 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.640
 as I am well for at least five 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.440
 years each blonde 12 in which hotel you 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.170
 you stayed new york pros and cons three 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.260
 or two because they have pool is the 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.630
 downtown and all that and the only one against 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.790
 It is not that you have lots next to 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.040
 months which and at night is a bit 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.140
 madness not from noise but you have 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.580
 and on the right, you are a tad 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.530
 you have is in your school that is the area 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.820
 where you can have a coffee and such 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.410
 so if you want to go out and have something 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.380
 at night you have to go more to 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.440
 the skill tape but 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.570
 otherwise we continue every come

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.260
 obviously in travel youtubers are 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.580

 it's not a joke it was not a hate going to work 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.439
