00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 and it shows everything if we are in card 5 and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.629
 As you are watching today, I am going to teach you 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.429
 how to put in the eyes the shape of a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.290
 zombie you are going to see that it is something incredible 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.210
 you can pay the way a zombie and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.980
 in different ways that is amazing 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.360
 what are you going to see right now and good 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.070
 we go there the only thing that has the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.170
 My character does not have a good face 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.199
 person who had face injuries 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.640
 but it's not worth going to get into the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.590
 Antilles once we are here in 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.420
 contact lenses you will see the different 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.670
 there is how serving it is changing the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.260
 eye color but this is now 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.649
 same as they would be so more normalitos 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.210
 I would like the rose another thing to look at 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.260
 this yellow that always one and I'm 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.600
 crazy 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.290
 then I would be black I would also be with 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.210
 gray that's also pretty cool this 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.680
 I would also be pretty cool this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.760
 It would also be very cool but this one 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.870
 It would be the zombies 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.700
 I would like rangers and oysters term the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.150
 spice as well as in plan 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.610
 of course something but Diana lizard is 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.470
 lizard cell is really cool 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.500
 would like dragon aliens goats 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.660
 smile 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.399
 it's worth to continue to set you back kid 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.530
 possessed and demon 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:16.350
 this has not seen him infected 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.509
 I would also like the dead alien 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 living and would also be the zombie 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.319
 that you notice who is really cool but 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.369
 honestly the one I like the most 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:29.099
 everyone would be this could be infected 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.349
 or the demon demon that is super 

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:33.119
 cool we're going to put the devil but 

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:34.229
 the fashion zombies very much 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.810
 the truth I miss very much that there 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.759
 got this kind of stuff not because it's 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.229
 on the road zombie way 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.909
 extraterrestrials and all of this from 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.219
 I do not know why I do not know why they had 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.899
 put that but it's pretty cool then 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.030
 have the paintings but this should not 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.920
 to have 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.080
 if he was more or less I think that the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.619
 same worth chest makeup with sticks 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.659
 with sticks couples let's go out let's go 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.340
 see how in the eyes these but the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.960
 true that a lot of beige is really cool 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.600
 all that zombies I liked 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.369
 quite because it is in plan there that is 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.890
 hers that a zombie but is that these 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.130
 reds let's see if I can zoom in 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.650
 a little more the camera fix is â€‹â€‹that it 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.270
 they are left there in the plan of flying dolls 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.860
 very much the truth so nothing 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.330
 I appreciated very much if you leave a piece 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.280
 of like can this piece of video that 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.860
 know what more curious thing have 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.209
 implemented in gta 5 so nothing 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.250
 I hope you liked the shapes 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.510
 subsist or you are not and see you in the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.510
