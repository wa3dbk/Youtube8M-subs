ps4 consoles and and it's kind of like a
trailer<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> controller<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.300> could

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
trailer for the controller if you could

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.359 
trailer for the controller if you could
imagine<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.050> mean<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.039> bunch<00:00:23.250> of

imagine that I mean it's it's a bunch of

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.650 
imagine that I mean it's it's a bunch of
devs<00:00:23.670> kind<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.060> talking<00:00:24.269> about<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
devs kind of talking about the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.750 
devs kind of talking about the
controller<00:00:24.990> revealing<00:00:25.650> some<00:00:25.890> new<00:00:26.039> images<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
controller revealing some new images and

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.400 
controller revealing some new images and
and<00:00:27.420> kind<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.689> talking<00:00:27.869> about<00:00:28.140> all<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
features that it comes with so I found

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.970 
features that it comes with so I found
this<00:00:30.750> pretty<00:00:31.050> interesting<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:31.679> got<00:00:31.710> some

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
this pretty interesting it's got some

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.470

you guys learn all about this new ps4

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.920 
you guys learn all about this new ps4
controller<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.329> here<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.230> go<00:00:46.350> enjoy<00:00:47.510> so<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
controller and here we go enjoy so the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.930 
controller and here we go enjoy so the
new<00:00:49.079> controller<00:00:49.440> truly<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:50.670> amazing

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
new controller truly is a really amazing

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.850 
new controller truly is a really amazing
piece<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.390> kit<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.170> has<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.590> lot<00:00:52.739> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
piece of kit because it has a lot of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
piece of kit because it has a lot of
simple<00:00:53.399> inputs<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:54.000> when<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.329> combine<00:00:54.690> them

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
simple inputs but when we combine them

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.959 
simple inputs but when we combine them
together<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.440> becomes<00:00:55.829> really<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.309> rich

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.990 

we<00:01:00.899> talked<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.800> lot<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.070> developers<00:01:02.609> saw

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
we talked with a lot of developers saw

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.600 
we talked with a lot of developers saw
what<00:01:03.269> they<00:01:03.510> really<00:01:03.809> want<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.610> they

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
what they really want and what they

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.149 
what they really want and what they
think<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.970> missing<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.810> DualShock<00:01:07.140> 3<00:01:07.170> that

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
think is missing in the DualShock 3 that

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.039 
think is missing in the DualShock 3 that
could<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> great<00:01:08.729> feature<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
could be a great feature one of

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
have been all these features added to it

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.870 
have been all these features added to it
without<00:01:36.649> compromising<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.920> basic<00:01:38.399> feel<00:01:38.670> of

the dual shot for example the first

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260 
the dual shot for example the first
thing<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.860> notice<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.490> light<00:01:41.940> bar

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
thing that you notice is the light bar

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.359 
thing that you notice is the light bar
at<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> front<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.080> this<00:01:43.350> light<00:01:43.590> bar<00:01:43.830> has

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
at the front and this light bar has

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.910 
at the front and this light bar has
several<00:01:44.850> functions<00:01:45.539> we<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:46.050> track<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
several functions we can track the

everyone it seems like a minor thing but

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.040 
everyone it seems like a minor thing but
it<00:02:05.099> actually<00:02:05.399> really<00:02:05.580> helps<00:02:05.910> the<00:02:06.119> flow<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.929> the

the controller touched by these
multi-touch<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.830> you're<00:02:17.550> able<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.730> have

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
multi-touch and you're able to have

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.309 
multi-touch and you're able to have
touch<00:02:18.150> interactions<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.959> are<00:02:19.080> very

touch interactions that are very
comfortable<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.950> play<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.580> can<00:02:20.730> use<00:02:20.819> you

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
comfortable to play so you can use you

freaking<00:02:22.920> things<00:02:23.129> out<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.520> then<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.030> add<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
freaking things out and then you add the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.640 
freaking things out and then you add the
