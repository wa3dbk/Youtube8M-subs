letting some of a light out I can do a

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.770 
letting some of a light out I can do a
layer<00:05:35.550> of<00:05:35.580> blood<00:05:35.910> that's<00:05:36.420> what<00:05:36.600> i<00:05:36.690> was

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
layer of blood that's what i was

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
thinking to like just black around the

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.470 
thinking to like just black around the
threads<00:05:40.890> and<00:05:41.280> then<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.820> program<00:05:43.880> okay<00:05:44.880> so<00:05:45.420> you

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
threads and then the program okay so you

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.940 
threads and then the program okay so you
see<00:05:45.780> we<00:05:45.930> learning<00:05:46.110> stuff<00:05:46.410> to<00:05:46.530> be<00:05:46.620> able<00:05:46.680> to

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950
