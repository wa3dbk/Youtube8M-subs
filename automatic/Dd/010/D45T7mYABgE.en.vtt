00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay I'm going over welding the spider

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.789 
okay I'm going over welding the spider
gears<00:00:03.270> in<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.570> video<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:04.049> almost<00:00:04.230> start<00:00:04.650> out

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
gears in this video I almost start out

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.100 
gears in this video I almost start out
by<00:00:04.980> figure<00:00:05.609> out<00:00:05.730> why<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:06.359> how<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.899> was<00:00:07.080> able<00:00:07.259> to

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
by figure out why and how I was able to

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.870 
by figure out why and how I was able to
have<00:00:10.110> one<00:00:10.440> wheel<00:00:10.590> moving<00:00:11.010> when<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.490> broke<00:00:11.730> the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
have one wheel moving when I broke the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.419 
have one wheel moving when I broke the
spreader<00:00:12.150> gears<00:00:12.679> abrupt<00:00:13.679> throw<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.070> smaller

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
spreader gears abrupt throw to smaller

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.099 
spreader gears abrupt throw to smaller
ones<00:00:14.519> like<00:00:14.790> some<00:00:15.089> new<00:00:15.179> pieces<00:00:15.420> here<00:00:15.780> but<00:00:16.770> uh

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
ones like some new pieces here but uh

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.650 
ones like some new pieces here but uh
keeping<00:00:19.109> my<00:00:19.230> foot<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.619> throttle<00:00:19.980> I

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
keeping my foot in the throttle I

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.400 
keeping my foot in the throttle I
managed<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.890> weld<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.070> outer<00:00:23.580> side<00:00:24.210> gear<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
managed to weld this outer side gear to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.920 
managed to weld this outer side gear to
the<00:00:25.560> carrier<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.330> then<00:00:27.330> when<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.599> took<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
the carrier and then when I took the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.240 
the carrier and then when I took the
last<00:00:28.140> hit<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> axilla<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.779> broke<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
last hit to the axilla and broke the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.500 
last hit to the axilla and broke the
welded<00:00:32.250> material<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.270> all<00:00:33.360> there

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
welded material you can see it all there

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.049 
welded material you can see it all there
that<00:00:33.870> done<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.250> was<00:00:35.340> free<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.940> was

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
that done it then it was free but it was

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.799 
that done it then it was free but it was
no<00:00:36.210> good<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.239> tore<00:00:39.600> up

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
no good you can see that is just tore up

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.799 
no good you can see that is just tore up
that<00:00:40.280> one<00:00:41.280> chunk<00:00:41.640> that's<00:00:41.760> ripped<00:00:42.030> out<00:00:42.239> that

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
that one chunk that's ripped out that

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.930 
that one chunk that's ripped out that
was<00:00:42.899> me<00:00:43.079> handling<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.820> out

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
was me handling this to get it out

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.610 
was me handling this to get it out
because<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.210> was<00:00:45.239> stuck<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.690> there<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:45.930> return

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
because it was stuck in there in return

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.549 
because it was stuck in there in return
they<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.940> tell<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:49.110> tell<00:00:49.379> but

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
they can tell but really tell but

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.150 
they can tell but really tell but
there's<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.800> crew<00:00:50.629> coke<00:00:51.629> concave<00:00:52.620> groove<00:00:52.949> all

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
there's a crew coke concave groove all

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.500 
there's a crew coke concave groove all
the<00:00:53.190> way<00:00:53.250> around<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:56.059> yeah<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> thought<00:00:57.360> let's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the way around that yeah I thought let's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.840 
the way around that yeah I thought let's
see<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.809> make<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.920> back<00:00:59.219> upper<00:00:59.550> end

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
see if I can make this back upper end

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.459 
see if I can make this back upper end
anyway<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.660> case<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> one<00:01:01.199> breaks

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
anyway it's just in case the one breaks

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.329 
anyway it's just in case the one breaks
and<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:02.100> throw<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.120> next<00:01:03.329> Derby<00:01:04.339> so

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and I just throw it in the next Derby so

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.920 
and I just throw it in the next Derby so
I'm<00:01:05.400> gonna<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.760> much<00:01:05.850> time<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> work<00:01:06.720> on

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
I'm gonna have that much time to work on

cleaned up and start working on welding

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.210 
cleaned up and start working on welding
it<00:01:29.979> okay<00:01:30.979> here's<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.369> rear<00:01:31.520> end<00:01:31.790> result<00:01:33.220> as

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
it okay here's the rear end result as

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.950 
it okay here's the rear end result as
you<00:01:34.280> can<00:01:34.460> see<00:01:34.640> I've<00:01:34.790> come<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.330> little<00:01:35.630> bit<00:01:35.720> crazy

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
you can see I've come a little bit crazy

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.020 
you can see I've come a little bit crazy
but<00:01:36.340> after<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.940> last<00:01:38.090> failure<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:40.850> don't

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
but after the last failure and I don't

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.060 
but after the last failure and I don't
plan<00:01:41.180> on<00:01:41.240> using<00:01:41.509> this<00:01:41.720> carrier<00:01:42.170> again<00:01:42.440> but<00:01:43.040> I

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
plan on using this carrier again but I

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.889 
plan on using this carrier again but I
can<00:01:43.250> still<00:01:43.490> take<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.060> shaft<00:01:44.330> out<00:01:44.570> that's

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
can still take the shaft out that's

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.570 
can still take the shaft out that's
extra<00:01:45.259> slag<00:01:45.560> laughs<00:01:45.830> to<00:01:45.950> knock<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.250> out<00:01:46.310> so

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
extra slag laughs to knock that out so

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:54.160 
extra slag laughs to knock that out so
don't<00:01:46.700> get<00:01:46.909> any<00:01:47.000> gears<00:01:47.240> but<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:52.520> can<00:01:52.670> see

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
don't get any gears but you can see

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.649 
don't get any gears but you can see
just<00:01:54.799> about<00:01:54.950> every<00:01:55.520> bit<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.420> could<00:01:56.570> be

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
just about every bit that could be

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.410 
just about every bit that could be
welded<00:01:57.080> that's<00:01:57.530> welded<00:01:58.060> stuck<00:01:59.060> at<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.210> shaft

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
welded that's welded stuck at the shaft

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.920 
welded that's welded stuck at the shaft
out<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:01.700> only<00:02:01.880> issues<00:02:02.119> I've<00:02:02.270> noticed<00:02:02.659> and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
out the only issues I've noticed and

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.840 
out the only issues I've noticed and
maybe<00:02:03.140> it's<00:02:03.229> because<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:03.619> is<00:02:03.770> cast<00:02:04.040> iron<00:02:04.490> or

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
maybe it's because this is cast iron or

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.290 
maybe it's because this is cast iron or
maybe<00:02:05.090> too<00:02:05.330> much<00:02:05.479> heat<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.049> different<00:02:06.680> welds

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
maybe too much heat and different welds

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.699 
maybe too much heat and different welds
if<00:02:08.300> will<00:02:08.479> show<00:02:08.690> up<00:02:08.840> there<00:02:09.020> does<00:02:09.229> show<00:02:09.410> up

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
if will show up there does show up

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.350 
if will show up there does show up
got<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.700> crack<00:02:11.000> there<00:02:11.030> that's<00:02:11.480> not<00:02:11.660> slag<00:02:13.360> and

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
got a crack there that's not slag and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.530 
got a crack there that's not slag and
there's<00:02:17.360> even<00:02:17.569> a<00:02:17.630> hairline<00:02:17.930> crack<00:02:17.989> there<00:02:19.540> so

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
there's even a hairline crack there so

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.199 
there's even a hairline crack there so
hopefully<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:23.120> stays<00:02:23.390> together

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
hopefully it stays together

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.500 
hopefully it stays together
at<00:02:26.209> least<00:02:26.360> enough<00:02:26.600> for<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:26.780> one<00:02:26.989> derby

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.770 

gets<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.530> slag<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.890> had<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.250> right<00:02:31.780> settle

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
gets to the slag I had the right settle

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.449 
gets to the slag I had the right settle
high<00:02:33.049> so<00:02:33.380> just<00:02:34.120> melt<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.239> too<00:02:35.390> much<00:02:35.510> lots<00:02:35.810> of

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
high so just melt it too much lots of

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.240 
high so just melt it too much lots of
chisel<00:02:37.459> that<00:02:37.549> off<00:02:37.730> or<00:02:38.030> grind<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.569> out<00:02:39.250> looks

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
chisel that off or grind it out looks

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.650 
chisel that off or grind it out looks
like<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.370> missed<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.790> little<00:02:41.000> bit<00:02:41.120> thicker<00:02:41.360> with

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
like I missed a little bit thicker with

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.720 
like I missed a little bit thicker with
a<00:02:41.690> little<00:02:41.989> bit<00:02:42.080> more<00:02:42.260> there<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:45.519> it's<00:02:46.519> pretty

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
a little bit more there but it's pretty

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.910 
a little bit more there but it's pretty
well

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
well

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.940 
well
well<00:02:48.920> did<00:02:49.130> solid<00:02:50.060> now

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
well did solid now

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.660 
well did solid now
so<00:02:51.970> we'll<00:02:52.970> be<00:02:53.180> putting<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.569> in<00:02:53.690> this<00:02:53.840> car<00:02:54.110> I

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
so we'll be putting it in this car I

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.030 
so we'll be putting it in this car I
think<00:02:55.670> or<00:02:55.970> my<00:02:56.269> same<00:02:57.049> part<00:02:57.380> back<00:02:57.500> up<00:02:57.709> here<00:02:57.920> in

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
think or my same part back up here in

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.560 
think or my same part back up here in
for<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:59.239> car<00:02:59.450> we'll<00:02:59.840> see<00:03:00.700> but<00:03:01.700> these<00:03:02.299> are<00:03:02.480> all

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
for that car we'll see but these are all

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.210 
for that car we'll see but these are all
eaten<00:03:02.900> eight<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.530> half<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.010> they're<00:03:04.130> all

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
eaten eight and a half so they're all

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.620 
eaten eight and a half so they're all
interchangeable<00:03:06.070> there<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.160> go<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:08.450> was

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
interchangeable there you go this was

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
time I was like I'll be sparkled let's

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.880 
time I was like I'll be sparkled let's
go<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:13.940> little<00:03:14.030> bit<00:03:14.299> here<00:03:14.570> here<00:03:15.230> here<00:03:15.650> whatever

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.920 
go a little bit here here here whatever
and<00:03:16.340> then<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.030> could<00:03:17.180> still<00:03:17.420> spin<00:03:17.810> this

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
and then I could still spin this

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.080 
and then I could still spin this

I<00:03:21.739> guess<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:22.190> think<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.459> just<00:03:22.609> got<00:03:22.730> lucky<00:03:23.019> with

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
I guess I think I just got lucky with

I guess I think I just got lucky with
that<00:03:24.079> last<00:03:24.380> one<00:03:24.620> these<00:03:25.130> two<00:03:25.340> gears<00:03:25.609> too

shattered there's nothing left but it

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.009 
shattered there's nothing left but it
would<00:03:28.579> still<00:03:28.670> move<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.150> one<00:03:29.329> wheel<00:03:29.600> and

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
would still move it to one wheel and

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.690 
would still move it to one wheel and

I<00:03:34.820> actually<00:03:35.570> welded<00:03:36.170> that<00:03:36.200> year<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:37.640> the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
I actually welded that year to the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.550 
I actually welded that year to the
carrier<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:38.450> for<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:38.810> while<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:38.989> was<00:03:39.290> going

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
carrier so for a while I was going

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.780 
carrier so for a while I was going
around<00:03:39.650> with<00:03:39.769> one<00:03:40.069> wheel<00:03:40.250> thought<00:03:40.609> I<00:03:40.640> had

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
around with one wheel thought I had

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.479 
around with one wheel thought I had
broken<00:03:41.030> axle<00:03:41.450> instead<00:03:41.569> and<00:03:42.220> when<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:43.250> finally

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
broken axle instead and when I finally

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.920 
broken axle instead and when I finally
got<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.700> shot<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:44.239> axle<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:45.069> it<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:47.660> broke

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
got a shot that this axle on it it broke

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.110 
got a shot that this axle on it it broke
tin<00:03:48.140> welds<00:03:48.500> loose

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.160

and<00:03:50.270> end<00:03:51.140> up<00:03:51.260> not<00:03:51.440> being<00:03:51.470> any<00:03:51.800> axles<00:03:52.220> broke

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
and end up not being any axles broke

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.580 
and end up not being any axles broke
there<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.290> go

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
there you go

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.250 
there you go
this<00:03:54.800> is<00:03:54.950> how<00:03:55.720> suggested<00:03:56.720> method<00:03:56.989> I<00:03:57.050> guess

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
this is how suggested method I guess

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.500 
this is how suggested method I guess
surveys<00:03:57.650> told<00:03:57.890> me<00:03:58.040> when<00:03:58.910> you<00:03:58.940> well<00:03:59.209> blow<00:03:59.360> these

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
surveys told me when you well blow these

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.170 
surveys told me when you well blow these
carriers<00:03:59.989> for<00:04:00.890> dirt<00:04:01.099> we<00:04:01.250> use<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.760> what<00:04:02.060> you

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
carriers for dirt we use this what you

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.089 
carriers for dirt we use this what you
should<00:04:02.360> do<00:04:02.480> watch<00:04:03.440> maybe<00:04:03.739> I<00:04:03.770> should<00:04:04.010> have

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
should do watch maybe I should have

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.339 
should do watch maybe I should have
known<00:04:04.250> because<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.550> know<00:04:04.610> in<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.140> circle<00:04:06.140> track

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
known because I know in the circle track

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.559 
known because I know in the circle track
racing<00:04:06.800> we<00:04:06.980> just<00:04:07.370> barely<00:04:07.610> welded<00:04:08.090> like<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.390> was

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
racing we just barely welded like it was

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.620 
racing we just barely welded like it was
that<00:04:09.380> yeah<00:04:09.650> racing<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.550> rope<00:04:10.760> but<00:04:11.450> shouldn't

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
that yeah racing the rope but shouldn't

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.570 
that yeah racing the rope but shouldn't
make<00:04:11.780> sense<00:04:12.019> us<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:12.290> go<00:04:12.410> racing<00:04:13.220> is<00:04:13.310> harder

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
make sense us I go racing is harder

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.259 
make sense us I go racing is harder
because<00:04:13.700> you're<00:04:14.110> racing<00:04:15.910> derbies<00:04:16.910> definitely
