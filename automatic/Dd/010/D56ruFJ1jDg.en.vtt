 You have insurance, Eastgrew. Not a regular stick. 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.550
 Brush tool is called the 2% c role is to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.720
 I use it to wipe dust off the spot . 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.720
 Farm. 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:28.070
 There is something like this in the wire. 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.770
 There is also something like a stick in my app. 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.600
 Of course, the sound or feeling is different. 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:40.130
 So it is accentuated by rail and peers do 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:46.340
 When play is accentuated zest lost my old club toughness 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.900
 While the show was writing brushes Suddenly one completely disassemble the air control 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.020
 In the wind 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.100
 I was surprised at the performance. 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.480
 Do it again 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:03.870
 As many as flush eoyeo to play scenes more 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:09.299
 In fact, it is writing the most, of course, but now through jazz side eojjae Latina 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:14.689
 Uh, I've used it a lot on this side , but it's actually pop. 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:19.579
 You can write as you like in any of these genres. 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:22.159
 So if you can understand the sounds that can fly in this brush 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:26.270
 You can find them whenever you need them. 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:31.549
 How to make a sound with an enemy brush and how to hit it 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:37.159
 Well, if what you're sound enough so that g2 aeman delivered some 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:39.880

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:52.580
 At the end of this treatment group 2 at the end of 2% 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.580
 The important sounds are very light 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.149
 I do not think it's a privilege . 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:08.780
 Then the bottle to the front surface 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:08.780
 If not will write tee tee yellow 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:16.120

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.860

 It's called the location. The sound of light. 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.549

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.849
 Once the pot as well as the phrase sounds more big is the water 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.849
