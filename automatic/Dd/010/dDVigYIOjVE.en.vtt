00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
before the Superbowl I did not get to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.770 
before the Superbowl I did not get to
watch<00:00:35.310> this<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:36.030> at<00:00:36.150> my<00:00:36.300> cousin's<00:00:36.510> wedding

watch this I was at my cousin's wedding

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.280 
watch this I was at my cousin's wedding
so<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.740> couldn't<00:00:38.250> really<00:00:38.430> tune<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:38.970> see<00:00:39.290> who

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
so I couldn't really tune in and see who

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.970 
so I couldn't really tune in and see who
won<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> did<00:00:41.490> look<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.850> who<00:00:42.090> won<00:00:42.270> MVP

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
won what but I did look up who won MVP

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.470 
won what but I did look up who won MVP
and<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.100> was<00:00:44.190> hoping<00:00:44.460> he<00:00:44.580> was<00:00:44.640> he<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.880> JJ<00:00:45.210> Watt

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and I was hoping he was he to JJ Watt

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
and I was hoping he was he to JJ Watt
but<00:00:46.410> unfortunately<00:00:47.100> well<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.460> really

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
but unfortunately well not really

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.430 
but unfortunately well not really
unfortunately<00:00:48.150> Aaron<00:00:48.540> Rodgers<00:00:48.900> did<00:00:49.050> win<00:00:49.290> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
unfortunately Aaron Rodgers did win it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.110 
unfortunately Aaron Rodgers did win it
so<00:00:49.860> that's<00:00:50.070> really<00:00:50.280> good<00:00:50.490> for<00:00:50.520> him

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

be the same as a console so we might

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.569
