00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the success I've had here some of the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.510 
the success I've had here some of the
failures<00:00:41.480> this<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> bark<00:00:43.290> graph<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.160> put

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
failures this is a bark graph that I put

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.400 
failures this is a bark graph that I put
on<00:00:44.960> about<00:00:45.960> five<00:00:46.230> weeks<00:00:47.129> ago<00:00:47.370> maybe<00:00:47.760> six<00:00:48.410> and

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
on about five weeks ago maybe six and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.520 
on about five weeks ago maybe six and
you<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.680> see<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.190> both<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.820> these<00:00:51.530> sticks

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you can see that both of these sticks

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.200 
you can see that both of these sticks
have<00:00:52.739> taken<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.840> a

posy cultivar and the one on the left

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.359 
posy cultivar and the one on the left
you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.410> I've<00:01:01.710> written<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:02.399> Lakota

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
you can see I've written here Lakota

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.679 
you can see I've written here Lakota
probably<00:01:05.369> can't<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> video<00:01:06.360> but

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
probably can't see that in the video but

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.080 
probably can't see that in the video but
that<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> Lakota<00:01:07.439> cultivar<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.909> I've

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
that is a Lakota cultivar and I've

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.310 
that is a Lakota cultivar and I've
grafted<00:01:09.570> both<00:01:09.750> these<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> top<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.170> this

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
grafted both these in the top of this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.719 
grafted both these in the top of this
tree<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.869> cut<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.259> tree<00:01:16.500> right<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.580> was

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
tree I cut the tree right there that was

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.870 
tree I cut the tree right there that was
a<00:01:18.380> very<00:01:19.380> hard<00:01:19.680> decision<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.310> had<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.549> make

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
a very hard decision I had to make

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
a very hard decision I had to make
I<00:01:21.150> cut<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.290> there<00:01:23.540> split<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.750> bark<00:01:25.020> made<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
I cut it there split the bark made the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.300 
I cut it there split the bark made the
graft<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.509> I'm<00:01:27.509> very<00:01:27.990> pleased<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.710> say<00:01:28.829> that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
graft and I'm very pleased to say that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.929 
graft and I'm very pleased to say that
both<00:01:30.470> pieces<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.950> sign<00:01:32.280> would<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.729> take<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
both pieces of sign would I take that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.539 
both pieces of sign would I take that
back<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.079> posy<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.590> growing<00:01:34.979> very<00:01:35.009> nicely

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
back the posy is growing very nicely

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.230 
back the posy is growing very nicely
actually<00:01:35.880> flowering<00:01:37.640> because<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> came<00:01:38.820> off<00:01:39.210> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
actually flowering because I came off of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.190 
actually flowering because I came off of
a<00:01:39.689> tree<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.680> was<00:01:40.829> gonna<00:01:41.040> flower<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:42.200> spring

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
a tree that was gonna flower this spring

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.820 
a tree that was gonna flower this spring
the<00:01:44.130> Lakota<00:01:45.439> let's<00:01:46.439> scratch<00:01:46.860> it

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.220 

still<00:01:50.830> green<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:52.390> definitely<00:01:52.930> has

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
still green and that definitely has

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.520 
still green and that definitely has
swollen<00:01:53.890> here<00:01:57.120> but<00:01:58.120> it's<00:01:58.300> behind<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.260> posi

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
swollen here but it's behind the posi

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.050 
swollen here but it's behind the posi
half<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:01.200> that's<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.500> portion<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.310> what<00:02:03.940> I've

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
half and that's a portion of what I've

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.570 
half and that's a portion of what I've
grafted<00:02:04.570> over<00:02:04.870> in<00:02:05.020> this<00:02:05.170> tree<00:02:05.560> over<00:02:05.800> here<00:02:06.460> we

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
grafted over in this tree over here we

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.020 
grafted over in this tree over here we
have<00:02:06.730> a<00:02:06.760> four<00:02:07.060> flat<00:02:07.360> graft<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:11.050> growing<00:02:12.030> I'm

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
have a four flat graft it's growing I'm

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.020 
have a four flat graft it's growing I'm
gonna<00:02:13.150> go<00:02:13.330> ahead<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.660> take<00:02:14.260> off<00:02:14.440> some<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.800> this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
gonna go ahead and take off some of this

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.530 
gonna go ahead and take off some of this
green<00:02:16.030> growth<00:02:16.480> down<00:02:16.960> below<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.560> graft<00:02:18.540> here's

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
green growth down below the graft here's

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.390 
green growth down below the graft here's
a<00:02:19.630> graph<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.840> put<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.410> last<00:02:20.710> year<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.280> can

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
a graph that put on last year you can

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.550 
a graph that put on last year you can
see<00:02:21.460> before<00:02:22.000> flaps<00:02:22.450> way<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:23.110> see<00:02:23.320> two<00:02:23.530> of

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
see before flaps way you can see two of

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.330 
see before flaps way you can see two of
the<00:02:23.710> four<00:02:24.160> here<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.540> that's<00:02:26.110> growing<00:02:26.620> up<00:02:26.950> nice

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
the four here and that's growing up nice

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.460 
the four here and that's growing up nice
and<00:02:31.560> I've<00:02:32.560> stripped<00:02:32.890> off<00:02:33.100> everything<00:02:33.640> in<00:02:33.790> her

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and I've stripped off everything in her

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.290 
and I've stripped off everything in her
there's<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.560> lot<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.950> bear<00:02:36.160> branch<00:02:36.580> here<00:02:36.940> and

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
there's a lot of bear branch here and

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.080 
there's a lot of bear branch here and
the<00:02:38.200> reason<00:02:38.530> for<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.740> is<00:02:39.010> because<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.790> graft

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
the reason for that is because the graft

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.480 
the reason for that is because the graft
that<00:02:40.540> was<00:02:40.810> made<00:02:41.020> up<00:02:41.170> here<00:02:41.530> had<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.250> match<00:02:42.459> the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
that was made up here had to match the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.530 
that was made up here had to match the
size<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.230> stock<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:44.920> I<00:02:45.670> grafted<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:46.390> to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
size of the stock that I grafted it to

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.980 
size of the stock that I grafted it to
and<00:02:46.690> that's<00:02:46.780> why<00:02:46.990> it's<00:02:47.140> way<00:02:47.320> out<00:02:47.560> here<00:02:47.950> and

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
and that's why it's way out here and

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.300 
and that's why it's way out here and
it's<00:02:49.990> not<00:02:50.110> perfect<00:02:50.470> oh<00:02:52.560> well<00:02:53.560> I'm<00:02:53.890> just<00:02:53.980> happy

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
it's not perfect oh well I'm just happy

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.120 
it's not perfect oh well I'm just happy
to<00:02:54.400> get<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.760> take<00:02:54.970> here's<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.330> bark<00:02:56.130> graph

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
to get it to take here's a bark graph

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.320 
to get it to take here's a bark graph
that<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.550> did<00:02:57.760> last<00:02:58.239> year<00:03:00.150> questioning<00:03:01.150> this

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
that I did last year questioning this

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.479 
that I did last year questioning this
because<00:03:01.750> it's<00:03:01.930> really<00:03:02.320> leaning<00:03:02.650> over<00:03:02.890> I'm

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
because it's really leaning over I'm

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.840 
because it's really leaning over I'm
thinking<00:03:03.880> maybe<00:03:04.060> I'm<00:03:04.239> going<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.450> tie<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.780> up

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
thinking maybe I'm going to tie it up

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.750 
thinking maybe I'm going to tie it up
and<00:03:06.850> give<00:03:07.150> us<00:03:07.180> some<00:03:07.450> support<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:09.220> we<00:03:09.340> don't<00:03:09.550> rip

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
and give us some support so we don't rip

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.550 
and give us some support so we don't rip
it<00:03:09.910> off<00:03:10.060> down<00:03:10.360> here<00:03:10.390> where<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.830> graphs<00:03:12.130> taken

it off down here where the graphs taken
over<00:03:14.560> here<00:03:14.739> are<00:03:14.980> two<00:03:15.280> four<00:03:15.610> flaps<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:17.380> one

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790

I've been giving a lot of care and it's

I've been giving a lot of care and it's
growing<00:03:51.560> rather<00:03:52.560> well<00:03:52.890> but<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:55.550> didn't<00:03:56.550> know

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
growing rather well but I didn't know

what<00:03:57.360> kind<00:03:57.600> of<00:03:57.660> pecans<00:03:57.959> this<00:03:58.200> tree<00:03:58.380> would

what kind of pecans this tree would

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.670 
what kind of pecans this tree would
produce<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:59.160> I've<00:03:59.400> grafted<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.410> now<00:04:01.410> as<00:04:01.560> we

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
produce so I've grafted it now as we

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.430 
produce so I've grafted it now as we
work<00:04:01.860> our<00:04:02.070> way<00:04:02.190> down<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.820> tree<00:04:03.330> there's<00:04:04.200> not

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.300

there's<00:04:12.209> an<00:04:12.420> old<00:04:12.570> failure<00:04:13.110> from<00:04:13.350> last<00:04:13.680> year

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
there's an old failure from last year

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.319 
there's an old failure from last year
and<00:04:15.079> one<00:04:16.079> from<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:16.859> year<00:04:17.220> yet<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.150> don't

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
and one from this year yet that I don't

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.080 
and one from this year yet that I don't
think<00:04:18.570> it's<00:04:18.690> going<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.870> grow<00:04:19.549> I'm<00:04:20.549> not<00:04:20.760> getting

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
think it's going to grow I'm not getting

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.590 
think it's going to grow I'm not getting
anything<00:04:21.329> out<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:21.840> this<00:04:23.180> probably<00:04:24.180> not<00:04:24.360> going

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
anything out of this probably not going

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.670 
anything out of this probably not going
to<00:04:24.690> happen<00:04:26.000> but<00:04:27.000> that's<00:04:27.150> okay

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
to happen but that's okay

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.100 
to happen but that's okay
perhaps<00:04:29.280> if<00:04:29.729> we<00:04:29.760> let<00:04:30.120> some<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.450> these<00:04:30.540> grow<00:04:30.840> out

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
perhaps if we let some of these grow out

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.770 
perhaps if we let some of these grow out
this<00:04:31.470> year<00:04:31.830> we'll<00:04:32.520> do<00:04:32.669> a<00:04:32.700> four<00:04:33.030> flap<00:04:33.360> on<00:04:33.600> them

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
this year we'll do a four flap on them

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.980 
this year we'll do a four flap on them
next<00:04:34.530> year<00:04:34.710> which<00:04:34.979> I<00:04:35.280> certainly<00:04:36.060> prefer<00:04:36.330> over

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
next year which I certainly prefer over

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.740 
next year which I certainly prefer over
the<00:04:37.110> bark<00:04:37.350> graft<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:42.919> we'll<00:04:43.919> get<00:04:44.070> it<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.250> grow

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
the bark graft and we'll get it to grow

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.090 
the bark graft and we'll get it to grow
we've<00:04:45.750> got<00:04:45.900> some<00:04:46.020> good<00:04:46.169> cultivars<00:04:46.680> up<00:04:46.890> here

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
we've got some good cultivars up here

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:55.140 
we've got some good cultivars up here
with<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:47.250> jayhawk<00:04:48.470> posy<00:04:51.350> Lakota

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:03.420 

and<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:57.340> beats<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:59.650> native<00:05:00.479> chance<00:05:02.340> that<00:05:03.340> we

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
and that beats the native chance that we

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.820 
and that beats the native chance that we
might<00:05:03.610> have<00:05:03.699> taken<00:05:05.340> thanks<00:05:06.340> for<00:05:06.490> watching
