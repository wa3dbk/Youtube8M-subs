00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Let's solve the issue of enem in 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.140
 2009 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.179
 You have two ways to do this question 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.910
 here will actually have three ways that 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.250
 I realized to make one of them is very 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.699
 fast you kill the question in a minute 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.380
 even - the others are more complicated a 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.539
 little further from being done 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.119
 I'll do each of them here for you. 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.130
 Look, the first one is fast. 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.560
 company that manufactures steel balls of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 six centimeter radius uses boxes 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.769
 of wood in the form of a 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.719
 carry the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.329
 so he speaks important things here 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.000
 box has the shape of a beauty cube 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.860
 knowing that the capacity of the carton is 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.239
 13 thousand eight hundred and twenty four 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.190
 cubic centimeters 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.559
 then the maximum number of spheres 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.379
 can be transported in a carton is 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.059
 same as the fast way to do it 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.219
 This is where I can ignore this. 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.710
 information of 13 thousand and 24 thousand of public 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.050
 simply realize that the only 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.890
 perfect that I have more alternatives 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.920
 here o 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.420
 is the 84 is not a perfect body is extracted 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.689
 the public root of 4 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.340
 This is an irrational number, right? 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.560
 It will be a cute whole number . 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.990
 as well as public radio of 16 also 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.090
 public arraes integer of 24 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.220
 is not 32 is not the only 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.830
 which is a perfect cube is 8 beauty then 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.840
 imagine for example here the ball're the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.220
 sphere would be more or less from here it has 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.040
 radius 6 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.360
 ok which means that the diameter of it 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.979
 measures 12 inches measures 12 centimeters 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.590
 sure and then imagine that in this sphere 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.880
 here it would fit inside a tub 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.630
 here o 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.939
 in this club here in this beauty box 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.479
 this box would then have to have 12 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.490
 centimeters by 12 centimeters by 12 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.110
 centimeter is or is not 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.130
 and then under these conditions I could 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.229
 take a sphere one does not have here in 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.350
 alternatives a perfect first time 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.929
 After that, I would have what I would have 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.690
 how to take eight of these spheres by 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.660
 I can have this box here right? 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.720
 A beauty box I'm taking a 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.300
 Only ball but I can very well. 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.970
 increase this amount only if I 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.040
 make a cube now with air this is 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.740
 say two who say that arises is 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.850
 Unit okay then I would have one a 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.100
 times one that gives a 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.870
 now let's assume that a cube with an edge 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.750
 2 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.330
 So, there's only one way you can not 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.580
 take eight would have this figure here 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:53.550
 right 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:55.860
 2 to 2 also and here now give a two 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.950
 three four and has four more dogs 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.200
 behind the 8th upcoming 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.450
 if we did a three side at the time 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.180
 that's two here's two here's 22 times 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.330
 two times 2 out of 8 the next would be three 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.130
 times three times 3 27 does not have 27 ac 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.760
 then I would have four times four 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.070
 times 4 64 does not have 64 here so the only one 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.580
 alternative that could be the answer is 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.890
 the letter b 8 is then there is a long form 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.530
 to resolve this from here based on the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.440
 announced that the volume of the cube is the 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.270
 next is to bill this 13 thousand 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.350
 eight hundred and twenty four centimeters 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:38.070
 cubic will bill this number here 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.840
 3824 I can factor to it and try to see if 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.269
 it's a perfect body was in the air 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.830
 look only to this bill number here 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.420
 then it begins to divide by two nor 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.290
 because it's an even number I can divide 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.410
 for two 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.640
 come on 13/2 will give six on a 1 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:57.570
 so here you will get 18/29 here 2/2 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.590
 to 1 and 4/22 remain even number 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.660
 divided by two 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.040
 and there will give a lot of day d account 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:09.180
 who does I just know / 2 839/2 is going to give 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.959
 four left a gift 11/25 left one 12 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.670
 / 2 of the six still gives number to 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.950
 split for two yet here I already 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.000
 I realized that I closed a neon cube 2 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.750
 raised to hub 3496/28 the following 3 / 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.670
 2 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:30.540
 one over 1 14 by 2 out of 7 and here 5/2 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.220
 gives two over 1 16 by 2 to 8 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.930
 so here you can divide by two 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.030
 still an even number then right 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:43.170
 continue 17/2 will give eight over 11 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.150
 12 by 2 of the 68 by 2 to 4 still of a 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.590
 even number can divide by two 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.480
 so you see that it is a very long method 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.370
 to do is if you know how to do division 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.220
 very quickly and quietly 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.310
 Quick question but let's go 8 by 2 to 4 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.080
 6 by 2 to 3 4 by 2 to 2 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.590
 You still have two and here you see that the 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.790
 I lock another right cube 432 here I go 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:09.570
 to have four for 223 for two that gives some work 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:12.510
 12 2 to 6 16 swim for two here will give 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.820
 108 is half 16 right now 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.470
 easy on our account for two again with 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:23.010
 the 54 by 2 closed another bowl here is not 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:26.100
 54 coming from two halves 2727 from 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.440
 three giving 9 for three giving 3 and for 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.380
 three that gives and that ends our account 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.810
 we closed another tank here then the 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:40.830
 cubic root of this whole number here 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:43.110
 explains from 13,824 I can say that 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.880
 equals when simplifying the cube with 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.340
 the public res always always stay 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.979
 I always stay this will give 2 times two 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.680
 times twice training 12 months 2 times 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:56.100
 twice 3 that's gonna give me what eight 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.410
 3 24 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.560
 does this mean and mean that 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.590
 my hub is my body I'm considering 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.669
 like the box that will carry that 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:14.610
 steel balls have edges equal to 24 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:18.330
 24 24 by 24 beauty like 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.650
 each sphere diameter 12 because they have 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.560
 six centimeters of radius of a diameter 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.669
 it is 12 diameter twice the radius then here 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.410
 eight of these spheres 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:32.240
 Just realize here I could put 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:35.120
 four so that 12 12 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.000
 but at 24 and there behind I could 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.280
 put four other spheres then 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.750
 to give and give to place eight to 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.009
 head had here inside this box 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:49.190
 and the answer would surely be the letter e 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.240
 I'm good, I'll get my grade. 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.750
 high on enem 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.150
 beauty then this until the next video 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.180
 You're not alone, I'm with you, bye. 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.180
 bye
