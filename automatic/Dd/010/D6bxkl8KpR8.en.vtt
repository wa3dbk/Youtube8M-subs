 happy tribute then he is a 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.909
 technique is very simple it's 2 kraft 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.400
 this not to talk about it 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.020

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.060

 crushed she will give us really 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.880
 there India but when I say the blind 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.530
 it's crazy stuff the number of colds 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.790
 that you will be able to have my cousin 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.680
 did that for a week he had 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.010
 ten thousand runes of each gift he had 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.409
 runes innate runes must have had 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.110
 runes not in to a step must he in 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.100
 has about 1000 of each and that's 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.440
 a technique that work in addition to this 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.030
 which is good is that since we 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.100
 can no longer exchanged resources against 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.470
 scrolls the food horns all 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.530

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.560
 scope of all awards and the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.570

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.340
 advise you to take a drink 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.040
 100 by cons be careful when you 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.720
 go kraft worth amulets you go 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.979
 quickly find yourself short of friends and 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.510
 you will have to throw the amulets 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.299
 to be able to move or so called a 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.709
 other perso and so that's okay 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.510
 lose a little time really done 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.610
 watch out for that on a little something a 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.840
 little stupid thing thought to do 4 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.050
 so here why am I telling you 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.349
 dale to break since watching our a the 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.470
 price let's talk about being an idea of ​​4000 cam 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.470
 pretty much the senses and here 3300 leaving 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.360
 not wrong to know that my cousin we had 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.989
 about ten thousand I leave you 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.940
 to tell if we add 1 2 that we are there 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:49.690
 3-0 in 2 0 that makes us 320 miles 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.690
 I do not sleep 1000 with ten minutes 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.989
 sanofi should have 330000 I arround alas 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.790
 about 400 miles by knowing 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:06.079
 that he had also runes not in so 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:09.980
 leaving the 120000 kama and spas 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.930
 must 9 me kaba so leaving a good 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.269
 little package I think that is approaching the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.890
 million I think it really proves 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.920
 of the million knowing he had to 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.030
 to spend what 200000 kama of kraft and 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.540
 in addition he is reassembled jeweler 54.3 a 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.239
 something like that 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.650
 so this technique that works after I 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.970
 I'm not sure she's working on all 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.620

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.620
