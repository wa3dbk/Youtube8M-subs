 here bringing you an adventure map and 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.080

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.670
 a lot and good in the description of 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.430
 video I'm going to leave everything that is the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.200
 package texture the map and I'll 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.730
 leave how to install it for those who do not 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.849
 know there in the description of the video 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.789
 to be everything more and good to start 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.320
 I wanted more than anything to grab this 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.849
 map also to see how engraved my 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.859
 phone because I just restarted it 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.179
 for some problems that I had and I think 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.329
 that you see is a little more fluid I do not know 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.190
 what do you think and good as you know 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.170
 is a commented video we will not see that 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.850
 this map is a type of sky block island 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.070
 where then we will find several 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.520
 islands that have different materials 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.100
 not between them then the gold stone 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.820
 diamond and an island only with the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.860
 pure materials sand cactus houses and 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.420
 all that not to the joke of this well then 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.370
 to where I found jokes 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.320
 Well, it's good to put all the islands together 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.480
 collecting all the materials and 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.410
 make your own world there is the one of 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.170
 giant tree that is the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.309
 which is the one that where are you going to go to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.870
 collect wood if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.520
 good at first you see some 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.470
 trees but you have to expand it a lot 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.910
 of these trees there are all the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.680
 materials also floating from there what 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.150
 you're going to grab and well it's also for 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.880
