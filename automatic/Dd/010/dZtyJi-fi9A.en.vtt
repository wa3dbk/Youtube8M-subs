00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 that the church can be completely different 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.930
 this shows the church of silence in 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.880
 hamburg in helenenstraÃŸe has 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.670
 you just removed all the church benches 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.210
 and has a meditative center 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.309
 created 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.760
 there you can get together for 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.680
 example for overtone music and from the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.060
 film treasures of the north church we show 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.939
 the short section of visa vista 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:32.369
 overtone instruments that are games horn 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.350
 monochord and a pipe bell game in 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.899
 unfold the silence of the church room 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.710
 your sounds and are with the whole 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.710
 body noticeable 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.500
 Edgar Spieker has an alternative way 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.450
 found silence to be experienced 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.250
 His body areas count as well 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.600
 offer of this church I am very happy 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.780
 long from the church 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.180
 and this church of silence too 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.070
 Discover was really one for me 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.430
 revelation but seen there are 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.910
 Christian churches open one 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:20.200
 offer space 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:22.840
 a place where I can find myself 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.410
 to my own spiritual depth 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.410
 can follow 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.200
 Mr. von Hirschhausen, you have wonders 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.970
 given keyword so we called the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.370
 suitable film in the quiet can 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.730
 One piece of this concentration too 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.510
 What do you think of such new ones 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.940
 offered by the church it is for me 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.060
 very strange to see that and 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.260
 At the same time I have a lot of myself 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.210
 dance experiences for example too 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.460
 made and that is one 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.350
 Giant difference if you look at it and 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.090
 first thinks how crazy is that then 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.710
 So if you never did that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.280
 I understand every one of the above head 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.560
 shake because I'm great 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.590
 also say ecstatic nature in the experience 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.020
 dance of liberation from contact of 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.990
 People too 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.610
 yes of pure joie de vivre he does that 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.010
 Protestant church rulers like finding 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.840
 they something so new approaches so 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:26.520
 You would have to try that out in the fall 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.960
 You can do that , but you can 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.340
 can also do cable worship services 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.700
 but at the end of the day 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.830
 I think I have to, and that's it 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.330
 is the l remember what 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.190
 has made us strong what can we do 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.950
 someone the beauty of a church room 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.120
 for example, they have always have the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.230
 which is very important, I said 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.300
 she also mentioned it 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.130
 I believe that clearly believe in the long run 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.110
 can only continue if it is in 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.120
 any way is practiced at home 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.980
 if it goes without saying so must 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.960
 The table prayer speaks to me when I say that 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.460
 then start as a 30-year-old can 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.810
 I do that but it will not be anymore 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.300
 never again this naturalness 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.640
 have spirituality rediscover what 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.870
 say so 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.040
 lighter on the one hand, I'm glad 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.680
 me that in the evangelical church 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.840
 the sensuality of faith new 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.360
 forms take place so i am too 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.670
 not with the fight of god 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.709
 mr same time but I have that too 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.610
 participated not quite creative but 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.270
 started with god 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.380
 There are new forms of spirituality in it 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.880
 the evangelical church but that 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.170
 does not exclude that there are others 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.080
 I was in Stuttgart yesterday 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.660
 a forest time so-called there 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.700
 every summer always two weeks children 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.790
 from the first to the sixth 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.720
 supervised for two weeks by 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.990
 honorary youth and older 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.780
 Read the Bible Reading Bible 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.220
 and there is, and I think so 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.720
 one does not exclude the other 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.160
 can have good preaching worship services 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.510
 we can recreate spirituality 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.220
 we can discover children in the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.230
 Christian faith introduce children 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.420
 to pass on the Christian rituals 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.070
 Parents help their children one me 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.570
 yes, also say the Christian 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.310
 practice rituals at home 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.410
 So the Protestant church is one 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.490
 huge variety of possibilities and 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.490
 I would like to let
