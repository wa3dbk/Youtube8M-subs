00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.059
 hey people could heat up yesterday 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.710
 more video here on my channel and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.269
 I just want to watch this video 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.619
 use a happy one for all of you 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.170
 to wish Christmas 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.060
 no matter, we'll spend this day I 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.890
 think most when first a piece 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.480
 celebrate far with your family and then 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.160
 tonight or tonight to the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.740
 console rushing and the gta 5 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.449
 Enter online mode and that's it 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.130
 no problem hacker groups has indeed 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.550
 announced that they would spoil us 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.680
 want 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.260
 but they were not at the end in the end 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.090
 able and at best you come 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.550
 even with a new fresh 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.469
 console in gta 5 online mode animal skins 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.289
 gotten with gta 5 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.350
 Of course in luggage and enjoy the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.809
 snow in new pictures graphic for that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.750
 just looks phenomenal from the whole 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.969
 city â€‹â€‹is white and that is one too 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.879
 the greatest innovation of the last one 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.289
 dlc s and updates i celebrate the city 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.480
 I spend hours in the city 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.640
 The whole building drove me that way 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.439
 looked again and have me too 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.880
 mostly busy with it 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.619
 Any passers-by with you 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.900
 throw off snowballs 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.000
 snowballs could shape in yours 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.970
 if you are unarmed since on the d-pad 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.259
 once left then press 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.030
 main character and take three 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.420
 you can snowballs on that three times 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.909
 do 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.920
 until you have new snowballs in the inventory 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.020
 have and then you can be quite normal with 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.689
 l2 aim and with him two the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.240
 throw off snowballs and thus even 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.130
 also people kill three throws about 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.780
 The upper body is enough for people 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.030
 kill and who with snowballs 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.460
 kills people then you get for it too 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.320
 usually no police stars 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.420
 In addition, the fireworks 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.070
 now again in gta 5 online mode the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.689
 You can pick yourself over the holidays 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.189
 which is a pretty cool update 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.290
 but it is natural from the snow 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.939
 totally in the shade 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.590
 I just leave in the background 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.149
 some gameplay run by goodbye 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.780
 I am at this point to get out people 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.780
 and
