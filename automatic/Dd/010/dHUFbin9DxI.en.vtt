00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.420
 the boxer is a high jump 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.300
 calls for a leap in 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.610
 the height and in the far is important 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.290
 that the horse jump higher at the boxer 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.130
 Must have been in a steep jump in 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.990
 same height 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.480
 so that it reaches the necessary distance 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.220
 here in training presented by the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.220
 young rider ann-christin gÃ¼ldenberg 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.230
 Now we have an oxer here 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.119
 a so-called high-step-jump 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.590
 not only steep and but also 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.450
 the horses have to jump the distance 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.790
 is missing a bit easier too 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.860
 Appraise because the render is a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.629
 but the fans are a bit more 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.600
 Of course enough can jump around 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.190
 to get away and the rider must 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:55.289
 even more careful with the downturn 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:57.750
 distance from the boxer, it is still 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.640
 more important to keep the distance with it 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.199
 the horse also has the possibility 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.579
 wide to jump when the field with the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.979
 is overstrained due to a 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.070
 bad jump distance wirtz middle 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.869
 in the ox, the sacrifice of the victim hangs 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.110
 certainly with the jumping ability of the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.750
 field and the height of the victim together 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.970
 the higher the steer is the wider 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.790
 the more momentum development needs 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.250
 Of course, the more basic pace and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.380
 Amok silky usually when he is high 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.360
 and wide is a bit closer than on 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.680
 the stall jump then that will be missing 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.180
 even the long jump can 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.369
 especially in this recording becomes clear 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.780
 how important is the rhythmic uniformity 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.299
 ride up for the faultless 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.070
 overcome an obstacle is the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.200
 Young rider manages the horse 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.119
 to give confidence that they are the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.250
 correct the lok to the point of departure 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.930
 Keeps relieved here, too 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.409
 rod on the ground the horse the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.409
 jump 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.670
 okay, there are caves and classes exactly 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.310
 like the steep jump sg spring with 80 to 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.890
 90 cm going on and certainly ends in 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.240
 3-star if it maybe even 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.700
 internationally there are even four or 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.430
 five stars at about 1 meter 60 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.640
 and then the horses will have a lot 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.500
 demands optical difficulties such as 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.390
 for example planks or built 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.150
 should be in the further training with 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.130
 what was recorded at the tournament 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.230
 Duty is already here in the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.000
 training also we have in the oxer 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.250
 Rear bars safety pads 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.470
 that means when the horse is a little harder 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.510
 gets on the pole releases the pad 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.680
 go up and down the pole 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.020
 falls downwards 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.430
 that has the advantage that if horses 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.350
 strong on the place on the rear axle 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.780
 pole does not jump that pole 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.190
 Do not go along with the horse if it is 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.690
 to a mistake but the rod comes 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.250
 simple down there since then 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.350
 There are not that many anymore 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.580
 accidents and not so many 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.580
 broken broken rods
