this next video shows the final rear-end
mock-up<00:00:13.889> basically<00:00:14.370> have<00:00:14.490> all<00:00:14.519> my<00:00:14.820> parts<00:00:15.509> on

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
mock-up basically have all my parts on

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.620 
mock-up basically have all my parts on
the<00:00:16.080> engine<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.880> could<00:00:18.060> see<00:00:18.210> where<00:00:18.420> my

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the engine so that I could see where my

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.380 
the engine so that I could see where my
build<00:00:18.840> area<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.189> show<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.730> said<00:00:21.270> where

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
build area is and I show I said where

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.349 
build area is and I show I said where
all<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> motor<00:00:21.810> mounts<00:00:22.140> are<00:00:23.029> ain't<00:00:24.029> been

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
all the motor mounts are ain't been

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.859 
all the motor mounts are ain't been
working<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.960> last<00:00:25.140> couple<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.980> days<00:00:26.869> to

got it on more permanent supports got

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.650 
got it on more permanent supports got
everything<00:00:38.579> mounted<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> motor<00:00:39.450> that's

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
everything mounted to the motor that's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.440 
everything mounted to the motor that's
pretty<00:00:40.170> much<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.590> mount<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.070> motor

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
pretty much going to mount to the motor

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.970 
pretty much going to mount to the motor
as<00:00:42.450> far<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.899> where<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.290> gonna<00:00:43.469> sit<00:00:43.829> inside

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
as far as where it's gonna sit inside

compressor bolted on my alternator needs
to<00:00:54.840> go<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.410> still<00:00:55.710> waiting<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
to go on I'm still waiting for a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.680 
to go on I'm still waiting for a
alternator<00:00:58.020> bracket<00:00:58.320> bushing<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.690> you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
alternator bracket bushing for that you

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
alternator bracket bushing for that you
can<00:01:00.809> see<00:01:01.050> I've<00:01:01.230> got<00:01:01.440> straight<00:01:02.010> through<00:01:02.280> pipes

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
can see I've got straight through pipes

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.690 
can see I've got straight through pipes
on<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.120> I'm<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:04.040> attempt<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> use<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
on this I'm going to attempt to use the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.140 
on this I'm going to attempt to use the
electric<00:01:06.210> turbo<00:01:06.689> which<00:01:07.260> gives<00:01:07.530> me<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
electric turbo which gives me the

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
electric turbo which gives me the
ability<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.510> run<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.080> straight<00:01:10.350> down<00:01:10.590> pipe

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
ability to run just a straight down pipe

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.090 
ability to run just a straight down pipe
out<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> back<00:01:12.380> which<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.530> good<00:01:13.680> I'll<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:13.860> no

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
out the back which is good I'll have no

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.480 
out the back which is good I'll have no
back<00:01:14.280> pressure<00:01:15.830> I've<00:01:16.830> got<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> starter

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
back pressure I've got the starter

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the transmission this is a motor mounts

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.399 
the transmission this is a motor mounts
these<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:47.790> all<00:01:47.909> motor<00:01:48.119> mounts<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
these are all motor mounts that's the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.679 
these are all motor mounts that's the
rear<00:01:49.590> motor<00:01:49.770> mount<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.729> attaches<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.509> the

rear motor mount it it attaches to the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.870 
rear motor mount it it attaches to the
rear<00:01:51.899> crossmember

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.660 

which<00:01:56.869> attaches<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.409> all<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:58.009> suspension

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
which attaches to all the suspension

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.440 
which attaches to all the suspension
components<00:01:58.970> underneath<00:02:00.070> all<00:02:01.070> of<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.549> control

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
components underneath all of the control

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:19.619 
components underneath all of the control
arms<00:02:02.900> linkages

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.929 

still<00:02:20.200> made<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.530> tweak<00:02:20.799> it<00:02:20.950> just<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.459> hair<00:02:21.489> here

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
still made it tweak it just a hair here

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.280 
still made it tweak it just a hair here
and<00:02:22.000> there<00:02:22.299> I<00:02:22.569> have<00:02:23.409> to<00:02:23.590> support<00:02:24.099> these<00:02:24.340> struts

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
and there I have to support these struts

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.399 
and there I have to support these struts
perfectly<00:02:26.290> straight<00:02:26.590> up<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.860> down<00:02:27.040> right<00:02:27.849> now

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
perfectly straight up and down right now

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.800 
perfectly straight up and down right now
they<00:02:29.409> move<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.920> little<00:02:30.099> bit<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.390> need<00:02:31.599> to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
they move a little bit so I need to

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.100 
they move a little bit so I need to
support<00:02:32.319> those<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.829> get<00:02:32.980> those<00:02:33.159> in<00:02:33.370> a

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
support those and get those in a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.600 
support those and get those in a
supported<00:02:35.110> position<00:02:35.319> in<00:02:35.739> order<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.040> make<00:02:36.579> sure

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
supported position in order to make sure

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.289 
supported position in order to make sure
the<00:02:36.879> framework<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:38.230> in<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.500> right<00:02:38.650> place<00:02:42.299> but

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
the framework is in the right place but

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.750 
the framework is in the right place but
so<00:02:43.480> far<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:43.959> good<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:45.250> next<00:02:45.370> thing<00:02:45.609> I'll<00:02:45.730> be

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
so far so good the next thing I'll be

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.530 
so far so good the next thing I'll be
doing<00:02:46.180> really<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:47.970> tie<00:02:48.970> these<00:02:49.030> front

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
doing really is to tie these front

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.479 
doing really is to tie these front
struts<00:02:49.840> down<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.230> remove<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.680> steel<00:02:51.280> bar

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
struts down and remove that steel bar

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.210 
struts down and remove that steel bar
between<00:02:52.329> us<00:02:52.690> at<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.319> bottom<00:02:53.620> in<00:02:53.769> between<00:02:54.099> them

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
between us at the bottom in between them

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.940 
between us at the bottom in between them
in<00:02:55.209> order<00:02:55.299> to<00:02:55.480> lay<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.720> frame<00:02:56.109> in<00:02:56.290> there<00:02:56.409> find

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
in order to lay the frame in there find

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.119 
in order to lay the frame in there find
