00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
10.1 which is just in wheels so first of

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.570 
10.1 which is just in wheels so first of
all<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.810> start<00:00:07.200> off<00:00:07.350> with<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.710> display<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.309> as

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
all I start off with the display so as

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.000 
all I start off with the display so as
the<00:00:09.000> name<00:00:09.150> suggests<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.690> tablet<00:00:10.019> has<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.349> 10.1

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
the name suggests the tablet has a 10.1

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.209 
the name suggests the tablet has a 10.1
inch<00:00:11.040> display<00:00:11.759> with<00:00:12.330> 1280<00:00:12.870> by<00:00:13.170> 800<00:00:13.530> pixel

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
inch display with 1280 by 800 pixel

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.090 
inch display with 1280 by 800 pixel
resolution<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:16.139> terms<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.710> pixel

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
resolution so and in terms of the pixel

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.849 
resolution so and in terms of the pixel
density<00:00:17.250> we<00:00:17.580> got<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.910> 149<00:00:18.510> PPI<00:00:18.840> not<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.650> much

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
density we got a 149 PPI not that much

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.099 
density we got a 149 PPI not that much
of<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.039> high<00:00:20.189> display<00:00:20.699> as<00:00:21.029> compared<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
of a high display as compared to the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.599 
of a high display as compared to the
previous<00:00:22.369> Galaxy<00:00:23.369> Note<00:00:23.519> 10.1<00:00:25.250> got<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.460> pro

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
previous Galaxy Note 10.1 got a pro

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.660 
previous Galaxy Note 10.1 got a pro
temper<00:00:26.910> 1<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:28.199> actually<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.980> it's<00:00:29.369> not<00:00:29.519> at

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
temper 1 so it's actually is it's not at

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.170 
temper 1 so it's actually is it's not at
a<00:00:29.789> pro<00:00:30.269> its<00:00:30.630> tab<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.650> new<00:00:31.769> series<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
a pro its tab for the new series so and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700 
a pro its tab for the new series so and
also<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.600> terms<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.930> software<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.469> had<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
also in terms of software we had the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.360 
also in terms of software we had the

305 GPU which is which is you know

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.789 
305 GPU which is which is you know
mediocre<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.920> too<00:01:14.220> great<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.729> not<00:01:15.030> too

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
mediocre or not a too great and not too

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.280 
mediocre or not a too great and not too
not<00:01:16.799> too<00:01:17.070> bad<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.210> terms<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.869> ram<00:01:19.080> we

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
not too bad so in terms of the ram we

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.980 
not too bad so in terms of the ram we
have<00:01:19.530> 1.5<00:01:20.040> gigabyte<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.790> ram<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.240> at<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
have 1.5 gigabyte of ram and at the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.450 
have 1.5 gigabyte of ram and at the
built-in<00:01:22.290> storage<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.770> 16<00:01:23.070> gigabyte<00:01:23.430> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
built-in storage is 16 gigabyte and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.700 
built-in storage is 16 gigabyte and
which<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.150> from<00:01:24.570> which<00:01:24.780> 12<00:01:25.140> gigabyte<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
which is from which 12 gigabyte is

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.880 
which is from which 12 gigabyte is
available<00:01:26.130> for<00:01:26.369> user<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.590> storage

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
available for user and the storage

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
available for user and the storage
expansion<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.729> done<00:01:30.000> via<00:01:30.240> microsd<00:01:31.020> slot

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
expansion can be done via microsd slot

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410 
expansion can be done via microsd slot
in<00:01:31.829> terms<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.340> battery<00:01:32.520> capacity<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
in terms of battery capacity we get a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.090 
in terms of battery capacity we get a
six<00:01:33.750> thousand<00:01:34.200> eight<00:01:34.380> hundred<00:01:34.530> million<00:01:34.799> power

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
six thousand eight hundred million power

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.480 
six thousand eight hundred million power
battery<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:36.470> also<00:01:37.470> which<00:01:37.680> will<00:01:38.009> gonna<00:01:38.220> keep

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
battery and also which will gonna keep

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.660 
battery and also which will gonna keep
this<00:01:38.729> at<00:01:39.090> tab<00:01:39.630> will<00:01:40.560> keep<00:01:40.770> keep<00:01:41.189> growing

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this at tab will keep keep growing

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.800 
this at tab will keep keep growing
because<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:43.350> display<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.880> very<00:01:45.210> high-end

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
because the display is not very high-end

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.670 
because the display is not very high-end
and<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.820> not<00:01:48.600> very<00:01:48.810> high-end<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.530> as

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
and so as it is not very high-end so as

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.370 
and so as it is not very high-end so as
the<00:01:49.799> processor<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.659> but<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> battery<00:01:52.170> life

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the processor so but the battery life

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.069 
the processor so but the battery life
but<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> battery<00:01:53.430> capacity<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:54.030> great<00:01:54.360> bigger

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
but the battery capacity is great bigger

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.380 
but the battery capacity is great bigger
battery<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.490> would<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.759> less<00:01:56.939> resolution

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
battery and it would be less resolution

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660 
battery and it would be less resolution
and<00:01:57.840> less<00:01:58.079> clock<00:01:58.469> speed<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:58.890> processor<00:01:59.460> we're

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and less clock speed or processor we're

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.660 
and less clock speed or processor we're
