00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
much better for the Super Nintendo

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.210 
much better for the Super Nintendo
version<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.420> controls<00:03:44.810> aren't<00:03:45.110> as<00:03:45.260> great<00:03:45.410> but

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
too long to do missions in that game

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.860 
too long to do missions in that game
while<00:03:55.849> waiting<00:03:56.150> around<00:03:56.240> waiting<00:03:56.690> for<00:03:56.720> the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
while waiting around waiting for the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.220 
while waiting around waiting for the
kill

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
kill

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.140 
kill
so<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:58.069> know<00:03:58.160> this<00:03:58.370> is<00:03:58.490> gonna<00:03:58.610> be<00:03:58.760> much<00:03:58.849> more

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
so you know this is gonna be much more

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.319 
so you know this is gonna be much more
time-efficient<00:03:59.750> for<00:03:59.900> me<00:04:00.019> uh<00:04:00.290> uh<00:04:00.829> and<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:02.060> think

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
time-efficient for me uh uh and I think

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.399 
time-efficient for me uh uh and I think
this<00:04:02.420> is<00:04:02.540> generally<00:04:02.689> gonna<00:04:03.019> be<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.170> better

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
this is generally gonna be a better
