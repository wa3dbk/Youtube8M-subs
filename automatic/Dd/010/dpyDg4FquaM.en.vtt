this<00:00:45.750> project<00:00:46.620> showed<00:00:46.890> up<00:00:47.510> it's<00:00:48.510> really<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
this project showed up it's really a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.760 
this project showed up it's really a
real<00:00:49.920> nice<00:00:50.190> car<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:51.539> some<00:00:51.840> rust<00:00:52.469> issues

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
real nice car it's got some rust issues

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.270 
real nice car it's got some rust issues
but<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:54.149> fortunate<00:00:54.960> thing<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.829> nobody's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
but the fortunate thing is that nobody's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.080 
but the fortunate thing is that nobody's
worked<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.289> which<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.590> twice<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.550> hard<00:00:59.910> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
worked on it which is twice as hard to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.840 
worked on it which is twice as hard to
fix<00:01:00.359> when<00:01:00.780> bad<00:01:01.260> workmanship<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.160> done<00:01:02.430> then

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
fix when bad workmanship is done then

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.840 
fix when bad workmanship is done then
then<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.690> fixing<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> original<00:01:04.850> corrosion

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
then just fixing the original corrosion

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.990 
then just fixing the original corrosion
damage<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:07.229> floor<00:01:07.530> isn't<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.100> bad<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.729> it's

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
damage the floor isn't that bad is it's

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.469 
damage the floor isn't that bad is it's
rust<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.689> localized<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:11.310> mainly<00:01:11.939> around<00:01:12.210> these

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
rust is localized to mainly around these

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.340 
rust is localized to mainly around these
wheel<00:01:12.780> wells<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> we're<00:01:15.060> making<00:01:15.509> pieces<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
wheel wells so we're making pieces and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.070 
wheel wells so we're making pieces and
butt<00:01:16.650> welding<00:01:17.070> them<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.460> butt<00:01:18.299> welding<00:01:18.750> is

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
butt welding them in butt welding is

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.050 
butt welding them in butt welding is
where<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> two<00:01:19.770> edges<00:01:20.159> line<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.400> rather<00:01:20.939> than

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
where the two edges line up rather than

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.780 
where the two edges line up rather than
overlap<00:01:21.600> each<00:01:21.630> other<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> then<00:01:23.340> after<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
overlap each other so then after the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.640 
overlap each other so then after the
repair<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.240> done<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.780> can't<00:01:25.049> tell<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
repair is done you can't tell that it

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.580 
repair is done you can't tell that it
was<00:01:25.710> repaired<00:01:26.280> from<00:01:26.490> either<00:01:26.640> side

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.380 

so<00:01:34.590> everywhere<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.340> little<00:01:35.670> circles<00:01:36.180> are

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
so everywhere you see little circles are

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.900 
so everywhere you see little circles are
going<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.320> guess<00:01:37.590> you'd<00:01:38.010> call<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.250> slight

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
going to be I guess you'd call it slight

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.330 
going to be I guess you'd call it slight
customizing<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.560> holes<00:01:40.770> are<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.190> be

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
customizing the holes are going to be

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.850 
customizing the holes are going to be
filled<00:01:41.670> again<00:01:41.970> we'll<00:01:42.750> cut<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:43.230> patches

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
filled again we'll cut little patches

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.830 
filled again we'll cut little patches
and<00:01:44.130> butt<00:01:44.340> weld<00:01:44.550> them<00:01:44.760> in<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.390> when<00:01:45.720> you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and butt weld them in so that when you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.320 
and butt weld them in so that when you
look<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> inside<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:47.670> won't<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
look on the inside you won't see the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.010 
look on the inside you won't see the
repair<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.530> only<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:50.040> aesthetics<00:01:50.670> it's

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
repair it's not only for aesthetics it's

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.450 
repair it's not only for aesthetics it's
the<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.230> way<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.920> because<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.340> you

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
the right way to do it because then you

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.690 
the right way to do it because then you
can<00:01:53.640> hammer<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.120> Dolly<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.690> weld<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
can hammer and Dolly the weld and and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.370 
can hammer and Dolly the weld and and
get<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> metal<00:01:57.060> back<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.480> flat<00:01:57.750> whereas<00:01:58.230> if

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
get the metal back to flat whereas if

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.220 
get the metal back to flat whereas if
you<00:01:58.500> laid<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> piece<00:01:59.130> underneath<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.810> couldn't

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
you laid a piece underneath you couldn't

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.510 
you laid a piece underneath you couldn't
hammer<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> Dolly<00:02:01.830> because<00:02:02.220> you're<00:02:02.370> hitting

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
hammer and Dolly because you're hitting

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.180 
hammer and Dolly because you're hitting
to<00:02:02.790> thickness<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> metal<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.110> all<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:05.010> do

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
to thickness is a metal and all you do

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.020 
to thickness is a metal and all you do
is<00:02:05.220> basically<00:02:06.120> create<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> mess<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.700> see

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
is basically create a mess you can see

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.350 
is basically create a mess you can see
in<00:02:09.240> this<00:02:09.929> panel<00:02:10.679> here<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:11.310> spot<00:02:11.730> welded<00:02:12.180> in

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
in this panel here it's spot welded in

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.280 
in this panel here it's spot welded in
and<00:02:13.640> we'll<00:02:14.640> drill<00:02:14.970> out<00:02:15.120> all<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.510> spot<00:02:15.780> welds

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and we'll drill out all the spot welds

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.430 
and we'll drill out all the spot welds
and<00:02:16.500> fix<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:17.160> any<00:02:17.790> rust<00:02:18.240> underneath<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.020> panel

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
and fix up any rust underneath the panel

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.370 
and fix up any rust underneath the panel
like<00:02:19.650> what<00:02:19.890> I'm<00:02:20.010> pointing<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.580> here<00:02:21.380> before

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
like what I'm pointing to here before

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.620 
like what I'm pointing to here before
the<00:02:22.500> new<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.680> goes<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:24.120> it'll<00:02:24.360> get

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
Reese pot welded in place and we usually

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.930 
Reese pot welded in place and we usually
put<00:02:28.350> some<00:02:28.590> primer<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.160> between<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.730> metal

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
put some primer in between the metal

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.510 
put some primer in between the metal
except<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.140> exact<00:02:31.680> place<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:32.370> going

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
except the exact place that it's going

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.470 
except the exact place that it's going
to<00:02:32.580> be<00:02:32.760> welded<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.600> way<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:35.250> won't<00:02:35.550> rust

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
to be welded and that way it won't rust

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.970 
to be welded and that way it won't rust
in<00:02:36.720> our<00:02:36.840> lifetime<00:02:37.320> again<00:02:37.670> this<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.000> grill

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
in our lifetime again this the grill

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.699 
in our lifetime again this the grill
it's<00:02:40.980> really<00:02:41.310> pretty<00:02:41.430> good<00:02:41.880> but<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.470> see

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
it's really pretty good but you can see

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.210 
it's really pretty good but you can see
here<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.190> got<00:02:44.400> some<00:02:44.640> rust<00:02:44.880> will<00:02:46.220> probably

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
here it's got some rust will probably

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.400 
here it's got some rust will probably
make<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.459> little<00:02:47.790> piece<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.000> metal<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.989> replace

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
make a little piece of metal to replace

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.509 
make a little piece of metal to replace
it<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.940> weld<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.530> but<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.650> general<00:02:52.920> except

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
it and weld it in but in general except

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.780 
it and weld it in but in general except
for<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.660> rust<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> very<00:02:56.160> straight

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790

cards back here to this door and then it

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.410 
cards back here to this door and then it
probably<00:03:00.840> got<00:03:01.709> kinked<00:03:02.400> at<00:03:02.550> one<00:03:02.730> time<00:03:03.030> and

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
probably got kinked at one time and

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.900 
probably got kinked at one time and
hammered<00:03:04.170> back<00:03:04.410> out<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.130> see<00:03:05.340> here<00:03:05.610> it's

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
hammered back out and you see here it's

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.030 
hammered back out and you see here it's
still<00:03:06.180> wrinkled<00:03:06.600> up<00:03:06.780> that's<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.380> perfect<00:03:07.830> use

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
still wrinkled up that's a perfect use

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.699 
still wrinkled up that's a perfect use

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
little uneven we'll have to build that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.600 
little uneven we'll have to build that
back<00:03:12.959> with<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.320> weld<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.950> then<00:03:14.100> grind<00:03:14.430> it

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
back with a weld and then grind it

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.780 
back with a weld and then grind it
straight<00:03:15.140> because<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.260> don't<00:03:16.470> want<00:03:16.560> any<00:03:17.489> kind

straight because you don't want any kind
