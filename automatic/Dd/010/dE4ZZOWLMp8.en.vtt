progress in one week I really find that
my<00:03:06.870> strengths<00:03:07.410> days<00:03:07.910> increase<00:03:08.910> my

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
my strengths days increase my

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.670 
my strengths days increase my
hypertrophy<00:03:10.860> work<00:03:11.930> my<00:03:12.930> working<00:03:13.230> sets<00:03:13.440> on<00:03:13.590> my

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
hypertrophy work my working sets on my

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.880 
hypertrophy work my working sets on my
hyper<00:03:13.920> hypertrophy<00:03:14.700> days<00:03:15.260> extremely<00:03:16.260> well<00:03:16.470> so

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
hyper hypertrophy days extremely well so

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.650 
hyper hypertrophy days extremely well so
I<00:03:16.920> like<00:03:17.489> this<00:03:17.640> program<00:03:18.030> John's<00:03:18.299> got<00:03:18.510> me<00:03:18.630> on

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
I like this program John's got me on

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.680 
I like this program John's got me on
seems<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.560> be<00:03:19.650> working<00:03:19.739> pretty<00:03:19.950> well<00:03:20.690> let's

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
seems to be working pretty well let's

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.479 
seems to be working pretty well let's
see<00:03:21.870> what<00:03:22.019> else<00:03:22.079> um<00:03:25.010> felt<00:03:26.010> like<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.190> wanted<00:03:26.280> to

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
see what else um felt like I wanted to

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.020 
see what else um felt like I wanted to
say<00:03:26.640> something<00:03:27.060> else<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:27.480> can't<00:03:27.690> remember<00:03:27.930> I

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
say something else I can't remember I

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.509 
say something else I can't remember I
guess<00:03:30.030> that's<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.420> size<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.290> going<00:03:31.560> up<00:03:31.739> back

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
guess that's it size is going up back

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.640 
guess that's it size is going up back
staying<00:03:32.970> lean<00:03:33.150> or<00:03:33.420> I'm<00:03:33.570> staying<00:03:33.959> fairly<00:03:34.260> lean

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
staying lean or I'm staying fairly lean

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.300 
staying lean or I'm staying fairly lean
my<00:03:35.640> strength<00:03:36.030> is<00:03:36.150> going<00:03:36.420> up<00:03:37.040> that's<00:03:38.040> really

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
my strength is going up that's really

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.979 
my strength is going up that's really
