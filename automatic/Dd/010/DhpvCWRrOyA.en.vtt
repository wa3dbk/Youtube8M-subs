blood<00:00:29.260> that's<00:00:29.770> right<00:00:30.190> every<00:00:30.790> painting<00:00:31.120> is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
blood that's right every painting is

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.970 
blood that's right every painting is
essentially<00:00:32.260> a<00:00:32.290> part<00:00:32.619> of<00:00:32.710> me<00:00:32.890> and<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:34.980> really

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
essentially a part of me and I really

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.940 
essentially a part of me and I really
sought<00:00:36.430> to<00:00:36.820> have<00:00:37.750> that<00:00:37.989> connection<00:00:38.260> with<00:00:38.800> the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
sought to have that connection with the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.470 
sought to have that connection with the
work<00:00:39.130> beforehand<00:00:39.790> i've<00:00:39.910> been<00:00:40.090> working<00:00:40.420> in

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
work beforehand i've been working in

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.869 
work beforehand i've been working in
traditional<00:00:41.050> media<00:00:41.380> and<00:00:41.680> didn't<00:00:42.280> feel<00:00:42.460> like<00:00:42.489> I

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
traditional media and didn't feel like I

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.510 
traditional media and didn't feel like I
was<00:00:42.970> really<00:00:43.629> connecting<00:00:44.200> on<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:45.160> deepest

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
was really connecting on the deepest

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.640 
was really connecting on the deepest
level<00:00:45.879> possible<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.960> when<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.200> started

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
level possible and when I started

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.979 
level possible and when I started
working<00:00:47.710> in<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:48.280> end<00:00:48.550> blood<00:00:48.989> experimentally

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
working in the end blood experimentally

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.069 
working in the end blood experimentally
I<00:00:50.590> felt<00:00:51.160> like<00:00:51.280> I<00:00:51.400> was<00:00:51.580> on<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:52.240> it<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.600> then

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
I felt like I was on to it and then

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.350 
I felt like I was on to it and then
started<00:00:53.650> using<00:00:53.829> it<00:00:54.040> exclusively<00:00:54.340> you<00:00:55.240> know

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
started using it exclusively you know

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.210 
started using it exclusively you know
the<00:00:55.480> work<00:00:55.660> just<00:00:55.900> took<00:00:56.050> off<00:00:56.320> was<00:00:56.710> there<00:00:56.980> that<00:00:57.160> I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
the work just took off was there that I

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.180 
the work just took off was there that I
really<00:00:57.610> felt<00:00:57.940> like<00:00:58.150> what<00:00:58.900> I<00:00:59.200> was<00:00:59.620> doing<00:01:00.040> was

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
really felt like what I was doing was

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.770 
really felt like what I was doing was
accurately<00:01:00.670> communicating<00:01:01.480> what<00:01:01.600> was

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
accurately communicating what was

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.660 
accurately communicating what was
happening<00:01:02.230> inside<00:01:02.380> what's<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.400> actual

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
happening inside what's the actual

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.060 
happening inside what's the actual
process<00:01:04.000> of<00:01:04.360> extracting<00:01:05.080> your<00:01:05.500> blood<00:01:05.770> for<00:01:05.979> the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
process of extracting your blood for the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.060 
process of extracting your blood for the
paintings<00:01:06.490> it's<00:01:07.030> similar<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.830> giving<00:01:08.830> blood

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
paintings it's similar to giving blood

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.920 
paintings it's similar to giving blood
if<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.610> were<00:01:09.729> to<00:01:09.850> take<00:01:10.000> a<00:01:10.060> blood<00:01:10.300> test<00:01:10.360> the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
if you were to take a blood test the

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.960 
if you were to take a blood test the
blood<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.229> collected<00:01:11.350> into<00:01:11.800> tubes<00:01:12.160> and<00:01:12.640> those

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
blood is collected into tubes and those

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.420 
blood is collected into tubes and those
tubes<00:01:13.210> are<00:01:13.450> stored<00:01:13.750> it<00:01:14.320> all<00:01:14.440> yourself<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:15.100> do

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
tubes are stored it all yourself I do

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.490 
tubes are stored it all yourself I do
not<00:01:15.880> collect<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.270> blood<00:01:16.479> myself<00:01:16.990> because<00:01:17.350> it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
not collect the blood myself because it

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.980 
not collect the blood myself because it
becomes<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.360> complicated<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:19.600> really<00:01:19.840> need

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
becomes a complicated you really need

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.980 
becomes a complicated you really need
other<00:01:20.170> hands<00:01:20.590> for<00:01:20.800> it<00:01:20.950> never<00:01:21.550> got<00:01:21.700> messy<00:01:21.990> it

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
other hands for it never got messy it

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.899 
other hands for it never got messy it
could<00:01:23.229> I'd<00:01:23.649> imagine<00:01:24.159> that<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.340> painting<00:01:24.880> like

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
could I'd imagine that a painting like

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.780 
could I'd imagine that a painting like
this<00:01:25.180> would<00:01:25.990> take<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.500> lot<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.830> blood<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.610> more

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
this would take a lot of blood the more

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.760 
this would take a lot of blood the more
saturated<00:01:28.360> it<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.960> more<00:01:29.140> layers<00:01:29.380> I'm

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
saturated it is the more layers I'm

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.800 
saturated it is the more layers I'm
putting<00:01:30.130> on<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.430> painting<00:01:30.850> obviously<00:01:31.690> the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
putting on the painting obviously the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.890 
putting on the painting obviously the
more<00:01:31.990> blood<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.650> more<00:01:32.860> opaque<00:01:33.310> I<00:01:33.580> work<00:01:33.940> the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
more blood the more opaque I work the

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.690 
more blood the more opaque I work the
more<00:01:34.930> blood<00:01:35.380> I<00:01:35.710> couldn't<00:01:36.280> give<00:01:36.430> an<00:01:36.549> accurate

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
more blood I couldn't give an accurate

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.020 
more blood I couldn't give an accurate
you<00:01:37.540> know<00:01:37.630> guess<00:01:38.110> in<00:01:38.350> terms<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.799> ounces<00:01:39.369> or

you know guess in terms of ounces or
pints<00:01:40.450> or<00:01:40.540> anything<00:01:40.900> like<00:01:40.930> that<00:01:41.080> but<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.590> can

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
pints or anything like that but I can

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.640 
pints or anything like that but I can
collect<00:01:42.270> 15<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:44.140> 30<00:01:44.440> tubes<00:01:45.150> at<00:01:46.150> ago<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:46.780> I'll

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
collect 15 to 30 tubes at ago and I'll

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.140 
collect 15 to 30 tubes at ago and I'll
work<00:01:47.860> with<00:01:48.010> that<00:01:48.159> for<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.400> certain<00:01:48.700> period<00:01:48.909> of

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
work with that for a certain period of

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.480 
work with that for a certain period of
time<00:01:49.210> I<00:01:49.659> actually<00:01:50.200> really<00:01:50.920> appreciate<00:01:51.460> that
