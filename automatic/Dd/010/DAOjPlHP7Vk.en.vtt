00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello friends how much time has passed no 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.400
 I know but it has been a lot but in 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.889
 my previous video I proposed that they chose 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.440
 if first the creepy pastas or the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.780
 second part of my arrival but almost not 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.420
 I have had answers but I want 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.449
 know that the second part is already ready 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.300
 Well, not so smart, I still need to cheer her up 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.760
 and pass it to tex alone but the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.880
 I leave with this creepy pasta titled 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.759
 always by your side because they run away from me 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.210
 because they call me a monster, it's not my 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.000
 I intend to hurt them when I approach 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.180
 they fall asleep and seem to suffer 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.820
 when this happens and people close to me 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.730
 shout away from the monster and I 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.879
 attack with their pokemon I have no more 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.640
 that fled the place one day when drinking water 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.730
 from a small river of my reflections it 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.430
 opened a portal idl came out a pokemon me 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.180
 he said it was called tour tina and that I 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.540
 It was a pokemon made of the grudge of the bear 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.660
 if the pokemon and that's why nobody 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.350
 was approaching due to my appearance and it was not 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.540
 I believed what he told me and I followed 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.790
 trying to approach people one day 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.729
 in a small park in which 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.250
 they inhabited several types of pokemon 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.220
 I found a girl with them and I 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.290
 I walked slowly toward them 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.740
 pokemon that were with her I 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.680
 they started attacking the girl tried them 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.590
 stop putting in front of me but 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.350
 they had already launched their attacks and not 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.229
 they could do anything so that I could face 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.050
 her and use pulse a shine to stop 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.229
 the attacks caused a big bang 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.229
 but nothing happened to him the child she me 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.930
 he smiled and said thank you later he gave me 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.020
 a hug I felt happy in that 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.930
 instant and I was wondering why it did not fall 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.080
 asleep at the moment of hugging me 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.600
 plucked a leaf from a tree and started 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.149
 play a very beautiful melody 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.480
 all the pokemon that were with her 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.360
 they lay down on the grass and will sleep 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.150
 I stood at the tip of that tree 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.700
 listening to the melody played to 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.640
 dusk went but before it was 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.330
 I was told hope to see you again 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.000
 By the way, they call me since then 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.580
 I stayed in that park as his 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.700
 protector and always went to 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.130
 dusk one day followed alice until her 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.190
 house she had to go through a 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.459
 cliff suddenly there was a landslide 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.220
 I did not think twice and I took it between 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.769
 my arms taking the dea and I took her 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.010
 up to his house and with tears in his eyes 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:55.340
 as long ago I hugged and touched the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.950
 melody that I like so much and I left a 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.980
 day Alice was not the park at the time 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.590
 that always came I flew as high as 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.470
 I could and a big cloud of smoke came out more 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.560
 ahead of where the cliff was by 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.050
 what happened to Alice I went 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.050
 faster than I could and when I got to the place 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.690
 there were several people in suits 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.050
 different in battle along with their 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.290
 pokemon and one of those battles caused a 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.900
 great explosion which caused the house 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.840
 of alice will collapse on her and her 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.750
 family for the first time experience the 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.450
 feeling of sadness and within 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.170
 I felt a huge pain in my face 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.810
 tears were flowing I could not stand that 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.540
 alice died she was the only one who 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.049
 accepted as I am but I can no longer 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.170

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.870

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.900
 make you suffer eternally in your dreams 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.660
 I'm going to make them die slowly but not 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.090
 I'm going to let you suffer so much time 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.430
 because I'm going to tear them all 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.340
 including his pokemon with his 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.420
 despicable blood if they themselves 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.530
 they can do 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.500
 use black gap against them 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.560
 they fell asleep and they will all fall in 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.620
 horrible nightmares but I just left 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.710
 income to your pokemon use hypnosis with 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.110
 their pokemon ordering them to kill 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.750
 his coaches and the last one that 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.780

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.570

 all the floor and I with a pain in the 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.350
 soul by alice suddenly everything was put 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.360
 dark and the bodies shattered 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.910
 small fireballs also came out 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.490
 what he was left of the house of alice 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.520
 they came out three balls of fire and one 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.310
 portal as a long time ago it went tour tina 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.790
 I asked him what these balls of 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.430
 fire and told me these are the souls of 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.010
 the corrupt and greedy humans that 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.499
 as god of death I will take them to me 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.080
 hell so they have 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:13.020

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.139
 pain and its but before you go 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.990

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.930
 promoter bruce alice I want you to know 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.689
 that I will always think of you and would like 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.960
 one last time I played sessa melody 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:31.050
 What I like to give so much that I'll never be 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.409
 away from you always until you see your heart 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.439
 and mind and the last thing I heard was the 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:40.080
 melody after that everything came back to the 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:43.259
 normality and there was nothing nor the 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.659
 bodies were only heard the 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.659
 Alice's melody in the whole forest
