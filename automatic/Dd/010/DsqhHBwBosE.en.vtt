00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.300 
think like the last time I was on there
I<00:01:32.810> remembered<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:34.799> sheet<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.100 
I remembered the just one sheet of it
was<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.700> somewhere<00:01:36.479> between<00:01:36.659> two<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> three

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
was like somewhere between two to three

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.080 
was like somewhere between two to three
dollars<00:01:37.590> i<00:01:37.740> think<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.310> full<00:01:38.820> my<00:01:38.909> greatness

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
dollars i think for full my greatness

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.149 
dollars i think for full my greatness
but<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.780> mean<00:01:39.960> he<00:01:40.049> was<00:01:40.200> worth<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.890> really

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
but I mean he was worth it was really

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
the best way I can describe it is a

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.569 
the best way I can describe it is a
mixture<00:02:31.159> between<00:02:32.019> really<00:02:33.019> worn<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:33.500> FBS<00:02:34.040> extra

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
mixture between really worn in FBS extra

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.430 
mixture between really worn in FBS extra
smooth<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:37.150> foamy<00:02:38.150> greatness<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.750> both

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
smooth and foamy greatness and both

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.080 
smooth and foamy greatness and both
those<00:02:39.650> are<00:02:39.890> amazing<00:02:40.250> tapes<00:02:40.730> from<00:02:41.000> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
those are amazing tapes from the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.569 
those are amazing tapes from the
greatness<00:02:41.359> and<00:02:41.569> FBS<00:02:41.930> extra<00:02:42.290> smooth<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.129> the

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
greatness and FBS extra smooth so the

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:44.860 
greatness and FBS extra smooth so the
fact<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.879> this<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.090> kind<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.540> right<00:02:44.689> in<00:02:44.720> the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
fact that this is kind of right in the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.869 
fact that this is kind of right in the
middle<00:02:45.049> it's<00:02:45.590> honestly<00:02:46.010> like<00:02:46.190> perfect<00:02:46.700> like

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
middle it's honestly like perfect like

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.670 
middle it's honestly like perfect like
it's<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.750> little<00:02:47.870> thinner<00:02:48.260> than<00:02:48.470> foamy

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
it's a little thinner than foamy

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.259
