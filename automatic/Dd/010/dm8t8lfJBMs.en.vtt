right<00:03:42.950> well<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.760> remember<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.329> wrap<00:03:46.049> your

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
right well you remember the wrap your

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.259 
right well you remember the wrap your
console<00:03:46.860> in<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.130> towel<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.400> make<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:47.910> all<00:03:48.000> hot

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
console in a towel and make it all hot

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.660 
console in a towel and make it all hot
trick<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:49.320> idea<00:03:49.560> being<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.040> overheated

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
trick the idea being that you overheated

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.670 
trick the idea being that you overheated
the<00:03:50.700> system<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.390> solder<00:03:51.660> remelted<00:03:52.560> and

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
the system so the solder remelted and

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.789 
the system so the solder remelted and
formed<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.070> new<00:03:53.100> connection<00:03:53.810> that's<00:03:54.810> basically

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
formed a new connection that's basically

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.220 
formed a new connection that's basically
what<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.220> game<00:03:56.430> stopped<00:03:56.760> fix<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.360> so<00:03:58.049> it's

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
what the game stopped fix is so it's

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.110 
what the game stopped fix is so it's
very<00:03:58.590> likely<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.370> console<00:03:59.790> will<00:03:59.910> just

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
very likely that the console will just

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.860 
very likely that the console will just
fail<00:04:00.360> again

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
fail again

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.740 
fail again

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
to be fair the consoles do come with a
