the original exhaust system and did the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.219 
the original exhaust system and did the
map<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.780> conversion<00:01:05.240> conversion<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.659> ECU

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
map to conversion conversion on the ECU

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.039 
map to conversion conversion on the ECU
so<00:01:08.180> anyway<00:01:09.180> I'm<00:01:09.360> mostly<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.810> taking<00:01:09.990> this

the outside you grind that guy off that

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.280 
the outside you grind that guy off that
you<00:03:07.019> replace<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.650> inside<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.870> with<00:03:09.870> I

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
you replace the inside of it with I

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.069 
you replace the inside of it with I
believe<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.670> was<00:03:11.820> two<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.630> half<00:03:12.810> inch

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
believe that was two and a half inch

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.850 
believe that was two and a half inch
diameter<00:03:13.400> perforated<00:03:14.400> pipe<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.500> believe

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
diameter perforated pipe and I believe

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.280 
diameter perforated pipe and I believe
don't<00:03:17.730> don't<00:03:17.940> don't<00:03:18.180> quote<00:03:18.390> me<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.690> she's

don't don't don't quote me on it she's
basically<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.709> length<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.100> can<00:03:20.310> plus<00:03:20.670> of

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
basically the length of the can plus of

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.039 
basically the length of the can plus of
it<00:03:20.940> plus<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.269> little<00:03:21.510> bit<00:03:23.510> anyway<00:03:24.510> then<00:03:25.019> you

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
it plus a little bit anyway then you

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.979 
it plus a little bit anyway then you
wrap<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.590> fiberglass<00:03:26.450> exhaust<00:03:27.450> packing

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
wrap it in fiberglass exhaust packing

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.199 
wrap it in fiberglass exhaust packing
and<00:03:28.430> then<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.579> put<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.820> all<00:03:29.910> back<00:03:30.030> together

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
and then you put it all back together

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.030 
and then you put it all back together
and<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.720> rivet<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.260> bad<00:03:31.440> boy<00:03:31.620> back<00:03:31.859> together

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
and you rivet that bad boy back together

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.580 
and you rivet that bad boy back together
and<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.489> not<00:03:32.609> a<00:03:32.670> big<00:03:32.820> deal<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.290> will<00:03:34.290> tell<00:03:34.470> you

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
and it's not a big deal I will tell you

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.520 
and it's not a big deal I will tell you
it's<00:03:34.920> it's<00:03:35.130> awfully<00:03:35.489> loud<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:37.140> way<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.260> did

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
it's it's awfully loud and the way I did

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.550 
it's it's awfully loud and the way I did
it<00:03:37.650> there's<00:03:37.799> actually<00:03:39.140> you'll<00:03:40.140> never<00:03:40.350> see<00:03:40.530> it

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
it there's actually you'll never see it

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.979 
it there's actually you'll never see it
in<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.769> video<00:03:41.060> there's<00:03:42.060> actually<00:03:42.359> car<00:03:42.630> craft

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
in the video there's actually car craft

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.099 
in the video there's actually car craft
exhaust<00:03:43.680> inserts<00:03:44.250> inside<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.850> those<00:03:44.940> pipes<00:03:45.209> to

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
exhaust inserts inside of those pipes to

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.020 
exhaust inserts inside of those pipes to
help<00:03:46.290> dampen<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.859> sound<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.220> little<00:03:47.340> bit<00:03:47.579> too

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
help dampen the sound a little bit too

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.960 
help dampen the sound a little bit too
so<00:03:48.510> loud<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.769> still<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.430> pretty<00:03:50.790> loud<00:03:51.060> so

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
so loud and it still is pretty loud so

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.819 
so loud and it still is pretty loud so
anyway<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.209> have<00:03:54.600> not<00:03:54.810> gotten<00:03:55.109> myself<00:03:55.440> pulled

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
anyway I have not gotten myself pulled

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:56.539 
anyway I have not gotten myself pulled
over<00:03:56.130> yet

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
over yet

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.060 
over yet
with<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.209> being<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:57.989> loud<00:03:58.760> I<00:04:00.350> guess<00:04:01.350> nobody

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
with it being that loud I guess nobody

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.680 
with it being that loud I guess nobody
tends<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.489> bother<00:04:02.670> it's<00:04:02.940> it's<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.329> little<00:04:03.569> bit

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
tends to bother it's it's a little bit

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.349 
tends to bother it's it's a little bit
harder<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.019> outer<00:04:04.260> than<00:04:04.700> than<00:04:05.700> even<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.209> the

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
harder to outer than than even the the

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.090 
harder to outer than than even the the
Harley<00:04:06.630> Davidsons<00:04:07.109> that<00:04:07.650> have<00:04:07.799> straight

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
Harley Davidsons that have straight

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.670 
Harley Davidsons that have straight
pipes<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:09.239> it's<00:04:09.420> it's<00:04:09.959> quite<00:04:10.079> loud<00:04:10.319> but<00:04:10.590> it

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
pipes so it's it's quite loud but it

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.539 
pipes so it's it's quite loud but it
sounds<00:04:10.980> pretty<00:04:11.190> pretty<00:04:11.940> beasty<00:04:12.510> too<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.549> with

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
sounds pretty pretty beasty too and with

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.479 
sounds pretty pretty beasty too and with
the<00:04:14.729> with<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.720> map<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.109> conversion

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
the with the map to conversion

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.680 
the with the map to conversion
it's<00:04:18.489> got<00:04:18.640> its<00:04:18.760> got<00:04:18.790> a<00:04:18.910> lot<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.150> guts<00:04:19.360> I'll<00:04:19.540> tell

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
it's got its got a lot of guts I'll tell

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.800 
it's got its got a lot of guts I'll tell
