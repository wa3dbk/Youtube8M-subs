00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.910
 a 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.030
 hi to all music lovers welcome to 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.250
 this second appointment 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.940
 in the last on the first date I have you 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.700
 left with a tria construction of 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.500
 on the pentatonic and I intend to continue 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.020
 with that type of construction for 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.230
 develop it further if there is 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.480
 remember well I talked about this one 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.410
 type of construction 3 to sequence sequence 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.600
 triadica exactly what starts 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.220
 from in the meta tone of minor that 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.900
 that starts from the note of sol and that yes 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:11.070
 develops into too many soul triads 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.010
 ok now let's try to keep the same 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.760
 type of construction also on the others 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:26.540
 twenty- tone notes that before riad 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:26.540
 once the second is obtained, this will be the third 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:41.119
 fourth and fifth this type of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.500
 triadic building I go to 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:48.960
 I can always use it 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.369
 combined with the previous one 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.700
 always concerning the first lesson 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.610
 on harmony on harmony 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.020
 pentatonica ok so you remember 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.500
 this position that I can interchange 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.500
 with this 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.909
 I can always play with the triads in 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:27.790
 this way but let's see what 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:30.579
 happens if I apply these 3d not 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.859
 on the fixed bass pedal in the first 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:37.569
 lesson used a bass pedal by 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:39.280
 me ok in this lesson i'll use one 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.439
 several basic sequence one 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.919
 simple rock sequence a bass of mi 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:48.579
 low down there and see what 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.069
 It happens 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:54.959
 superimposing these 3d on these 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.959
 bass sequences 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.019
 well the sound in my opinion is a lot 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.030
 interesting is one thing one thing 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.390
 another important thing to say 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.810
 you can use these sequences of 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.810
 tria of 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.720
 no 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.510
 I repeat you can always use for 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.540
 also build your themes let's go to 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.540
 to see 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.040
 ok let's see what happens now 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.980
 overlapping another pentatonic io 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.220
 I would choose the minor pentatonic 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.530
 for what reason why the minor is 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.730
 tonic prophet built on the fifth 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:04.420
 grade of the minor fitting the yes like 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:07.980
 note appears to be the fifth of the me the 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.980
 re a seventh 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:15.370
 the fundamental mine and leaves in the 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:19.600
 a beautiful hour superimposed on a 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:24.120
 minor agreement and then the other note la 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.590
 stupendous and the eleventh with the fourth 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.890
 respect minor agreement let's go to 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.980
 see how it would sound like they would sound 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:36.280
 these triads this time built on 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.960
 pentatonic of si minor overlapping a 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:44.290
 this harmony harmony in G major 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.660
 but in sleep and their turned minor 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.310
 therefore in their on their superimposed to the 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.310
 their relative minor stops 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:26.530
 Try to mixture of both 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.530
 pentatonic 

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:08.139
 I hope the topic is yours 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:11.129
 liking 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:11.129
 see you soon. Bye
