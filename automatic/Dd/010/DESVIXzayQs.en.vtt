00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.430
 the ice delta stadium offers a 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.230
 desolate sight 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.050
 little public interest in the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.230
 overijssel derby between pec zwolle and 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.830
 fc twente women and so match 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.830
 earns more 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.449
 pec zwolle came with the ball 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.250
 wife of fc twente later and starting phase 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.359
 on top of 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:32.099
 find out about individual action 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.660
 turn back and then point 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.309
 albeit a long shot this is a nice one 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.960
 bowball 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.960
 a nice traffic jam that you already have home 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.640
 yes he is and specialists 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.129
 shoot from distance 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.920
 fc twente again the van der zanden 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.960
 when loss of possession here this is small 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.090
 braskamp 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.730
 something beautiful here in the thought the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.079
 stab of brummelen 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:07.260
 with the ferry and so does pec zwolle 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:11.140
 the chances that poorly defend from 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.190
 bulletman goalkeeper away 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.190
 and picked up by dekker 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.620
 but the pole brings salvation aside 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.210
 failing pec zwolle fc twente 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.190
 lord in most at this stage of the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.020
 but had to watch out for the 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.230
 countus 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.870
 this is good intervention from dekker ball op 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.790
 van de zande with the cross is the miss 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.650
 rene defense and this is cold-blooded 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.720
 completed by ellen jansen 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.720
 the lead for FC Twente women 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.590
 here is the miss the keeper goes the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.250
 wrong way 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 and thank you ellen jansen and all that 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.590
 light fc twente deserves 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.580
 hear pointed 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.540
 male combinations not picked up properly 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.540
 weather of the sande 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.530
 and so attacked one after the other 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.130
 the dollar of pec zwolle 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.520
 ball and the second ball again expedite 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.520
 jansen 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.690
 corner is there in linking wicher 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.120
 and then your janssen is in the right place 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.120
 from seven to a real striker 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.560
 holthuis no chance who rather long ball 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.180
 bad head is there from koreman 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.780
 immediately sought the depth 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.940
 jansen yes there is cover in the back too 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.940
 do and of course there is the penalty 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.050
 and also the yellow card for hills 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.239
 penalty kick is there for strikers there 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.090
 she didn't bother with that 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.709
 on the stroke of rest now 3 0 lead and 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:06.160
 then the competition is already in the 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:08.709
 bag but no pec in the second half 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.209
 zwolle nevertheless reimbursed in attack they were 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:17.980
 narrator and therefore get natural 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:21.220
 also some chances are put in again 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.430
 well smit h great job hand chicken sari 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.430
 from veenendaal 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.780
 again the build-up of pec zwolle beautiful 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.780
 purple from smit 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.560
 also from the paul the paul is waiting 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.939
 reinforcement that comes then it is free 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.209
 loan 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.079
 small braskamp on the force and yet it 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.390
 overview 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.230
 nice bow and great goalkeeper work 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.230
 from van veenendaal 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.030
 van de zande always fast 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.980
 see if they keep the overview 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.989
 keys with the cross 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.989
 hhc hills very well in between 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.849
 then again the forefront of the 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:19.479
 sins that you go fast only on the chicken 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.780
 staff and scores share controls the 0 against 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.780
 four 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.500
 good game from FC Twente 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.419
 vandezande yes with the blender 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.130
 And so FC Twente wins a lot 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.970
 easy from the women of pec 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.889
 zwolle 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.810
 yes it may seem like summer we had 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.910
 already found a purchase or to a dat zwolle 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.050
 then yes was at the bottom and after three 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.639
 matches you still have a little say 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.530
 so you actually just start this lesson 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.910
 and of well you know full well 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.110
 last year just at the last minute 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.060
 the bene league in the bene league b 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.800
 played so normally prepared to 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.810
 good opponent drop yes it is one 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.389
 piece death without let you point and 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.610
 lie if you're realistic confuse 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.590
 less like twente today and I am that 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.599
 400 unjustified rash is in the pair 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.889
 chances even if you ship it earlier 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.940
 which of course is much more exciting 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.990
 but yes if you are unrealistic 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.990
 yo is not going to pick him up
