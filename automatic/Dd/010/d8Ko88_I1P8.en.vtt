00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 or knows what to do and after the exchange 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.390
 nothing turns out the team is unclear 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.069
 guys now look very arcade 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.090
 good after all the experienced composition which 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.160
 must drag and 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.780
 and it's just that somewhere is unlucky somewhere 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.830
 maybe not the right decisions but still 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.100
 Not everything is lost 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.630
 10 second set but of course I need 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.060
 was taking a little bit to another team 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.519
 arcades now start looking for not 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.230
 card center hover to the liquid exchange 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.210
 he was about tanks and counter style 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.250
 just slide the slide and that's it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.140
 good 260 good have 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.410
 look beyond the arcades they had good rice 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.230
 honestly go to the center but there is no center 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.579
 the socket won't come out on the unit will 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.110
 surely will not play this carefully 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.539
 will be the standard angelkiller's sport 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.399
 morning with him will go derp monastery 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.230
 on the cover under the center of the card dream 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.480
 on by jimmy with him working side by side 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.879
 it turns out the cliff of the last map and Ira 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.579
 slept on a cliff to choose from us 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.470
 unity goes yes but no unity 1 they took 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.689
 took the first means they type take type 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.140
 the latest and conceived arcade takes the base on 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.720
 last map and everywhere my map is with us 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.280
 cliff top base will choose arcade and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.290
 maybe you can play now 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.009
 quieter further try to bring everything 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.530
 on ruinberg again but this is it 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.430
 long hacking on a cliff with a chance with 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.610
 top base there 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.070
 and if unity is taken and goes on the attack 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.829
 which they all feel perfectly well 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.689
 if unity is stronger there than there 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.240
 in general, then you need to train and sit 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.560
 in the training room 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.210
 this house well, what do they see 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.290
 happy of teeth arcade they repeat 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.020
 a I do not know I call this one 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.520
 I don't like the cut because 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.840
 eventually let slip away nine 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.479
 will remain and in the end she will then 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.009
 suffer from 1290 from this bush which 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.509
 just will not see conjuring on her 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.399
 she will not see him this 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.790
 need to go repair here I think that 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.159
 this place is very controversial for t69 but 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.840
 as long as there is a monastery here , well, it will be 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.540
 until two devines have everything 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.310
 Well, here we will continue to watch that 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.380
 will be 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.420
 how will change the position of the dream where is he 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.830
 will move generally ideas take out 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.599
 very aggressively set bye and day and 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.880
 a poet something can be contrived if we 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.000
 see on the minimap to no one understood 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.280
 they all catch movement here 1390 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.519
 Dremova shines at a distance of two 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.470
 half squares arcanum team 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.959
 edge 800 meters square 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.150
 80 Well here here here he deysvitelno 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.220
 will catch and even virginity here and so 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.410
 the fact is that the unity command did not see 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.110
 nobody 90 in the center of the map and they immediately 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.060
 understand that they are on an island and could 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.799
 be they yes yes and on the island there you are alone 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.450
 son is the news of that much there on the island and not 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.370
 It means that hell is a village, but who 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.980
 will go highlight there come across go 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.840
 village but don't know 6969 is it now 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.370
 komandor weapon to yes this here is 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.650
 hike them if there is no junction and here 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.260
 aggressively 60 diana goes on to do 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.640
 unity they do and what i say they 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.890
 understand that 90 is not it info 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.540
 my job but not at the lighthouse but here it is a network 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.060
 either hints or stand under the red line 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.340
 in seva and here it is the decision to break the lighthouse 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.720
 virginity + 60 nine goes on the river 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.970
 they are seen and must break free 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.470
 unity either come back and 3g all trunks 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.780
 theodore straighten i get from u too 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.609
 than bile and breaking through and still breaking through 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.010
 monastery well, well worked Diodorus 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.530
 give the drum essentially weighs worked except 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.660
 Jared Summer rushes to the center 30 deuce with 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.250
 of the other flank here I am rude with 4 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.739
 the drums should go to the rear and 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.079
 work out the god of fragrance and unity api and 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.420
 behind shines everybody work six failure r 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.239
 distributes damage 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.109
 confined it is trouble it is just trouble 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.040
 okapi not to take tankovich 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.989
 ajar it still does not go how many dragons 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.370
 fight for four yes tell thought 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.049
 here he is afraid to break in that she doesn't 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.569
 counterattack will fall they all ran back 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:54.370
 oh my god radiator look missed 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:57.739
 okay three shells still have him here 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.989
 once i missed the opportunity i only 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.030
 today some uncomfortable situation 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.069
 put yourself guys from the arcade team 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.560
 now just a real shooting range for unity 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.750
 they give such a terk before diodor gave two 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.560
 drum in the tank they took t1 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:16.039
 it's all unity in the finals congratulations unity 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.720
 in the final very risky crazy 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.690
 lighthouse round 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.250
 a little bit unjustified he 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.170
 now this arcade we all saw it 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.090
 saw the guys from the arcade on repeat 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.920
 I'll understand it all and now as the game goes on 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.770
 understand that it was a crazy mistake 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.960
 Well, what the fifth sixth place for 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.420
 debut season I think it's a success 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.520
 for the arcade and it is worth congratulating them 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.440
 and wish further success in 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.880
 the off season will be short so our 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.950
 probably you should not rest 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.410
 probably even more 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.410
 turnovers for the second season and I hitched 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.750
 planned to rest we will not 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.760
 less so the teams will now 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.680
 worked seriously will be just about 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.970
 team for the fifth and sixth place there those 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.560
 who did not fly those who do not play 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.640
 docking match click will be time 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.290
 look at others and 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.840
 something to change their game because 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.550
 again pause short top teams will 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.070
 busy playing their lan finale a 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.890
 because the arcade will be a wonderful pause 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.870
 to prepare for the new season 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.760
 the next number 2 on their pv-cluster 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.710
 there will be three like last season on 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.130
 Europe America will have 2 seasons again 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.020
 I repeat one angel killer him 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.560
 must take away right now he is trying 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:28.180
 to the maximum I know here inspects 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.790
 meeting just some sense of login and 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.110
 some kind of model is like a knockout 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.700
 boxing you know there in the first second 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.080
 first round when going there 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.080
 crowd watch bob
