00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.170
 hello friends I'm manu and I'm here in 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.180
 minecraft to bring you a mode called 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.270
 minimum race at the request of one of 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.460
 users I hope you have enough 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.340
 clear with this video how it is installed and 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.199
 how it is used, and nothing else, I hope 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.000
 Enjoy the video and we will 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.500
 start we have a series of keys 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.570
 that will help us enjoy the way and 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.730
 use it correctly the first 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.710
 it would be good let's put the f1 we're going to 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.110
 see the mini map that was not 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.420
 teaching good the first would be the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.079
 letter zeta the zeta key that will help us 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.940
 to zoom the map 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.980
 the second would be the X that we 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.519
 help you see the map at first in 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.070
 close-up in case it's not worth it 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.019
 use it in small the next would be 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.780
 the cee that would be to create a waypoint 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.239
 a point where they also appear in 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.070
 this map that we're never going to have 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.739
 loss of anything for example if 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.340
 we have a like hidden or a house a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.860
 castle or what thing is worth we're going to put 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.860
 point let's put for example dot 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.899
 We can choose the color we want 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.490
 choosing it with those placed in color 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.549
 let's put the green that I like 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.149
 green good we have here the point and 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.120
 If we left he can not go no 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.690
 that hill for example let's go 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.690
 toward 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.790
 if we go to this hill from 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.040
 that hill we will continue to see the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.050
 point and if you see the mini map we will 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.870
 show the address where we have 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.110
 what to go for 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.150
 to get there and good from 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.670
 here we continue to see where our 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.050
 bought our house or whatever you want 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.050
 that we have there is worth 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.100
 the following would be the king's menu 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.070
 minimum that we will open it by pressing the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.560
 letter m and here we could enable it or 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.810
 disable what we could choose the type 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.700
 of the map's rendering that right now 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.709
 is teaching the surface though 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.869
 can also help us by choosing the 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.150
 biome that we want to be or the cave 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.950
 looking for caves if we see is this part 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.280
 that is green are caves that are very 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.900
 near the surface 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.750
 then well let's leave it in 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.610
 surface we have a point of death a 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.579
 then in which if we died for 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.710
 example here and I had forgiveness and what 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.080
 we had activated 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.030
 good a point would be created here 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.030
 just in which when he exposes 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.670
 we plowed wherever we could 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.220
 come back here easily knowing that no 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.550
 we are going to lose our things and we are going to 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.130
 show you the options like that a little more 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.560
 those that most use the others that do not 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.570
 I will say I recommend you not to touch them and 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.780
 Well the first thing is that we can change 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.480
 the size or the shape of the map 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.010
 round as square the texture that 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.190
 we can put the network is minimal the 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.140
 created by cousins â€‹â€‹or the map's the map 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.090
 old that is the mini map too 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.650
 we could put it if we like the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.420
 position of the map we could put it 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.070
 both to the right above and to the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.740
 right down as the left up 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.600
 as to the left below and on the scale 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.220
 from the map I recommend not touching it 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.370
 I recommend leaving by car for when 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.070
 minimize or maximize the game be 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.840
 always a certain percentage the 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.870
 scale but good if always if we are 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.610
 blind we can put the biggest one or if 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.070
 we do not want it not to bother us so much 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.840
 make the opacity smaller 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.069
 of the map also served for this 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.680
 purpose doing 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.019
 for it to be almost transparent up to the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.709
 100% that would not reveal anything 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.840
 it's electorally opaque and up to here I 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.439
 I recommend you do not touch anything else because 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.159
 the truth is that touching it can make 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.750
 the model works properly and nothing 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.280
 I hope you liked the video and the 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.500
 explanation and now I will teach you to 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.329
 install it up now and good friends 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.889
 we're back here and well I'm going to 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.230
 teach more or less where do you have to 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.730
 install the good is in the folder by 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.010
 minecraft defect where I would install 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.599
 monkeys motors we would always change this 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.750
 my username would we change it for 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.939
 X in a producer I yours and good 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.169
 here we would leave minecraft because that 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.579
 truth is that from this version 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.829
 in which it has worked for me in the 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.630
 previous versions of the 1.5 point 1 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.419
 It has not worked for me so I recommend 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.460
 that at least be installed is already and good 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.039
 we could also leave the mother is the 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.020
 folder for example or select it 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.930
 porter but I for example I have mods of 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.990
 the 1.4 points 7 of the 1.5 of the 1.5 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.130
 point one of the snapshots besides good 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.780
 in 1.5 point 1 if we click 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.200
 we would have optimize we would have and pixel and 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.540
 haendel and the minimum beige and we're going to 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.360
 load the map with the magic launcher 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.350
 use ballet usually use this because 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.750
 The truth is that it is very easy to 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.730
 use is a very easy walker not 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.410
 we have to touch nothing else and always 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.600
 we want to remove or some way only 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.580
 we have to eliminate it and right now by 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.110
 example I have the minecraft forge that does not 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.169
 I have good this one I can already remove it from 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.120
 here 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.289
 I have minecraft because it detects it as 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.020
 an internal mode since we have it 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.199
 directly in the mods folder and 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.090
 good the opt in vain and the minimum race me 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.379
 puts a name but this is not going to 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.120
 to pay attention because we see that it works 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.690
 correctly what will not work 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.580
 is when you open minecraft you are not going to see the 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.259
 option to see the mods with minecraft 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.970
 because it 's something that has not 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.120
 similar but good the minimum king 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.139
 we are going to give tests and if 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.729
 we see that we have not installed it 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.139
 correctly or we give to what there is 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:40.270
 once since we see that it does not work 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.270
 and we give him in holguin 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.720
 we see the screen very well as 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.550
 I said it will not appear the mods of 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.300
 we will loader here we will not be able to see the 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.250
 mods that we have installed but 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.520
 when loading the map, the 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.520
 mini map
