thing to keep in mind with monofilament

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.779 
thing to keep in mind with monofilament
is<00:01:34.600> those<00:01:35.079> deep<00:01:35.499> are<00:01:35.709> you<00:01:35.740> fishing<00:01:36.249> the<00:01:36.579> more

is those deep are you fishing the more
stretch<00:01:37.149> that's<00:01:37.420> involved<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:37.990> harder<00:01:38.380> it<00:01:38.469> is

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
stretch that's involved the harder it is

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.590 
stretch that's involved the harder it is
gonna<00:01:38.770> be<00:01:38.950> able<00:01:39.069> to<00:01:39.310> drive<00:01:39.819> that<00:01:40.029> hook<00:01:40.299> home

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.019 
have really become the Rays especially
in<00:01:53.380> open<00:01:53.560> water<00:01:53.889> fishing<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.490> as<00:01:54.639> well<00:01:54.880> they

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:55.029 
in open water fishing and as well they

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:56.879 
in open water fishing and as well they
should<00:01:55.060> has<00:01:55.689> a<00:01:55.719> little<00:01:56.170> bit<00:01:56.289> less<00:01:56.529> stretch

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
should has a little bit less stretch

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.699 
should has a little bit less stretch
than<00:01:57.130> monofilament<00:01:57.579> plus<00:01:58.420> when<00:01:58.689> a<00:01:58.719> fish<00:01:59.020> looks

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
than monofilament plus when a fish looks

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.980 
than monofilament plus when a fish looks
up<00:01:59.920> at<00:02:00.130> it<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.429> kind<00:02:00.459> of<00:02:00.669> blends<00:02:01.029> in<00:02:01.389> with<00:02:01.929> the

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
up at it it kind of blends in with the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.480 
up at it it kind of blends in with the
background<00:02:02.139> because<00:02:02.829> it<00:02:02.859> doesn't<00:02:03.249> reflect

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
background because it doesn't reflect

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.399 
background because it doesn't reflect
light<00:02:03.819> it's<00:02:03.999> almost<00:02:04.149> impossible<00:02:04.899> for<00:02:04.929> a<00:02:05.139> fish

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
light it's almost impossible for a fish

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.349 
light it's almost impossible for a fish
to<00:02:05.590> see<00:02:05.799> it<00:02:05.950> but<00:02:06.399> there's<00:02:06.579> a<00:02:06.639> new<00:02:06.969> breed<00:02:07.329> of

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
to see it but there's a new breed of

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.419 
to see it but there's a new breed of
fluorocarbon<00:02:08.050> line<00:02:08.410> out<00:02:08.590> there<00:02:08.800> you're<00:02:09.340> gonna

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
fluorocarbon line out there you're gonna

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.190 
fluorocarbon line out there you're gonna
want<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.819> hear<00:02:10.360> about<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.929> called

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
want to hear about and this is called

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.280 
want to hear about and this is called
floral<00:02:12.040> silk<00:02:12.610> especially<00:02:13.030> here<00:02:13.209> from<00:02:13.420> Bionic

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
floral silk especially here from Bionic

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.160 
floral silk especially here from Bionic
Bionic<00:02:14.769> floral<00:02:15.549> silk<00:02:15.819> line<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.360> really<00:02:16.810> key

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
Bionic floral silk line is really key

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.030 
Bionic floral silk line is really key
and<00:02:17.200> here's<00:02:17.650> what<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:17.890> is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
and here's what it is

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.080 
and here's what it is
it's<00:02:18.219> kind<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.549> a<00:02:18.670> combination<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.890> floral

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
it's kind of a combination of floral

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.039 
it's kind of a combination of floral
fluorocarbon<00:02:22.090> line<00:02:22.269> along<00:02:22.900> with

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
fluorocarbon line along with

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.630 
fluorocarbon line along with
monofilament<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:23.890> there's<00:02:24.069> still<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.280> little

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
monofilament so there's still a little

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.300 
monofilament so there's still a little
bit<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:25.180> stretch<00:02:26.109> to<00:02:26.379> it<00:02:26.409> has<00:02:26.709> all<00:02:27.069> the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
bit of stretch to it has all the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.250 
bit of stretch to it has all the
benefits<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.939> monofilament<00:02:28.269> it's<00:02:28.750> easy<00:02:29.019> to

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
benefits of monofilament it's easy to

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.619 
benefits of monofilament it's easy to
tie<00:02:29.469> but<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.519> has<00:02:30.670> all<00:02:30.939> the<00:02:31.090> benefits<00:02:31.269> of

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
tie but it has all the benefits of

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.289 
tie but it has all the benefits of
fluorocarbon<00:02:32.109> as<00:02:32.500> well<00:02:32.799> which<00:02:33.370> means<00:02:33.609> it's

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
fluorocarbon as well which means it's

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.819 
fluorocarbon as well which means it's
going<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.599> hang<00:02:34.900> straighter<00:02:35.590> than

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
going to hang straighter than

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.710 
going to hang straighter than
monofilament<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:36.670> not<00:02:36.819> going<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.090> be<00:02:37.209> curly

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
monofilament it's not going to be curly

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.539 
monofilament it's not going to be curly
or<00:02:37.750> twisty<00:02:38.109> it's<00:02:38.260> going<00:02:38.409> to<00:02:38.470> sink<00:02:39.159> when<00:02:39.430> it

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
or twisty it's going to sink when it

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.009 
or twisty it's going to sink when it
hits<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.909> water<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:40.540> actually<00:02:40.689> in

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
hits the water so it's actually in

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.110 
hits the water so it's actually in
deeper<00:02:41.349> water<00:02:41.560> presentations<00:02:42.340> like<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:42.970> have

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
deeper water presentations like I have

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.179 
deeper water presentations like I have
rigged<00:02:43.390> up<00:02:43.510> here<00:02:43.810> with<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> small<00:02:44.349> pan<00:02:44.650> fish<00:02:44.920> jig

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
rigged up here with a small pan fish jig

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.940 
rigged up here with a small pan fish jig
it's<00:02:45.670> going<00:02:45.879> to<00:02:45.939> help<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.420> lure<00:02:46.720> sink<00:02:47.409> faster

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
it's going to help that lure sink faster

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.550 
it's going to help that lure sink faster
and<00:02:48.159> the<00:02:48.579> straighter<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.329> line<00:02:49.599> stays<00:02:50.049> from

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
and the straighter this line stays from

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.339 
and the straighter this line stays from
the<00:02:51.220> jig<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.879> the<00:02:51.909> tip<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.389> rod<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:53.139> more
