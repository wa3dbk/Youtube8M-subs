great occasion because we are seeing
something<00:03:40.380> new<00:03:41.130> created<00:03:41.730> which<00:03:41.940> is

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
something new created which is

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.390 
something new created which is
extracting<00:03:43.020> lead<00:03:43.349> from<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.650> glass<00:03:43.830> this<00:03:44.280> is

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
extracting lead from a glass this is

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.040 
extracting lead from a glass this is
unique<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:44.940> has<00:03:45.300> not<00:03:45.480> been<00:03:45.690> done<00:03:45.870> elsewhere

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
unique this has not been done elsewhere

finally<00:03:50.010> we<00:03:50.190> have<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.370> new<00:03:50.580> technology<00:03:50.849> that

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
finally we have a new technology that

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.089 
finally we have a new technology that

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
could deal with these things can take

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.640 
could deal with these things can take
the<00:03:53.430> harmful<00:03:53.849> bits<00:03:54.060> out<00:03:54.319> extract<00:03:55.319> all<00:03:55.500> the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
the harmful bits out extract all the

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.979 
the harmful bits out extract all the
lead<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:56.190> turn<00:03:56.610> them<00:03:56.760> into<00:03:56.849> aggregates<00:03:57.450> this

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
lead and turn them into aggregates this

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.780 
lead and turn them into aggregates this
is<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.200> process<00:03:59.099> I<00:03:59.280> think<00:03:59.340> it's<00:03:59.550> gonna<00:03:59.640> be

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
is a process I think it's gonna be

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.850 
is a process I think it's gonna be
