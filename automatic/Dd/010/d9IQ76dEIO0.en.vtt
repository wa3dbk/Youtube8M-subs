that's<00:00:02.220> really<00:00:02.490> starting<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.060> come<00:00:03.270> out<00:00:03.300> and

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
that's really starting to come out and

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.020 
that's really starting to come out and
that's<00:00:03.899> exactly<00:00:04.890> what<00:00:05.490> we<00:00:05.640> wanted<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.120> do

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 
that's exactly what we wanted to do

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.209 
that's exactly what we wanted to do
notice<00:00:09.030> I'm<00:00:09.269> doing<00:00:09.870> very<00:00:10.769> much<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.190> same

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
notice I'm doing very much the same

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.780 
notice I'm doing very much the same
thing<00:00:11.519> at<00:00:12.210> every<00:00:12.540> level<00:00:13.190> but<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> darker<00:00:14.759> I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
thing at every level but the darker I

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.689 
thing at every level but the darker I
get<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.540> closer<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.199> stayed<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.220> edge<00:00:17.400> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
get the closer I stayed to the edge and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.570 
get the closer I stayed to the edge and
I<00:00:17.820> don't<00:00:18.060> go<00:00:18.390> out<00:00:18.600> too<00:00:18.930> much<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.470> can<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
I don't go out too much I can do the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.240 
I don't go out too much I can do the
same<00:00:20.789> thing<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.270> did<00:00:21.359> with<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.380> H<00:00:22.560> pencil

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
same thing that I did with the H pencil

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.450 
same thing that I did with the H pencil
a<00:00:23.279> little<00:00:23.699> bit<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.500> make<00:00:25.500> some<00:00:25.710> big<00:00:25.920> circles

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
a little bit and make some big circles

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.060 
a little bit and make some big circles
to<00:00:26.849> try<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.269> knit<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> together<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.439> don't<00:00:28.800> do

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
to try and knit it together but don't do

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.710 
to try and knit it together but don't do
too<00:00:29.279> much<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.699> your<00:00:29.760> darker<00:00:30.330> pencils

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
too much with your darker pencils

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.430 
too much with your darker pencils
because<00:00:30.900> as<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.500> see<00:00:31.650> here<00:00:31.890> even<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:33.440> made

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
because as you can see here even on made

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.590 
because as you can see here even on made
it<00:00:34.590> kind<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.010> sharp<00:00:35.870> gap<00:00:37.399> from<00:00:38.399> HB<00:00:39.090> 2<00:00:39.860> 3<00:00:40.860> H<00:00:41.040> so

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
it kind of a sharp gap from HB 2 3 H so

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.510 
it kind of a sharp gap from HB 2 3 H so
whenever<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.930> happens<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.070> always<00:00:44.190> go

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
whenever that happens you can always go

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.389 
whenever that happens you can always go
back<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> lighter<00:00:45.840> pencil<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.950> 3<00:00:47.250> h

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
back to a lighter pencil like your 3 h

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.260 
back to a lighter pencil like your 3 h
and<00:00:47.700> basically<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:49.020> go<00:00:49.680> over<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and basically just go over all the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.799 
and basically just go over all the
layers<00:00:52.520> very<00:00:53.520> likely<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.850> will<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
layers very likely and this will have a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.080 
layers very likely and this will have a
bit<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.469> knitting<00:00:58.859> effect<00:00:59.280> over<00:00:59.940> your

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
bit of a knitting effect over your

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.719 
bit of a knitting effect over your
drawing<00:01:01.879> it'll<00:01:02.879> knit<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.949> various<00:01:05.400> layers

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
drawing it'll knit the various layers

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.359 
drawing it'll knit the various layers
together<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.189> have<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.729> much<00:01:09.479> more

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
together so that you have a much more

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.920 
together so that you have a much more
smoother<00:01:11.369> transition

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.240 

it's<00:01:19.530> also<00:01:19.950> very<00:01:20.400> helpful<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.980> very<00:01:22.980> good

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
it's also very helpful to have very good

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.650 
it's also very helpful to have very good
vision<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.940> spot<00:01:24.360> these<00:01:24.720> very<00:01:25.170> sort<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.920> subtle

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
vision to spot these very sort of subtle

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.640 
vision to spot these very sort of subtle
differences<00:01:28.340> but<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.520> practice<00:01:30.260> it<00:01:31.260> becomes

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
differences but with practice it becomes

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.130 
differences but with practice it becomes
very<00:01:32.010> very<00:01:32.870> obvious<00:01:33.950> now<00:01:35.600> this<00:01:36.600> might<00:01:36.900> look

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
very very obvious now this might look

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.040 
very very obvious now this might look
done<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:39.300> some<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.810> that's

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
done and you know for some of you that's

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.210 
done and you know for some of you that's
as<00:01:40.710> dark<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.820> want<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.180> go<00:01:42.330> for<00:01:43.080> those<00:01:43.380> film

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
as dark as you want to go for those film

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.359 
as dark as you want to go for those film
war<00:01:44.490> fans<00:01:44.869> watching<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.920> always<00:01:47.160> go

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
war fans watching this you can always go

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.660 
war fans watching this you can always go
to<00:01:47.400> an<00:01:47.700> even<00:01:48.150> darker<00:01:48.390> shade<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:50.160> I<00:01:50.400> don't

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
to an even darker shade to be I don't

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.139 
to an even darker shade to be I don't
like<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.030> drop<00:01:51.479> too<00:01:52.200> dark<00:01:52.530> too<00:01:52.890> fast<00:01:53.280> because

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
like to drop too dark too fast because

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.960 
like to drop too dark too fast because
this<00:01:54.540> will<00:01:54.690> create<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.130> very<00:01:56.130> sharp<00:01:56.340> contrast

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
this will create a very sharp contrast

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.600 
this will create a very sharp contrast
unless<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:58.050> what<00:01:58.259> you're<00:01:58.410> going<00:01:58.619> for<00:01:58.800> you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
unless that's what you're going for you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.359 
unless that's what you're going for you
want<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> try<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.119> go<00:02:00.479> down<00:02:00.649> increments<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.830> two

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
want to try to go down increments of two

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.840 
want to try to go down increments of two
shades<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.600> maybe<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.229> 2h<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.460> an<00:02:05.640> h<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.840> h<00:02:06.869> b2<00:02:07.850> it

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
shades so maybe a 2h to an h to h b2 it

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.050 
shades so maybe a 2h to an h to h b2 it
to<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.360> some<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.290> like<00:02:10.560> one<00:02:10.800> or<00:02:10.979> two<00:02:11.060> increments

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
to be some of like one or two increments

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.020 
to be some of like one or two increments
so<00:02:12.959> again<00:02:13.350> I'm<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:14.160> doing<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> same<00:02:14.730> thing

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
so again I'm just doing the same thing

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.800 
so again I'm just doing the same thing
that<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.239> did<00:02:15.330> before<00:02:19.640> sticking<00:02:20.640> very<00:02:21.120> close<00:02:21.510> to

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
that I did before sticking very close to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.990 
that I did before sticking very close to
the<00:02:21.959> sides<00:02:24.620> almost<00:02:25.620> out<00:02:26.459> Lou<00:02:26.820> outlining<00:02:29.000> my

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the sides almost out Lou outlining my

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:44.760 
the sides almost out Lou outlining my
form

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.480 

they<00:02:45.370> can<00:02:45.550> go<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.760> little<00:02:45.970> bit<00:02:46.270> harder<00:02:47.430> at<00:02:48.430> this

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
they can go a little bit harder at this

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.200 
they can go a little bit harder at this
stage<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.100> really<00:02:51.640> define<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.690> edge<00:02:54.210> and

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
stage just to really define on edge and

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.530 
stage just to really define on edge and
I<00:02:55.360> think<00:02:55.630> maybe<00:02:55.960> I<00:02:56.110> could<00:02:56.590> make<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:57.180> bit<00:02:58.180> more<00:02:58.210> of

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
I think maybe I could make a bit more of

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.390 
I think maybe I could make a bit more of
a<00:02:58.750> smoother<00:02:59.170> transition<00:02:59.200> here<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.160> I'm<00:03:00.220> going

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
a smoother transition here so I'm going

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.720 
a smoother transition here so I'm going
to<00:03:00.460> return<00:03:00.760> back<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.090> my<00:03:01.680> age<00:03:02.680> pencil<00:03:03.460> and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
to return back to my age pencil and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.480 
to return back to my age pencil and
build<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.750> little<00:03:04.990> bit<00:03:05.140> more<00:03:05.470> try<00:03:06.430> to

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
build it up a little bit more try to

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:24.650 
build it up a little bit more try to
connect<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.150> H<00:03:07.390> with<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.900> HP

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.360 

and<00:03:25.410> go<00:03:25.620> back<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:26.040> my<00:03:26.540> 3h<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.960> do<00:03:28.890> some<00:03:29.190> more

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
and go back to my 3h to do some more

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:39.140 
and go back to my 3h to do some more
fitting

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.880 

and<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.200> more<00:03:40.530> or<00:03:40.680> less<00:03:40.890> is<00:03:42.439> it<00:03:43.439> the<00:03:43.680> final

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
and this more or less is it the final

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.670 
and this more or less is it the final
effect<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.849> what<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.120> want<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.360> achieve<00:03:45.680> you

effect of what you want to achieve you

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.600 
effect of what you want to achieve you
can<00:03:46.829> try<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.099> do<00:03:49.069> sharpen<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.189> edges<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.519> little

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
can try to do sharpen the edges a little

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.179 
can try to do sharpen the edges a little
bit<00:03:50.970> more<00:03:51.239> your<00:03:52.079> highlighted<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:52.980> with

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
bit more your highlighted it is with

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:58.599 
bit more your highlighted it is with
your<00:03:54.049> highest<00:03:55.049> or<00:03:55.409> hardest<00:03:56.400> pencil<00:03:56.909> and

your highest or hardest pencil and

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.220 
your highest or hardest pencil and
finally<00:03:59.609> two<00:04:00.000> things<00:04:00.299> actually<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.959> my

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
finally two things actually in my

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.800 
finally two things actually in my
original<00:04:01.500> drawing<00:04:02.099> over<00:04:02.489> here<00:04:02.819> you<00:04:03.000> noticed<00:04:03.659> i

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
original drawing over here you noticed i

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.990 
original drawing over here you noticed i
added<00:04:04.109> a<00:04:04.200> bit<00:04:04.319> of<00:04:04.379> a<00:04:04.590> shadow<00:04:04.829> this<00:04:05.579> is<00:04:05.760> dennie

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
added a bit of a shadow this is dennie

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.990 
added a bit of a shadow this is dennie
very<00:04:06.450> easily<00:04:06.810> obviously<00:04:07.620> following<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.790> same

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
very easily obviously following the same

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.449 
very easily obviously following the same
process<00:04:09.650> except<00:04:10.650> i'm<00:04:10.829> going<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.069> start<00:04:11.280> with<00:04:11.430> a

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
process except i'm going to start with a

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.340 
process except i'm going to start with a
darker<00:04:11.970> pencil<00:04:12.180> like<00:04:12.780> my<00:04:13.079> h<00:04:13.730> pencil<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:15.000> just

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
darker pencil like my h pencil and just

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.629 
darker pencil like my h pencil and just
sort<00:04:16.350> of<00:04:16.500> him<00:04:16.769> in<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:18.120> general<00:04:18.539> shape<00:04:19.639> and

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
sort of him in the general shape and

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.400 
sort of him in the general shape and
this<00:04:20.850> is<00:04:21.000> all<00:04:21.150> very<00:04:21.180> dependent<00:04:21.989> on<00:04:22.079> where<00:04:22.260> your

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
this is all very dependent on where your

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.740 
this is all very dependent on where your
light<00:04:22.620> sources<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.370> I'm<00:04:23.460> completely<00:04:24.000> winging

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
light sources and I'm completely winging

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.600 
light sources and I'm completely winging
it<00:04:25.050> here<00:04:25.080> if<00:04:25.800> you're<00:04:26.070> drawing<00:04:26.310> from<00:04:26.550> life

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
it here if you're drawing from life

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.560 
it here if you're drawing from life
you'll<00:04:27.030> get<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.240> better<00:04:27.419> idea<00:04:27.539> of<00:04:29.510> how<00:04:30.510> the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
you'll get a better idea of how the

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.740 
you'll get a better idea of how the
shadow<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.620> plot<00:04:32.099> I'm<00:04:33.030> just<00:04:33.210> going<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.479> put

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
shadow is a plot I'm just going to put

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.270 
shadow is a plot I'm just going to put
it<00:04:33.840> in<00:04:33.930> generally<00:04:34.560> here<00:04:34.889> and<00:04:35.630> I'm<00:04:36.630> just<00:04:37.280> doing

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
it in generally here and I'm just doing

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.960 
it in generally here and I'm just doing
the<00:04:38.400> circles<00:04:38.940> I'm<00:04:39.300> not<00:04:39.479> pressing<00:04:39.780> too<00:04:40.050> hard

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
the circles I'm not pressing too hard

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.339 
the circles I'm not pressing too hard
you<00:04:41.970> really<00:04:42.330> don't<00:04:42.539> want<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:42.900> press<00:04:43.110> too<00:04:43.320> hard

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
you really don't want to press too hard

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.170 
you really don't want to press too hard
until<00:04:43.740> you<00:04:44.010> get<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.280> your<00:04:44.310> final<00:04:44.669> stages<00:04:45.360> of

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
until you get to your final stages of

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.170 
until you get to your final stages of
sharpening<00:04:48.180> your<00:04:48.240> lines<00:04:50.810> and<00:04:52.940> now<00:04:53.940> I'm<00:04:54.030> going

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
sharpening your lines and now I'm going

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.850 
sharpening your lines and now I'm going
to<00:04:54.240> go<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.389> an<00:04:54.630> even<00:04:54.930> darker<00:04:55.110> pencil<00:04:55.500> I'm<00:04:55.710> going

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
to go to an even darker pencil I'm going

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.420 
to go to an even darker pencil I'm going
to<00:04:55.949> go<00:04:56.039> to<00:04:56.099> my<00:04:56.250> HD<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.830> where<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.010> shadow<00:04:59.280> is

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
to go to my HD and where the shadow is

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.510 
to go to my HD and where the shadow is
the<00:04:59.789> darkest<00:05:00.300> is<00:05:00.570> where<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:02.210> sphere<00:05:03.210> meets<00:05:03.870> I

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
the darkest is where the sphere meets I

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.409 
the darkest is where the sphere meets I
guess<00:05:05.520> our<00:05:05.669> base<00:05:05.940> or<00:05:08.030> there<00:05:09.030> should<00:05:09.270> be<00:05:09.389> a

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
guess our base or there should be a

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.480 
guess our base or there should be a
better<00:05:09.659> word<00:05:09.900> for<00:05:10.139> it<00:05:10.260> that<00:05:10.289> I'm<00:05:10.500> not<00:05:10.710> thinking

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
better word for it that I'm not thinking

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.310 
better word for it that I'm not thinking
up<00:05:11.639> right<00:05:11.849> now<00:05:12.000> but<00:05:12.270> basically<00:05:12.720> your<00:05:12.960> ground

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
up right now but basically your ground

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.629 
up right now but basically your ground
and<00:05:15.530> dragging<00:05:16.530> out<00:05:16.710> from<00:05:17.639> that<00:05:18.030> meeting<00:05:18.599> point

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
and dragging out from that meeting point

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.189 
and dragging out from that meeting point
I'm<00:05:20.639> doing<00:05:21.000> small<00:05:21.599> circles<00:05:22.139> once<00:05:22.380> again<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:25.080> I

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
I'm doing small circles once again and I

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:31.580 
I'm doing small circles once again and I
trying<00:05:27.289> not<00:05:28.289> overwhelm<00:05:29.159> my<00:05:30.060> first<00:05:30.389> layer<00:05:30.780> too

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
trying not overwhelm my first layer too

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.279 
trying not overwhelm my first layer too
much<00:05:31.830> I<00:05:32.159> want<00:05:33.030> a<00:05:33.090> nice<00:05:33.270> transition<00:05:33.570> from<00:05:34.229> dark

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
much I want a nice transition from dark

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:41.870 
much I want a nice transition from dark
to<00:05:34.919> light<00:05:35.599> so<00:05:37.699> I'm<00:05:38.699> just<00:05:40.099> doing<00:05:41.099> small<00:05:41.250> circles

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
to light so I'm just doing small circles

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.440 
to light so I'm just doing small circles
very<00:05:42.210> lightly<00:05:42.570> and<00:05:45.199> the<00:05:46.199> lighter<00:05:46.470> i<00:05:46.650> get<00:05:47.450> the

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
very lightly and the lighter i get the

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.340 
very lightly and the lighter i get the
lighter<00:05:48.719> i<00:05:49.139> press

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
lighter i press

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.630 
lighter i press
and<00:05:52.350> you<00:05:53.220> can<00:05:53.340> only<00:05:53.460> go<00:05:53.730> back<00:05:53.970> and<00:05:54.300> knit<00:05:55.140> that

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
and you can only go back and knit that

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:03.260 
and you can only go back and knit that
as<00:05:56.750> needed<00:05:58.070> go<00:05:59.070> back<00:05:59.370> easier<00:06:00.080> to<00:06:01.080> be<00:06:02.270> and

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
as needed go back easier to be and

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.710 
as needed go back easier to be and
really<00:06:04.280> define<00:06:05.280> your<00:06:05.460> lungs<00:06:05.730> pressing<00:06:06.420> a<00:06:06.510> lot

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
really define your lungs pressing a lot

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.260 
really define your lungs pressing a lot
harder<00:06:07.020> now<00:06:07.580> still<00:06:08.580> not<00:06:09.000> too<00:06:09.270> hard<00:06:10.190> because

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
harder now still not too hard because

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.690 
harder now still not too hard because
that's<00:06:12.270> really<00:06:12.600> going<00:06:12.960> to<00:06:14.990> damage<00:06:16.340> the<00:06:17.340> effort

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
that's really going to damage the effort

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.790 
that's really going to damage the effort
that<00:06:17.880> you<00:06:18.000> put<00:06:18.030> on<00:06:18.420> put<00:06:18.840> into<00:06:19.140> your<00:06:19.230> drawing<00:06:19.500> if

that you put on put into your drawing if

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.330 
that you put on put into your drawing if
you<00:06:20.100> are<00:06:20.850> too<00:06:21.030> heavy-handed<00:06:21.330> and<00:06:22.340> finally

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
you are too heavy-handed and finally

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.120 
you are too heavy-handed and finally
ought<00:06:23.550> to<00:06:24.270> finish<00:06:24.600> your<00:06:24.780> drawing<00:06:25.020> you<00:06:25.800> can<00:06:25.980> use

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
ought to finish your drawing you can use

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.400 
ought to finish your drawing you can use
your<00:06:26.280> eraser<00:06:26.880> and<00:06:27.150> just<00:06:27.990> add<00:06:28.580> the<00:06:30.230> smallest<00:06:31.230> of

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
your eraser and just add the smallest of

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.900 
your eraser and just add the smallest of
highlights<00:06:31.920> in<00:06:32.630> the<00:06:33.630> corner<00:06:34.400> really<00:06:35.400> not<00:06:35.640> too

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
highlights in the corner really not too

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.080 
highlights in the corner really not too
much<00:06:36.320> because<00:06:37.320> you<00:06:38.310> can<00:06:38.460> really<00:06:38.640> sort<00:06:39.000> of

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
much because you can really sort of

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.750 
much because you can really sort of
overwhelm<00:06:39.930> the<00:06:40.140> drawing<00:06:40.410> if<00:06:40.770> you<00:06:41.490> put<00:06:41.730> too

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
overwhelm the drawing if you put too

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.060 
overwhelm the drawing if you put too
much<00:06:42.180> I<00:06:45.170> think<00:06:46.170> I<00:06:46.290> made<00:06:46.470> this<00:06:46.620> drawing<00:06:46.830> give

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 
much I think I made this drawing give

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.310 
much I think I made this drawing give
you<00:06:47.160> a<00:06:47.220> little<00:06:47.460> bit<00:06:47.610> too<00:06:47.820> light<00:06:48.120> so<00:06:48.450> the<00:06:48.840> the

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
you a little bit too light so the the

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.920 
you a little bit too light so the the
highlight<00:06:49.710> doesn't<00:06:50.070> stick<00:06:50.310> out<00:06:50.490> as<00:06:50.760> much<00:06:51.570> but

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
highlight doesn't stick out as much but

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.520 
highlight doesn't stick out as much but
this<00:06:52.620> is<00:06:52.860> generally<00:06:53.400> um<00:06:53.700> how<00:06:54.570> you<00:06:54.630> do<00:06:54.930> a<00:06:54.960> sphere

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
this is generally um how you do a sphere

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.980 
this is generally um how you do a sphere
and<00:06:58.040> this<00:06:59.040> technique<00:06:59.610> of<00:06:59.820> shading<00:07:00.270> comes<00:07:00.720> and

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
and this technique of shading comes and

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.230 
and this technique of shading comes and
very<00:07:01.200> helpful<00:07:01.770> no<00:07:02.700> matter<00:07:02.910> what<00:07:03.090> you're

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
very helpful no matter what you're

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.900 
very helpful no matter what you're
drawing<00:07:03.500> especially<00:07:04.500> a<00:07:04.530> portraiture<00:07:05.460> I<00:07:05.490> found

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
drawing especially a portraiture I found

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.690 
drawing especially a portraiture I found
to<00:07:06.240> be<00:07:06.270> very<00:07:06.360> useful<00:07:07.370> using<00:07:08.370> the<00:07:08.460> same

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
to be very useful using the same

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.350 
to be very useful using the same
techniques<00:07:09.270> of<00:07:09.570> drawing<00:07:10.440> a<00:07:10.560> person's<00:07:10.950> face

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
techniques of drawing a person's face

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.230 
techniques of drawing a person's face
starting<00:07:12.360> with<00:07:12.540> one<00:07:13.470> layer<00:07:13.740> of<00:07:14.100> one<00:07:14.970> light

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
starting with one layer of one light

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.260 
starting with one layer of one light
layer<00:07:15.510> and<00:07:15.810> then<00:07:16.500> defining<00:07:17.190> the<00:07:17.490> edges<00:07:17.820> slowly

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
layer and then defining the edges slowly
