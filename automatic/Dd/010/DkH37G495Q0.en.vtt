00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.760
 embarrassed renewable energy remains to be installed at home since 2003 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.790
 solar thermal panels this allows it to heat the water of the 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.790
 house almost all night 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.040
 a year ago the installation is 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.650
 hidden in a cupboard 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.650
 many parts the hot water tank and machinery 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.890
 so we had made the choice 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.420
 but after this installation in a room when I was redone a little 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.910
 little extension of the house 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.300
 the room did not exist 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.520
 we thought it was time to change the heater 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.820
 a special meeting 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.820
 the design and the debate I think 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.270
 in addition to the technical connections and highlighting the exhibition of the panels 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.969
 must be well use it to maximize performance 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.249
 so today if the six square meters of sensors installed 

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:14.710
 on the roof finally circulating a coolant warmed by the 

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:18.100
 solar radiation the team that then transmits the heat below 

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.810
 false 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.370
 d we had started on our programs on the system at the heart of the debates 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.800
 bulcke the answers it is more likely 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.040
 this term help 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.510
 this facility designed for all businesses 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.680
 it's this facility in e2 want to dismantle and destroy the house 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.920
 to fall into ruin 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.650
 the coolant at the end of life what he wants 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.800
 and there we did not know how to answer me at the time 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.940
 so we now know that the sectors that recovers its money 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.600
 but that's why m little information from artists 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.940
 six years later that the eco-citizen approach has been largely 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.850
 rewarded and physical 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.460
 according to a recent study on the generalization of solar water heaters 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.950
 would cover more than 50% of the needs of things in France in the absence 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.500
 of bonus a country other advantage sometimes it is necessary to count a good ten 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.370
 years of amortization this duration varies greatly depending on the area 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.550
 geographical and sunshine unlike photovoltaic 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.640
 the installation of solar thermal panels therefore responds much more 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.350
 ecological concern because the financial investment
