00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hi guys, I'm fine, so I came today. 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.280
 bring a super useful video and I think 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.040
 Can you help a lot of people? 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.950
 some basic tips as soon as I used it 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.780
 It was time to renovate my room and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.900
 things that were cheap that were not 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.650
 so expensive so I hope you like it 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.600
 so come on 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.180
 The first tip is you bet on 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.820
 multifunctional objects that will 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.470
 organize your body because even in 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.260
 large rooms and small rooms 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.880
 when you buy the organizers already 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.239
 think about buying the most 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.820
 cute for you power to heal and is the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.010
 organizer for example lipsticks 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.760
 He can help you figure it out. 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.489
 your makeup is I also use some 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.879
 metal cans that it has won in 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.199
 Matinha experience and then the guard 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.690
 swab is all these things that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.140
 They were spread that I keep them 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.640
 they are shared so do not weigh the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.280
 visual room 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.619
 so it's always good to think about these things 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.340
 that would have dual utility because there 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.290
 You optimism space and manages to leave 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.450
 in beautiful and organized at the same time 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.200
 because the problem is when you put 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.030
 a lot and then things start to fail 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.950
 talk to each other and there was a 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.479
 mess because you have nowhere to store 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.750
 things then the important thing is you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.729
 to think about it is another thing to us 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.810
 When you go and give a general 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.659
 room 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.939
 I'm not afraid to throw things away or 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.400
 Give it to someone because when I was 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.460
 with a lot of things it seems like this 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.060
 do not be harmonious, do not know, do not look cool 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.740
 and then the best is you actually play 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.020
 These things time or give a destination 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.820
 different for them because not even one 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.340
 room full of things is the best you know 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.320
 sometimes less is more and things get worse 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.049
 more beautiful and more organized and more 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.390
 sometimes it's a thing there that neither is 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.000
 so beautiful and you leave then 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.750
 detach because you're only working 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.790
 It's good of you to exchange these 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.920
 things things that you can not give anymore is that 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.340
 move the energy of the room knows then 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.490
 do not get that 40 stopped is things 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.800
 old photos 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.710
 the aspects you release yourself from this 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.010
 You do not use the second tip you use. 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.530
 flowers and I bought some flowers 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.080
 Is it dry? 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.880
 they are live flowers but a dry one and there you 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.250
 You do not need to put anything into it. 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.450
 I think that's what a person told me and 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.570
 in the comments 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.450
 and I also bought some flowers from 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.640
 Lying because I need to carry 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.690
 and also the ideal place for flowers 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.880
 it's not in the bedroom 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.610
 so the little flowers do not suffer 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.390
 another went to buy flowers takes my flower 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.950
 that does not need maintenance is is the 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.560
 flowers she did not much style for the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.990
 room then, for example, I like 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.380
 flowers pink flowers more cheerful with 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.000
 more lively colors and that's where it 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.600
 My room's personality 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.430
 If you like a sunflower it is to try the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.570
 types of flowers that can say something 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.790
 about you 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.500
 So I thought it was cool, I think it gives. 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.990
 a very special touch for the quartet 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.880
 very cool the third tip I think 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.040
 it's one of the most important is you 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.710
 add items that say something about the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.380
 your personality then in the decoration I 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.450
 I try to put my franz the box is 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:33.350
 One thing I love is a secret that I 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:35.810
 I love and I have butt is the frame of the 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.120
 phoenix is also different things then 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.700
 so they say something about me and me 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.860
 I like and for example I like things 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.640
 so it does not matter what country and 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.510
 colorful 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.650
 but there are people who like things more 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.130
 solid then you will decorate there 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.040
 according to what you want but it's very 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.210
 cool you put these things on your 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.100
 personality 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.810
 I remember that when the producer of 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.850
 my house at home 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.840
 the magazine producer my house she sees 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.300
 that each 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.640
 she totally changed my room so 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.130
 another thigh she took everything she had 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.790
 into the niches and places the last 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.430
 It was a very expensive thing and I felt 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.380
 that was more my room and then for me it was 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.200
 type or part of a journal but is not the 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.850
 My passion is with my personality and 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.470
 I think I think that's what changes 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.390
 completely knows 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.270
 It's every corner of my room and oil 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.950
 or I see something I did and that 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.960
 I'm very proud because I really 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.660
 It's much cooler to do things, you know. 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.360
 has a hard hand that I also did at 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.210
 times the use of background here in the channel then 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.350
 several things they say something about 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.500
 I think that's the most important. 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.060
 your personality in your room 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.990
 will really make you feel at home. 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.180
 home and in your corner the fourth tip is 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.980
 you bet on a different wall 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.920
 then for example all other 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.040
 walls have a neutral color in my room 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.770
 in case it's white but it could be gray 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.440
 halila in a clear river is a more 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.600
 Basic and so there is this wall here 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.630
 from behind it has the background those 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.380
 apricots there is princess type name 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.030
 so it is well clean and this paper of 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.980
 wall but at the same time it brings a 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.890
 personality to the room because it 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.620
 it's not it's totally stamped 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.090
 but you can paint the room I just 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.150
 to paint my sister's bedroom 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.470
 green water that berdych was needed 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.720
 then you go you paint the color that is 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.460
 says more about you than you do 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.410
 like or the color you think goes 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.210
 give it to combine more that here I 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.250
 I put another well that I knew I 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.150
 I would like to do well. It's very colorful. 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.060
 fourth 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.250
 so I decided to put a more 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.770
 neutral but I could play with colors 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.140
 and everything else and there goes from you but I think 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.810
 cool that wall of prominence because there 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.270
 Where are you going to leave things worse? 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.970
 important in white and coral even know 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.630
 and it 's not that expensive an ink can 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.419
 a wall to seal the real 60 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.820
 close to what normally costs 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.590
 Renovation is super cheap 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.620
 so I think these are the four 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.110
 gold tips so more important in the 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.180
 time for you to form your room and not 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.350
 just tell sometimes you can only give one 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:26.870
 so he knows how to give a life more to the 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.760
 your room and are super simple tips 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.430
 I believe they are available for 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.200
 everyone 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.070
 You tend to use a lot of personality 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.970
 and a lot of creativity is to make your 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:41.100
 It's the corner that does not know how to be creative. 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.650
 who thinks they are not creative to create 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.690
 Your corner came in this video ac 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.240
 click here and I do not have some tips for 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:51.060
 you be more creative because everyone 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.280
 It can be just like it and there on the blog I go 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.770
 put some inspirations from rooms 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.420
 Why can you see improvements in 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.690
 several different styles 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.220
 I am in offenses already selected so 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.120
 so you do not have to worry 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.420
 very 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.300
 is to keep looking for it already in 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.430
 several different rooms is so that's it 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.170
 I hope you have enjoyed and 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.180
 more video suggestions like this one

 I love to record heart videos is a 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.970
 thing I discovered a while ago that I 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.740
 I really like and then this is a kiss 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.500
