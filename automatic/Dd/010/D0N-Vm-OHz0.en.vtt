00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
13 I wanted to show you this 10 watt LED

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.400 
13 I wanted to show you this 10 watt LED
waterproof<00:00:05.330> outside<00:00:06.330> light<00:00:08.690> box<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.960> I'll

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
waterproof outside light box this I'll

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.570 
waterproof outside light box this I'll
put<00:00:10.590> up<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.710> information<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.340> where<00:00:11.429> this

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
put up the information of where this

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.860 
put up the information of where this
came<00:00:11.880> from<00:00:13.130> don't<00:00:14.130> do<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.940> did<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.210> go<00:00:15.809> to

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
came from don't do what I did and go to

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.470 
came from don't do what I did and go to
the<00:00:16.049> order<00:00:16.379> 12<00:00:17.160> volt<00:00:17.400> one<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.910> accidentally

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the order 12 volt one and accidentally

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.840 
the order 12 volt one and accidentally
get<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.100> get<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:21.390> high-voltage<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:22.850> I'm

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
get the get the the high-voltage one I'm

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.400 
get the get the the high-voltage one I'm
gonna<00:00:24.090> keep<00:00:24.300> them<00:00:24.539> because<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.109> use<00:00:25.260> them

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
gonna keep them because I can use them

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.080 
gonna keep them because I can use them
too<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.990> didn't<00:00:27.990> notice<00:00:28.849> what<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:29.910> was

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
too but I didn't notice what I was

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.460 
too but I didn't notice what I was
ordering<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.720> make<00:00:30.900> sure<00:00:30.929> you're<00:00:31.230> ordering

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
ordering so make sure you're ordering

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.810 
ordering so make sure you're ordering
the<00:00:31.650> right<00:00:31.769> thing<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.520> what<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the right thing so this is what the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.170 
the right thing so this is what the
light<00:00:33.000> looks<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:34.010> it's<00:00:35.010> actually<00:00:35.280> really

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
light looks like it's actually really

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.090 
light looks like it's actually really
well<00:00:36.420> constructed<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.770> all<00:00:37.950> metal<00:00:40.100> it's

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
well constructed it's all metal it's

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.880 
well constructed it's all metal it's
nice<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.670> nectars<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> LED

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.069 

I'm<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> show<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:48.629> supposed<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
I'm going to show you it's supposed to

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.350 
I'm going to show you it's supposed to
be<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> 10<00:00:50.010> watt<00:00:50.219> LED<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:50.940> there's<00:00:51.149> this

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
be a 10 watt LED and then there's this

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.260 
be a 10 watt LED and then there's this
reflector<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.219> don't<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:54.000> if

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
reflector and I don't know if I can if

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.430 
reflector and I don't know if I can if
you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.449> get<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.870> scale<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:56.219> not<00:00:56.370> huge

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
you can get the scale here it's not huge

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.950 
you can get the scale here it's not huge
not<00:01:00.350> but<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.590> tiny<00:01:01.949> either

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.679 

the<00:01:06.960> wiring<00:01:07.409> instructions<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.689> typically

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the wiring instructions and typically

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.920 
the wiring instructions and typically
vague<00:01:11.840> PG<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.170> yellow-green<00:01:13.829> and<00:01:14.340> n<00:01:14.759> is<00:01:15.479> blue

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
vague PG is yellow-green and n is blue

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.990 
vague PG is yellow-green and n is blue
and<00:01:16.259> L<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.829> brown<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.369> there<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.579> go<00:01:17.729> right

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
and L is brown so there you go right

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.450 
and L is brown so there you go right
well<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.259> cooked<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
well this is how I cooked it up here I

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.060 
well this is how I cooked it up here I
have<00:01:20.490> another<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.470> comes<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.890> these

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
have another one and it comes with these

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.910 
have another one and it comes with these
comes<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.390> connector<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> can

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
comes with this connector that you can

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.999 
comes with this connector that you can
use<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.429> I<00:01:27.590> connected<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:30.200> white<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
use so I connected this up white to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.139 
use so I connected this up white to
brown<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:33.229> black<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.679> blue<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.090> know

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
brown and black to blue and then I know

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.330 
brown and black to blue and then I know
it's<00:01:36.390> you're<00:01:36.990> not<00:01:37.110> gonna<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.350> able<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.560> really

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
it's you're not gonna be able to really

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.520 
it's you're not gonna be able to really
tell<00:01:38.670> I'm<00:01:38.849> here<00:01:39.179> it's<00:01:39.330> kind<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.840> brightness<00:01:40.409> is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
tell I'm here it's kind of brightness is

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.730 
tell I'm here it's kind of brightness is
really<00:01:41.119> concentrated<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.259> look<00:01:43.530> at

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
really concentrated that if you look at

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.910 
really concentrated that if you look at
it<00:01:43.950> you're<00:01:44.189> blinded<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> while<00:01:45.679> so<00:01:46.679> you<00:01:46.709> can

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it you're blinded for a while so you can

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.730 
it you're blinded for a while so you can
see<00:01:47.069> it's<00:01:47.220> using<00:01:47.369> 12<00:01:47.929> watts<00:01:49.459> and<00:01:51.049> 0.19<00:01:52.049> amps

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
see it's using 12 watts and 0.19 amps

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:03.199 
see it's using 12 watts and 0.19 amps
and<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:56.069> 120<00:01:56.909> volt<00:01:57.409> bulb<00:02:01.700> it's<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:03.030> gonna

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
and it's 120 volt bulb it's it's gonna

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.490 
and it's 120 volt bulb it's it's gonna
be<00:02:03.450> hard<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.289> tell<00:02:04.560> exactly<00:02:04.799> how<00:02:06.200> bright<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.380> is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
be hard to tell exactly how bright it is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.699 
be hard to tell exactly how bright it is
but<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:07.950> okay<00:02:08.849> let<00:02:08.940> me<00:02:09.000> turn<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.269> light<00:02:09.539> off

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.449 

okay<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.970> there<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.209> can<00:02:15.390> see<00:02:16.190> he's<00:02:17.190> quite<00:02:17.340> a

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
okay so there you can see he's quite a

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.530 
okay so there you can see he's quite a
bit<00:02:18.140> then<00:02:19.140> actually<00:02:19.620> my<00:02:20.489> monitor<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.000> right<00:02:21.329> is

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
bit then actually my monitor is right is

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.539 
bit then actually my monitor is right is
how<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.900> actually<00:02:22.500> looks<00:02:22.889> it's<00:02:23.160> about<00:02:23.250> that

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
how it actually looks it's about that

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:29.229 
how it actually looks it's about that
color<00:02:23.940> compared<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:25.250> incandescent<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.610 

that's<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.329> little<00:02:30.480> bit<00:02:30.660> more<00:02:30.870> yellow<00:02:31.109> than<00:02:31.470> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
that's a little bit more yellow than it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.379 
that's a little bit more yellow than it
actually<00:02:31.799> is<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:32.549> it's<00:02:32.850> certainly<00:02:33.060> not

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
actually is but it's it's certainly not

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.400 
actually is but it's it's certainly not
quite<00:02:33.720> as<00:02:33.840> warm<00:02:35.359> but<00:02:36.359> it's<00:02:36.510> not<00:02:36.660> as<00:02:36.840> harsh<00:02:37.170> as

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
quite as warm but it's not as harsh as

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.930 
quite as warm but it's not as harsh as
that<00:02:37.440> sort<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:37.859> daylight<00:02:38.579> light<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:41.069> it

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
that sort of daylight light and it

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.120 
that sort of daylight light and it
provides<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.720> lot<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.019> light<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.380> mean<00:02:43.829> there

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
provides a lot of light I mean there
