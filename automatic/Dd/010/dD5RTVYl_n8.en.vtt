00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
you're going to throw already because

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.499 
you're going to throw already because
you're<00:01:07.619> already<00:01:07.770> anticipating<00:01:08.460> his<00:01:08.520> move<00:01:08.789> so

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
you're already anticipating his move so

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.840 
you're already anticipating his move so
it's<00:01:09.990> really<00:01:10.289> a<00:01:10.590> shadowbox<00:01:11.189> drill<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.759> I'll

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
it's really a shadowbox drill and I'll

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.669 
it's really a shadowbox drill and I'll
break<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.179> down<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.509> you<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.649> a

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679 
break it down for you and then a

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:15.050 
break it down for you and then a
variation<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.609> just<00:01:14.789> sort<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
variation of that is just sort of a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.539 
variation of that is just sort of a
punch-out<00:01:15.479> variation<00:01:16.109> which<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.829> like<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.039> use

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
punch-out variation which I like to use

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.709 
punch-out variation which I like to use
they'd<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.969> to<00:01:17.999> do<00:01:18.149> at<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.359> end<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.600> my

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
they'd like to do at the end of my

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.529 
they'd like to do at the end of my
workout<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.159> first<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.030> something

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
workout but this first one is something

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.300 
workout but this first one is something
that<00:01:21.810> probably<00:01:22.380> would<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.710> somewhere<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.219> my

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that probably would do somewhere in my

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.399 
that probably would do somewhere in my
shadow<00:01:23.579> boxing<00:01:24.170> probably<00:01:25.170> pretty<00:01:25.320> much

shadow boxing probably pretty much

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.690 
shadow boxing probably pretty much
towards<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.859> end<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.009> my<00:01:26.100> rounds<00:01:26.429> before<00:01:26.520> I'm
