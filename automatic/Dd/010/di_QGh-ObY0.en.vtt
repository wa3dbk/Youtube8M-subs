even in there and then we want this to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.170 
even in there and then we want this to
be<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:55.829> thick<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.760> we're<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> add<00:00:57.149> a

be really thick so we're going to add a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.680 
be really thick so we're going to add a
bunch<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> ice<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.820> very<00:00:59.820> powerful<00:01:00.480> motor

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
bunch of ice to it very powerful motor

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.970 
bunch of ice to it very powerful motor
so<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.930> don't<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.260> worry<00:01:01.469> about<00:01:01.739> putting

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
a lot of ice in the machine that will

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.740 
a lot of ice in the machine that will
never<00:01:04.769> burn<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.369> got<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> thermal<00:01:06.090> protector<00:01:06.630> on

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
never burn up got a thermal protector on

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.929 
never burn up got a thermal protector on
it<00:01:06.900> flip<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> lowest<00:01:08.280> speed<00:01:08.640> go<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it flip it on the lowest speed go to

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
it flip it on the lowest speed go to
speed<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.600> we're<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> turn<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
speed one we're going to turn the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.310 
speed one we're going to turn the
machine<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.900> start<00:01:12.900> out<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
machine on here start out with a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:48.870 
machine on here start out with a
variable<00:01:13.830> speed<00:01:13.950> work<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.580> way<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.550 

and<00:01:49.880> there<00:01:50.120> you<00:01:50.210> go<00:01:50.540> fresh<00:01:50.780> homemade<00:01:51.260> sorbet

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
and there you go fresh homemade sorbet

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.440 
and there you go fresh homemade sorbet
made<00:01:52.070> in<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.250> Vitamix<00:01:52.640> in<00:01:52.850> just<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.180> few

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
made in the Vitamix in just a few

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.940 
made in the Vitamix in just a few
seconds<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.620> as<00:01:55.190> you<00:01:55.310> can<00:01:55.430> see<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:57.590> makes<00:01:57.830> it

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
seconds and as you can see it makes it

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.600 
seconds and as you can see it makes it
pretty<00:01:58.160> thick<00:01:59.470> you're<00:02:00.470> looking<00:02:00.800> for<00:02:01.070> the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
pretty thick you're looking for the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.700 
pretty thick you're looking for the
pattern<00:02:01.970> right<00:02:02.120> there<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:03.200> container<00:02:03.590> is

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
pattern right there the container is

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.350 
pattern right there the container is
designed<00:02:04.100> really<00:02:04.550> well<00:02:04.730> to<00:02:04.940> pull<00:02:05.090> everything

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
designed really well to pull everything

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.680 
designed really well to pull everything
down<00:02:05.600> in<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.870> blade<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:07.420> you're<00:02:08.420> not<00:02:08.540> ever
