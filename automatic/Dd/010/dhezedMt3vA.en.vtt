00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it's hard to tell but actually there's a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.770 
it's hard to tell but actually there's a
little<00:01:08.730> bit<00:01:08.940> of<00:01:09.000> condensation<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
little bit of condensation on the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.500 
little bit of condensation on the
plastic<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.340> drips<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:11.940> it<00:01:12.330> would<00:01:12.480> be

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
plastic so it drips down it would be

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.720 
plastic so it drips down it would be
muddy<00:01:12.870> in<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.470> didn't<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.770> sawdust

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
muddy in here if we didn't have sawdust

muddy in here if we didn't have sawdust
down

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
down

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.080 
down
plus<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.870> manure<00:01:16.170> would<00:01:16.800> be<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> problem<00:01:17.190> now

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
plus the manure would be a problem now

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.140 
plus the manure would be a problem now
we've<00:01:18.450> got<00:01:18.660> these<00:01:18.870> on<00:01:19.050> our<00:01:19.170> garden<00:01:19.530> spot<00:01:19.800> and
