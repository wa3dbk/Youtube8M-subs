00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.750
 to the attitude of girls that such editorial 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.790
 I bring you today is how to get in 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.820
 lashes for maybe inside the 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.740
 super easy eye the first time I 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.000
 there is of that or if it is the first time that 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.410
 see is the first time you do it 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.890
 to believe that we have given read that goes to 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.810
 to be uncomfortable is not worth it is put by 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.550
 inside the tab or inside 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.439
 of the eye but at the root of the eyelash 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.189
 natural we get to touch the eye ni 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.779
 nothing are super comfortable to wear 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.540
 they hurt for nothing they do not go 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.550
 Taking off easily is not necessary 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.470
 that we put on our eyes or that we 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.269
 let's make a line so you do not notice 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.879
 and is super tabs are naturally 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:46.269
 you fit super good in the eyes and it's as if 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.370
 really outside our tab so 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.860
 nothing the makeup that I have already 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.100
 recorded I will upload it I ask surely 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.229
 after this video and also the super 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.750
 really simple I hope that you 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.449
 like and if you want to have to put on 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.140
 false eyelashes inside you only have 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.670
 to keep watching the video 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.860
 well as you see I do not take anything from 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.110
 eye makeup I will use 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.970
 a few tabs of art and they are the number 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.350
 109 that are of finite base the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.640
 I recommend because they are more comfortable to 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.229
 carry is also going to use a 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.240
 art glue and it is very important 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.270
 that the glue is waterproof by itself 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.470
 they cry their eyes and thus achieve that you 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.690
 given the theme of the track being 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.040
 it really lasts quite well but it's a 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.400
 delicate area and it is better to be 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.080
 enrolled I will apply the glue for 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.850
 over art designing by the base 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.860
 as we usually apply then we go to 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.630
 leave it pegadito in the box apply it 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.759
 above and while the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.649
 glue make me lashes for 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.890
 so achieve better take the base of the 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.110
 the natural eyelash make the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.060
 we have a little bit and it's time 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.789
 necessary for the glue to dry 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.649
 the circles about 30 seconds I like 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.580
 Apply the lashes starting from 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.160
 center and already adjusting to the extremes 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.740
 that's how you like it most or how you feel 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.630
 more comfortable is that they are put below 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.840
 without touching the water line is right by 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.259
 the root of the natural eyelash and I already 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.259
 we are adjusting 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.489
 uncomfortable I promise is a present 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.400
 Super comfortable to wear is super easy 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.739
 just go putting it on the tab 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.910
 natural and adjust it I can take more 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.980
 because I'm recording but really 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.980
 It took about 4 seconds and I found the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.959
 lashes and they last me a lot more so that's 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.250
 at the end you will see supernatural you can 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.470
 use as much as if you are 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.209
 made up like doing and you can 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.069
 make up later so I do not expect anything 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.360
 that you liked and healthy of us and 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.450
 of a little kiss modifying 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.450
 ah 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.430
