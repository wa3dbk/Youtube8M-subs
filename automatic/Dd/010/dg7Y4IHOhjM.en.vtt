00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.059
 there are all these threats and today we 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.760
 is found for a new video so 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.639
 in this video I'm just going 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.170
 introduce yourself but rather because 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.759
 because it's still a little 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.200
 bad so that's done that's several 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.539
 several weeks that I do not do any 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.980
 video so sometimes it was because of the 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.590
 bad weather times it was because 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.550
 I forgot my camera or sometimes it's 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.029
 because she is too busy in 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.119
 wood so here we are all from 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.390
 suite so so for starters I'm going 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.460
 tell you about so from a knife 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.460
 facto excluded all that remains 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:46.220
 so it's a good knife 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.949
 except obviously that's the handle he 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.040
 plastic so her breasts he did 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.159
 his time what but it's not a level 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.720
 resistance is not the top 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.510
 so I broke them simply 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.540
 finally broken in two simply by 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.500
 by making stickonnat so the coverslip 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.920
 it's turned upside down so is this 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.660
 summer but that 's still a very 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.040
 good knife 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:17.960
 good another this one so if he with my 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.030
 father we bought a good third Spanish 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.220
 for 10 15 euros 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:28.160
 superb have rather than say small here 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.410
 there is also a trick that serves to 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
 hang it on the belt or on the 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.010
 size simply 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.810
 and I do not know if you see that well 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.300
 it's the closing system so there it 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.580
 is blocked so just turn it 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.310
 because you see well effect of 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.400
 close so not too bad made beautiful little 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.400
 knife so 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.439
 of this one so that there that you say 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.909
 his name 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.200
 it's the seller and generation so I 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.060
 you will put the name in the description 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.990
 6 of the video if some people are interested 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.140
 so there is a extreme seller 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.530
 and so it's a good knife 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.780
 the good catch tomorrow since it's not 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.690
 this erasing material is a matter 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.660
 gripping valleys hanging well 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.620
 handy 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.590
 same as the previous one something for 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:37.870
 put the belt but the same system 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:42.549
 than the previous one so with something in 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.760
 way of closing here is what a good 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.760
 knife 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.709
 so that's not me it's a knife to 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.370
 my father so he's a former elder 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.079
 knife so he is he to little anarchy 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.709
 heavy but hey he has done his time 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:05.459
 by with a system of opening has not 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.850
 closing and opening 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.190
 so we can see well we force and they get 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:16.720
 hoist to the blade does not lower so 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:22.630
 very good knife just he has a small 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:27.120
 little heavy but otherwise it's there 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:32.640
 so that's it in a tactical move 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.640
 so here we go 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.409
 safina civil and so I'm here he is 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.769
 by month he is also to my father so I 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.150
 I'm not sure how much he paid but that's it 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.069
 he told me it was a little bit 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.409
 expensive anyway since there is a 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.930
 kind of pocket order a small 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.459
 lamp that can be used to illuminate so 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.000
 not obviously because I have 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:00.329
 more stacks there is also a kind of 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.560
 screen so digital screen so that I 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.599
 see a little since it displays I believe 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.599
 it's either the time or it's 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:15.420
 to wait for the temperature that makes 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:25.220
 easily reclosable and to open it 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:25.220
 just push here and 2 to press 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.300
 to push here he was supporting then because 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.479
 that I had done wrong so here it is 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.099
 come from favi dao are super good 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:46.349
 rather tactical can be a little expensive 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:49.949
 but me bhutto so replacing 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:52.139
 the other I have that I broke and I 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.720
 found a good knife a tank on the bass 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.720
 and a peaceful rate of power for 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.080
 to prune branches it is not bad so 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.380
 I paid it's not 2 3 euros in a 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.380
 flea market 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.660
 so right now I'm trying to 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.699
 make a kind of door to door 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.270
 earlier that goes with 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:18.780
 so that's obviously I jase 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:22.740
 would arrange it so what I did I 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.949
 took a beast thongs of leather and I 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.530
 sewn into one in an excess one 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.960
 flight since I found my father 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.139
 who gave me 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.880
 so here it is a very beautiful knife in 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.570
 a tear so that was it knew 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.719
 do the boat did not buy place the other 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.419
 the last one so that's the ones 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.830
 always with me it's victorinox 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:56.190
 so he has several functions so style 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:58.039
 scissors like scissors or mango 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.200
 and of course its primary function 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.360
 of a knife so that's not too much 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.450
 knife made for cutting 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.919
 branches it's something to see in 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.750
 keychains for example we will do 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.190
 races where I do not know because we 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.169
 will buy a garment that there is a 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.690
 ethics is how to say a little bit 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.870
 too model 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.940
 it can still be used for the coupe 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.159
 what am I going to show you 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.409
 all sat down here by then 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:30.719
 last one last thing so you see 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:31.950
 it's open it here it's done I 'm going 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:34.520
 you probably see better like that 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.409
 it's a kind of two- door machete 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.570
 or buy it on the Indian festival astra 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.919
 I think it's dated 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:45.419
 I'm really not sure but I believe 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:47.000
 that dates back to the end of the 19th century 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.969
 century 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.449
 so it's a little weary damaged 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:56.400
 so here's the video is over 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.770
 I hope you enjoyed so if 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.999
 this is the case a second louse that makes it 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.960
 always pleasure so shared too 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:07.680
 comment on the constructive comments 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.469

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.960

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:15.509
 well yeah tomorrow is here at hello

 that because of the bench for that's it 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.620
 Well, I think we all said before
