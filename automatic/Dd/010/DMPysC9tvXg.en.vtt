 daily limits on card transactions you 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.450

 and cash withdrawals at an ATM that 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.060
 Generally reduce the risks 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.920
 loss of a certain amount besides if 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.090
 the bank provides a service to change

 making a transaction in an ATM I 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.700
 would give the following advice first before

 Inspect the transaction 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.540

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.689
 well worth paying attention 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.359

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.969
 the presence of various kinds of linings and 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.040
 on the slot of a vision card for availability 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.980
 various reading devices 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.140
 it is also worth paying attention to 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.269
 transaction enhancement so that there is no 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.409
 no unauthorized persons capable 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.260
 view your pin code 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.180
 if we are talking about shopping in the store 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.099
 only 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.040
 separate advice this do not miss the card 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.280
 from the view the implementation of the transaction should 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.579
 take place with your presence so that 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.230
 it was not possible to scan 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.540
 information from your card calculations online 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.939
 Internet is best done on official 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.569
 known sites the site address is desirable 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:07.639
 must start with a network protocol 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.620
 https and should definitely have 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.669
 running antivirus program on 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.409
 your computer 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.269
 if you regularly spend such 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.639
 payments you better open the card for 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.889
 such operations open a special card 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.500
 extra which allows you 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.379
 shopping online you 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.239
 just add this card to the right one 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.049
 amount to buy and carry 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.620
 purchase thereby reducing risks 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.419
 unauthorized transactions by 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.370
 the main map if you still became 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.500
 the victim of scammers and found 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.109
 card operations which you 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.479
 did not commit need to immediately contact in 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.150
 the bank the bank is worth contacting by calling 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:46.430
 to the contact center where you immediately 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.750
 block the card and will not 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.479
 the possibility of any 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.069
 card transactions are your next steps 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:55.510
 it is natural to visit the department 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.979
 the bank where the application is written 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.780
 unauthorized transaction and 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:02.569
 this statement is accepted and the bank 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.359
 consider the application for it 30 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.359
 working days after which the client 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.409
 given the answer about how it is 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.579
 this is happening 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.919
 investigation and 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.540
 betrays the answer about how it will be 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.940
 reimbursed while not surprising 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.739
 call from the bank in the middle of the night or 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.130
 detection of not installed by you 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.979
 card limits naturally for 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.509
 card use security like 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.000
 actions are taken both by 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.050
 client and by the bank itself 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.400
 banks exist 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.860
 security services who 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.970
 system-based monitor transactions by 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.740
 account and if 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.570
 certain transaction which was 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.370
 detected does not match 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.770
 customer characteristics 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.280
 she is considered so suspicious 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.780
 then the customer is called about 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.710
 warning or verification of that 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.710
 or another transaction
