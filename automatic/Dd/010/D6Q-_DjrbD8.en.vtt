00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.920
 an export stop youtube-channel the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.469
 I'm ready 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.650
 the question of the beginning makes it true today 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.840
 on today's picture do not shout the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.600
 most creative answer or maybe the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.029
 answer that is correct wins something 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.789
 I'll say something in the next video 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.289
 has won and who has not had today 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.880
 my topic is under six i have 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.730
 it in a different video ever 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.829
 I had raised this product 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.510
 I think there are quite a few products 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.010
 it is so much talked about 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.899
 it does not make sense sense 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.600
 Of course it makes sense you just have to 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.610
 The purpose and purpose of this product is 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.410
 insist on the product too 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.960
 it seems to come but later 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.570
 because for the lists is maybe 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.129
 not dry on it and says 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.300
 misunderstand the meaning behind six 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.850
 first we have 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.980
 multi concentrate content whey isola 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.670
 as with calcium, it can therefore be milk protein 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.430
 medium all casein protein isolate and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.460
 chickens a protein worth the video 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.880
 Do not fool around knows that 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.650
 we are here in the end a component 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.080
 to have 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:25.049
 Here we have one more, so we have one 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.700
 two and here is the third that is 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.960
 we actually have a three 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.000
 components 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.619
 she is not really six components 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.450
 So do not get so into it 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.520
 light lead from the composition 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.040
 it also appears a lot cloud 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.290
 concentrate and whey isolate 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.450
 I'll come to that next time 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.680
 So flipchart let yourself then is 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.159
 a little bit the light of the sweet 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.220
 multi-component protein with a high proportion 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.979
 that means it's more of an all-rounder 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.630
 the product you actually so yes 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.730
 can use all day long 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.950
 as we look at what's to stop 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.960
 or how much is in it 53 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.030
 just a protein that is for one 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.660
 protein product so very little that 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.040
 actually disqualifies the super 6 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.410
 in category one in the category 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.010
 pure protein products for during 34 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.150
 protein and a total of 34 percent 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.590
 contain carbohydrates 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.440
 that means we have a lot, of course 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.120
 a lot of sugar and not sugar 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.950
 so much was on it but it is missing 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.110
 a little bit what it stands for politics 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.910
 then it's out 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.890
 Mehrzucker that means it is probably times 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.390
 you think you're in it 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.310
 that means we have very many 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.020
 carbohydrates and we also have one 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.480
 a bit more fat than in others 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.180
 which was not necessarily something 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.430
 It is so bad because the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.720
 Carbohydrates in itself lower 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.790
 are as for example as at one 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.610
 Of course, weight gainers are allowed 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.320
 far from mountain this share of fat 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.320
 want to have 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.820
 So what about the internet via 56 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.530
 and to keep the video short 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:02.110
 what can it do in good German 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.959
 even a speaker it can be very 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.650
 Great and very good dissolve 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.170
 That's why the guess is close 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.180
 that much more good in concentrates 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.120
 if you look at this here for 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.600
 example are 80 grams of super 6 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.459
 Contain with water and which is stuck 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.320
 Of course not at all and it is 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.410
 very fluid that means it is very 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.540
 a lot of protein concepts protein isolate 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.000
 there what the whole bit cheaper 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.850
 but it also made one 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.920
 to stay for spot good meals 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.230
 Replacement makes us when we are 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.530
 For example, I can see the box 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.300
 not sure if the camera is going to make it 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:50.320
 in any case is here with 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.830
 replacement or edition so the 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.840
 manufacturer of four cents 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.540
 Not at all that this is a protein 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.820
 product or a protein is but it 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.680
 One meal is the set if one 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.560
 then times on the internet cost so 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.640
 a bit see through then we come up 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.310
 about 2 euro per meal at 100 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.500
 gram in one helping and I have to 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.570
 say if you are traveling in the water 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.340
 can enjoy because just the taste so 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.470
 great is because the solubility is so 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.370
 is great then of course must say 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.720
 is that a very cheap one 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.460
 between meals with a good one 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.390
 nutrition ratio carbohydrates protein 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.730
 and fat 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.240
 because where else do you get for two euros 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.830
 a wholesome meal with a good 400 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.290
 calories because of the 100 grams in the 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.170
 but with a very much helping 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.270
 high protein content with about one 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.740
 little more than half 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.260
 Carbohydrate half of the protein 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.310
 carbohydrate content and with little fat 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:53.280
 I say at the kiosk next door are 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.000
 ten in the animal movie 82 euro whole 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.000
 very different 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.229
 but also suggests really cool
