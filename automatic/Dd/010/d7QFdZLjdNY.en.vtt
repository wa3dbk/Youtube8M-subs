pickup<00:02:23.230> truck<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.590> saw<00:02:23.620> how<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.100> sled<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.550> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
pickup truck I saw how to sled in the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.120 
pickup truck I saw how to sled in the
back<00:02:24.959> enclosed<00:02:25.959> trailers<00:02:26.440> everywhere<00:02:26.950> and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
back enclosed trailers everywhere and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.040 
back enclosed trailers everywhere and
plenty<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.430> treads<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.030> access<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.660> mountains

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
plenty of treads to access the mountains

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.530 
plenty of treads to access the mountains
we<00:02:29.980> rolled<00:02:30.190> over<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.610> sled<00:02:30.880> shed<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.420> get

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
we rolled over to the sled shed to get

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.120 
we rolled over to the sled shed to get
our<00:02:31.660> clutches<00:02:31.930> dialed<00:02:32.410> in<00:02:32.500> for<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.740> proper

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
our clutches dialed in for the proper

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.740 
our clutches dialed in for the proper
elevation<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:33.940> we<00:02:34.090> would<00:02:34.239> get<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.510> most

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
elevation so we would get the most

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.199 
elevation so we would get the most
horsepower<00:02:35.200> out<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.739> our<00:02:35.860> engines<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.489> little

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
horsepower out of our engines a little

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.900 
horsepower out of our engines a little
adjustment<00:02:37.690> for<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:37.989> altitude<00:02:38.730> 1500<00:02:39.730> feet

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
adjustment for the altitude 1500 feet

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.720 
adjustment for the altitude 1500 feet
here<00:02:40.209> they<00:02:41.140> were<00:02:41.260> used<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.590> 9,000<00:02:42.340> back<00:02:42.489> home

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
here they were used to 9,000 back home

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.240 
here they were used to 9,000 back home
so<00:02:43.120> they'll<00:02:43.840> be<00:02:43.959> pulling<00:02:44.170> strong<00:02:44.620> now<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.130> we

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
so they'll be pulling strong now and we

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.340 
so they'll be pulling strong now and we
won't<00:02:45.400> burn<00:02:45.610> our<00:02:45.760> motor<00:02:45.940> up<00:02:46.180> well<00:02:46.959> we<00:02:47.050> can<00:02:47.230> go

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
won't burn our motor up well we can go

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.390 
won't burn our motor up well we can go
POW<00:02:47.560> surface<00:02:49.019> good<00:02:50.019> thing<00:02:50.200> we<00:02:50.320> did<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.160> powder

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
POW surface good thing we did the powder

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.130 
POW surface good thing we did the powder
was<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:51.790> deep<00:02:52.120> we<00:02:52.330> needed<00:02:52.570> every<00:02:52.810> ounce<00:02:52.930> of
