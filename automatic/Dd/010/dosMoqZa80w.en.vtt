oK<00:00:01.500> we've<00:00:01.620> already<00:00:01.829> done<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.250> entry<00:00:02.550> drill

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
oK we've already done the entry drill

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.400 
oK we've already done the entry drill
and<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.300> gathering<00:00:03.480> water<00:00:03.959> behind<00:00:04.230> your

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
and the gathering water behind your

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.289 
and the gathering water behind your
blade<00:00:04.589> drill<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.100> then<00:00:05.549> we've<00:00:05.790> looked<00:00:06.060> at<00:00:06.180> the

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
blade drill and then we've looked at the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.610 
blade drill and then we've looked at the
actual<00:00:06.480> catch<00:00:06.930> drill<00:00:07.259> where<00:00:07.410> we<00:00:07.529> actually

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
actual catch drill where we actually

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.860 
actual catch drill where we actually
start<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.099> do<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.940> first<00:00:09.210> part<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.599> stroke

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
start to do the first part of the stroke

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.140 
start to do the first part of the stroke
by<00:00:10.440> engaging<00:00:10.769> our<00:00:11.370> paddling<00:00:11.700> side<00:00:11.910> hips

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
by engaging our paddling side hips

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.480 
by engaging our paddling side hips
against<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.809> fully<00:00:13.590> secured<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.219> loaded

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
against a fully secured and loaded

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.430 
against a fully secured and loaded
paddle<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.509> now<00:00:15.660> what<00:00:15.870> we're<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.320> is

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
paddle so now what we're going to do is

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.050 
paddle so now what we're going to do is
rocks<00:00:16.710> you're<00:00:16.859> gonna<00:00:16.949> start<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.609> start<00:00:17.940> to

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
rocks you're gonna start to start to

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.790 
rocks you're gonna start to start to
take<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.900> catch<00:00:19.199> drill<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.619> we're<00:00:19.710> gonna

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
take that catch drill and we're gonna

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.370 
take that catch drill and we're gonna
apply<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.550> actual<00:00:20.910> Kotlin<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.050> when<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> did

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
apply it to actual Kotlin so when I did

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.250 
apply it to actual Kotlin so when I did
the<00:00:22.470> catch<00:00:22.650> drill<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.930> got<00:00:24.930> my<00:00:25.050> hips

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the catch drill I just got my hips

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.570 
the catch drill I just got my hips
engaged<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.010> kind<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.279> rewound

through the water got my hips engage

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.200 
through the water got my hips engage
rewound<00:00:28.859> through<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> water<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.880> did<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.150> a

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
rewound through the water and did that a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.479 
rewound through the water and did that a
number<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.080> times<00:00:31.289> now<00:00:31.560> I'm<00:00:32.009> actually<00:00:32.219> gonna

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
number of times now I'm actually gonna

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.950 
number of times now I'm actually gonna
paddle<00:00:32.790> I'm<00:00:33.030> gonna<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.300> moving<00:00:33.630> my<00:00:33.719> board

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
paddle I'm gonna be moving my board

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.410 
paddle I'm gonna be moving my board
forward<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.730> want<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.300> this

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
forward but what you want to do in this

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.850 
forward but what you want to do in this
drill<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.930> want<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.290> think<00:00:37.469> about<00:00:37.590> getting

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
drill is you want to think about getting

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.010 
drill is you want to think about getting
everything<00:00:38.460> done<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.090> early<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.750> in

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
everything done as early as you can in

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.740 
everything done as early as you can in
the<00:00:40.350> stroke<00:00:40.969> unnaturally<00:00:41.969> early<00:00:42.329> remember

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the stroke unnaturally early remember

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.690 
the stroke unnaturally early remember
drills<00:00:43.170> are<00:00:43.410> exaggerations<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.550> this

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
drills are exaggerations so this

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.010 
drills are exaggerations so this
shouldn't<00:00:44.910> look<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> normal<00:00:45.539> paddling

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
shouldn't look like a normal paddling

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.299 
shouldn't look like a normal paddling
stroke<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.410> should<00:00:46.590> look<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:46.860> an

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
stroke it should look like an

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.100 
stroke it should look like an
exaggerated<00:00:48.180> paddling<00:00:48.600> stroke<00:00:48.840> where<00:00:49.020> you're

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
exaggerated paddling stroke where you're

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.540 
exaggerated paddling stroke where you're
focusing<00:00:49.590> only<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> front<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.489> your

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
focusing only on the front of your

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.360 
focusing only on the front of your
stroke<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.629> you've<00:00:51.870> got<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> board<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:53.129> has

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
stroke if you've got a board that has

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
stroke if you've got a board that has
some<00:00:53.789> type<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.030> mark<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.530> use

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
some type of mark on it that you can use

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.490 
some type of mark on it that you can use
as<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> reference<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:57.149> my<00:00:57.570> board<00:00:57.780> has<00:00:57.930> bark<00:00:58.289> on

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
as a reference like my board has bark on

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.540 
as a reference like my board has bark on
it<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:58.920> going<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.129> try<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.370> get

actually<00:02:05.140> paddling<00:02:05.939> keep<00:02:06.939> trying<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.390> get

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
actually paddling keep trying to get

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.779 
actually paddling keep trying to get
your<00:02:08.080> whole<00:02:08.259> stroke<00:02:08.530> done<00:02:08.770> early<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:09.250> that

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
your whole stroke done early and that

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.320 
your whole stroke done early and that
means<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.179> main<00:02:10.420> pulling<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.910> using<00:02:13.239> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
means the main pulling just using the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.690 
means the main pulling just using the
catch<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.720> going<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:13.959> be<00:02:14.050> done<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.920> my<00:02:15.160> board

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
catch is going to be done on my board

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.300 
catch is going to be done on my board
if<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.290> pulling<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.709> going<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:18.040> done<00:02:18.190> by

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
if the pulling is going to be done by

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.130 
if the pulling is going to be done by
the<00:02:18.370> can<00:02:18.640> bark<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.060> blade<00:02:19.300> may<00:02:19.510> actually<00:02:19.900> drag

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
the can bark the blade may actually drag

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.690 
the can bark the blade may actually drag
through<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.470> water<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.800> little<00:02:20.950> bit<00:02:21.100> past<00:02:21.400> that

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
through the water a little bit past that

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.430 
through the water a little bit past that
but<00:02:22.360> you're<00:02:22.510> not<00:02:22.660> really<00:02:22.930> putting<00:02:23.170> any

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
but you're not really putting any

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.400 
but you're not really putting any
pressure<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> blade<00:02:24.190> at<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.489> point<00:02:24.730> and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
pressure on the blade at that point and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.199 
pressure on the blade at that point and
you'll<00:02:26.410> recognize<00:02:26.739> if<00:02:27.430> somebody<00:02:27.819> sees<00:02:28.030> you

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
you'll recognize if somebody sees you

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.240 
you'll recognize if somebody sees you
doing<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.599> they<00:02:28.690> should<00:02:28.900> recognize<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.650> this

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
doing it they should recognize that this

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.890 
doing it they should recognize that this
is<00:02:30.400> really<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.060> drill<00:02:31.300> you're<00:02:31.480> doing<00:02:31.720> by

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
is really the drill you're doing by

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.410 
is really the drill you're doing by
seeing<00:02:32.310> your<00:02:33.310> hips<00:02:33.640> really<00:02:34.920> snap<00:02:35.920> back<00:02:36.400> as<00:02:37.060> you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
seeing your hips really snap back as you

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.570 
seeing your hips really snap back as you
as<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.140> catch<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:39.280> they're<00:02:39.430> really<00:02:39.610> gonna

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
as you catch so they're really gonna

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.400 
as you catch so they're really gonna
you're<00:02:42.580> gonna<00:02:42.670> set<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.120> blade<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.630> it's

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
you're gonna set the blade and it's

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.780 
you're gonna set the blade and it's
gonna<00:02:44.530> look<00:02:44.799> like<00:02:44.860> there's<00:02:45.250> almost<00:02:45.400> like<00:02:45.760> a

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
gonna look like there's almost like a

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.170 
gonna look like there's almost like a
width<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.660> your<00:02:46.720> paddling<00:02:47.140> side<00:02:47.410> hips<00:02:48.180> coming

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
width of your paddling side hips coming

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.479 
width of your paddling side hips coming
back<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.769> other<00:02:50.890> thing<00:02:51.130> is<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
back and the other thing is that the

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.970 
back and the other thing is that the
blade<00:02:51.670> should<00:02:52.000> be<00:02:52.120> quiet<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:53.530> strokes<00:02:53.830> should

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
blade should be quiet the strokes should

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.340 
blade should be quiet the strokes should
be<00:02:54.100> quiet<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.760> that's<00:02:55.510> because<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.140> blades

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
be quiet and that's because the blades

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.509 
be quiet and that's because the blades
buried<00:02:56.799> if<00:02:56.980> your<00:02:57.310> stroke<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.299> loud<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.630> noisy

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
buried if your stroke is loud and noisy

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.640 
buried if your stroke is loud and noisy
like<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.700> like<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.420> your<00:03:02.170> blades<00:03:02.410> not

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
like that like that your blades not

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.810 
like that like that your blades not
buried<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.100> you're<00:03:03.190> not<00:03:03.310> really<00:03:03.579> grabbing

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
buried and you're not really grabbing

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.890 
buried and you're not really grabbing
water<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:05.170> if<00:03:05.290> your<00:03:05.470> blade<00:03:06.299> it's<00:03:07.299> fully<00:03:07.570> set

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
water but if your blade it's fully set

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.880 
water but if your blade it's fully set
and<00:03:08.140> buried<00:03:08.730> when<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.820> do<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.590> it's<00:03:11.590> very

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
and buried when you do this it's very

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.770 
and buried when you do this it's very
quiet<00:03:12.190> when<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.940> engage<00:03:13.120> your<00:03:13.420> hips<00:03:13.540> and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
quiet when you engage your hips and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.000 
quiet when you engage your hips and
that's<00:03:13.870> what's<00:03:14.200> going<00:03:14.320> to<00:03:14.380> give<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.709> really

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
that's what's going to give you a really

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.080 
that's what's going to give you a really
good<00:03:15.130> connection<00:03:15.430> at<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.790> front<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.030> your

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
good connection at the front of your

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.390 
good connection at the front of your
stroke
