because<00:04:12.380> I<00:04:12.560> think<00:04:12.860> lumu<00:04:13.190> has<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.610> power<00:04:13.820> to

because I think lumu has the power to
hurt<00:04:14.209> him<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.630> he's<00:04:15.500> very<00:04:15.769> aggressive<00:04:16.150> Peter

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
Quillin he has power but he's not that

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.789
