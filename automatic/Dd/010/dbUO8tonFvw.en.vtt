00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.730
 is now our destiny to know the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.240
 famous Indian mine in santa clara del 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.039
 Guarco tells the legend that this was the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.220
 place where the old people of the area 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.280
 they collected metal and that's why we're going to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 discover the mystery we set out 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.730
 by ravines for the road you need 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.030
 a 4x4 to a point of the mountains 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.030
 because then it continues but walking 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.620
 the fresh air is the engine of the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.390
 walk and landscapes without place to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.980
 doubts make this visit even more valuable 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.640
 we enter through private land with 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.600
 Area guides 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.600
 ah 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.190
 and where nobody can imagine it is the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.190
 entry 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.469
 with rafa we are already from the entrance of the 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.409
 mine and I see something scary if not 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:24.380
 but what bats did only 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:29.409
 only if a little bit sculpts good 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.409
 then let's enter and truth 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.390
 Access is complicated, you have to 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.640
 manage to enter and the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.250
 residents like that they do not like our 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.250
 visit because they came out fast from there 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.880
 mask for the massive accumulation of 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.340
 bat droppings 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.810
 although some decided to enter without 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.870
 protection 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.630
 it's called porn 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.440
 the josh indians mine today by 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.510
 first time he comes 60 years ago he had 10 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.970
 years back then when it gets to that 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.150
 for the first time the mine 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:15.020
 and here what was heard by the people most 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.290
 older than I pulled a material from this 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.290
 mine 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.690
 It is a tunnel where you can walk 1 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.910
 to 1 wet and cold 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.190
 it's quite uncomfortable because you have to 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.770
 enter practically lying down but already 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.770
 when you can walk from tickets 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.340
 all right 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.300
 standing sing 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.280
 you have to leave to crouch because there 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.160
 there are parts that protrude from to 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.260
 of the day but I can almost s 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.310
 you can walk to the bottom 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.430
 It measures approximately 60 meters long 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.989
 and it has no outlet although it is said that it was 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.110
 the place where they were collected 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.110
 materials now there is no trace of it 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.840
 in what we have been able to appreciate this is 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.640
 sees a lot of rock like 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.870
 accompanied by the earth and a lot of humidity 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.660
 there's a lot of moisture in fact on the floor 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.280
 there is a lot of water and this part of here 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.330
 also asia that as you can think 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.770
 here I do not know if you hard to take this one you see the 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.770
 constant water dripping 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.590
 The whole tunnel is of the same rock material 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.590
 and clay 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.950
 and so we're going to go through the mine and there and 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.010
 that's how he stayed and when he was 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.340
 bigger and gabini I met him and you saw 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.829
 but that is already a gap is not not known 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.310
 what house mine would be of this would be of 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.680
 boro would be another kind of mineral going that 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.379
 get out of here and for the people of the area 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.739
 is well known or only those that already 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.569
 they have been living here for years , challenges and 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:10.250
 of ravines if you know of this mine 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.470
 truth and the boat people plus grandparents 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.410
 of the place they say that this Indian mine 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.169
 it's more of a legend because it's a tunnel 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.669
 mysterious that hides in the 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.669
 mountains of the Guarco
