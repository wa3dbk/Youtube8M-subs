water<00:05:24.460> you<00:05:24.880> know<00:05:25.000> it's<00:05:25.210> not<00:05:25.419> you're<00:05:25.659> not

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
water you know it's not you're not

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.210 
water you know it's not you're not
supposed<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.050> use<00:05:26.229> garden<00:05:26.590> hose<00:05:26.680> water<00:05:26.949> but

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
supposed to use garden hose water but

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.550 
supposed to use garden hose water but
now<00:05:27.400> you<00:05:27.460> can<00:05:27.820> because<00:05:28.479> this<00:05:28.630> filter<00:05:29.110> is<00:05:29.320> going

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
now you can because this filter is going

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.990 
now you can because this filter is going
to<00:05:29.620> filter<00:05:29.860> out<00:05:30.070> all<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.280> impurities<00:05:30.669> and

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
to filter out all the impurities and

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.700 
to filter out all the impurities and
everything<00:05:31.330> so<00:05:31.900> basically<00:05:32.320> you're<00:05:32.500> going<00:05:32.620> to

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
everything so basically you're going to

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.560 
everything so basically you're going to
get<00:05:32.889> really<00:05:33.370> really<00:05:33.520> clean<00:05:33.909> water<00:05:34.270> nice

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
get really really clean water nice

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.290 
get really really clean water nice
basically<00:05:35.289> cleaner<00:05:35.560> than<00:05:35.770> tap<00:05:35.800> water<00:05:36.300> and

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
basically cleaner than tap water and

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.580 
basically cleaner than tap water and
it's<00:05:37.449> going<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.659> fill<00:05:37.870> your<00:05:37.990> pots<00:05:38.259> a<00:05:38.440> lot

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
it's going to fill your pots a lot

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.810 
it's going to fill your pots a lot
quicker<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:39.039> you're<00:05:39.130> not<00:05:39.280> going<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.490> run<00:05:39.699> back

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
quicker and you're not going to run back

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.469 
quicker and you're not going to run back
and<00:05:40.030> forth<00:05:40.240> to<00:05:40.360> your<00:05:40.389> kitchen<00:05:41.280> so<00:05:42.280> basically<00:05:43.090> I

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
and forth to your kitchen so basically I

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.149 
and forth to your kitchen so basically I
mean<00:05:43.900> I<00:05:44.050> think<00:05:44.199> you<00:05:44.259> get<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.470> idea

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
mean I think you get the idea

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.610 
mean I think you get the idea
this<00:05:45.580> gets<00:05:45.789> hooked<00:05:45.909> up<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.690> wall<00:05:46.870> this

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
this gets hooked up to the wall this

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.920 
this gets hooked up to the wall this
gets<00:05:47.889> hooked<00:05:48.039> up<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:49.270> end<00:05:49.419> of<00:05:49.479> the<00:05:49.539> filter

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
gets hooked up to the end of the filter

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.649 
gets hooked up to the end of the filter
so<00:05:50.800> you<00:05:50.949> control<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.490> filter<00:05:51.699> with<00:05:52.240> a<00:05:52.270> switch

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
so you control the filter with a switch

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.860 
so you control the filter with a switch
here<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.789> this<00:05:54.789> place<00:05:55.030> is<00:05:55.180> going<00:05:55.210> to<00:05:55.330> sit<00:05:55.690> in

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
here and this place is going to sit in

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.189 
here and this place is going to sit in
your<00:05:55.930> pot<00:05:56.440> so<00:05:56.800> your<00:05:57.550> pot<00:05:57.789> wall<00:05:58.060> you<00:05:58.930> know<00:05:59.050> it's

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 
your pot so your pot wall you know it's

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.659 
your pot so your pot wall you know it's
going<00:05:59.320> to<00:05:59.380> be<00:05:59.440> right<00:05:59.590> here<00:05:59.919> so<00:06:00.070> imagine<00:06:00.550> like

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
going to be right here so imagine like

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.930 
going to be right here so imagine like
this<00:06:01.120> just<00:06:01.479> filling<00:06:01.870> up<00:06:01.990> inside<00:06:02.830> your<00:06:03.009> pot<00:06:03.190> it

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
this just filling up inside your pot it

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.450 
this just filling up inside your pot it
works<00:06:04.120> really<00:06:04.419> nice<00:06:04.690> you<00:06:04.930> can<00:06:05.080> actually

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
works really nice you can actually

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.320 
works really nice you can actually
Humber<00:06:06.460> talk<00:06:06.699> there's<00:06:06.940> people<00:06:07.090> who<00:06:07.240> have

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
Humber talk there's people who have

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.749 
Humber talk there's people who have
built<00:06:07.479> brackets<00:06:08.110> off<00:06:08.320> of<00:06:08.979> here<00:06:09.250> that<00:06:09.460> you<00:06:09.639> know

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
built brackets off of here that you know

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.930 
built brackets off of here that you know
I<00:06:10.349> guess<00:06:11.349> actually<00:06:12.310> yeah<00:06:12.460> they<00:06:12.550> can<00:06:12.699> probably

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
I guess actually yeah they can probably

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.969 
I guess actually yeah they can probably
just<00:06:13.090> go<00:06:13.210> in<00:06:13.330> here<00:06:13.599> you<00:06:14.229> can<00:06:14.349> go<00:06:14.469> brackets<00:06:14.889> off

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
just go in here you can go brackets off

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.610 
just go in here you can go brackets off
these<00:06:15.159> four<00:06:15.400> spots<00:06:15.759> and<00:06:16.389> so<00:06:17.289> you<00:06:17.380> can<00:06:17.469> just

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
these four spots and so you can just

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.100 
these four spots and so you can just
hang<00:06:17.800> it<00:06:17.979> in<00:06:18.460> your<00:06:18.610> pot<00:06:18.789> so<00:06:19.630> you<00:06:19.719> not<00:06:19.840> to<00:06:19.930> sit

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
hang it in your pot so you not to sit

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.940 
hang it in your pot so you not to sit
around

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
around

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.860 
around
holding<00:06:21.880> it<00:06:22.000> while<00:06:22.090> you're<00:06:22.270> filling<00:06:22.600> it<00:06:22.690> but

weekend for the first time you know the
new<00:06:31.900> electric<00:06:32.230> system<00:06:32.650> so<00:06:33.450> yeah<00:06:34.450> you<00:06:34.870> guys

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
new electric system so yeah you guys

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.570 
new electric system so yeah you guys
will<00:06:35.110> be<00:06:35.200> seeing<00:06:35.560> it<00:06:35.710> then<00:06:35.920> but<00:06:36.190> I<00:06:36.250> think<00:06:36.520> you

get the idea and like I said for about

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.780 
get the idea and like I said for about
50<00:06:38.380> bucks<00:06:38.590> I<00:06:38.800> think<00:06:38.980> it's<00:06:39.190> a<00:06:39.250> well<00:06:39.490> worthwhile

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
50 bucks I think it's a well worthwhile

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.180 
50 bucks I think it's a well worthwhile
investment<00:06:40.630> you<00:06:41.260> know<00:06:41.350> filters<00:06:41.620> down<00:06:41.890> to<00:06:41.950> five

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
investment you know filters down to five

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.770 
investment you know filters down to five
microns<00:06:42.430> you<00:06:42.790> can<00:06:42.880> go<00:06:42.970> crazy<00:06:43.210> you<00:06:43.450> can<00:06:43.570> go<00:06:43.660> down

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
microns you can go crazy you can go down

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.050 
microns you can go crazy you can go down
to<00:06:43.810> two<00:06:44.050> microns<00:06:44.530> if<00:06:44.710> you<00:06:44.800> want<00:06:45.010> I<00:06:45.250> didn't<00:06:45.970> go

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
to two microns if you want I didn't go

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.140 
to two microns if you want I didn't go
that<00:06:46.240> night<00:06:46.420> so<00:06:47.010> yeah<00:06:48.010> that's<00:06:48.280> it<00:06:48.550> so<00:06:48.610> that<00:06:49.030> is
