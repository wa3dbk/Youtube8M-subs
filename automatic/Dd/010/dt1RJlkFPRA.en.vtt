a<00:03:43.920> Forgotten<00:03:44.400> land<00:03:44.639> I<00:03:44.850> think<00:03:44.880> that's<00:03:45.269> what<00:03:45.389> it

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
a Forgotten land I think that's what it

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.030 
a Forgotten land I think that's what it
is<00:03:45.510> don't<00:03:46.019> quote<00:03:46.200> me<00:03:46.350> on<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.500> name<00:03:46.769> I'm<00:03:46.920> not

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
is don't quote me on that name I'm not

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.039 
is don't quote me on that name I'm not
sure<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.430> victory<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.120> stereo<00:03:48.569> being<00:03:48.810> pretty

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
sure it is victory I stereo being pretty

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.479 
sure it is victory I stereo being pretty
much<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.380> only<00:03:49.410> fusion<00:03:49.950> monster<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.370> can

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
much the only fusion monster that can

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.770 
much the only fusion monster that can
protect<00:03:50.760> itself<00:03:50.910> when<00:03:51.269> you<00:03:51.299> bring<00:03:51.569> it<00:03:51.660> out

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
protect itself when you bring it out

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.330 
protect itself when you bring it out
therefore<00:03:52.500> if<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.680> do<00:03:52.829> pay<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.190> five

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
therefore if you do pay the five

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.620 
therefore if you do pay the five
thousand<00:03:53.700> Life<00:03:53.790> Points<00:03:53.819> it's<00:03:54.239> pretty<00:03:54.480> much

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
thousand Life Points it's pretty much

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.960 
thousand Life Points it's pretty much
guaranteed<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.530> stay<00:03:55.769> on<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.010> field<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.819> is

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
if cyber Stein doesn't get Veiler now

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.379 
if cyber Stein doesn't get Veiler now
that<00:03:59.160> would<00:03:59.310> be<00:03:59.430> good<00:03:59.549> in<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.760> aspect<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.209> if

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
that would be good in the aspect that if

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.819 
that would be good in the aspect that if
