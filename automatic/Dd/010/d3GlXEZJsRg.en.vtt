00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Why ?? 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.500
 For all is normal ????? 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.620
 Are YouTube videos posted on 301 views a day? 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.880
 Yesterday I came across the English video of the guy who asked the question 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.100
 The product manager in YouTube Analytics service who explains everything, and as I know it can provoke 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.260
 Those who watch a lot of videos on YouTube or even those who publish videos on YouTube 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
 - So how was the video of yesterday? 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.920
 301 views 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.660
 301 views! 301 views! 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.680
 Finally ça..ça blocks er ... 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.600
 Hey this crazy buzz, buzz this sick! 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.360
 I talk to a star, I talk to a fucking star! 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.320
 I decided to summarize this explanation ... to teach everyone ... 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.640
 Hain, more "Sorry, I ... I did not know I did not understand the video, I do not speak English, 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.140
 Sorry, yes, I'm sorry, really. 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.840
 You should know that when a video was posted on YouTube, make this video repeated 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.420
 On different servers all over the world, is not it like that if you watch this video, for example, from Paris, 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.680
 Well you can watch videos that are located on servers in France or in Europe, there is no need to go convince the US and Japan. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.980
 Then the servers offer a bit of worldwide send information to YouTube, 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:23.220
 They say, "Well, I've seen this video once in my service, go, go youtube, you notes, go." 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.720
 The other thing is to know YouTube distinguish two types of videos, seen 300 or less, and those that are more than 300 views. 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.080
 If so a video has 10, 20, 30, 100, 200 and 300 views, the YouTube counter is usually increased 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:50.200
 If you do more than 300 views, while YouTube believes it is necessary to check the views, then hanging the YouTube 301 counter is achieved if there are no robots having fun 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.180
 Click for thousands of times that the counter rises. 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.740
 This is cheating! Ugly robot, I have to eye. 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.360
 YouTube then removes these misconceptions and after less than a day, shows the real number of the counter. 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:11.660
 Then you say "Yes, but wait, sometimes the counter is hanging 302 views or more!" 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.860
 Besides having the same grandfather in the Simpsons, you're right! 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:25.220
 The explanation, here, when it exceeds 300 views, ie moving from a YouTube video that does not check the views where the video is achieved, 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.500
 It may be that YouTube recognizes many views that arrive simultaneously from different servers. 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.880
 On arrival at the same time adds YouTube before blocking the counter for one day, 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:46.320
 So you can see numbers up to 320, like 302, 303, 'end you know the numbers between 301 and 320 usually if you go to school. 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:03:01.500
 Now once you see someone post-comment like, "If you're also in 301iéme, the green thumb!" Then "301 views and 1342 comments!? WTF!" 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.880
 Show him this video, it is your civic duty. 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:20.280
 Thank you Numberphile for its video interpretation is a YouTube channel that talks about numbers ... big, big atmosphere in man's life, what are the numbers ... 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.580
 I told you very soon! 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.720
