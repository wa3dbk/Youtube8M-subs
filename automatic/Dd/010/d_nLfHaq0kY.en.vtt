00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
were also going to put that to the test

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.920 
were also going to put that to the test
as<00:00:32.189> well<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:33.829> the<00:00:34.829> color<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.399> I'm<00:00:35.520> using<00:00:35.910> is

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.910 

number<00:00:39.930> 100<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.670> me<00:00:42.320> so<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.500> meant<00:00:43.829> to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
number 100 I for me so this is meant to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.350 
number 100 I for me so this is meant to
give<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.280> bit<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.610> glow<00:00:44.760> because<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
give you a bit of a glow because it's a

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.779 
give you a bit of a glow because it's a
radiance<00:00:45.809> foundation<00:00:46.370> don't<00:00:47.370> know<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
radiance foundation don't know what the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.510 
radiance foundation don't know what the
coverage<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.950> quite

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
coverage is going to be like it's quite

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.380 
coverage is going to be like it's quite
runny<00:00:51.050> texture<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.910> use<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.710> sigma<00:00:56.149> often<00:00:57.149> brush

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
runny texture I use a sigma often brush

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
runny texture I use a sigma often brush
we<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.230> my<00:00:58.410> hair<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.829> my<00:00:58.980> face

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.380 

it<00:01:09.180> definitely<00:01:09.720> leaves<00:01:10.080> more<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:11.390> radiance

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
it definitely leaves more of a radiance

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.280 
it definitely leaves more of a radiance
to<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.840> skin<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:18.119> coverage<00:01:18.510> is<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.840> too<00:01:19.050> bad

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
to the skin the coverage is not too bad

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.810 
to the skin the coverage is not too bad
i'd<00:01:19.500> say<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.860> medium<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:23.310> doesn't<00:01:23.640> feel

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
i'd say it's medium and it doesn't feel

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.240 
i'd say it's medium and it doesn't feel
too<00:01:24.270> greasy<00:01:24.810> or<00:01:25.020> heavy<00:01:25.050> on<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> skin<00:01:26.040> either

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
too greasy or heavy on the skin either

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.969 
too greasy or heavy on the skin either
which<00:01:26.550> is<00:01:26.700> always<00:01:27.030> great<00:01:30.710> now<00:01:31.710> I've<00:01:31.800> got<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
which is always great now I've got a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.120 
which is always great now I've got a
couple<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.580> blemishes<00:01:33.000> here<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.050> we'll<00:01:34.830> see

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
couple of blemishes here so we'll see

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:55.649 
couple of blemishes here so we'll see
what<00:01:35.250> those<00:01:35.520> look<00:01:35.820> like

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.660 

to<00:01:56.229> be<00:01:56.350> fair<00:01:56.530> considering<00:01:57.039> it's<00:01:57.219> not<00:01:57.399> high

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
to be fair considering it's not high

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.999 
to be fair considering it's not high
coverage<00:01:57.999> foundation<00:01:58.869> it's<00:01:59.380> covered<00:01:59.859> them

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
coverage foundation it's covered them

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.249 
coverage foundation it's covered them
quite<00:02:00.340> well<00:02:00.369> but<00:02:01.060> what<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.270> like<00:02:01.509> about<00:02:01.539> this<00:02:01.810> so

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
quite well but what I like about this so

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.050 
quite well but what I like about this so
far<00:02:02.289> is<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:02.799> you<00:02:03.189> can<00:02:03.399> still<00:02:03.670> see<00:02:04.030> the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
far is that you can still see the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.809 
far is that you can still see the
texture<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.079> skin<00:02:05.229> through<00:02:05.819> there's

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
texture of the skin through there's

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.680 
texture of the skin through there's
nothing<00:02:07.210> more<00:02:07.420> i<00:02:07.780> dislike<00:02:08.470> on<00:02:08.739> myself<00:02:09.690> its

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
nothing more i dislike on myself its

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.440 
nothing more i dislike on myself its
foundations<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.500> totally<00:02:12.190> musk<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:13.360> know

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
foundations that totally musk you know

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.080 
foundations that totally musk you know
any<00:02:13.750> kind<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.290> texture<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> skin<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.910> make

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
any kind of texture to the skin and make

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.199 
any kind of texture to the skin and make
it<00:02:16.269> look<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.690> little<00:02:17.110> bit<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.500> cardboard<00:02:18.209> this

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
it look a little bit to cardboard this

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.740 
it look a little bit to cardboard this
so<00:02:19.510> far<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.840> working<00:02:20.470> really<00:02:20.650> well<00:02:21.599> what<00:02:22.599> have

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
so far is working really well what have

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.960 
so far is working really well what have
fun<00:02:22.780> with<00:02:23.019> foundations<00:02:23.920> from<00:02:24.190> Rimmel<00:02:24.549> before

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
fun with foundations from Rimmel before

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.080 
fun with foundations from Rimmel before
is<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.840> they<00:02:25.989> do<00:02:26.049> oxidized<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.310> you'll<00:02:27.879> find

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
is that they do oxidized so you'll find

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.339 
is that they do oxidized so you'll find
that<00:02:28.269> they<00:02:28.390> go<00:02:28.540> on<00:02:28.690> all<00:02:28.870> right<00:02:29.079> and<00:02:29.290> then

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
that they go on all right and then

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.020 
that they go on all right and then
through<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.860> day<00:02:30.010> they've<00:02:30.310> gone<00:02:30.549> either<00:02:30.819> a

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
through the day they've gone either a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.900 
through the day they've gone either a
different<00:02:31.510> color<00:02:31.750> or<00:02:32.019> slightly<00:02:32.440> darker<00:02:32.910> in

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
different color or slightly darker in

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.440 
different color or slightly darker in
one<00:02:34.510> case<00:02:34.750> for<00:02:35.079> me<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.470> bit<00:02:35.920> more<00:02:36.069> orange<00:02:36.549> but<00:02:37.360> it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
one case for me a bit more orange but it

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.270 
one case for me a bit more orange but it
was<00:02:37.599> okay<00:02:37.810> at<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> beginning<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.860> day<00:02:39.069> and

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
was okay at the beginning of the day and

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.729 
was okay at the beginning of the day and
it<00:02:39.549> just<00:02:39.730> gradually<00:02:40.690> starts<00:02:41.349> getting<00:02:41.650> the

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
it just gradually starts getting the

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.460 
it just gradually starts getting the
darker<00:02:42.190> which<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.400> dislike<00:02:42.819> so<00:02:43.599> hopefully<00:02:44.290> this

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
darker which I dislike so hopefully this

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
which is great feeling why's it does

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.589 
which is great feeling why's it does
feel<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.220> little<00:03:09.310> bit<00:03:09.609> tacky<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.359> if<00:03:10.450> you're

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
feel a little bit tacky so if you're

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.940 
feel a little bit tacky so if you're
going<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.870> use<00:03:11.049> something<00:03:11.290> like<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.620> powder

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
going to use something like a powder

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.699 
going to use something like a powder
bronzer<00:03:12.430> or<00:03:12.910> powder<00:03:13.599> blush<00:03:13.959> then<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.470> would

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
bronzer or powder blush then I would

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.589 
bronzer or powder blush then I would
suggest<00:03:14.889> that<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.400> use<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.609> mattifying<00:03:16.060> powder

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
suggest that you use a mattifying powder

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.839 
suggest that you use a mattifying powder
or<00:03:16.989> product<00:03:17.410> or<00:03:17.620> loose<00:03:17.919> powder<00:03:18.250> whatever<00:03:18.579> you

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
or product or loose powder whatever you

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.180 
or product or loose powder whatever you
want<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.030> use<00:03:19.180> first<00:03:19.959> before<00:03:20.530> applying<00:03:20.799> them

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
want to use first before applying them

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.759 
want to use first before applying them
otherwise<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.329> will<00:03:22.510> stick<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.230> little<00:03:23.590> bit

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
otherwise it will stick a little bit

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.599 
otherwise it will stick a little bit

needs powder down especially the t-zone
now<00:05:58.070> i<00:05:58.460> would<00:05:58.610> say<00:05:58.940> it<00:05:59.060> suits<00:05:59.360> normal

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.850 
now i would say it suits normal
combination<00:06:01.120> normal<00:06:02.120> dry<00:06:02.360> and<00:06:02.690> dry<00:06:03.260> skin<00:06:03.680> if

very very oily or have problematic skin
then<00:06:09.300> this<00:06:09.540> probably<00:06:09.990> isn't<00:06:10.229> going<00:06:10.470> to<00:06:10.560> be<00:06:10.650> for

you<00:06:26.070> might<00:06:26.220> think<00:06:26.370> what<00:06:26.610> you're<00:06:26.729> talking

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
you might think what you're talking

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.700 
you might think what you're talking
about<00:06:27.090> but<00:06:27.600> I<00:06:27.660> have<00:06:27.900> quite<00:06:28.440> a<00:06:28.500> few<00:06:28.620> here<00:06:29.220> so<00:06:30.030> um

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
about but I have quite a few here so um

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.659 
about but I have quite a few here so um
for<00:06:31.710> that<00:06:31.800> reason<00:06:31.860> I<00:06:32.310> would<00:06:32.370> say<00:06:32.550> it's

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
for that reason I would say it's

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.150 
for that reason I would say it's
probably<00:06:32.760> not<00:06:33.300> the<00:06:33.389> best<00:06:33.419> for<00:06:34.110> anyone<00:06:34.979> who's

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
probably not the best for anyone who's
