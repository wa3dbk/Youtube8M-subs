wherever it is if you're throwing a book

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.340 
wherever it is if you're throwing a book
punch<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.669> need<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.940> support<00:00:33.390> through<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
punch you need that support through the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.900 
punch you need that support through the
bicep<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:35.010> you're<00:00:35.130> tackling<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.670> need<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.850> go

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
bicep if you're tackling you need to go

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.660 
bicep if you're tackling you need to go
to<00:00:35.969> grab<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.510> pull<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> bicep<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.280> also<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
to grab and pull so the bicep is also a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.709 
to grab and pull so the bicep is also a
muscle<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> help<00:00:39.629> you

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
muscle that is going to help you

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.420 
muscle that is going to help you
function<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.290> improve<00:00:40.800> your<00:00:40.920> game<00:00:41.070> as<00:00:41.250> well

function and improve your game as well

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.459 
function and improve your game as well
so<00:00:42.059> let's<00:00:42.180> get<00:00:42.300> into<00:00:42.570> some<00:00:42.600> movements<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
so let's get into some movements for the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.119 
so let's get into some movements for the
bicep<00:00:48.379> first<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> show<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.860> an

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
bicep first going to show you an

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.970 
bicep first going to show you an
exercise<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.850> compound<00:00:51.449> movement<00:00:51.809> which<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
exercise a compound movement which is a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.220 
exercise a compound movement which is a
row<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.850> quickly<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.539> transition<00:00:54.989> from<00:00:55.079> one

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
row so quickly we transition from one

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.310 
row so quickly we transition from one
exercise<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> next<00:00:56.160> now<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.539> triceps<00:00:58.170> we

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
exercise to the next now on triceps we

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560 
exercise to the next now on triceps we
use<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> closed<00:00:58.890> grip<00:00:59.160> bench<00:00:59.640> press<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.480> we're

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
use a closed grip bench press here we're

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.170 
use a closed grip bench press here we're
going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.750> use<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> row<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:02.180> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
going to use a row so we're here and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.719 
going to use a row so we're here and
we're<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> pull<00:01:04.070> working<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.189> bicep

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
we're going to pull working that bicep

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.219 
we're going to pull working that bicep
and<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.479> want<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.780> extra<00:01:07.049> I'm

and if you really want to get extra I'm

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.070 
and if you really want to get extra I'm
Francisco<00:01:07.439> underhand<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:09.210> squeeze

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
Francisco underhand and squeeze

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.929 
Francisco underhand and squeeze
now<00:01:11.040> even<00:01:11.310> though<00:01:11.400> most<00:01:11.549> people<00:01:11.700> will

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
now even though most people will

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.550 
now even though most people will
consider<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> back<00:01:12.689> exercise<00:01:13.020> which<00:01:13.409> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
consider this a back exercise which it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.859 
consider this a back exercise which it
is<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.189> back<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> primary<00:01:14.880> mover<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
is the back is the primary mover but the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
is the back is the primary mover but the
bicep<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.070> working<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
bicep as you can see is working it's the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.740 
bicep as you can see is working it's the
secondary<00:01:18.210> mover<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:20.340> build<00:01:20.580> max<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
secondary mover and to build max in the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.410 
secondary mover and to build max in the
arms<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> put<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.000> time<00:01:24.210> in

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
arms you really have to put your time in

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.929 
arms you really have to put your time in
on<00:01:25.200> these<00:01:25.439> compound<00:01:26.040> movements<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.549> content

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
on these compound movements of content

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.370 
on these compound movements of content
movements<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.450> you're<00:01:27.570> working<00:01:27.750> from

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
movements because you're working from

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.200 
movements because you're working from
multiple<00:01:28.950> joints<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.460> here's<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
multiple joints so here's a that was a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.149 
multiple joints so here's a that was a
great<00:01:30.390> exercise<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.840> build<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.650> mass<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
great exercise to build that mass in the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.700 
great exercise to build that mass in the
bicep<00:01:32.549> now<00:01:33.060> let's<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.390> into<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.930> bicep

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
bicep now let's go into a bicep

all right so then you're in position for
concentration<00:03:11.480> curls<00:03:12.670> into<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.760> minor

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
concentration curls into a minor

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.520 
concentration curls into a minor
adjustment<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.960> change<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.290> focus<00:03:17.410> here<00:03:18.410> we

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
adjustment to change the focus here we

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.890 
adjustment to change the focus here we
are<00:03:19.210> in<00:03:20.210> position<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.350> curl<00:03:22.570> now<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:23.630> see<00:03:23.810> how

are in position and curl now you see how

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.710 
are in position and curl now you see how
this<00:03:23.990> really<00:03:24.170> isolates<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.160> bicep<00:03:25.720> because

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
this really isolates the bicep because

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.630 
this really isolates the bicep because
you're<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:27.050> this<00:03:27.380> preacher<00:03:27.890> curl<00:03:28.100> position

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
you're in this preacher curl position

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.600 
you're in this preacher curl position
there's<00:03:29.420> no<00:03:29.690> chance<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.680> cheat<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.370> can't

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
there's no chance to cheat you can't

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.270 
there's no chance to cheat you can't
really<00:03:31.760> rock<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:33.380> get<00:03:33.470> your<00:03:33.650> shoulders<00:03:33.980> into
