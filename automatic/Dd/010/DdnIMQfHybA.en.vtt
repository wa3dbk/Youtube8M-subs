down like the scope and stuff there's no

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.990 
down like the scope and stuff there's no
way<00:01:47.009> he<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.549> right<00:01:47.670> now

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
way he can do that right now

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.850 
way he can do that right now
there's<00:01:48.299> absolutely<00:01:48.689> no<00:01:48.899> reason<00:01:49.110> or<00:01:49.500> no<00:01:49.680> way

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
there's absolutely no reason or no way

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.679 
there's absolutely no reason or no way
that<00:01:50.100> he<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.549> he<00:01:50.939> does<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> peg

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that he can do that he does have a peg

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.260 
that he can do that he does have a peg
hole<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:51.960> his<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.200> leg<00:01:52.229> big<00:01:52.890> whoop-de-doo

hole in his right leg big whoop-de-doo
because<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.290> moment<00:01:55.350> he<00:01:55.950> can't<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.310> do

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
because at the moment he can't really do

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
because at the moment he can't really do
much<00:01:56.430> anyway<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.090> we'll<00:01:57.990> get<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.170> done

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
much anyway so we'll get that done

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
he looks kind of stupid to me because he

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.930

see<00:02:21.210> why<00:02:21.420> McFarland<00:02:22.320> couldn't<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.800> added<00:02:23.250> a

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
see why McFarland couldn't have added a

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.010 
see why McFarland couldn't have added a
hinge<00:02:23.700> joint<00:02:23.790> right<00:02:24.120> here<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.420> his<00:02:24.540> mouth<00:02:24.660> open

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
hinge joint right here so his mouth open

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.810 
hinge joint right here so his mouth open
and<00:02:25.140> closed<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.440> would<00:02:25.710> have<00:02:25.800> been<00:02:25.920> so

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
and closed that would have been so

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.700 
and closed that would have been so
amazing<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.630> for<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.990> series<00:02:28.440> seven

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.120 
pale gross gross pale this four jackals
you<00:03:23.640> know<00:03:23.730> what<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:23.850> mean<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.630> do<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:25.130> detailed

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
you know what I mean to do a detailed

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.130 
you know what I mean to do a detailed
look<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.610> him<00:03:28.190> he<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:30.360> exact<00:03:30.690> same<00:03:30.930> as

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
look of him he is the exact same as

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.080 
look of him he is the exact same as
jackal<00:03:31.650> majors<00:03:31.980> except<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:32.610> right<00:03:32.790> here<00:03:33.000> on

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
jackal majors except for right here on

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.300 
jackal majors except for right here on
his<00:03:33.209> head<00:03:33.450> he<00:03:34.080> has<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.680> thing<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.010> covers

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
his head he has this thing that covers

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.810 
his head he has this thing that covers
up<00:03:35.660> his<00:03:36.660> left<00:03:37.020> eye<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:38.340> assume<00:03:38.670> it's

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
up his left eye and I assume it's

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.180 
up his left eye and I assume it's
supposed<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.150> be<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.840> help<00:03:39.989> him<00:03:40.230> be<00:03:40.350> able<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.650> be

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
supposed to be to help him be able to be

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.810 
supposed to be to help him be able to be
more<00:03:41.880> accurate<00:03:42.270> with<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.989> beam<00:03:43.140> rifle<00:03:43.500> and

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
more accurate with the beam rifle and

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.430 
more accurate with the beam rifle and
maybe<00:03:44.820> he<00:03:45.150> has<00:03:45.330> some<00:03:45.540> special<00:03:45.690> link<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.350> he

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
maybe he has some special link so he

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.690 
maybe he has some special link so he
doesn't<00:03:46.650> have<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.830> look<00:03:46.950> down<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.160> barrel<00:03:47.370> so

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
doesn't have to look down the barrel so

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.070 
doesn't have to look down the barrel so
maybe<00:03:47.880> he<00:03:48.060> could<00:03:48.180> aim<00:03:48.360> like<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:49.020> he

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
maybe he could aim like this and he

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.479 
maybe he could aim like this and he
could<00:03:49.200> get<00:03:49.290> constant<00:03:49.890> head<00:03:50.010> shots<00:03:50.220> just

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
could get constant head shots just

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.830 
could get constant head shots just
because<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:50.940> way<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:51.720> know

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
because of the way that is you know

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.990 
because of the way that is you know
maybe<00:03:52.290> it's<00:03:52.410> like<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.530> camera<00:03:52.860> interface<00:03:53.610> with

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
maybe it's like a camera interface with

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.280 
maybe it's like a camera interface with
the<00:03:54.120> gun<00:03:54.600> because<00:03:54.750> that's<00:03:54.959> really<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.230> only

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
the gun because that's really the only

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.199 
the gun because that's really the only
good<00:03:55.530> excuse<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.070> possibly<00:03:56.400> think<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.730> for

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
good excuse I can possibly think of for

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.960 
good excuse I can possibly think of for
why<00:03:57.330> he<00:03:57.810> can't<00:03:58.080> aim<00:03:58.530> down<00:03:58.800> his<00:03:59.160> own<00:03:59.310> gun<00:03:59.730> you

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
why he can't aim down his own gun you

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.220 
why he can't aim down his own gun you
know<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.120> mean<00:04:00.270> he<00:04:00.390> can't<00:04:00.600> look<00:04:00.780> down<00:04:00.959> his<00:04:01.110> own

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
know I mean he can't look down his own

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.760 
know I mean he can't look down his own
gun<00:04:01.410> oh<00:04:01.530> look<00:04:01.770> so<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.600> hate<00:04:03.600> these<00:04:03.720> feet<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.230> hate

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
gun oh look so I hate these feet I hate

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.890 
gun oh look so I hate these feet I hate
these<00:04:04.980> feet<00:04:05.220> they're<00:04:05.880> yeah<00:04:06.030> got<00:04:06.600> him<00:04:06.630> posed

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
these feet they're yeah got him posed

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.350 
these feet they're yeah got him posed
that's<00:04:07.140> not<00:04:07.320> too<00:04:07.590> bad<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:07.920> pose<00:04:08.160> if<00:04:08.820> it

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
that's not too bad of a pose if it

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.640 
that's not too bad of a pose if it
wasn't<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.660> beam<00:04:09.810> rifle<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.320> maybe<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.560> was

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
wasn't a beam rifle and maybe it was

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.150 
wasn't a beam rifle and maybe it was
something<00:04:10.800> else

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
something else

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.130 
something else
so<00:04:13.250> articulation<00:04:14.250> on<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.489> jackal

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
so articulation on the jackal

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.320 
so articulation on the jackal
articulation<00:04:16.140> it's<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.799> ball-joint<00:04:17.190> neck<00:04:17.609> so

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
articulation it's a ball-joint neck so

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.979 
articulation it's a ball-joint neck so
you<00:04:18.359> can<00:04:18.690> rotate<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.260> head<00:04:19.380> 360<00:04:19.950> we<00:04:20.540> his<00:04:21.540> arms

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
you can rotate the head 360 we his arms

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.380 
you can rotate the head 360 we his arms
at<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.500> shoulder<00:04:22.890> go<00:04:23.280> up<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.610> down<00:04:24.150> go

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
at the shoulder go up and down go

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.270 
at the shoulder go up and down go
forward<00:04:24.630> backward<00:04:24.780> he<00:04:25.410> has

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
forward backward he has

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.869 
forward backward he has
in<00:04:26.789> a<00:04:27.150> joint<00:04:27.629> right<00:04:28.169> here<00:04:28.349> at<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.889> upper<00:04:29.610> bicep

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
in a joint right here at the upper bicep

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.999 
in a joint right here at the upper bicep
above<00:04:30.599> the<00:04:30.750> bicep<00:04:31.139> but<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.650> doesn't<00:04:31.889> have<00:04:31.979> a

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
above the bicep but it doesn't have a

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.320 
above the bicep but it doesn't have a
very<00:04:32.220> big<00:04:32.370> range<00:04:32.550> so<00:04:34.159> the<00:04:35.159> elbow<00:04:35.460> can<00:04:35.699> bend<00:04:35.940> not

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
very big range so the elbow can bend not

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.580 
very big range so the elbow can bend not
a<00:04:36.360> whole<00:04:36.629> lot<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.680> wrist<00:04:38.039> rotates<00:04:38.610> 360<00:04:39.590> a

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
a whole lot the wrist rotates 360 a

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.619 
a whole lot the wrist rotates 360 a
little<00:04:41.250> bit<00:04:41.370> of<00:04:41.460> waist<00:04:41.610> articulation<00:04:41.819> just

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
little bit of waist articulation just

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.129 
little bit of waist articulation just
enough<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:42.930> make<00:04:42.990> them<00:04:43.139> jiggle<00:04:43.580> his<00:04:44.580> hip<00:04:45.139> can

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
enough to make them jiggle his hip can

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.930 
enough to make them jiggle his hip can
go<00:04:46.470> in<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.770> out<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:46.949> you<00:04:47.039> can<00:04:47.069> also<00:04:47.250> rotate<00:04:47.580> it

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
go in and out and you can also rotate it

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.100 
go in and out and you can also rotate it
so<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.210> know<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.569> can<00:04:48.690> have<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.810> lake<00:04:48.990> going

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
so you know you can have a lake going

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.089 
so you know you can have a lake going
forward<00:04:49.409> and<00:04:49.470> backward<00:04:49.740> or<00:04:49.770> side-to-side

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
forward and backward or side-to-side

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.939 
forward and backward or side-to-side
it's<00:04:50.430> up<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.639> you<00:04:50.759> the<00:04:51.419> knee<00:04:52.080> can<00:04:52.530> go<00:04:52.650> forward

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
it's up to you the knee can go forward

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.830 
it's up to you the knee can go forward
and<00:04:53.039> backward<00:04:53.370> then<00:04:53.879> his<00:04:54.090> ankle<00:04:54.509> can<00:04:54.720> go

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
and backward then his ankle can go

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.180 
and backward then his ankle can go
forward<00:04:55.139> and<00:04:55.259> backward<00:04:55.530> or<00:04:55.680> if<00:04:55.770> you<00:04:55.830> rotate<00:04:56.129> it

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
forward and backward or if you rotate it

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.969 
forward and backward or if you rotate it
side<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.370> side<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:56.849> it<00:04:56.909> can<00:04:57.000> also<00:04:57.150> twist<00:04:57.509> 360

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
side to side and it can also twist 360

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.990 
side to side and it can also twist 360
he<00:04:58.979> also<00:04:59.130> has<00:04:59.430> peg<00:04:59.669> holes<00:04:59.909> in<00:05:00.090> his<00:05:00.270> feet<00:05:00.509> so

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
he also has peg holes in his feet so

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.860 
he also has peg holes in his feet so
don't<00:05:03.000> know<00:05:03.180> what's<00:05:03.389> up<00:05:03.509> with<00:05:03.659> that

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
don't know what's up with that

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.390 
don't know what's up with that
unless<00:05:04.409> they're<00:05:04.560> trying<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:04.860> go<00:05:05.009> for<00:05:05.280> like

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
unless they're trying to go for like

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.770
