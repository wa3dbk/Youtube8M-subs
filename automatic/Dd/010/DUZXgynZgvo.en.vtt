00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
of the arrival of that asteroid and you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.249 
of the arrival of that asteroid and you
have<00:02:04.979> some<00:02:05.189> very<00:02:05.399> strange<00:02:06.020> coincidences<00:02:07.020> that

have some very strange coincidences that

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.380 
have some very strange coincidences that
it<00:02:07.860> seems<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.310> officials<00:02:08.759> are<00:02:09.000> not<00:02:09.149> being

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
it seems the officials are not being

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.330 
it seems the officials are not being
upfront<00:02:09.629> about<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.440> what<00:02:10.709> are<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.950> trying<00:02:11.129> to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
upfront about so what are you trying to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.920 
upfront about so what are you trying to
say<00:02:11.430> here

Brooks<00:02:12.079> I<00:02:12.200> mean<00:02:12.379> you're<00:02:12.769> saying<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.280> there

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
Brooks I mean you're saying that there

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.020 
Brooks I mean you're saying that there
are<00:02:13.609> some<00:02:13.790> dots<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.329> be<00:02:14.450> connected<00:02:14.780> here<00:02:16.030> what

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
are some dots to be connected here what

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.610 
are some dots to be connected here what
are<00:02:17.060> they<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.569> what's<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.989> conclusion<00:02:18.170> we

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
are they and what's the conclusion we

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.099 
are they and what's the conclusion we
should<00:02:18.799> be<00:02:18.890> led<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.390> well<00:02:20.390> it's<00:02:20.659> a<00:02:20.750> much<00:02:20.900> bigger

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109

this comment well what we should be

there<00:03:57.590> are<00:03:57.620> a<00:03:57.799> lot<00:03:58.009> of<00:03:58.040> forces<00:03:58.549> working<00:03:58.790> on

this comet as it travels through our

this comet as it travels through our
solar<00:04:00.799> system<00:04:01.220> from<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.489> very<00:04:01.729> odd<00:04:01.970> angle<00:04:02.449> and

not<00:04:03.319> all<00:04:03.560> of<00:04:03.739> them<00:04:03.859> have<00:04:04.009> been<00:04:04.159> calculated<00:04:04.909> so

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
not all of them have been calculated so

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.030 
not all of them have been calculated so
we're<00:04:05.569> kind<00:04:05.750> of<00:04:05.840> making<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:06.259> guess<00:04:06.530> as<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:06.799> where

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
we're kind of making a guess as to where

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.129 
we're kind of making a guess as to where
this<00:04:07.189> thing<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:07.430> going<00:04:07.549> to<00:04:07.669> end<00:04:07.879> up<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.359> I

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
this thing is going to end up and I

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.800 
this thing is going to end up and I
guess<00:04:09.519> you<00:04:10.519> know<00:04:10.639> may<00:04:10.819> not<00:04:11.030> be<00:04:11.150> good<00:04:11.329> enough<00:04:11.569> as

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
guess you know may not be good enough as

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.830 
guess you know may not be good enough as
the<00:04:12.439> earth<00:04:12.650> gets<00:04:13.159> close<00:04:13.400> enough<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:14.150> this<00:04:14.569> and

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
the earth gets close enough to this and

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.499 
the earth gets close enough to this and
other<00:04:15.169> bodies<00:04:15.620> like<00:04:15.799> yu55<00:04:16.400> this<00:04:17.090> cut<00:04:17.329> this

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:17.509 
other bodies like yu55 this cut this

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.930 
other bodies like yu55 this cut this
asteroid<00:04:17.959> that's<00:04:18.229> coming<00:04:18.530> in<00:04:18.680> we're<00:04:19.430> going<00:04:19.669> to

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
asteroid that's coming in we're going to

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.060 
asteroid that's coming in we're going to
see<00:04:20.120> some<00:04:20.479> very<00:04:20.659> near<00:04:21.019> misses<00:04:21.440> with<00:04:21.620> our<00:04:21.769> plane

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
see some very near misses with our plane

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.150 
see some very near misses with our plane
that's<00:04:22.900> maybe<00:04:23.900> not<00:04:24.020> alarming<00:04:24.680> but<00:04:24.890> when<00:04:25.070> you

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
that's maybe not alarming but when you

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.400 
that's maybe not alarming but when you
look<00:04:25.460> at<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:25.910> literally<00:04:26.540> billions<00:04:27.050> of

look at the literally billions of

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.930 
look at the literally billions of
dollars<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:27.980> governments<00:04:28.490> are<00:04:28.610> spending

all over the world to build underground

shelters and storage capacities you

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.620 
shelters and storage capacities you
wonder<00:04:34.040> if<00:04:34.220> they<00:04:34.580> know<00:04:34.610> something<00:04:35.270> we<00:04:35.450> don't

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
wonder if they know something we don't

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.480 
wonder if they know something we don't
well<00:04:36.110> why<00:04:36.290> haven't<00:04:36.440> I<00:04:36.680> gotten<00:04:36.890> anything<00:04:37.130> in<00:04:37.340> my

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
underground shelter is to me I mean is

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.210 
underground shelter is to me I mean is
this<00:04:40.850> something<00:04:41.030> that<00:04:41.240> you<00:04:41.900> think<00:04:42.230> you<00:04:43.100> know

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
this something that you think you know

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.120 
this something that you think you know
based<00:04:43.520> on<00:04:43.790> the<00:04:44.720> fear<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.260> that<00:04:45.500> perhaps<00:04:45.770> we

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
based on the fear that that perhaps we

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.730 
based on the fear that that perhaps we
should<00:04:46.400> have<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:46.970> people<00:04:47.750> should<00:04:47.930> be<00:04:48.080> you

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
should have that people should be you

should have that people should be you
know<00:04:48.890> given<00:04:49.520> notice<00:04:49.850> of<00:04:50.800> well<00:04:51.800> I<00:04:51.830> think<00:04:52.100> it's

know given notice of well I think it's

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.550 
know given notice of well I think it's
worth<00:04:52.640> a<00:04:52.820> raised<00:04:53.030> eyebrow<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:53.540> I'm<00:04:53.780> sorry<00:04:54.350> you

didn't get your notice but I think that

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.430 
didn't get your notice but I think that
