00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
see I got a line of twelve pound

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.880 
see I got a line of twelve pound
monofilament<00:00:54.309> line<00:00:55.210> so<00:00:55.750> you<00:00:55.839> do<00:00:55.960> is<00:00:56.110> you<00:00:56.320> meet

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
monofilament line so you do is you meet

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.579 
monofilament line so you do is you meet
your<00:00:57.129> tag<00:00:57.879> end<00:00:57.909> you<00:00:58.629> meet<00:00:59.049> it<00:00:59.170> with<00:00:59.259> your<00:00:59.409> thumb

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
your tag end you meet it with your thumb

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.880 
your tag end you meet it with your thumb
so<00:00:59.739> it's<00:00:59.890> like<00:00:59.979> that<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:01.210> pull<00:01:01.449> up<00:01:01.689> you<00:01:02.680> keep

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
so it's like that you pull up you keep

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.770 
so it's like that you pull up you keep
keep<00:01:03.489> it<00:01:03.610> wrapped<00:01:03.850> around<00:01:04.059> your<00:01:04.329> thumb<00:01:04.600> right

keep it wrapped around your thumb right

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.950 
keep it wrapped around your thumb right
here<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:06.100> swing<00:01:06.579> it<00:01:06.610> around<00:01:06.880> like<00:01:07.659> that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
here and you swing it around like that

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.010 
here and you swing it around like that
and<00:01:08.530> you<00:01:08.890> got<00:01:09.040> seven<00:01:09.430> times<00:01:09.610> so<00:01:09.790> one<00:01:10.180> two<00:01:10.479> three

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
and you got seven times so one two three

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.530 
and you got seven times so one two three
four<00:01:11.380> five<00:01:11.740> six<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.400> I<00:01:12.700> already<00:01:12.939> did<00:01:13.060> one<00:01:13.240> so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
four five six and I already did one so

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.050 
four five six and I already did one so
that's<00:01:14.140> that<00:01:14.619> should<00:01:14.829> be<00:01:14.920> seven<00:01:15.310> then<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:15.939> can

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
that's that should be seven then you can

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.330 
that's that should be seven then you can
see<00:01:16.270> there<00:01:16.509> the<00:01:16.960> loop<00:01:17.259> right<00:01:17.530> above<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.979> split

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
see there the loop right above the split

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.219 
see there the loop right above the split
ring<00:01:18.369> on<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.850> red<00:01:19.000> eye<00:01:19.030> there's<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:20.020> loop

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
ring on the red eye there's that loop

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.899 
ring on the red eye there's that loop
right<00:01:20.259> there<00:01:20.649> you<00:01:21.040> want<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.220> stick<00:01:21.490> your<00:01:21.520> tag

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909

right there you want to stick your tag
end<00:01:22.240> through<00:01:22.270> that<00:01:22.900> loop<00:01:23.140> so<00:01:23.440> you<00:01:24.430> stick<00:01:24.880> it

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
end through that loop so you stick it

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.880 
end through that loop so you stick it
through<00:01:25.000> sometimes<00:01:25.900> I<00:01:25.990> use<00:01:26.110> my<00:01:26.200> teeth<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.710> grab

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
through sometimes I use my teeth to grab

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.690 
through sometimes I use my teeth to grab
it<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:28.210> grab<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.630> tag<00:01:28.870> end<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:30.400> right

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
it so grab the tag end and then right

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.030 
it so grab the tag end and then right
where<00:01:30.850> your<00:01:30.970> thumb<00:01:31.180> was<00:01:31.390> comes<00:01:32.229> off<00:01:32.440> as<00:01:32.650> a<00:01:32.680> loop

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
where your thumb was comes off as a loop

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.570 
where your thumb was comes off as a loop
and<00:01:33.690> you<00:01:34.690> stick<00:01:34.990> your<00:01:35.620> tag<00:01:35.920> in<00:01:36.070> through<00:01:36.340> that

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
and then you meet the tag end up with

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.060 
and then you meet the tag end up with
your<00:01:40.600> main<00:01:40.810> line<00:01:41.080> here<00:01:41.290> that<00:01:41.320> b.title<00:01:41.799> into

and<00:02:07.360> then<00:02:07.479> it's<00:02:07.630> just<00:02:07.780> slide<00:02:07.990> down<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.560> as

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
and then it's just slide down and as

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.660 
and then it's just slide down and as
soon<00:02:09.009> as<00:02:09.099> it<00:02:09.250> meets<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:10.319> tag<00:02:11.319> on<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.890> hour

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
soon as it meets that tag on the hour

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.119

tug<00:02:12.939> on<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.269> tag<00:02:13.510> end<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.590> that's<00:02:14.739> kind<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.040> a

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
tug on the tag end so that's kind of a

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.880 
tug on the tag end so that's kind of a
loose<00:02:15.370> knot<00:02:15.670> just<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:17.200> have<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.349> kind<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.709> hold

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
loose knot just you have to kind of hold

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.920 
loose knot just you have to kind of hold
it<00:02:18.010> down<00:02:18.189> and<00:02:18.489> then<00:02:19.120> pull<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:19.689> it<00:02:19.780> tightens

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
it down and then pull it so it tightens

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.890 
it down and then pull it so it tightens
up<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.170> knot<00:02:20.409> a<00:02:20.439> little<00:02:20.500> bit<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:21.159> then<00:02:22.090> so

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
up the knot a little bit and then so

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.059 
up the knot a little bit and then so
it's<00:02:23.049> like<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> loop<00:02:23.379> knot<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.769> then<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.950> just

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
it's like a loop knot and then you just

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.369 
it's like a loop knot and then you just
pull<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:24.640> should<00:02:24.849> slide<00:02:25.090> down<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.599> you

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
pull it and it should slide down and you

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.920 
pull it and it should slide down and you
can<00:02:27.069> pause<00:02:27.219> ties<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.700> want<00:02:27.909> so<00:02:28.540> that's<00:02:28.689> like

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
can pause ties you want so that's like

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.790 
can pause ties you want so that's like
what<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.319> knot<00:02:29.499> looks<00:02:29.680> like

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
what the knot looks like

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.710 
what the knot looks like
and<00:02:31.250> then<00:02:31.490> obviously<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:32.000> cut<00:02:32.300> off<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.540> tag

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
and then obviously you cut off the tag

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.300 
and then obviously you cut off the tag
in<00:02:32.900> pretty<00:02:33.530> sure<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:33.710> is<00:02:33.830> called<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.100> san
