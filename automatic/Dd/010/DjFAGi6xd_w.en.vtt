00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.250
 and here we are with the teacher mirta 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.789
 download this rule good morning 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.920
 well very well baking a cake 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:20.750
 carving a cake on a cake 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.380
 beautiful made in a can of peaches 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.810
 how exactly that sounds like me or cake 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.240
 what start as a lathe of cake or fate 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.340
 that the mother makes several cars and each 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.579
 boy gets a good pancake 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.789
 thanks standards good as well as said 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.100
 standard let's cook this cake in a 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.920
 can of peaches we have the mante 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.269
 avian karim well we cook it 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.129
 we unmold the ideal is to make it more or 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.440
 less one or two days before so that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.629
 cake is well parked that to make 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.519
 Once I have this, if I had one left 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.010
 I'm going to carve very high 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.120
 all the edge quoted from that copete wants 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.300
 relieve remove 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.420
 the part of a side that is going to be the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.180
 basis of this car so we then remove 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.880
 this part and I'm going to cut one of a 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.149
 side stand 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.350
 about one centimeter and another 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.180
 another side 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.240
 we need a cake that is 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.979
 stationed to be able to carve the with 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.090
 ease then with a rule we're going to 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.190
 take the measure and we take 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.190
 approximately 5 centimeters 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.950
 and we take 4 here this part of here is the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.300
 part that we're going to do where it's going to 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.520
 sit this doll that we have modeled 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.590
 then we are cutting and we are going 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.060
 removing the cake portion 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.810
 then in the part that would be of the trunk 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.329
 let's round up and down a little bit 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.670
 this is very simple to do they have to 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.460
 Buck up 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.960
 because at the time of the celebration of our 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.240
 children that each of the boys is 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.130
 take a pancake of these is very cute 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.930
 you can then put the name to 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.000
 every little car to do it more 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.770
 personalized 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.610
 once we did this here we are going to 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.810
 start to go down 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.810
 the front part 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.300
 to make the trumpet of the car 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.340
 here we have the radiator we are going to place 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.709
 a mold cited that you can 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.580
 perform we leave a bit for the 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.050
 bumper 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.050
 and we are cutting 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.110
 in this way with a good knife 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.180
 sharp with these teeth can be 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.090
 perfectly and in this way we go 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.510
 giving it the form 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.330
 We are there 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.090
 we are withdrawing in rounded form is 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.459
 preferable to do it little by little because if 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.439
 we get confused and cut a piece of 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.269
 blow after we're going to have to do 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.670
 with all these crumbs as if it were a 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.480
 pastiche with dulce de leche for 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.099
 solve the problem and go back to 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.690
 fill then try to cut from to 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:06.940
 I cut a little bit, I 'm taking it out 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.660
 until more or less realize 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.790
 of what I want to achieve yes 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.430
 let's get a little more and the part 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.010
 from behind we will lower it a little bit more 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.280
 because it's always lower than the part 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.280
 from ahead 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.380
 once we have this 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.569
 what we are going to do 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.749
 let's cut a little bit more 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.639
 in this way once I have done 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:36.819
 what we have to do is like 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.290
 we were going to soften all the cuts that 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.319
 we did with the knife then to 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.540
 that we are going to use a grater 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.770
 that way we're going to totally smooth 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.780
 the piece 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.360
 then what we are going to do 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.420
 with the grater 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.240
 let's have it with both of us 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.030
 with the firm hand the cake we are going to 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.490
 pass the grater to smooth completely 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.980
 the whole surface like this when we 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.530
 we put this together with sweet the team bouquets 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.520
 we are left to massa well lawful and the car 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.760
 well visit 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.700
 well this way 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.840
 we go through and we are doing absolutely 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.840
 the entire surface 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:25.000
 we are removing everything that could have 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.000
 remained marked with the knife 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.610
 if we go past once you 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.650
 they have this what they are going to do they are going to 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.120
 put it together with dulce de leche and once 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.000
 who lamented well with dulce de leche and 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.320
 they will cover it with the dough 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.090
 cakes and then we have 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.830
 worked of course as always 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.740
 let's work with plates to stretch 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.990
 the dough with the purple plates and with 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.190
 the little stick that is very good 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.720
 because it is non-stick 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.760
 and once we have done this 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.710
 we absolutely lined the whole pancake 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.930
 let's line the cake with the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.910
 Flavor dyes remember that for 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.610
 achieve the red color what is important is 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.140
 I have pasta I left more or 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.560
 less than one day to the other so that the 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.320
 color take well very strong and then what 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.810
 use do not have to try to achieve the 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.790
 red at the same time because it's a 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.890
 color that it costs to take and if you 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.750
 exceed in the dye will saturate the 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.180
 mass then the important thing is that 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.790
 they had little by little how are we going to do 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.800
 the wheels 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.620
 they will cover you once they lined 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.050
 we stretch a finite paste with a stick 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.840
 brown texture and we mark the seat 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.910
 we roll in yellow and then 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.740
 the wheels are very simple simply 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.930
 balls that you are going to flatten with 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.510
 palm of the hand and once they flattened 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.730
 with a little note mark the center and 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.160
 Mark and put a piece of pasta 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.800
 yellow let's paste here one of the 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.289
 wheels 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.610
 let's say one on one side and another on the other 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.349
 here we will always do it with 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.199
 glue 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:58.900
 of glue use the cmc let's 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.550
 help us in this case with a toothpick 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.979
 that we are going to place it there we put a 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.990
 wheel of this side and another wheel 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.639
 on the other side like this 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:14.129
 and we put one and we put another 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.129
 let's cut the bumpers afterwards 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.460
 let's cut all these pieces 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.069
 the fender that this one is placed on 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.900
 this way here then I'm going to place 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.320
 also a little bit of glue 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.070
 there 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.650
 and we are going to paste 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.420
 we go to this side so I see it well 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.540
 one on this side 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.030
 notice that this is done very quickly and 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.380
 It's very easy to make, I used 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.030
 a red color because I think it's a 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.390
 very cute and very cheerful color for 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.810
 guys let's paste the part of 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.810
 ahead 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.880
 so we put a little bit of glue 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:59.660
 I also did it with the stick 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:02.590
 remember that I did it there 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.590
 and we are here 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.160
 let's put this that we're going to paste it 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.980
 down here 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.500
 and that's how we put our whole car together 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.440
 which is very simple and very simple for 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.670
 you can put it together 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.670
 we put this here 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:24.390
 we put here the part of the trunk also 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.850
 that if we are commanding it this way 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.350
 it's very simple to do it and the 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.900
 true that machines can do with 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.870
 enough anticipation to elaborate 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.220
 board if we put the name also 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.110
 how the name was written here in this 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.080
 case I put a joke on a rabbit 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.030
 some test that anchored worm 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.130
 written to make it look nice and this 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.260
 way let's see guys if we are 

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.510
 take a pancake and your souvenir is 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.400
 beautiful, really, we see each other 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:54.680
 next see you we see your work 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.680
 thanks until the next all the next
