 I did not count but I know 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.790

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.519
 chain and there in one minute barrel 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.099
 how successful is it that the 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.769

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:14.939

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.159
 10the three more and even better than the 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.389
 first time you had done 17 in going 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.280
 withdraw from them because you were out 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.530
 and here I think there is even one who 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.920
 was removed because you were out 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.799
 also 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.349
 so it's still very powerful 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.150
 do you believe that prevailing understanding 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.659
 even later will come to close or there 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.069

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.680

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.139

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.970

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.660

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.790
