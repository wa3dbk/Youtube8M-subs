00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
it would sprout dummy really house i

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.680 
it would sprout dummy really house i
guess<00:03:18.260> ice<00:03:18.470> right<00:03:19.160> here<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.669> it<00:03:20.239> will<00:03:20.299> sprout

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
guess ice right here and it will sprout

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.120 
guess ice right here and it will sprout
um<00:03:22.150> stems<00:03:23.150> out<00:03:23.359> of<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.660> so<00:03:24.109> and<00:03:24.380> i<00:03:24.739> will<00:03:24.889> try<00:03:25.069> to

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
um stems out of it so and i will try to

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.059 
um stems out of it so and i will try to
grow<00:03:25.340> this<00:03:25.639> one<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.750> that<00:03:26.900> potato<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:27.680> won't

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
soak in the water and we'll see if roots

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.150 
soak in the water and we'll see if roots
will<00:03:32.780> come<00:03:32.959> on<00:03:33.079> and<00:03:33.290> simple<00:03:33.680> come<00:03:33.859> up<00:03:33.980> we'll

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:10.009 
sees inside and what I've done is I

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.640 
sees inside and what I've done is I
placed<00:04:10.310> some<00:04:10.400> seed<00:04:10.759> in<00:04:10.970> this<00:04:11.120> soil<00:04:11.650> right

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
placed some seed in this soil right

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.450 
placed some seed in this soil right
there

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
there

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.850 
there
and<00:04:13.550> I<00:04:14.240> did<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:15.080> method<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.740> other

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
and I did that method and the other

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.820 
and I did that method and the other
method<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.580> that<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:16.880> place<00:04:17.300> some<00:04:17.690> seeds<00:04:18.020> and<00:04:18.320> a

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
method is that a place some seeds and a

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.640 
method is that a place some seeds and a
zip<00:04:19.100> loc<00:04:19.310> method<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:20.630> we'll<00:04:20.960> see<00:04:21.200> how<00:04:21.230> well

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
zip loc method so we'll see how well

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.410 
zip loc method so we'll see how well
this<00:04:21.890> girl<00:04:22.130> this<00:04:22.280> is<00:04:22.340> like<00:04:22.670> a<00:04:22.820> week<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.390> half

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
going on there yet it's probably a slow

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
good I've never I don't think I've seen

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.760 
good I've never I don't think I've seen
a<00:04:37.120> video<00:04:38.120> on<00:04:38.540> how<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.810> grow<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.080> pineapple<00:04:39.350> from

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
a video on how to grow a pineapple from

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.220 
a video on how to grow a pineapple from
seeds<00:04:40.100> also<00:04:40.490> this<00:04:41.090> one<00:04:41.330> this<00:04:41.690> one<00:04:41.930> is<00:04:41.960> the

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
seeds also this one this one is the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.290 
seeds also this one this one is the
honey<00:04:42.500> very<00:04:42.910> also<00:04:43.910> called<00:04:44.510> um<00:04:45.070> mamacita<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.340> I

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
honey very also called um mamacita and I

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.510 
honey very also called um mamacita and I
did<00:04:47.750> look<00:04:47.960> in<00:04:48.170> youtube<00:04:48.560> for<00:04:48.830> videos<00:04:48.860> kind<00:04:49.430> of

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
did look in youtube for videos kind of

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.570 
did look in youtube for videos kind of
grow<00:04:49.700> it<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:50.720> didn't<00:04:51.140> see<00:04:51.320> any<00:04:51.500> so<00:04:52.310> that's

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
grow it and I didn't see any so that's

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.190 
grow it and I didn't see any so that's
why<00:04:52.700> I<00:04:52.730> have<00:04:53.000> three<00:04:53.270> different<00:04:53.480> methods<00:04:53.750> and

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
why I have three different methods and

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.880 
why I have three different methods and
hopefully<00:04:55.130> one<00:04:55.340> of<00:04:55.400> them<00:04:55.640> is<00:04:55.850> a<00:04:55.880> success<00:04:56.530> so<00:04:57.530> I

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
hopefully one of them is a success so I

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.420 
hopefully one of them is a success so I
did<00:04:58.220> try<00:04:58.700> another<00:04:59.120> method<00:04:59.770> but<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.920> is<00:05:01.070> out<00:05:01.280> in

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
did try another method but it is out in

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.660 
did try another method but it is out in
my<00:05:01.550> patio<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.900> did<00:05:03.350> them<00:05:03.620> for<00:05:04.100> the<00:05:04.160> other<00:05:04.250> this

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
covered in ziploc bag so i will do a

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.590 
covered in ziploc bag so i will do a
video<00:05:22.070> on<00:05:22.280> that<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.790> we'll<00:05:23.030> see<00:05:23.210> how<00:05:23.420> well
