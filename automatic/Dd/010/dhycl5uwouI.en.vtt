00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
Cruise's really good actor Morgan

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.120 
Cruise's really good actor Morgan
Freeman<00:03:36.239> hardly<00:03:37.110> any<00:03:37.320> Morgan<00:03:37.739> Freeman<00:03:38.040> in

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
Freeman hardly any Morgan Freeman in

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.380 
Freeman hardly any Morgan Freeman in
this<00:03:38.220> movie<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.520> hope<00:03:38.700> no<00:03:38.970> one's<00:03:39.120> going<00:03:39.360> for

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
this movie I hope no one's going for

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.670 
this movie I hope no one's going for
Morgan<00:03:39.750> Freeman<00:03:40.080> I<00:03:40.140> thought<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.560> was<00:03:40.650> very

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
Morgan Freeman I thought it was very

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.120 
Morgan Freeman I thought it was very
pretty<00:03:41.040> film<00:03:41.280> uh<00:03:42.080> read<00:03:43.080> before<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.530> was<00:03:43.890> shot

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
pretty film uh read before it was shot

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.440 
pretty film uh read before it was shot
on<00:03:44.160> digital<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.150> thought<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.390> looked

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
on digital and I thought it looked

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.630 
on digital and I thought it looked
really<00:03:45.720> good<00:03:45.959> there's<00:03:46.650> one<00:03:46.950> scene<00:03:47.340> at<00:03:47.580> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
really good there's one scene at the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.590 
really good there's one scene at the
beginning<00:03:47.940> when<00:03:48.090> they're<00:03:48.209> having<00:03:48.300> dinner

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
beginning when they're having dinner

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.540 
beginning when they're having dinner
with<00:03:48.750> candlelight<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.500> thought<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.370> was

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
with candlelight and I thought that was

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.640 
with candlelight and I thought that was
a<00:03:50.610> really<00:03:50.670> pretty<00:03:51.180> scene<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.780> looked<00:03:51.810> genuine

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
a really pretty scene it looked genuine

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.740 
a really pretty scene it looked genuine
like<00:03:52.860> that<00:03:53.459> was<00:03:53.580> their<00:03:53.760> main<00:03:53.910> source<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.510> wasn't

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
like that was their main source I wasn't

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.970 
like that was their main source I wasn't
really<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.140> impressed<00:03:55.470> with<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.650> visuals

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
really that impressed with the visuals

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.270 
really that impressed with the visuals
of<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.220> movie<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.550> think<00:03:57.030> after<00:03:57.989> seeing

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
of this movie I think after seeing

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.070 
of this movie I think after seeing
Joseph<00:03:59.280> Kosinski's<00:03:59.820> work<00:04:00.000> on<00:04:00.180> Tron<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.810> think

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
Joseph Kosinski's work on Tron I think

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.630 
Joseph Kosinski's work on Tron I think
the<00:04:01.230> design<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.890> movie<00:04:02.160> was<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.370> lot<00:04:02.610> more

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
the design of that movie was a lot more

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.729 
the design of that movie was a lot more
impressive<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.959> really<00:04:04.410> like<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.709> way

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
impressive and I really like the way

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.560 
impressive and I really like the way
tron<00:04:05.070> looked<00:04:05.370> even<00:04:05.760> if<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:06.000> thought<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.330> story

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
tron looked even if I thought the story

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.030 
tron looked even if I thought the story
had<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.750> lot<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:06.959> problems<00:04:07.440> also<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.920> other

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
had a lot of problems also the other

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.470 
had a lot of problems also the other
thing<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.280> was<00:04:08.459> weird<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.850> me<00:04:08.970> is<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.300> this

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
thing that was weird to me is that this

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.810 
thing that was weird to me is that this
film<00:04:09.690> has<00:04:09.900> such<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.260> tease<00:04:10.530> moments<00:04:11.130> with<00:04:11.790> the

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
film has such a tease moments with the

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.759 
film has such a tease moments with the
music<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.600> lighting<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.140> shots<00:04:13.470> and

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
music and the lighting and the shots and

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.710 
music and the lighting and the shots and
Tom<00:04:13.950> Cruise<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.489> an<00:04:14.610> 80<00:04:14.790> *<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.269> pretty<00:04:15.660> much

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
Tom Cruise is an 80 * and pretty much

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.870 
Tom Cruise is an 80 * and pretty much
looks<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.049> same<00:04:16.230> as<00:04:16.380> he<00:04:16.470> did<00:04:16.650> in<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.859> 80s<00:04:16.890> that

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
looks the same as he did in the 80s that

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.970 
looks the same as he did in the 80s that
it's<00:04:18.269> just<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.930> weird<00:04:19.169> choice<00:04:19.500> like<00:04:19.830> there

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
it's just a weird choice like there

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.650 
it's just a weird choice like there
seemed<00:04:20.190> like<00:04:20.340> shots<00:04:20.609> right<00:04:20.910> out<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.180> like<00:04:21.479> the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
seemed like shots right out of like the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.180 
seemed like shots right out of like the
sex<00:04:21.870> scene<00:04:22.080> in<00:04:22.109> Top<00:04:22.380> Gun<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.740> seems<00:04:23.039> like

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
sex scene in Top Gun it seems like

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.380 
sex scene in Top Gun it seems like
you're<00:04:23.310> being<00:04:23.460> nitpicky<00:04:23.640> but<00:04:23.910> not<00:04:24.180> really

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
you're being nitpicky but not really

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.350 
you're being nitpicky but not really
because<00:04:24.720> if<00:04:25.310> there's<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.370> lot<00:04:26.550> of<00:04:26.580> advance

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
because if there's a lot of advance

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.029 
because if there's a lot of advance

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.490 
technology in this movie you could see

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.519 
know this makes me rethink that a little
bit<00:05:06.419> when<00:05:06.539> I<00:05:06.599> see<00:05:06.779> a<00:05:06.810> movie<00:05:07.050> like<00:05:07.139> this<00:05:07.319> because

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:07.529 
bit when I see a movie like this because

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.619 
bit when I see a movie like this because
I<00:05:07.650> think<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.250> audience<00:05:08.400> needs<00:05:08.819> to<00:05:09.150> go<00:05:09.300> through

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:09.629 
I think the audience needs to go through

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:10.820 
I think the audience needs to go through
it<00:05:09.750> with<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.990> characters<00:05:10.439> i<00:05:10.650> need<00:05:10.800> that

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
it with the characters i need that

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.429 
it with the characters i need that
emotional<00:05:11.430> hook<00:05:11.639> to<00:05:12.569> really<00:05:12.840> be<00:05:12.990> rooted<00:05:13.349> in

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:13.439 
emotional hook to really be rooted in

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.159 
emotional hook to really be rooted in
the<00:05:13.529> story<00:05:13.830> so<00:05:14.219> you<00:05:15.120> know<00:05:15.210> maybe<00:05:15.419> doing<00:05:15.840> origin

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
the story so you know maybe doing origin

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.230 
the story so you know maybe doing origin
stories<00:05:16.500> isn't<00:05:17.189> such<00:05:17.310> a<00:05:17.340> bad<00:05:17.520> idea<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:18.090> this

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
stories isn't such a bad idea and this

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.390 
stories isn't such a bad idea and this
film<00:05:18.539> desperately<00:05:19.529> needed<00:05:19.800> an<00:05:19.919> origin<00:05:20.370> story

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
film desperately needed an origin story

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.459 
film desperately needed an origin story
I<00:05:20.789> do<00:05:20.879> like<00:05:21.210> Tom<00:05:21.419> Cruise<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.779> think<00:05:22.199> he<00:05:22.319> usually

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:22.469 
I do like Tom Cruise I think he usually

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:24.679 
I do like Tom Cruise I think he usually
picks<00:05:22.860> movies<00:05:23.310> that<00:05:23.490> are<00:05:23.580> very<00:05:23.669> solid<00:05:24.270> they

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:24.689 
picks movies that are very solid they

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:26.209 
picks movies that are very solid they
might<00:05:24.840> not<00:05:24.990> be<00:05:25.080> amazing<00:05:25.590> and<00:05:25.800> they<00:05:25.860> may<00:05:25.979> have<00:05:26.189> a

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
might not be amazing and they may have a

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:27.589 
might not be amazing and they may have a
couple<00:05:26.490> issues<00:05:26.789> but<00:05:27.090> they're<00:05:27.210> usually<00:05:27.330> really

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
couple issues but they're usually really

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.899 
couple issues but they're usually really
solid<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.199> watchable<00:05:28.529> this<00:05:29.159> is<00:05:29.310> almost

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
solid and watchable this is almost

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.820 
solid and watchable this is almost
completely<00:05:30.360> unwatchable<00:05:30.719> all<00:05:31.139> in<00:05:31.259> all<00:05:31.379> it's

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
completely unwatchable all in all it's

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.019 
completely unwatchable all in all it's
not<00:05:31.979> a<00:05:32.839> terrible<00:05:33.839> film<00:05:34.319> in<00:05:34.469> my<00:05:34.589> opinion<00:05:34.919> it's<00:05:35.909> a

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.029 
not a terrible film in my opinion it's a

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.390 
not a terrible film in my opinion it's a
harmless<00:05:36.270> dumb<00:05:36.870> stupid<00:05:37.589> film<00:05:37.800> that<00:05:38.039> makes<00:05:38.190> no

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
harmless dumb stupid film that makes no

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.680 
harmless dumb stupid film that makes no
sense<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.879> one<00:05:39.089> thing<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.509> actually

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
sense the one thing that I actually

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.450 
sense the one thing that I actually
really<00:05:40.139> liked<00:05:40.379> about<00:05:40.529> the<00:05:40.770> movie<00:05:41.039> were<00:05:41.279> the

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
really liked about the movie were the

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.269 
really liked about the movie were the
drones<00:05:41.789> that<00:05:42.060> he<00:05:42.360> does<00:05:42.930> maintenance<00:05:43.199> on<00:05:43.500> there

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
drones that he does maintenance on there

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:45.920 
drones that he does maintenance on there
the<00:05:44.400> circular<00:05:44.789> spheres<00:05:45.210> that<00:05:45.330> you<00:05:45.509> see<00:05:45.690> in<00:05:45.810> the

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
the circular spheres that you see in the

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.320 
the circular spheres that you see in the
trailer<00:05:46.129> they're<00:05:47.129> like<00:05:47.310> defense<00:05:47.669> mechanisms

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
trailer they're like defense mechanisms

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.869 
trailer they're like defense mechanisms
and<00:05:48.629> so<00:05:48.750> they<00:05:48.990> are<00:05:49.409> weapons<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:50.099> those<00:05:50.699> were

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879 
and so they are weapons and those were

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.369 
and so they are weapons and those were
really<00:05:51.060> cool<00:05:51.270> that<00:05:51.479> was<00:05:51.539> a<00:05:51.599> cool<00:05:51.870> development

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
really cool that was a cool development

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:53.860 
really cool that was a cool development
I<00:05:52.440> kind<00:05:52.650> of<00:05:52.680> like<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:52.949> way<00:05:53.009> they<00:05:53.129> were<00:05:53.219> done

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
I kind of like the way they were done

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.149 
I kind of like the way they were done
and<00:05:54.870> they<00:05:55.379> almost<00:05:55.650> seem<00:05:55.860> to<00:05:55.949> have<00:05:56.039> some

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
and they almost seem to have some

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.920 
and they almost seem to have some
personality<00:05:56.699> it<00:05:56.759> was<00:05:56.849> it<00:05:57.029> was<00:05:57.150> a<00:05:57.180> the<00:05:57.659> most

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
personality it was it was a the most

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.869 
personality it was it was a the most

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
unique thing about the film and they

unique thing about the film and they
were<00:05:59.939> very<00:06:00.029> what<00:06:00.449> the<00:06:00.569> special<00:06:01.139> effects<00:06:01.379> the

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:01.529

were very what the special effects the
CGI<00:06:01.889> on<00:06:02.069> them<00:06:02.219> was<00:06:02.339> also<00:06:02.639> excellent<00:06:03.360> on<00:06:03.599> a<00:06:03.689> one

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
CGI on them was also excellent on a one

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.079 
CGI on them was also excellent on a one
