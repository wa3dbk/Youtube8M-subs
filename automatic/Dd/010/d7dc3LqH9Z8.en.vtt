 I'm going to show you this is the kind of 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.930
 brochures that europe printing makes for 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.930

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.100
 brochure 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.890
 is small and has reduced 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.650
 information but that does have all the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.320
 information about your company and this brochure 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.060

 little bag and well I can talk to you 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.840
 also about the marketing of your company 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.840
 at the moment that you start companies 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.950
 companies you start marketing your 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.870
 company 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.110
 The first thing you will have to handle is 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.620
 just that a brochure a project 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.680
 advertising and good when you already have 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.280
 at that time you speak agrope press and 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.070
 you say good I want to print 50 today 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.739
 I want to print 100 this is the place 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.200
 indicated the indicated place to print 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.840
 all your brochures and I would also like 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.930
 talk about one of the features 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.930
 what your project brochure should have 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.380
 It must be, let's say, write 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.040
 clear titles and subtitles and attractive 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.020
 and that hook especially in view to 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.690
 the customer's view what does it mean 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.930
 this at the moment that you open a 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.360
 brochure because you say you know that this 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.250
 brochure does not contain colors that to me 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.560
 they call my attention bores me what 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.610
 I do is break it and it goes to the garbage 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.380
 but if you handle colors like estes 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.810
 striking and that are not tired to the 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.330
 view of your client the results will be 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.290
 completely positive other of the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.200
 points that says here in this in this 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.990
 own printing page talks about 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.530
 clear and precise explanation of the product 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.510
 or service with concise summary 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.720
 ok how are we talking about what a 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.490
 brochure we have that good and we said that 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.080
 the brochure is very summarized 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.990
 information we have to be very 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.400
 specific we can not expand us much 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.770
 in the characteristics of what 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.830
 we manage if we do not have to be clear 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.620
 concise rapids and this is so that 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.630
 the client can read it up to a high 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.620
 at the moment he is driving he says 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.290
 they left me this 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.090
 Today, I have an opportunity in about 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.549
 seconds of quickly seeing what 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.860
 they handle then that's another of the 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:06.280
 characteristics that your 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.230
 Other brochure is includes include the most 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.599
 number of photographs in which 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.840
 the products or services of 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:17.739
 shows and attach the feet of 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.070
 explanatory written photos what do you want 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.130
 say this good because at the moment of 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.800
 what are you going to do your brochure the person 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.530
 you should take pictures or you will have to have 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.630
 photos of everything that is or do in your 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.850
 company the best photos that you 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.160
 you want to present because we are not going to 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.919
 saturate that of too many photos has to 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.889
 be a big picture like this that you can 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.100
 see here that the camera captures 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.229
 ok here is this is the photograph of 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.479
 the one we're talking about and this is the 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.889
 that we suggest you too 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:58.300
 true ok and finally says it should be 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:01.720
 It is necessary to use diagrams or drawings 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.240
 this is something that you can equal and 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.669
 and also define if you want to put it not 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.030
 it's not a completely important point 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.800
 or if you do not put it in there will also be 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.919
 perfectly good your brochure with the 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.139
 data you need for the client 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.780
 true and good alike already to finish 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.180
 says text sequence according to 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.509
 argument of what we propose that 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.210
 it means that if I open a brochure and 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:31.210
 find information here and at 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.099
 When I opened it, I said, I lost myself 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.389
 completely here is already talking about 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:40.180
 something else from that moment is no no 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.639
 is not positively done then 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.940
 we need to give that coordination to 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:48.580

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.919
