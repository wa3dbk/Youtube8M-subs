00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.870
 summer borders of the starbucks name there 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.849

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.410
 clapton if you like the other videos 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.090
 from 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.389
 youtubers then keep watching until 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.389
 the end 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.180
 first we go the cow long 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.960
 make it a professional and then you need it 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.050
 lime coin 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.880
 two bowls or packets of water in one 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.369
 measuring cup 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.590
 sugar and cup to make it there eventually 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.740
 and I happened to have one 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.490
 starbucks cup lying at home 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.490
 an ice cubes 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.930
 first grab a bowl and 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.000
 therefore your water 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.810
 I read about 240 milliliters and that 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.810
 thing 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.410
 separate your coin and then open and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.450
 then skate a few leaves 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.480
 in deezer or color 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.670
 six seven thinks 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.510
 and then terrier good at it 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.790
 totally awesome 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.280
 and ask you on the sides day by day 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.650
 all the way we were going to pull 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.120
 then pick up another container and some 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.830
 you clear your anger I had but 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.410
 the use of a friend way too expensive 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.840
 and I cut it in half and 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.230
 both half squeezed 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.640
 the juice and 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.640
 also get this then 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.770
 if you show the juice squeezed out 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.510
 a bowl or sugar I have the one 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.770
 little by feeling done 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.789
 and then of course I will 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.789
 completely injured 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.100
 and if it is resolved equally well with 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.000
 each other and you go full 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.960
 bring that man 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.960
 to become a whole 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.210
 then you grab a cup and it is actually you 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.509
 juice also to this the cow is longer fair 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.619
 and it's just pure drink from the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.619
 summer nice and refreshing 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.310
 yes this is it and sold for 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.160
 Ice cubes will be nice and cold 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.160
 and this series is only over 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:30.600
 and then you continue to find yes 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.600
 says tendrals so this one 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.050
 and what you need for hiding 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.310
 business is or fruits 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.290
 actually is 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.910
 and who have the best stitching but that is 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.160
 very well 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.690
 a bowl okay oh if necessary one 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.000
 purchased nauseous coincidence 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.910
 I want to open this very easily in one 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.239
 I think you have sugar too 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.239
 required 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.190
 and lay your fireball 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.520
 I have a breeder here 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.520
 it is a curse 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.959
 to start you need water again 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.959
 the number 20 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.310
 and that cup of tea and there you do 2 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.310
 bags in it 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.780
 and you are going to press that right now and 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.190
 all busy 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.190
 the other side if it's okay 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.710
 you smile and withdraw you for five minutes 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.200
 maximum peter and the neighborhood and raspberry 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.930
 lemonade in I did feel a bit 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.300
 but am new so can do a little more 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.880
 because I thought it was not very sweet and 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.880
 then you add the 120 milliliters of water 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.329
 I then shot at an overpriced mine 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.940
 old foot store 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:28.750
 and then you pick up a delivery and steps 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.320
 T-shirt or off and leave 5 minutes you can 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.320
 to merge 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.800
 avoid 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.460
 and when you get together when basically 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.760
 already done 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.110
 from the dance what you think is better for us 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:55.780
 his child in cup you can still possibly 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.980
 add post berries or strawberry but the 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.190
 need food 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.020
 so i wouldn't go in and last 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.630
 formerly young Paris course 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.080
 and then you are done with your barry 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.080
 from in starbucks 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.200
