one<00:00:09.000> block<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.510> extra<00:00:09.870> melt<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:10.860> used<00:00:11.099> two

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
one block of extra melt and we used two

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.900 
one block of extra melt and we used two
parts<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.620> half-and-half<00:00:13.620> cream<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:14.639> part

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
parts of half-and-half cream in one part

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.700 
parts of half-and-half cream in one part
of<00:00:15.000> heavy<00:00:15.210> whipping<00:00:15.389> cream<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.020> we<00:00:16.379> melted

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
of heavy whipping cream and we melted

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.410 
of heavy whipping cream and we melted
this<00:00:16.890> down<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> microwave<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.910> high<00:00:18.119> power

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
this down in the microwave on high power

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.810 
this down in the microwave on high power
it<00:00:18.660> took<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.960> total<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.410> about<00:00:19.529> eight<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.670> nine

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
it took a total of about eight to nine

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.269 
it took a total of about eight to nine
minutes<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.710> periodically<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.949> would<00:00:23.070> pull

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
minutes and periodically we would pull

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.830 
minutes and periodically we would pull
out<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.580> container<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.180> stir<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> rubber

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
out the container and stir with a rubber

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.870 
out the container and stir with a rubber
spatula<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.800> mix<00:00:25.920> all<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.189> nice<00:00:26.519> cream

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
spatula just to mix all that nice cream

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.419 
spatula just to mix all that nice cream
and<00:00:27.090> cheese<00:00:27.240> together<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:28.099> earlier<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.250> we

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and cheese together and earlier on we

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.160 
and cheese together and earlier on we
had<00:00:29.580> poured<00:00:29.820> off<00:00:29.939> some<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> cream<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
had poured off some of the cream the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.749 
had poured off some of the cream the
residual<00:00:31.619> cream<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.920> was<00:00:32.040> left<00:00:32.250> over<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.610> we

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
residual cream that was left over but we

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.190 
residual cream that was left over but we
ended<00:00:32.880> up<00:00:33.090> pointing<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.540> back<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.170> just

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
ended up pointing that back in and just

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.990 
ended up pointing that back in and just
slowly<00:00:34.440> folding<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.969> a

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
slowly folding it so this is a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.869 
slowly folding it so this is a
consistency<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:37.050> want<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.700> nice

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
consistency that we want and it's a nice

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.420 
consistency that we want and it's a nice
color<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:39.899> well<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.800> our<00:00:40.829> vegetables

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
color as well here are our vegetables

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.580 
color as well here are our vegetables
which<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:42.000> been<00:00:42.210> sitting<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.870> cooling

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
which have just been sitting and cooling

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.619 
which have just been sitting and cooling
at<00:00:43.710> room<00:00:43.890> temperature<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.640> we're<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> go

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
at room temperature so we're going to go

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.920 
at room temperature so we're going to go
ahead<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.870> fold<00:00:46.110> these<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.210> I<00:00:48.210> wasn't

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
ahead and fold these in and I wasn't

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.450 
ahead and fold these in and I wasn't
sure<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> use<00:00:49.680> all<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.250> them

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
sure if I was going to use all of them

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.200 
sure if I was going to use all of them
so<00:00:51.090> I'm<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.840> spatula<00:00:52.530> off<00:00:53.210> half

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
so I'm just going to spatula off half

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.760 
so I'm just going to spatula off half
and<00:00:54.800> fold<00:00:55.800> those<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:58.170> I'm<00:00:58.260> thinking<00:00:58.500> we're

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and fold those in and I'm thinking we're

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.349 
and fold those in and I'm thinking we're
probably<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> use<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> whole<00:00:59.850> batch<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
probably going to use the whole batch to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.020 
probably going to use the whole batch to
be<00:01:00.480> honest<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.500> again<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.280> recipes

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
be honest with you and again the recipes

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.000 
be honest with you and again the recipes
and<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.359> ratios<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.170> run<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> gamut

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and the ratios for this run the gamut

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.340 
and the ratios for this run the gamut
but<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.450> real<00:01:06.689> good<00:01:06.869> starter

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
but this is just a real good starter

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.260 
but this is just a real good starter
recipe<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:09.000> kind<00:01:09.210> of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
recipe so that you can see what kind of

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.080 
recipe so that you can see what kind of
feel<00:01:09.540> you're<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:11.970> get

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
feel you're going for and you really get

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.530 
feel you're going for and you really get
to<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.840> kind<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.979> difference<00:01:14.540> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to see what kind of a difference the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.920 
to see what kind of a difference the
fresh<00:01:16.020> vegetables<00:01:16.880> make<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.240> again<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
fresh vegetables make and again at the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.350 
fresh vegetables make and again at the
very<00:01:19.140> end<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.650> fold<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.280> some<00:01:20.580> some<00:01:21.119> fresh

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
very end we fold it in some some fresh

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.109 
very end we fold it in some some fresh
cilantro<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:23.040> season<00:01:23.430> those<00:01:23.580> vegetables

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
cilantro and we season those vegetables

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.660 
cilantro and we season those vegetables
with<00:01:24.330> chili<00:01:24.600> powder<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.140> well<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.130> pinto

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
bean seasoning that was mostly camino

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.740
