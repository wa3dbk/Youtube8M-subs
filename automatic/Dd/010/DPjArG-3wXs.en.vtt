00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.910 
version that means it has LTE built in
for<00:00:15.420> high-speed<00:00:15.630> data<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.529> let's<00:00:16.680> go<00:00:16.800> ahead

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
for high-speed data so let's go ahead

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.609 
for high-speed data so let's go ahead
and<00:00:17.160> take<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> look<00:00:17.550> at<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.880> now<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.510> is

supposedly the thinnest 4G tablet on the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.810 
supposedly the thinnest 4G tablet on the
market<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.320> should<00:00:23.010> be<00:00:23.039> interesting<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.609> see

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
market so should be interesting to see

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.700 
market so should be interesting to see
if<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.090> still<00:00:24.510> holds<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:24.840> build<00:00:25.109> quality<00:00:25.560> wise

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
if it still holds up build quality wise

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.859 
if it still holds up build quality wise
but<00:00:26.039> here's<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.430> Galaxy<00:00:26.849> Tab<00:00:27.029> let's<00:00:27.599> go<00:00:27.750> ahead

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
itself now like I said this is a 4G

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.679 
itself now like I said this is a 4G
galaxy<00:01:16.890> tab<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:18.119> telling<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689

insert the 4G SIM card which I do have

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.230 
insert the 4G SIM card which I do have
there's<00:01:21.390> micro<00:01:21.810> SD<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> side<00:01:22.729> 4G<00:01:23.729> SIM<00:01:23.970> card

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
there's micro SD on the side 4G SIM card

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.719 
there's micro SD on the side 4G SIM card
here<00:01:24.570> feels<00:01:25.560> built<00:01:25.920> pretty<00:01:26.159> well<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.580> is

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
here feels built pretty well this is

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.530 
here feels built pretty well this is
either<00:01:27.150> steel<00:01:27.600> or<00:01:27.780> aluminum<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.360> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
either steel or aluminum and this is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
either steel or aluminum and this is
where<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.840> SIM<00:01:31.049> card<00:01:31.079> goes<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.860> saying<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
where the SIM card goes it's saying it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
where the SIM card goes it's saying it
goes<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> SIM<00:01:33.509> card<00:01:33.540> right

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
goes like this I have the SIM card right

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.109 
goes like this I have the SIM card right
here<00:01:34.290> go<00:01:35.130> ahead<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.280> place<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:38.119> so

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
here go ahead and place this in so

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.149 
here go ahead and place this in so
there's<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> SIM<00:01:39.689> card<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.590> front<00:01:40.890> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
there's the SIM card so on the front you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.670 
there's the SIM card so on the front you
can<00:01:41.189> see<00:01:41.490> here's<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> Galaxy<00:01:42.299> Tab<00:01:42.450> itself<00:01:42.899> we

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the bottom we have some speakers and the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.980 
the bottom we have some speakers and the
connected<00:02:10.380> charge<00:02:10.710> port<00:02:11.600> let's<00:02:12.600> go<00:02:12.720> ahead<00:02:12.810> and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
connected charge port let's go ahead and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.890 
connected charge port let's go ahead and
peel<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.680> cover<00:02:14.340> off<00:02:14.580> here<00:02:17.480> now<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.540> screen

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
peel the cover off here now the screen

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.620 
peel the cover off here now the screen
itself<00:02:19.820> should<00:02:20.820> be<00:02:20.940> pretty<00:02:21.120> interesting<00:02:21.600> to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
itself should be pretty interesting to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.200 
itself should be pretty interesting to
see<00:02:21.930> we<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> retina<00:02:23.490> display<00:02:23.880> from

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
see we have the retina display from

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.340 
see we have the retina display from
Apple<00:02:24.630> but<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.380> this<00:02:25.650> case<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:27.350> 720p

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
Apple but in this case we have a 720p

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.500 
Apple but in this case we have a 720p
screen<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.580> should<00:02:29.910> be<00:02:30.000> pretty<00:02:30.270> nice

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
screen so that should be pretty nice

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.160 
screen so that should be pretty nice
this<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.650> really<00:02:32.520> nice<00:02:32.700> screen<00:02:33.300> that's<00:02:33.540> 1280

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
this is a really nice screen that's 1280

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.470 
this is a really nice screen that's 1280
by<00:02:34.410> 800<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.790> should<00:02:36.090> be<00:02:36.120> pretty

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
by 800 so it should be pretty

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.600 
by 800 so it should be pretty
good-looking<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.650> an<00:02:37.740> AMOLED<00:02:38.250> screen

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
good-looking and it's an AMOLED screen

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.710 
good-looking and it's an AMOLED screen
so<00:02:38.760> let's<00:02:38.880> go<00:02:39.000> ahead<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.240> turn<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:41.600> now<00:02:42.600> it

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
so let's go ahead and turn it on now it

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.840 
so let's go ahead and turn it on now it
is<00:02:42.870> pretty<00:02:43.050> thin<00:02:43.410> feels<00:02:44.280> pretty<00:02:44.610> light<00:02:44.820> and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
is pretty thin feels pretty light and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.520 
is pretty thin feels pretty light and
it's<00:02:45.360> interesting<00:02:45.600> holding<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.200> little<00:02:46.380> bit

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
it's interesting holding a little bit

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.350 
it's interesting holding a little bit
bigger<00:02:46.830> tablet<00:02:47.310> than<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.520> 7-inch<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.180> not

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
bigger tablet than a 7-inch but not

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.840 
bigger tablet than a 7-inch but not
quite<00:02:48.630> as<00:02:48.750> big<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.230> 10-inch<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:50.370> does<00:02:50.610> look

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
quite as big as a 10-inch it does look

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.300 
quite as big as a 10-inch it does look
kind<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.480> small<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.840> my<00:02:51.989> hands<00:02:52.350> but<00:02:53.130> it's

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
kind of small in my hands but it's

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.640 
kind of small in my hands but it's
booting<00:02:53.670> up<00:02:53.790> that's<00:02:54.540> pretty<00:02:54.780> fast<00:02:55.080> really<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
booting up that's pretty fast really and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.940 
booting up that's pretty fast really and
that's<00:02:56.489> probably<00:02:57.000> due<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.420> its<00:02:57.540> dual-core<00:02:58.110> 1.4

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that's probably due to its dual-core 1.4

that's probably due to its dual-core 1.4

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.100

wondering<00:05:05.370> how<00:05:05.670> much<00:05:06.360> it<00:05:06.540> costs<00:05:06.960> it's

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
wondering how much it costs it's

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.780 
wondering how much it costs it's
actually<00:05:07.560> a<00:05:07.590> little<00:05:07.890> bit<00:05:08.070> expensive<00:05:08.280> it's

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
actually a little bit expensive it's

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.380 
actually a little bit expensive it's
four<00:05:09.000> hundred<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.390> forty<00:05:09.540> nine<00:05:09.840> dollars<00:05:10.290> on

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
four hundred and forty nine dollars on

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.280 
four hundred and forty nine dollars on
contract<00:05:12.390> so<00:05:12.540> that's<00:05:12.690> a<00:05:12.780> two<00:05:12.930> year<00:05:13.080> contract

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
contract so that's a two year contract

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.830 
contract so that's a two year contract
for<00:05:13.620> four<00:05:13.890> forty<00:05:14.190> nine<00:05:14.370> or<00:05:14.640> full<00:05:15.420> retail

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
for four forty nine or full retail

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.050 
for four forty nine or full retail
without<00:05:16.140> a<00:05:16.170> contract<00:05:16.620> is<00:05:16.890> $6.99

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
without a contract is $6.99

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.930 
without a contract is $6.99
so<00:05:18.540> that<00:05:18.780> contract<00:05:19.350> will<00:05:19.560> require<00:05:19.920> data<00:05:20.280> now

interesting the way it looks a little

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.700 
interesting the way it looks a little
bit<00:05:44.070> bigger<00:05:44.250> than<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.780> the<00:05:45.780> original<00:05:46.230> Galaxy

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
Tab but a little bit smaller than an

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.480 
Tab but a little bit smaller than an
iPad<00:05:49.230> or<00:05:49.700> the<00:05:50.750> 10.1<00:05:51.750> Galaxy<00:05:52.290> Tab<00:05:52.470> so<00:05:52.710> I<00:05:52.950> like<00:05:53.460> it

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490

overall<00:05:53.970> it<00:05:54.210> feels<00:05:54.240> very<00:05:54.600> durable

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
overall it feels very durable

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.010 
overall it feels very durable
feels<00:05:55.800> built<00:05:56.130> really<00:05:56.669> well<00:05:56.880> not<00:05:57.630> quite<00:05:57.900> as
