we<00:00:00.780> are<00:00:00.900> setting<00:00:01.260> up<00:00:01.350> an<00:00:01.560> oceanic<00:00:01.709> biocube<00:00:02.220> for

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
we are setting up an oceanic biocube for

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.650 
we are setting up an oceanic biocube for
saltwater<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:04.700> just<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.790> word<00:00:06.000> on<00:00:06.210> water

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
saltwater and just a word on water

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.720 
saltwater and just a word on water
parameters<00:00:07.550> we<00:00:08.550> have<00:00:09.500> edit<00:00:10.500> live<00:00:10.740> rinse<00:00:11.370> and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
parameters we have edit live rinse and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.939 
parameters we have edit live rinse and
live<00:00:12.719> rock<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:14.000> ro/di<00:00:15.500> synthetic<00:00:16.500> salted

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
live rock and ro/di synthetic salted

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.300 
live rock and ro/di synthetic salted
water<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.390> tank<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.990> now<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.890> want<00:00:20.189> to

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
water to the tank and now we want to

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.580 
water to the tank and now we want to
monitor<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.359> make<00:00:21.570> sure<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.439> water

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
monitor and make sure the water

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.859 
monitor and make sure the water
parameters<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.580> order<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.240> at<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.510> point

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
parameters are in order so at this point

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.040 
parameters are in order so at this point
you<00:00:25.519> can<00:00:26.519> we're<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.570> going<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.720> look<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you can we're just going to look at the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.400 
you can we're just going to look at the
basic<00:00:28.260> parameters<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.840> number<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.080> your

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
basic parameters so number one is your

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.260 
basic parameters so number one is your
temperature<00:00:31.890> which<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.340> right<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:33.210> is

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
temperature which is right here this is

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.370 
temperature which is right here this is
just<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.660> simple<00:00:34.550> strip<00:00:35.550> thermometer<00:00:36.360> I'm<00:00:37.350> very

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
just a simple strip thermometer I'm very

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.510 
just a simple strip thermometer I'm very
inexpensive<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.950> ideally<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.100> want<00:00:41.309> your

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
inexpensive and ideally you want your

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.350 
inexpensive and ideally you want your
temperature<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.570> about<00:00:43.010> 77<00:00:44.010> degrees<00:00:44.360> right

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
temperature to be about 77 degrees right

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.959 
temperature to be about 77 degrees right
here<00:00:46.010> it's<00:00:47.010> hard<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.370> tell<00:00:47.520> from<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> light

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
here it's hard to tell from the light

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.940 
here it's hard to tell from the light
but<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.420> actually<00:00:48.570> around<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.559> which<00:00:49.770> is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
but it's actually around here which is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.910 
but it's actually around here which is
okay<00:00:51.199> then<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:53.039> want<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.730> our<00:00:54.920> ammonia

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
okay then we want to look at our ammonia

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.680 
okay then we want to look at our ammonia
we<00:00:56.160> want<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.030> spiking<00:00:57.360> because

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
we want to see that it's spiking because

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.010 
we want to see that it's spiking because
we<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.109> filled<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.530> our<00:00:58.739> tank<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.750> it<00:01:00.750> might

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
we just filled up our tank and it might

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.260 
we just filled up our tank and it might
be<00:01:01.260> who<00:01:01.770> knows<00:01:01.829> how<00:01:02.160> long<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.579> will<00:01:02.699> take<00:01:02.760> but

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
be who knows how long that will take but

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.780 
be who knows how long that will take but
the<00:01:03.300> ammonia<00:01:03.719> has<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.140> build<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the ammonia has to build up and a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.580 
the ammonia has to build up and a
bacteria<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> water<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> build<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.439> so

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
bacteria in the water has to build up so

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.100 
bacteria in the water has to build up so
it<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.770> break<00:01:07.950> down<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.369> ammonia<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.960> we

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it can break down the ammonia so what we

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
it can break down the ammonia so what we
did<00:01:10.290> instead<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> test<00:01:11.130> kit<00:01:11.400> where<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.820> can

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
did instead of a test kit where you can

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570 
did instead of a test kit where you can
measure<00:01:12.150> your<00:01:12.299> ammonia<00:01:12.810> your<00:01:13.530> nitrates<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
measure your ammonia your nitrates and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.030 
measure your ammonia your nitrates and
your<00:01:14.729> nitrites<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.560> added<00:01:16.799> this

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
your nitrites we have just added this

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.999 
your nitrites we have just added this
simple<00:01:18.049> ammonia<00:01:19.340> alert<00:01:20.340> from<00:01:21.119> seachem<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
simple ammonia alert from seachem and it

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.310 
simple ammonia alert from seachem and it
will<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.310> let<00:01:23.580> us<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.759> when<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.990> ammonia

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
will just let us know when the ammonia

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.320 
will just let us know when the ammonia
will<00:01:25.860> start<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.280> spike<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.759> your<00:01:26.909> tank<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
will start to spike in your tank and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.760 
will start to spike in your tank and
then<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.600> know<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:27.990> well<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.259> its<00:01:28.409> way<00:01:28.650> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
then you know it's well on its way to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.690 
then you know it's well on its way to
cycle<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.750> an<00:01:30.960> indicator<00:01:31.700> in

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
cycle so this is just an indicator in

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700 
cycle so this is just an indicator in
the<00:01:33.030> middle<00:01:33.329> there's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> color<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.229> tells<00:01:34.470> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the middle there's a color it tells you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.710 
the middle there's a color it tells you
where<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.610> are<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:36.000> far<00:01:36.210> as<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.420> ammonia

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
where you are as far as your ammonia

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.569 
where you are as far as your ammonia
right<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.200> we're<00:01:37.380> safe<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.070> color<00:01:38.280> matches

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
right now we're safe the color matches

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.450 
right now we're safe the color matches
up<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:40.020> different<00:01:40.470> colors<00:01:40.829> you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
up there you have different colors you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.300 
up there you have different colors you
have<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.670> blue<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.780> toxic<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.590> light<00:01:43.770> blue<00:01:44.159> is

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
have a blue is toxic the light blue is

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.510 
have a blue is toxic the light blue is
alarm<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.630> green<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.229> alert<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:47.369> is

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
alarm and the green is alert this is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.210 
alarm and the green is alert this is
something<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.939> might<00:01:48.090> want<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.479> use<00:01:49.220> just

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
something you might want to use just

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.679 
something you might want to use just
when<00:01:50.369> you're<00:01:50.490> beginning<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.970> cycle<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.420> tank

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
when you're beginning to cycle your tank

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.289 
when you're beginning to cycle your tank
you<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:51.930> watch<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.850> it'll<00:01:53.850> save<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
you can watch it and it'll save you a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.410 
you can watch it and it'll save you a
lot<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.479> water<00:01:54.720> tests<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.030> next<00:01:57.270> thing

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
lot of water tests so the next thing

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.480 
lot of water tests so the next thing
that<00:01:57.570> we're<00:01:57.810> looking<00:01:58.140> at<00:01:58.350> is<00:02:00.590> your<00:02:01.590> salinity

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
that we're looking at is your salinity

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.010 
that we're looking at is your salinity
or<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.880> amount<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.240> salt<00:02:03.509> that's<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.869> your

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
or the amount of salt that's in your

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.059 
or the amount of salt that's in your
water<00:02:04.229> if<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.579> look<00:02:05.790> up<00:02:06.000> here<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:07.069> device

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
water if you look up here this device

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.760 
water if you look up here this device
here<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> put<00:02:09.090> inside<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.629> tank<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.619> is

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
here that I put inside the tank this is

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.830 
here that I put inside the tank this is
called<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.129> hydrometer<00:02:11.930> now<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
called a hydrometer now the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.210 
called a hydrometer now the
tend<00:02:14.080> not<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.470> be<00:02:14.500> super<00:02:15.129> accurate<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:17.010> we<00:02:18.010> had

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
tend not to be super accurate but we had

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.860 
tend not to be super accurate but we had
the<00:02:18.250> water<00:02:18.640> mixed<00:02:19.390> at<00:02:20.160> 1.03<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:22.420> as<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:22.750> can

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
the water mixed at 1.03 so as you can

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.570 
the water mixed at 1.03 so as you can
see<00:02:23.110> it's<00:02:23.319> kind<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.590> indicating<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:26.580> ideally

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
see it's kind of indicating that ideally

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.509 
see it's kind of indicating that ideally
you<00:02:28.360> want<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:29.050> be<00:02:29.730> 31<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.269> salinity<00:02:32.519> this

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
you want it to be 31 the salinity this

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.640 
you want it to be 31 the salinity this
side<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.120> salinity<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.840> ideally<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.470> want

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
side is the salinity so ideally you want

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.949 
side is the salinity so ideally you want
it<00:02:35.830> right<00:02:35.980> here<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:40.060> want<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.390> gravity

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
it right here and you want the gravity

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.690 
it right here and you want the gravity
which<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.739> other<00:02:41.830> measurement<00:02:42.400> on<00:02:42.519> the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
which is the other measurement on the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.660 
which is the other measurement on the
other<00:02:42.819> side<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.420> be<00:02:43.540> 1.0<00:02:44.230> 23<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.310> want<00:02:45.580> the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
other side to be 1.0 23 so you want the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.720 
other side to be 1.0 23 so you want the
gravity<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.269> be<00:02:46.390> here<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:47.489> 31<00:02:49.230> salinity<00:02:50.230> or<00:02:50.730> 1.0

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
gravity to be here so 31 salinity or 1.0

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.150 
gravity to be here so 31 salinity or 1.0
23<00:02:52.239> is<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:52.360> gravity<00:02:52.900> towards<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.709> lower<00:02:53.860> end

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
23 is the gravity towards the lower end

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.740 
23 is the gravity towards the lower end
of<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:54.690> little<00:02:55.799> scale<00:02:56.799> here<00:02:59.849> so<00:03:00.849> as<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.599> can

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
of this little scale here so as you can

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.180 
of this little scale here so as you can
see<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.910> actual<00:03:04.299> indicator<00:03:04.900> is<00:03:05.049> way<00:03:05.349> up<00:03:05.560> it's

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
see the actual indicator is way up it's

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.460 
see the actual indicator is way up it's
past<00:03:06.489> 38<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:08.530> around<00:03:08.799> 1.03<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:10.540> there's<00:03:11.379> a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
past 38 it's around 1.03 so there's a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.110 
past 38 it's around 1.03 so there's a
lot<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.680> salt<00:03:12.010> in<00:03:12.250> here<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.670> we<00:03:12.760> want<00:03:12.970> to

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
lot of salt in here and we want to

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.180 
lot of salt in here and we want to
reduce<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.900> amount<00:03:14.079> of<00:03:14.200> salt<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.530> our<00:03:14.620> tank<00:03:14.950> so

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
reduce the amount of salt in our tank so

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.809 
reduce the amount of salt in our tank so
how<00:03:15.310> do<00:03:15.370> we<00:03:15.579> do<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.870> well<00:03:16.950> what<00:03:17.950> happens<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.579> a

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
how do we do that well what happens in a

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.559 
how do we do that well what happens in a
tank<00:03:19.150> as<00:03:19.950> your<00:03:20.950> water<00:03:21.670> goes<00:03:22.180> through<00:03:22.209> your

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
tank as your water goes through your

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.030 
tank as your water goes through your
tank<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:23.109> lot<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.650> gets<00:03:23.799> evaporated<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:26.040> but

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
tank a lot of it gets evaporated and but

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.699 
tank a lot of it gets evaporated and but
your<00:03:27.190> salt<00:03:27.579> actually<00:03:28.180> stays<00:03:28.450> in<00:03:28.660> your<00:03:28.690> tank<00:03:29.049> so

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
your salt actually stays in your tank so

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.830 
your salt actually stays in your tank so
over<00:03:30.010> time<00:03:30.280> if<00:03:30.639> you<00:03:30.730> just<00:03:30.970> let<00:03:31.120> your<00:03:31.209> tanks<00:03:31.599> it

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
over time if you just let your tanks it

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.520 
over time if you just let your tanks it
and<00:03:32.139> you<00:03:32.739> don't<00:03:32.889> top<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.370> off<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:35.230> will<00:03:35.380> get

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
and you don't top it off you will get

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.870 
and you don't top it off you will get
more<00:03:35.590> salt<00:03:36.099> level<00:03:36.940> in<00:03:37.090> your<00:03:37.299> tank<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.609> way

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
more salt level in your tank so the way

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.659 
more salt level in your tank so the way
to<00:03:39.940> reduce<00:03:40.510> your<00:03:40.780> salinity<00:03:41.380> or<00:03:41.560> when<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.519> have

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
to reduce your salinity or when you have

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.150 
to reduce your salinity or when you have
to<00:03:42.819> top<00:03:43.030> off<00:03:43.269> your<00:03:43.480> evaporated<00:03:44.230> water<00:03:44.410> you

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
to top off your evaporated water you

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.159 
to top off your evaporated water you
just<00:03:45.400> want<00:03:45.609> to<00:03:45.700> use<00:03:46.260> fresh<00:03:47.849> ro/di<00:03:48.849> water<00:03:49.359> you

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
just want to use fresh ro/di water you

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.860 
just want to use fresh ro/di water you
don't<00:03:50.380> want<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.620> add<00:03:51.000> ro/di<00:03:52.000> synthetic<00:03:52.690> water

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
don't want to add ro/di synthetic water

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.740 
don't want to add ro/di synthetic water
you<00:03:53.200> just<00:03:53.410> want<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.680> add<00:03:53.849> fresh<00:03:54.849> reverse

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
you just want to add fresh reverse

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.500 
you just want to add fresh reverse
osmosis<00:03:56.250> deionized<00:03:57.250> water<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:58.239> we're<00:03:58.419> going

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
osmosis deionized water so we're going

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.670 
osmosis deionized water so we're going
to<00:03:58.599> do<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.650> reduce<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:01.380> gravity<00:04:02.380> because

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
to do that to reduce the gravity because

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.890 
to do that to reduce the gravity because
we've<00:04:03.190> got<00:04:03.400> it<00:04:03.519> too<00:04:03.669> high<00:04:03.819> we've<00:04:04.060> got<00:04:04.239> too<00:04:04.419> high

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
we've got it too high we've got too high

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.809 
we've got it too high we've got too high
of<00:04:05.079> a<00:04:05.200> salt<00:04:05.500> here<00:04:05.889> so<00:04:06.370> we're<00:04:06.459> going<00:04:06.549> to<00:04:06.639> add

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
of a salt here so we're going to add

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.430 
of a salt here so we're going to add
some<00:04:07.200> fresh<00:04:08.200> ro/di<00:04:08.950> water<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:10.180> get<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.200> salt

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
some fresh ro/di water to get the salt

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.150 
some fresh ro/di water to get the salt
level<00:04:11.859> down<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.130> bit<00:04:12.489> in<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.669> tank<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.980> this<00:04:14.980> is

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
level down a bit in the tank and this is

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.969 
level down a bit in the tank and this is
setting<00:04:15.459> up<00:04:15.549> a<00:04:15.639> bog<00:04:15.849> cube<00:04:16.150> for<00:04:16.780> salt<00:04:17.349> water<00:04:17.620> so

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
setting up a bog cube for salt water so

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.620 
setting up a bog cube for salt water so
we're<00:04:18.130> looking<00:04:18.190> at<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.579> parameters<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.450> we

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
we're looking at the parameters and we

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.089 
we're looking at the parameters and we
want<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:19.900> get<00:04:19.959> them<00:04:20.200> set<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:20.739> they're<00:04:20.919> ideal

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
want to get them set so they're ideal

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.599 
want to get them set so they're ideal
for<00:04:21.310> raising<00:04:21.909> corals<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.479> fish
