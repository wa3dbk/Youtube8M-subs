need to know about the differences

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.540 
need to know about the differences
between<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:43.120> iphone<00:00:43.690> 4<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.019> ipod<00:00:44.710> touch<00:00:44.739> one

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
between the iphone 4 and ipod touch one

between the iphone 4 and ipod touch one
the<00:00:46.030> screen<00:00:46.449> resolution<00:00:47.440> is<00:00:47.970> it<00:00:48.970> is<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.239> same

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
the screen resolution is it is the same

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.360 
the screen resolution is it is the same
it<00:00:49.600> does<00:00:49.750> have<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.020> retina<00:00:50.230> display<00:00:50.559> but<00:00:51.219> the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
it does have the retina display but the

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.610 
it does have the retina display but the
IPS<00:00:51.850> technology<00:00:51.969> is<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.780> tiny<00:00:53.050> bit<00:00:53.230> different

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
IPS technology is the tiny bit different

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.729 
IPS technology is the tiny bit different
between<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.280> iphone<00:00:54.550> 4<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:55.180> ipod<00:00:55.540> touch

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
between the iphone 4 and the ipod touch

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.830 
between the iphone 4 and the ipod touch
4g<00:00:56.739> because<00:00:57.370> on<00:00:57.670> different<00:00:58.090> viewing<00:00:58.329> angles

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
4g because on different viewing angles

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.430 
4g because on different viewing angles
you<00:00:59.410> cannot<00:00:59.710> see<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.430> ipod<00:01:00.700> touch<00:01:00.820> 4g<00:01:01.360> as<00:01:02.170> well

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
you cannot see the ipod touch 4g as well

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.850 
you cannot see the ipod touch 4g as well
as<00:01:02.680> iphone<00:01:03.160> 4<00:01:03.460> so<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.300> IPS<00:01:05.020> technology<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.800> a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
as iphone 4 so the IPS technology is a

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.370 
as iphone 4 so the IPS technology is a
little<00:01:06.100> bit<00:01:06.190> different<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:08.050> second

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
little bit different and the second

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.840 
little bit different and the second
thing<00:01:08.410> you<00:01:08.530> want<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.800> know<00:01:08.920> is<00:01:09.100> that<00:01:09.700> the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
thing you want to know is that the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.520 
thing you want to know is that the
camera<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.930> HD<00:01:11.550> 720p<00:01:12.570> recording<00:01:13.570> is<00:01:14.110> very

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
camera the HD 720p recording is very

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.380 
camera the HD 720p recording is very
good<00:01:14.800> edges<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.460> has<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.850> little<00:01:16.000> bit<00:01:16.240> less

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
good edges that has a little bit less

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.540 
good edges that has a little bit less
quality<00:01:16.810> than<00:01:17.170> iphone<00:01:17.649> 4<00:01:17.890> just<00:01:18.160> a<00:01:18.220> tiny<00:01:18.430> bit

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
quality than iphone 4 just a tiny bit

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.940 
quality than iphone 4 just a tiny bit
but<00:01:19.270> it's<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.570> remarkable<00:01:20.140> third<00:01:20.470> thing<00:01:20.830> you

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
but it's the remarkable third thing you

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.620 
but it's the remarkable third thing you
want<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.160> know<00:01:21.280> about<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:22.150> ipod<00:01:22.420> touch

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
want to know about the ipod touch

between<00:01:23.409> an<00:01:23.530> iphone<00:01:23.680> 4<00:01:24.220> is<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.659> there<00:01:26.200> is

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
between an iphone 4 is that there is

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.850 
between an iphone 4 is that there is
only<00:01:27.030> 256<00:01:28.030> megabytes<00:01:28.630> of<00:01:28.960> ram<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.530> in<00:01:29.740> the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
only 256 megabytes of ram and in the

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.210 
only 256 megabytes of ram and in the
iphone<00:01:30.250> 4<00:01:30.490> there's<00:01:30.750> 512<00:01:31.750> so<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.920> brooding

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
iphone 4 there's 512 so the brooding

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.820 
iphone 4 there's 512 so the brooding
times<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.759> prague<00:01:33.970> are<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.299> same<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.900> for

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
times of prague are the same and for

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.530 
times of prague are the same and for
editing<00:01:36.040> your<00:01:36.189> movie<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.759> hoping<00:01:37.180> up<00:01:37.299> apps

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
editing your movie and hoping up apps

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.929 
editing your movie and hoping up apps
are<00:01:37.840> probably<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.259> slight<00:01:38.680> bit<00:01:38.890> slower<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
are probably a slight bit slower so the

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.179 
are probably a slight bit slower so the
performance<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.570> very<00:01:40.659> close<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.710> iphone

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
performance is very close to the iphone

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.690 
performance is very close to the iphone
4<00:01:42.460> but<00:01:43.090> do<00:01:43.509> you<00:01:43.540> note<00:01:43.750> that<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.200> a4<00:01:45.070> chip<00:01:45.100> is<00:01:45.520> in
