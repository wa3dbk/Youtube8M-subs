00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:03.590
 my name is enrique rubbed goalkeeper 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.380
 I am a doctor graduated from the national university 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.049
 the decade the practice of gynecology 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.049
 and yes also a graduate health leaders currently 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.469
 the scientific director others 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.579
 in state hospital 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:17.500
 all right 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.749
 my contacts with the transfer factors 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.039
 of many years because 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.119
 mind them 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.839
 and professional training 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.389
 I was always uneasy about the way they could be 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.810
 supply these actor in reference to 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.670
 transmit a regular immunity 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.350
 in people however until very recently 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.390
 came to my hands a literature 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.060
 of a gynecologist 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.150
 the contest 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.570
 of the United States in torrejÃ³n 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.410
 that in 2010 a book 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.970
 that came to my hands and 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.200
 in the sea to switzerland 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.629
 and he recounted there the two benefits that are achieved with factors of 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.270
 Transfer tied orally 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.120
 all right 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.790
 indisputably 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.080
 I looked for a way to get them 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.390
 effectively 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.570
 I took them 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.010
 personally 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.390
 for an irritable bowel problem that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.620
 that bothers me due to stress 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.490
 then it is understood well then with him 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.570
 ni kms 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.540
 on the one hand boa supply it to patients because this is not any 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.030
 medication these um 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.420
 supplement 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.430
 percent 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.840
 it is not a nutritional supplement 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.930
 ttk minds a supplement that we 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.360
 balances balances the immune system 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.300
 then according to founders I started to aa supplied patients 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.759
 who had problems at the expense of the patients 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:55.960
 they presented 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.820
 percent herpetic diseases or diseases 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.950
 g 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.800
 human papilloma virus 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.710
 for 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.580
 improve the 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.979
 the treatment that is done to this type of patients 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:14.069
 I actually found what 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.309
 many patients 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.629
 for example the case of a patient who has been treating 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.849
 of serious aesthetic problems with outbreaks terribly 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.069
 painful 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.069
 per hundred since it is honest loyal the transfer factors 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:29.859
 p 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.989
 and the episodes began to move away 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.469
 I sent him and be less and less serious 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.759
 per cent the last episode 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.059
 p we noticed by a small welts 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:44.249
 5th Lora 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.209
 and without any other 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.049
 clinical manifestation 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.239
 which made me think that this patient actually exists 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.959
 He improved a lot in his 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.809
 pepsic teacher 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:03:00.089
 and then began to use it on patients who were going to get into 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:01.329
 surgery 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.869
 patients who was going to do hysterectomy 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:10.699
 that the transfer act was provided as a supplement one more 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:12.959
 one month before surgery 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:13.760
 i 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.879
 with surprise comes 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.989
 how those patients had a much faster recovery 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.499
 d the 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.599
 Healing promotion was much better 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.759
 percent and in 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.059
 g 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.299
 then in your process 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.549
 postsurgical was an evolution also much better 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.559
 already currently these recommending this supplement scare transfer factor 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:44.150
 to many of my patients
