00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello and welcome to hardware 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.259
 rathjen update of the 300 euro gaming 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.480
 computers or in this case 1 300 euro 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.139
 computer intended for upgrading 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.030
 as the processor of Intel Celeron G 1840 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.550
 with 2 x 2 8 ghz 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.470
 he has a tdp of 54 watts one 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.359
 integrated graphics unit and he will be in 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.689
 the box version delivered that suggests 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.880
 Cooler is already ge 1840 can 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.340
 against every other 11.50 processor 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.520
 The xeon e3 will also be exchanged 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.600
 june 7 as mainboard that it print b85 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.870
 anniversario sp 3 s ata 34 ddr3 ram 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.329
 benches of the express 3.0 a 5.1 sound 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.590
 chippis express 3.0 is the newest 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.260
 stood with graphics cards 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.730
 and it has four cooled phases with it 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.890
 you are in any case prepared for 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.570
 an i7 4790k or a 5775c so 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.969
 the strongest processors for this 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.460
 socket with sata 3 is now ready 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.710
 if you want to retrofit a ssd and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.660
 one can maximally 32 gb 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.000
 install memory with the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.920
 many pci express x1 can connect 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.409
 one without problems for example one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.700
 Install sound card and wifi card and 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.680
 on the panel 2 ps2 vga dvi and hdmi led 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.670
 Integrated graphics unit of the processor 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.240
 4 x usb 2 x 2 usb 3 a lan socket and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.110
 3 3 5 mm latches for the sound chip as 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.600
 memory 8gb kingston hyperx x-fi 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.579
 ddr3 1866 and cl10 is pretty fast 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.470
 because the processor but not as well 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.590
 supports fireplace even without problems 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.450
 on ddr3 1600 and count nine operate 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.670
 and there is two pieces you can get him 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.630
 operate a dual channel mode when 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.610
 you want to be natural 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.649
 Buy a second child at any time 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.229
 so you have 16 gigabytes of memory 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.390
 but as a gamer , you currently have 8 gb 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.490
 enough and as solid one a terabyte 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.170
 from toshiba it's a startling 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.729
 the fast disk and a terabyte 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.799
 are loose for most of you 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.930
 Sufficient other hard disks can 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.020
 Of course, be retrofitted at any time 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 as power supply the 500 watt lc power gold 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.659
 It has 80 plus gold water 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.729
 is energy efficient 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.890
 and 500 watts is really enough for that 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.629
 good as well as everything goes without it 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.530
 problems for the fastest 11.50 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.390
 processor and 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.130
 fastest single gpu video card on 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.220
 the market and last but not least 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.580
 hosted sharkoon vgvs has two 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.280
 pre-installed 120 mm fan and it 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.900
 Fit graphics cards will be up to 38 5 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.420
 centimeters so practically all 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.319
 graphics cards and cpu cooler to 16 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.239
 centimeter 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.700
 that means it fits for example too 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.430
 the alpen movie broken eco or the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.170
 therme laa thaya 02 macho if you like that 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.660
 pc do not assemble yourself volt 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.180
 can also assemble for 26 euro 90 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.250
 let who but no pc would like to good 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.440
 upgrade but rather a pc with a lot 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.209
 a lot of performance should be on everyone 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.650
 case to pick a used pc 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.690
 I already have a video for that 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.040
 made to look your long river 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.170
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.700
 that the video is older than two months 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.620
 the description will look there on the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.720
 respective link click through the server 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.470
 always latest version then until 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.470
 next video
