00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
okay in this tutorial I'm going to show

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.759 
okay in this tutorial I'm going to show
you<00:00:10.650> how<00:00:10.770> to<00:00:10.969> make<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.030> blow

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
you how to make a blow

you how to make a blow
retain<00:00:14.769> some<00:00:15.510> colors<00:00:16.510> in<00:00:16.689> it<00:00:16.810> um<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:18.460> see<00:00:19.000> this

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
retain some colors in it um you see this

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.510 
retain some colors in it um you see this
technique<00:00:19.990> use<00:00:20.140> a<00:00:20.170> lot<00:00:20.410> these<00:00:20.619> days<00:00:20.680> it's<00:00:21.340> kind

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
technique use a lot these days it's kind

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.880 
technique use a lot these days it's kind
of<00:00:21.550> an<00:00:21.669> interesting<00:00:21.730> technique<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.680> I'm<00:00:23.829> going

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
of an interesting technique so I'm going

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.339 
of an interesting technique so I'm going
to<00:00:24.039> just<00:00:24.099> get<00:00:24.579> into<00:00:24.789> it<00:00:24.910> here<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.960> your<00:00:26.110> layers

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
to just get into it here in your layers

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.920 
to just get into it here in your layers
you<00:00:27.189> know<00:00:27.279> obviously<00:00:27.460> if<00:00:27.789> you<00:00:28.060> pick<00:00:28.210> out<00:00:28.360> an

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
you know obviously if you pick out an

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.799 
you know obviously if you pick out an
image<00:00:29.230> and<00:00:29.439> then<00:00:29.529> in<00:00:29.649> your<00:00:29.739> layers<00:00:29.950> you<00:00:30.910> unlock

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:31.809 
image and then in your layers you unlock

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.319 
image and then in your layers you unlock
this<00:00:31.840> background<00:00:32.230> layer<00:00:32.710> I<00:00:32.980> was<00:00:33.969> like<00:00:34.090> to<00:00:34.210> make

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
this background layer I was like to make

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.970 
this background layer I was like to make
a<00:00:34.360> copy<00:00:34.630> of<00:00:34.750> it<00:00:35.820> okay<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:38.290> we'll<00:00:38.559> call<00:00:38.770> this

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
a copy of it okay and we'll call this

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:53.550 
a copy of it okay and we'll call this
layer<00:00:41.309> black<00:00:42.309> and<00:00:44.100> white<00:00:48.150> color<00:00:51.960> okay<00:00:52.960> and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
layer black and white color okay and

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.780 
layer black and white color okay and
then<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.890> next<00:00:53.920> thing<00:00:54.160> that<00:00:54.280> you<00:00:54.430> want<00:00:54.610> to<00:00:54.640> do

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
then the next thing that you want to do

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.990 
then the next thing that you want to do
is<00:00:55.030> make<00:00:55.239> it<00:00:55.480> black<00:00:55.780> and<00:00:55.810> white<00:00:56.110> so<00:00:56.910> there's<00:00:57.910> a

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
is make it black and white so there's a

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.550 
is make it black and white so there's a
few<00:00:58.060> different<00:00:58.300> ways<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:58.600> do<00:00:58.870> this<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:59.440> way

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
few different ways to do this the way

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:09.630 
few different ways to do this the way
that<00:00:59.710> I'm<00:00:59.800> going<00:00:59.980> to<00:01:00.040> do<00:01:00.160> it<00:01:00.340> is<00:01:04.560> go<00:01:05.560> into<00:01:05.770> my<00:01:08.640> my

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
that I'm going to do it is go into my my

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.030 
that I'm going to do it is go into my my
adjust<00:01:09.939> players<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:11.439> you'll<00:01:11.590> click<00:01:11.829> right

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
adjust players and you'll click right

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.350 
adjust players and you'll click right
here<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.369> go<00:01:12.579> into<00:01:12.729> your<00:01:12.820> adjustment<00:01:13.210> layers

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
here to go into your adjustment layers

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.850 
here to go into your adjustment layers
and<00:01:13.600> you'll<00:01:13.719> go<00:01:13.899> into<00:01:14.079> channel<00:01:14.770> mixer<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
and you'll go into channel mixer and

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.820 
and you'll go into channel mixer and
you'll<00:01:18.790> click<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.210> monochrome<00:01:19.840> right<00:01:20.799> here

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
brush them out make it the brush black

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.550 
brush them out make it the brush black
so<00:01:56.229> it<00:01:56.380> will<00:01:56.560> erase<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:58.840> can<00:01:58.990> use<00:01:59.020> white<00:01:59.350> on

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
so it will erase or you can use white on

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.490 
so it will erase or you can use white on
the<00:01:59.590> eraser<00:02:00.810> don't<00:02:01.810> do<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.110> same<00:02:02.350> thing

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the eraser don't do the same thing

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.040 
the eraser don't do the same thing
and<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.580> see<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.360> bringing<00:02:06.630> her

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
and you can see that it's bringing her

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.469 
and you can see that it's bringing her
back<00:02:07.200> into<00:02:07.440> their<00:02:07.820> but<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:09.000> easiest<00:02:09.090> way<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
back into their but the easiest way to

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.240 
back into their but the easiest way to
do<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.320> I'm<00:02:10.470> like<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.979> stop<00:02:11.220> sign

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
do it on and I'm like this stop sign

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.230 
do it on and I'm like this stop sign
would<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.790> be<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.060> take<00:02:12.270> my<00:02:12.890> automatic<00:02:14.240> lasso

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
would just be to take my automatic lasso

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.970 
would just be to take my automatic lasso
tool<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.480> just<00:02:18.530> draw<00:02:19.530> around<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.220> edge<00:02:20.340> a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
tool and just draw around the edge a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.390 
tool and just draw around the edge a
little<00:02:22.980> quicker

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.670 

okay<00:02:30.299> if<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.689> have<00:02:30.810> your<00:02:30.930> selection<00:02:31.379> then<00:02:31.590> you

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
okay if you have your selection then you

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.360 
okay if you have your selection then you
go<00:02:31.799> ahead<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.069> just<00:02:33.409> you<00:02:34.409> can<00:02:34.530> press<00:02:34.739> delete
