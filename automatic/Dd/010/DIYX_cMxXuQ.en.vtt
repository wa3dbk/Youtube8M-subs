00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:08.240
 ouch everyone's friends so gap and 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.240
 so we find ourselves for the 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.830
 first episode of prb trick a new 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.090
 concept that I wanted to set up on my 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.889
 chain so this concept as its name 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.560
 the indicated will allow me to give you 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.269
 pvp tips on certain types 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.730
 of play and in this first episode we 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:26.050
 let's see some advice on a chair 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.199
 so first of all I 'll show you my 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.039
 technique in ultra hunger games have already 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.630
 be aware that there are several 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.059
 game techniques so choose to play 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.440
 all by yourself play team play 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.640
 the agglo it's really me i'll you 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.050
 show my usual gaming technique 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.290
 that is to say, to play alone 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.910
 and then rather seriously 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.910
 let's go for the first tips 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.900
 the spawn and yes it's a pretty moment 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.239
 decisive because according to how 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.680
 you get out low if you lost the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.390
 life it will penalize you and otherwise drool 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.670
 will start a game normally so 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
 solo I advise you not to 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.790
 go to the spawn because it's very 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.470
 risky you have very little chance 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.000
 to get a sword this will often 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.930
 other people who have one and 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.670
 you will often finish when you go out 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.780
 spawn I also advise you to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.759
 do not go where everyone is 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.369
 of course if you have been forced to 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.600
 to miss out on people is not very 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.970
 serious but we must avoid anyway 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.450
 for a brief car it's just 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.450
 chests beside 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.840
 and now we go to the second 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.920
 part that is probably the most 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.930
 important because it concerns 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.850
 the entire game so I'm going to you 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.010
 give some ex tips with respect to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.040
 that will help you access the 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.040
 final 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.670
 so first advice for me he is 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.830
 pretty basic but for some I you 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.030
 really advises to use it it's 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.350
 to see yourself looking behind you because 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.460
 that it happened very quickly to be 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.780
 kill when we are in a chest or 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.550
 when we write because we did not do 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.619
 goof who had the opponent behind 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.340
 so often look behind you 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.340
 can save your life 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.090
 other advice that is also basic 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.530
 for me but it's probably for 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.870
 many more of you teams 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.640
 do them by separating them 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.470
 people ie do you do a 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.000
 by one it's a lot easier you 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.560
 take half the damage and you 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.060
 inflict twice more because 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.980
 when the guys on you can you 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.420
 typing as one at a time or so this 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.530
 will be less effective and we took two 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.450
 times more damage while the arch 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.550
 after or focus very rarely on a 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.720
 person and you will receive damage that 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.290
 on the part of a person so that's 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.290
 much easier 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.090
 another tip that is probably 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.500
 used people's work it's to get 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.100
 hide it can be useful in two 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.830
 different domains 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.170
 defense is practical you put in 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.160
 slick and so or just ap to someone 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.180
 against whom you do not want to 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.340
 fight or so if you do not have 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.780
 many lives but it is equal in 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.980
 practice in the head you can create 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.260
 ambushes that allows you to give 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.940
 a few hits without being able to 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.530
 type that will clearly give you 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.880
 the advantage other technique that can 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.350
 to be useful in some cases it's 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.420
 when you have an enemy against you 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.739
 that you just started fighting and 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.310
 that he starts to flee whatever your 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.770
 quality of life 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.330
 do not run away because he believes you 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.010
 really have a lot of lives and 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.050
 will allow the slightest mistake that he 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.650
 would kill him to finish him off and 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.650
 win the fight 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.280
 and finally last trick is a little 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.080
 little more technical this time it's the 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.940
 f3 then that's really handy for 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.230
 them down when you look 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.940
 players to kill to shorten the 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.410
 part and where it allows you to 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.410
 see seeing that his mass as the blocks but 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.580
 it still shows the entities 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.190
 the players are part and its entities 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.910
 so that allows you to find and the 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.910
 kill or at least try 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.190
 in the final whether it's having done 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.680
 a lot of kiel or staying in 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.300
 your corner has finally arrived there you 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.190
 will have to face someone at 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.569
 less as well except you last 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.569
 obstacle before reaching the victory 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.680
 there are not really any tricks that can 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.150
 to succeed me the final I advise you 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.560
 still eat a golden apple even 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.240
 if you are crazy life for you 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.980
 allow to extend or have a 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.550
 chorus of absorption the body in addition 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.600
 it's still very difficult 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.889
 other than that there are not really any tips 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.290
 really use all the weapons the 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:39.870
 lighter the bow here that's it really plays 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.870
 in pure and hard pt go good luck 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:55.110
 and yes it's really fun to play 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.510
 but play against fair play people 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.560
 it's really nice 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.910
 for example to be fair play you 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.340
 can you say gg when you do that he 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.080
 finally after if it's three days 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.139
 in greece is very normal not to 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.120
 say 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.289
 but also do not say cheater 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.370
 when you make it is by 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.650
 someone who is just stronger 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.970
 that you 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.990
 we do not go old when for example 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.639
 we leave you from behind it's from 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.040
 your fault you just have to do more 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.580
 watch out with more violent 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.840
 for example at the bottom 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.050
 make video of it you can see 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.430
 screen of different people slaughtered 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.350
 so I advise you not to be 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.150
 like her because 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.490
 it's really not nice and often 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.900
 it's really for 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.220
 in any case I hope these tips 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.630
 you will have more because I would have had 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.020
 a lot of time to make them taste 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.370
 ideas that makes 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.590
 several weeks that I think so 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.419
 I hope it will have you true in 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.590
 more do not hesitate to put your opinion 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.780
 in the comments if you have 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.230
 really and mythical video 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.000
 as well as at m I like it causes 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.300
 bah subscribe to the east 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.300
