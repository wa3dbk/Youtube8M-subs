00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello everyone, weâ€™ll find you and yourself or 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.429
 This is a small video in which I will tell 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.440
 how to play the hunger games will be two 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.290
 option first option for licensed 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.450
 version and the second for the pirate I will tell 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.150
 how are they different and how are they caused 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.410
 what is the difference between their pros and cons so 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.580
 let's go to the first method 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.189
 so the first way to take advantage 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.439
 official official servers 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.789
 hunger games on the site minecraft 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.980
 world games. 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.349
 the link to it will be under the description in what 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.360
 his first plus is very convenient here 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.410
 and a menu that lets you perfectly 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.079
 monitor server 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.540
 let's look at it in more detail first 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.510
 this lobby this lobby for now as you know 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.879
 Where mapo is chosen, that is, it is shown here 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.879
 how many people are playing and you can 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.100
 choose a game and connect also you 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.879
 here can be divided by region to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.940
 you had less lag here reboot it 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.570
 that is, the river above the server without a match nudism 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.219
 Pts happens and lives with a love game 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.430
 actually what are the advantages of this method 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.110
 and the first plus is that there is less 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.790
 lay dependencies on the second method 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.670
 because these are official servers and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.900
 here the host is more powerful and the second plus 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.140
 this is a more convenient site and menu 3 3 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.299
 this is something that is more convenient to play 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.020
 hungry games that is less steamed 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.080
 and if you haven't seen the hungry play 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.140
 games with this website link 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.119
 will appear in the annotation on the right above so 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.520
 let's go to the second way the second way 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.790
 for the pirated version of minecraft it 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.510
 connect to ip server 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.940
 and the same hunger games but it works 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.830
 also for pirated clients now i 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.980
 I'll tell you the pros cons of this server and 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.380
 I will tell a little bit because a little bit on 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.860
 first look there is quite confusing 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.100
 such a 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.350
 and management so in iconography on the server 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.050
 enter login now I am leading it and 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.940
 continue the pine after you enter the login you 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.110
 must do the following things now I 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.720
 to you I am already so hungry with water 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.209
 games is server multi server as far as i am 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.820
 remember and so you will need to go 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.440
 you will spawn there 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.290
 button go to the hunger games 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.390
 but you move on and so you find yourself 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.240
 this such a platform and in shock do not know 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.580
 What are they doing what I in where to go 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.860
 in principle everything is very simple and so 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.580
 there are two sides this is left and right 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.090
 on each of them there is a server 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.160
 hungry games here are the tablets they are multi 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.280
 nameplates that is you press right 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.560
 mouse button in the part of the game writes Volodya 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.290
 start this means that the game is already read 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.820
 we can not dream of the second too 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.610
 the most with 3 of 4 of 5 6 7 8 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.350
 and if none of these plates are 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:03.890
 work on sin in another country and 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.890
 try to connect there already 18-17 16 15 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:13.749
 14 13 12 11 well, I am out of luck right now 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:19.329
 none of none of these arenas now 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:24.609
 not free but here arena 12 is over 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:27.549
 looking for 12 arena here it is 12 arena she 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:31.299
 full, that is, the same pronax is impossible 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.739
 and actually what turns out you already 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.810
 channel with the hunger games 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.030
 hour I will tell minus this method 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.120
 The first is here is such I do not like 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.409
 personally such lambie sites are much 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.560
 convenient second minus is that the server 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:50.049
 very cruel 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.319
 it is right lag him and true I now 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.949
 literally played with me just I went 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:01.419
 tried to beat the air count well and how 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:04.209
 there it turned out seven kill there as well 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:08.290
 there is a minus in the fact that there is less 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:11.370
 people play though a large number 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.199
 I won't say anything 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.090
 actually plus of this method in that 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:21.900
 that he for a pirate that is, does not require 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:24.009
 cost and no money and 2 2 such 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.220
 the plus sign is what I think is here 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:33.610
 more Russians will actually 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:37.570
 still such interesting is in principle 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.900
 all i think choose the way that you 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.630
 convenient all everyone involved was oleg the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.250
 game says he was me and it was a video 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.250
 how to play the hunger games
