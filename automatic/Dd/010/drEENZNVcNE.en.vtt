you went to put some essence right so

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.850 
you went to put some essence right so
then<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.719> take<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.110> essence<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.680> put<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
diamonds it's quite a bit of diamonds so

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.080 
diamonds it's quite a bit of diamonds so
it's<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.739> diamond<00:00:55.949> per<00:00:56.340> piece<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.969> there's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
it's one diamond per piece and there's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.180 
it's one diamond per piece and there's
three<00:00:57.390> sets<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> math<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.070> one

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
three sets so do the math on that one

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.849 
three sets so do the math on that one
it's<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.609> an<00:00:59.940> absurd<00:01:00.359> amount<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
it's not an absurd amount but and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:02.930 
it's not an absurd amount but and
currently<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> last<00:01:02.550> play<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.730> I'm

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that's what it looks like if you want a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.050 
that's what it looks like if you want a
third-person<00:02:03.060> view<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> thief

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
third-person view of it so the thief

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
third-person view of it so the thief
armor<00:02:06.420> requires<00:02:06.810> these<00:02:07.049> as<00:02:07.200> well<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
armor requires these as well this is a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.680 
armor requires these as well this is a
red<00:02:08.250> wool<00:02:08.459> all<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.030> way<00:02:09.090> around<00:02:09.390> for<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
red wool all the way around for the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.240 
red wool all the way around for the
helmet<00:02:09.989> for<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> hood<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.649> guess<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.039> hood

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
helmet for the hood I guess the hood

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.430 
helmet for the hood I guess the hood

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
he has night vision and strength and I

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.130 
he has night vision and strength and I
believe<00:02:41.610> he<00:02:41.760> has<00:02:41.940> like<00:02:42.210> haste<00:02:42.510> or<00:02:42.720> something

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
believe he has like haste or something

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.410 
believe he has like haste or something
cuz<00:02:43.320> he<00:02:43.500> moves<00:02:43.740> really<00:02:44.670> quickly<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:45.180> think

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
cuz he moves really quickly I think

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.520 
cuz he moves really quickly I think
that's<00:02:45.570> what<00:02:45.690> haste<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.140> don't<00:02:46.320> remember

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
that's what haste is I don't remember

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.920 
that's what haste is I don't remember
but<00:02:47.160> he<00:02:47.400> has<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.610> ability<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.970> move<00:02:48.120> extremely

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
but he has the ability to move extremely

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.290 
but he has the ability to move extremely
quickly<00:02:49.170> as<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> thief<00:02:49.890> in<00:02:50.280> real<00:02:50.550> life<00:02:50.790> would<00:02:51.240> I

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
quickly as a thief in real life would I

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.360 
quickly as a thief in real life would I
guess<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.320> that's<00:02:52.470> really<00:02:52.620> cool<00:02:52.800> armor<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.310> I

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
guess so that's really cool armor so I

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.100 
guess so that's really cool armor so I
guess<00:02:53.550> if<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.330> all<00:02:54.450> three<00:02:54.690> sets<00:02:54.960> it

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
guess if you have all three sets it

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.570 
guess if you have all three sets it
pretty<00:02:55.260> much<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:55.470> determines<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.250> what<00:02:56.460> you

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
pretty much just determines on what you

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.040 
pretty much just determines on what you
want<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.790> actually<00:02:56.970> do<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.690> once<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.930> take

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
want to actually do and once you take

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.660 
want to actually do and once you take
the<00:02:58.200> armor<00:02:58.410> off<00:02:58.560> even<00:02:59.010> though<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.190> still<00:02:59.460> have

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
the armor off even though you still have

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.360 
the armor off even though you still have
something<00:03:00.360> effects<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.990> lose<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.980> majority

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
something effects you lose the majority

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.880 
something effects you lose the majority
of<00:03:02.400> them<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.420> obviously<00:03:03.840> they<00:03:04.260> disappear

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
of them and obviously they disappear

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.100 
of them and obviously they disappear
after<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.130> while<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:06.570> then<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.960> what<00:03:07.080> I

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
after a while and then on to what I

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.170 
after a while and then on to what I
consider<00:03:07.260> my<00:03:07.620> favorite<00:03:08.070> set<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.700> scale

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
consider my favorite set is the scale

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.270 
consider my favorite set is the scale
armor<00:03:09.390> let<00:03:10.110> me<00:03:10.200> turn<00:03:10.350> off<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.560> weather

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
armor let me turn off the weather

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.160 
armor let me turn off the weather
because<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:13.200> likes<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.500> do<00:03:13.860> this<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:15.170> don't

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
because it likes to do this I don't

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.270 
because it likes to do this I don't
think<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.350> can<00:03:16.410> actually<00:03:16.680> turn<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.130> weather
