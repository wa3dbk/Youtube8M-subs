this version of Pinkie Pie really a lot
because<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.209> thought<00:03:41.389> she<00:03:41.540> looked<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:42.049> adorable

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
because I thought she looked so adorable

only<00:03:45.739> thing<00:03:45.919> I'm<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.069> little<00:03:46.160> bummed<00:03:46.579> about<00:03:46.730> is

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
only thing I'm a little bummed about is

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.150 
only thing I'm a little bummed about is
that<00:03:47.209> she<00:03:47.389> is<00:03:47.480> missing<00:03:47.630> one<00:03:47.959> of<00:03:47.989> her<00:03:48.169> shoes<00:03:48.470> but

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
that she is missing one of her shoes but

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.470 
that she is missing one of her shoes but
it's<00:03:49.370> Pinkie<00:03:49.639> Pie<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.030> don't<00:03:50.239> think<00:03:50.389> she

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
it's Pinkie Pie so I don't think she

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.909 
it's Pinkie Pie so I don't think she
will<00:03:50.630> really<00:03:50.810> mind<00:03:51.109> in<00:03:51.290> fact<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.620> think<00:03:51.680> she

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919

will just have fun with having just one
bare<00:03:53.810> foot<00:03:54.109> or<00:03:54.379> maybe<00:03:54.739> instead<00:03:54.919> I<00:03:55.099> should<00:03:55.220> say

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
bare foot or maybe instead I should say

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.490 
bare foot or maybe instead I should say
one<00:03:55.730> bare<00:03:55.970> hoof<00:03:56.239> she<00:03:56.660> did<00:03:57.019> come<00:03:57.230> with<00:03:57.410> her

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500

one bare hoof she did come with her
dress<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:58.040> as<00:03:58.190> you<00:03:58.340> can<00:03:58.459> see<00:03:58.519> it's<00:03:58.849> still

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
dress and as you can see it's still

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.720 
dress and as you can see it's still
really<00:03:59.569> nice<00:03:59.750> her<00:04:00.290> hair<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.829> tail<00:04:01.250> definitely

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
really nice her hair and tail definitely

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.970 
really nice her hair and tail definitely
needs<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:02.000> little<00:04:02.180> bit<00:04:02.359> of<00:04:02.510> taming<00:04:03.109> but<00:04:03.799> it's

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980
