 Hello! 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 We believe that all children deserve access to education because it transforms lives. 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 It helps break the cycle of poverty and creates opportunities for the future. 

00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:26.100
 This is where we come on the scene. We may all be sweet, but we work hard to get more kids to school. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.200
 However, we can not do it alone. 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:39.200
 For every soft toy purchased, the IKEA Foundation donates 1 euro to UNICEF and Save the Children. Together, we help children get the education they deserve. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 So, from all of us, thank you very much for participating in the Soft Toys for Education campaign.
