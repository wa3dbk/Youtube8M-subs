00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.299
 I would not 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.280
 go 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.000
 I do not know 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.410
 there are 12 tracks in a villa we are in 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.110
 special in a thousand subscribers and good 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.700
 we are here in my room and good 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.520
 well this is my computer is a laptop 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:34.940
 why are we really fucking 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:37.350
 is already five years old and it is this model 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.059
 so I want to stop and still provide more 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.579
 of 500 5520 but we are going that if not 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:50.839
 continue almost is I do it a little more and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.839
 do not cook me and we go this emirate 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.360
 well I think the clearest of all 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:04.320
 helmets and we were looking for me 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.130
 they counted 50 euros so they are 1 sp touch and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.590
 I bought it 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.200
 for to play the full play 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.939
 has here the micro that with what he recorded 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.600
 this micro with which I am now 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:20.229
 recording I was going with the mobile phone 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.229
 and well, this 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:28.740
 we go from the helmets to put the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:34.680
 liters starting in volume with this 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.560
 mini laptop and it 's very good at almost 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.210
 no game and he does not work for me 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.060
 because I have the graph to the minimum and not 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.060
 I could play and that's it 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.000
 I can leave the same computer if I 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.810
 I bought first bought that did not insure 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.630
 still right now they are seeing and good 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.170
 Well, they said if you like it and everything and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.040
 well I'll put it here if I can be worth 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.600
 in the tower and the screen and well then 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.000
 can teach a little more not because no 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.840
 be very short in the games that I have of 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.840
 the play 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.700
 they are high are little 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.080
 and we're going it alone that I like because 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.870
 they are really expensive I do not have much 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.480
 although now I do not play much because I do not 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.349
 I got it 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.700
 then he already used that and well the disc 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:38.230
 hard that I talked about this is a hard drive 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.920
 500gb 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.540
 and that's where I keep everything 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.480
 actually with a 200 so I hope that 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.970
 I liked this has been my setup 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.550
 special 1000 my room is my computer 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.250
 and it's good if I buy a new 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.050
 I will teach it and everything goes well 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.180

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.180
