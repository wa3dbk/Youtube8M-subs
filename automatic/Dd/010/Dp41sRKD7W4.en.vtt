00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:24.599
"Speaker 1: I'm Yianni Gagianas in this is
the day research lab at the University of

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:25.599
Delaware.

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:40.450
So I'm a junior biomedical engineering major
and I'm a research assistant here.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.580
I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.080
My dad is actually a physician, in Pittsburgh
there is a lot of biomedical technology and

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.140
research going on, so I was exposed to it
from a very young age so I always had an interest

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.220
in sciences and into, going into research.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.470
In our lab we are specifically trying to treat
breast cancer.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.491
We create nano particles to specifically targeted
the cancer cells and not the healthy tissue

00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:19.440
around it, and we do that by taking what's
called a nano shell and conjugating on antibodies

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.440
to that.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.770
And we expose it to a laser which keeps up
the shell and kills all the cancer cells around

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.250
it, leaving with the healthy tissues alive.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.950
I specifically wanted to go into cancer research
for a couple reasons, first off my grandmother

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.330
actually is a breast cancer survivor so that
hits home in my family, and here at the University

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.500
of Delaware I've been heavily involved in
UDance which is a 12 hour Dance Marathon benefited,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.420
benefiting Pediatric Cancer Research.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.940
And through that I've met some amazing children
who have pediatric cancer and gotten, gotten

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.610
very tight with their families and this really
serves as a, an inspiration for me to do this

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:14.190
work and to hopefully come up with something
that will benefit people with cancer.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.569
In the lab I specifically do three things,
first I sympathize are nano particles.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.569
Next, I will treat our cancer cells with the
particles.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.790
And lastly I will image the particles on the
microscope to see if our treatment was effective

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.819
or not.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.220
So what I really like about doing research
is the ability to use critical thinking and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.720
problem solving skills, what I've learned
since being in the lab is that not everything

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.040
goes as you planted it the first time or even
the second time, but what I enjoy most is

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.099
learning to adjust and learning to fix the
problem that you encountered so the next time

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.040
it can be better.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.739
The biggest thing I've learned from being
involved in undergraduate research is to keep

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.060
trying.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.810
You always want everything to work the first
time but where you really feel fulfilled is

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.660
whenever it doesn't work the first time or
the second time, and you persist and it works

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.800
eventually.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.921
That's really what I've taken out of research
it's, it's that persistence in that, that

00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:29.069
drive.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.410
I really love what I do in this lab, it's
a great opportunity to take what I learn in

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.710
the classroom and to apply it to real life
situations and I really feel like we have

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.840
a huge potential to help people who need it.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.270
In my free time I like to go fishing, play
soccer, travel, and hang out with my friends.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.760
My goal as an undergraduate researcher is
to help make discoveries that will not only

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.349
help our lab group, but will be able to help
other researchers throughout the world when

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.870
they're looking at those that are related
to our research, so that what we do here can

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.329
help everybody else."
