this kind of handy to have but it also

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.830 
this kind of handy to have but it also
the<00:01:02.129> cooling<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.059> right<00:01:03.510> through<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the cooling on this is right through the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.299 
the cooling on this is right through the
top<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.409> put<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:04.710> hand<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.220> like

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
top and if I put my hand here it's like

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.550 
top and if I put my hand here it's like
a<00:01:05.339> toaster<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.150> literally<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.049> heat<00:01:07.290> just

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
a toaster it literally the heat just

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.530 
a toaster it literally the heat just
kind<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.860> Rises<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.790> top<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.299> feel

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
kind of Rises out of the top I can feel

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.390 
kind of Rises out of the top I can feel
the<00:01:09.689> flow<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.320> very<00:01:10.500> quiet<00:01:10.740> system<00:01:11.280> if

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the flow and it's a very quiet system if

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.020 
the flow and it's a very quiet system if
you<00:01:11.460> listen<00:01:11.760> listen<00:01:13.700> doesn't<00:01:14.700> make<00:01:14.790> any<00:01:14.939> noise

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you listen listen doesn't make any noise

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.730 
you listen listen doesn't make any noise
so<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> real<00:01:16.530> quiet<00:01:16.830> system<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
so it's a real quiet system we do have a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.890 
so it's a real quiet system we do have a
HDMI<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.400> actually<00:01:20.729> digital<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.689> then

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
HDMI this is actually digital but then

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.899 
HDMI this is actually digital but then
it's<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.590> an<00:01:22.680> HDMI<00:01:23.070> conversion

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
it's going right to an HDMI conversion

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.890 
it's going right to an HDMI conversion
and<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.330> into<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.290> large<00:01:26.189> screen<00:01:26.640> piece<00:01:27.000> 32
