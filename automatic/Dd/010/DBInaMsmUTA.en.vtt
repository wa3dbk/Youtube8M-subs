 hollande joventut ofcom welcome to a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.849
 new video today I bring you a very note 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.410
 important to you 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.410
 so pay close attention to them 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.970
 I will explain something very easy how they are going to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.129
 unlock your team if by chance 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.830
 I put a pattern and they do not remember 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.390
 what was the school then here they 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.899
 I'm going to explain 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.390
 first of all let's turn off the equipment 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.430
 completely off ok it should be mentioned 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.960
 that if you do this method you are 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.730
 it will delete the information the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.250
 applications that have had downloaded 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.930
 they're already going to erase the games they had 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.720
 content of a good internal memory 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.780
 let's go to recovery mode 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.930
 let's first the power button together with 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.140
 the volume key more 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 ok we press both at the same time or 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.369
 they have to be both at the same time 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.600
 until it goes into recovery mode which is 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.670
 this is the recovery mode 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.310
 you do not be afraid if you follow the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.850
 steps just as I say, it's not going to 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.040
 spend nothing ok then to move 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.920
 here is only with the up key 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.490
 and the bottom key the least volume 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.990
 is to move down 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.800
 we move and we're going to go where it says 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.800
 this factor and we do not factory reset yesterday 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.200
 and with the power button is we are going to give 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.119
 as ok 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.920
 here we are going to move with the keys 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.939
 from volume down to reach a 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.939
 index and is 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.510
 and again with the power control we're going 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.580
 talk ok and that is the process that 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.619
 we have to do press ok let's go to 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.940
 wait for it to fully load the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.369
 equipment in which the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.110
 factory restoration and the equipment is going to 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.480
 to remain as such as new is not going to 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.130
 nothing is going to just be like 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.690
 new and since it is not new, it does not have 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.660
 no information to go back to 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.980
 set up your gmail account download 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.980
 the applications that you had before 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.970
 if they had pictures in your internal memory 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.340
 probably the good is put when 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.980
 we appear this way we go to the cinema 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.900
 where it says reboot system nose that is the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.300
 first line I lower it here so that 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.360
 you can read it well and again 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.580
 with the power button we give it and the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.500
 phone will automatically pay and 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.510
 is going to learn again 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.230
 this is a simple step the truth is not 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.599
 afraid this is what 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.310
 if you happen to be 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.920
 block your computer you can not which one is it 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.200
 the pattern in this mode is how are they going to 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.670
 unlocking is easy is safe without 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.290
 risk 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.409
 cut the video because the truth took 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.330
 It took a lot of about 5 minutes 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.330
 approximately undertakes but it is normal 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.760
 and now we see that it is already in the 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.530
 initial screen already entered doubt the 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.019
 welcome as it is when it is new 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.019
 and then nothing friends this 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.410

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.200
