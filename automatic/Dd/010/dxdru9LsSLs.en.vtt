00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.060 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.870 

I<00:00:12.150> will<00:00:13.050> be<00:00:13.200> using<00:00:13.320> TC<00:00:13.860> Electronics<00:00:14.340> D<00:00:14.700> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
I will be using TC Electronics D to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.040 
I will be using TC Electronics D to
delay<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:16.490> how<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.550> will<00:00:17.850> start<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.450> will<00:00:18.870> go

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
delay and how we will start it will go

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.519 
delay and how we will start it will go
to<00:00:19.110> devices<00:00:19.530> VST<00:00:20.430> connections<00:00:21.050> then<00:00:22.050> create

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
to devices VST connections then create

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.060 
to devices VST connections then create
an<00:00:22.800> external<00:00:23.340> effect<00:00:24.270> I<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.590> hooked<00:00:25.830> up

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
an external effect I have it hooked up

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.650 
an external effect I have it hooked up
as<00:00:26.279> mono<00:00:26.610> and<00:00:28.310> it's<00:00:29.310> connected<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.090> v

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
as mono and it's connected to the v

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.090 
as mono and it's connected to the v
output<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.320> third<00:00:32.070> input<00:00:33.800> okay

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
output and third input okay

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.460 
output and third input okay
and<00:00:35.270> let's<00:00:36.270> name<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:39.740> okay<00:00:41.900> so<00:00:42.900> how<00:00:43.140> do<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.350> use

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
then you select external plugins TC D -

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
then you select external plugins TC D -
okay<00:00:53.070> now<00:00:53.310> help<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.820> then<00:00:54.420> I'll<00:00:54.570> put<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
send to fully wet and check the delay

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.749 
send to fully wet and check the delay
with<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:02.450> okay<00:01:03.559> then<00:01:04.559> I'll<00:01:04.739> put<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.040> back<00:01:05.250> to

Cubase

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.950 

how<00:01:29.570> about<00:01:29.780> if<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.050> want<00:01:30.320> to<00:01:30.380> record<00:01:30.920> that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
how about if you want to record that

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.580 
how about if you want to record that
thing<00:01:32.960> there<00:01:33.830> is<00:01:33.950> two<00:01:34.159> ways<00:01:34.330> you<00:01:35.330> can<00:01:35.570> put<00:01:36.470> it

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
thing there is two ways you can put it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.550 
thing there is two ways you can put it
so<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.310> add<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.610> new<00:01:37.970> audio<00:01:38.330> track<00:01:38.560> and

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
so that you add a new audio track and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.080 
so that you add a new audio track and
then<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.220> add<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.430> new<00:01:40.729> track<00:01:41.440> new<00:01:42.440> input<00:01:43.090> mono

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
then you add a new track new input mono

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.280 
then you add a new track new input mono
and<00:01:44.890> not<00:01:45.890> connect<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.400> or<00:01:46.930> was<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.200> other

and not connect it or was it the other

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:57.670 
and not connect it or was it the other
way<00:01:48.470> around<00:01:53.470> new<00:01:54.470> output<00:01:54.860> okay<00:01:55.550> and<00:01:56.530> write<00:01:57.530> it

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
way around new output okay and write it

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:08.859 
way around new output okay and write it
there<00:02:04.270> okay<00:02:05.920> so<00:02:06.920> now<00:02:07.160> it's<00:02:07.340> going<00:02:07.580> there<00:02:07.869> let's

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
there okay so now it's going there let's

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:09.969 
there okay so now it's going there let's
go<00:02:09.019> in<00:02:09.140> there

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
go in there

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.460 
go in there
yeah<00:02:10.670> yeah<00:02:10.940> yeah<00:02:11.450> yeah<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.070> so<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.410> now<00:02:15.410> you
