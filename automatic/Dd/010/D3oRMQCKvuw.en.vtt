a<00:01:04.530> forward<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.010> think<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.670> was

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
a forward I think just because it was

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.969 
a forward I think just because it was
defense<00:01:06.119> being<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.420> low<00:01:06.570> he's<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:07.560> 26

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
defense being so low he's got 26

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.590 
defense being so low he's got 26
contract<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:08.580> he<00:01:08.670> also<00:01:08.790> has<00:01:09.000> three<00:01:09.180> training

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
contract but he also has three training

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.690 
contract but he also has three training
slots<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.020> could<00:01:10.200> literally<00:01:10.439> slap<00:01:10.770> slap

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
slap slap you could slap three plus 5s

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.660
