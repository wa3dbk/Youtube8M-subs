00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.530 
too much yeah he loses a lot of his
kiting<00:03:19.890> potential<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:20.610> your<00:03:20.730> overall<00:03:20.850> damage

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
kiting potential but your overall damage

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.910 
kiting potential but your overall damage
output<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:22.019> relatively<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.650> same

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
output is relatively the same

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.819 
output is relatively the same
madlife<00:03:23.549> up<00:03:23.790> there<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.090> was<00:03:24.180> godhand<00:03:24.900> your

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
madlife up there that was godhand your

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.280 
madlife up there that was godhand your
damage<00:03:26.100> output<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.430> relatively<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.239> same<00:03:27.390> so

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
damage output is relatively the same so

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.680 
damage output is relatively the same so
i<00:03:28.590> think<00:03:28.829> okay<00:03:29.400> if<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.610> go<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.910> my<00:03:30.120> go<00:03:30.239> fork<00:03:30.540> if

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
i think okay if I go this my go fork if

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.750 
i think okay if I go this my go fork if
I<00:03:30.780> go<00:03:30.930> ie<00:03:31.110> my<00:03:31.500> dueling<00:03:31.920> potential<00:03:32.400> was

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
I go ie my dueling potential was

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.310 
I go ie my dueling potential was
incredible<00:03:33.239> because<00:03:33.360> as<00:03:33.570> Azrael<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.140> always

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
incredible because as Azrael I always

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.789 
had the problem if if a tank if a
jungler<00:03:36.570> if<00:03:36.750> someone<00:03:36.989> like<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.140> gets<00:03:37.530> into

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
jungler if someone like that gets into

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.650 
jungler if someone like that gets into
the<00:03:37.890> backline<00:03:38.280> gets<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.730> me<00:03:38.850> I'm<00:03:39.060> pretty<00:03:39.450> well
