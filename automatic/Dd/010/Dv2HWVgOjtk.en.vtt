00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
guess they were looking for fights and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.309

thought it was going to be a little less
one-sided<00:02:23.400> than<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.420> know<00:02:25.040> they

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
one-sided than this but you know they

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.559 
one-sided than this but you know they
pretty<00:02:26.310> much<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.489> dominated<00:02:27.090> from<00:02:27.120> from

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569
