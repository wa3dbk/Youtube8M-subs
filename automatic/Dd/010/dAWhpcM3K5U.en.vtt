00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:21.520
 I'm going to auction two objects 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:25.390
 the first is the golden ax the act of 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.180
 orenga is broken and to know what 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.860
 you have to do is buy 50 trees to 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.280
 ganglia 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.100
 one in second thing is the beans 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.030
 that many people do not have it because they 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.610
 consider a Japanese event in February 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.280
 and we're going to auction it then if it's going to 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.860

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.440
 the straw of bean 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.629

 those interested will have to start 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.360
 bid from 500,000 hurdles and as 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.110
 there was a lot of mess the last time because the 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:18.490
 we have decided that the bids are between 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.820
 5000 and 10000 hurdles that is if the last 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.860
 pusher has bid 510,000 several 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.990
 then the next one would have to push 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.130
 the 515,000 or 510 thousand 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:36.610

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.320

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:47.570
 at eight in the evening sorry 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:52.080
 and even what is human is the push and the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.510
 later to his people and that but first 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.760

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.540
 Bids that are real if you do not have to 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.280
 You put money because it is the same if 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.860

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.580

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:14.180
 time and without anything that the bids are 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:18.530
