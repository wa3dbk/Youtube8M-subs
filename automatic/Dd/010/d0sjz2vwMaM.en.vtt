00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello to all 47 new life 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.019
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.280
 to make golden but without making them 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.290
 so everyone knows that for the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.910
 to make it need blocks of liver I 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.320
 will show you like that the blocks of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.160
 iron and a pumpkin of fire and a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.380
 pumpkin 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.550
 but there is another technique too 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.350
 with pnj 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.779
 so that's how it 's 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.890
 known technique up and you put no 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.420
 there a golem here he will protect me 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.170
 will protect it will kill the words it's beautiful 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.510
 but in front of his house 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.489
 your house because I showed you 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.649
 me is for example to have several 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.350
 and you do not want to use a lot of 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.800
 ingots to do if you are no 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.860
 survive and ben thanks to the doors and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.070
 wooden planks this one it will be more 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.629
 easy then there I already did the test 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.149
 to be sure that before doing the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.609
 video of course normal 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.220
 so you actually see that to have 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.470
 no more than you see they have to get 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.240
 to reproduce it again it 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.250
 there must be more for there to be 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.540
 have more needs more house 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.850
 and instead of building every house 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.770
 like that so that two wooden boards 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 and one for that symbolizes a 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.280
 house so I made it full 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.750
 full full in there so there they are 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.909
 full in the village pnj they get 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.799
 reproduce or and the little hearts and 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.290
 babies and all the gold as he finds 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.509
 that there is a lot of pnj to I believe that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.220
 sixteen 16 when there's a thing out of 24 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.670
 like that 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.979
 well they can they can 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.049
 appear to protect them so that's 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.909
 very simple I believe a tutorial I think 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.770
 that you understood flat up you go up 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.780
 shows that like that they go 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.470
 appear to kill you one and he'll 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.100
 reappear 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.030
 so you had to do unlimited so 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:59.579
 veiled veiled then go and spit 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.070
 houses and they will go in they 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:07.619
 will breed and make golems 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.800
 so could kill him show you that which 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.340
 we are worried 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.340
 where are you going 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.569
 and therefore they protect the villagers 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.569
 zombies and everything 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.450
 hop there it is 1 a good faith did 4 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.359
 the gaude do and so when I go in 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.719
 kill an up it will reappear and so 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:32.780
 like that you had to do unlimited 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:33.409
 so that's it's not sure I mean 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.310
 that it's not me who invented them 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:41.060
 but it's known so do not follow me 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.220
 who invented it and so that's it 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.500
 may have had to do unlimited 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.000
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.549
 if that's the case do not hesitate to put 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.209
 a little green thumb and where to put a 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.780
 comment 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.700
 and soon game normally make a no 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.090
