so again I'm just going to create a road

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.729 
so again I'm just going to create a road
with<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.149> curved<00:00:57.660> turn<00:00:59.870> to<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.859> just

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
with a curved turn to do this you just

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.000 
with a curved turn to do this you just
create<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> brush<00:01:06.290> preferably<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.619> snap<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
create a brush preferably with snap to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.920 
create a brush preferably with snap to
grid<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:09.110> I'm<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> make<00:01:10.890> mine<00:01:11.570> 256<00:01:12.570> units

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
grid on I'm going to make mine 256 units

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.399 
grid on I'm going to make mine 256 units
wide<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:14.600> then<00:01:16.610> apply<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.689> or<00:01:18.689> create<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
wide and then apply it or create it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.770 
wide and then apply it or create it
actually<00:01:22.460> then

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.090 

make<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.960> length<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.410> want<00:01:28.620> but<00:01:28.890> leave<00:01:29.040> it

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.210 
make it the length you want but leave it
no<00:01:29.340> draw<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:31.110> want<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> create<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.860> smooth

no draw now we want to create a smooth
90<00:01:33.000> degree<00:01:33.210> turn<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.410> do<00:01:34.620> this<00:01:35.780> create<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
90 degree turn so to do this create a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.250 
90 degree turn so to do this create a
box<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.380> Hammer<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.580> brush<00:01:38.790> tool<00:01:40.790> it's

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
box and Hammer with the brush tool it's

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.790 
box and Hammer with the brush tool it's
best<00:01:43.260> to<00:01:43.440> have<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> perfect<00:01:44.580> square<00:01:44.940> and

choppier<00:02:23.310> I've<00:02:23.760> actually<00:02:24.690> found<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.110> 8<00:02:25.290> is

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
choppier I've actually found that 8 is

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.870 
choppier I've actually found that 8 is
really<00:02:26.550> really<00:02:26.970> good<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.330> then<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:29.550> can<00:02:29.700> have

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
really really good and then you can have

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.630 
really really good and then you can have
the<00:02:30.120> starting<00:02:30.510> angle<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:34.170> arc<00:02:34.350> angle<00:02:34.640> so

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
the starting angle and the arc angle so

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.180 
the starting angle and the arc angle so
if<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.120> wanted<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:37.230> u-turn<00:02:37.740> I<00:02:37.800> just

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
if I wanted this to be a u-turn I just

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.960 
if I wanted this to be a u-turn I just
set<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.490> arc<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.970> 180<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:40.230> makes<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.560> turn

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
set the arc to 180 and it makes you turn

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.930 
set the arc to 180 and it makes you turn
but<00:02:41.970> we<00:02:42.060> want<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.330> 90<00:02:42.630> degree<00:02:42.870> turn<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.489> want<00:02:44.760> 9

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
but we want a 90 degree turn so I want 9

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.720 
but we want a 90 degree turn so I want 9
to<00:02:45.090> be<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.660> 90<00:02:46.440> degree<00:02:46.709> arc<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.130> click<00:02:47.340> preview

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
to be a 90 degree arc you click preview

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.900 
to be a 90 degree arc you click preview
and<00:02:48.060> then<00:02:48.180> click<00:02:48.600> OK<00:02:49.190> then<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.370> lag<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:50.880> a

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
and then click OK then in a lag for a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.760 
and then click OK then in a lag for a
second<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.570> will<00:02:51.720> create<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:53.209> then<00:02:54.770> you

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
second and it will create it then you

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.300 
second and it will create it then you
want<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.750> take<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.870> object<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.380> align<00:02:59.280> it

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
want to take the object and align it

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.800 
want to take the object and align it
perfectly<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.910> don't<00:03:00.120> want<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.330> stretch<00:03:00.570> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
perfectly you don't want to stretch and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.590 
perfectly you don't want to stretch and
skew<00:03:01.080> this<00:03:01.260> because<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.739> will<00:03:01.830> disfigure<00:03:02.459> it

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
skew this because it will disfigure it

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.890 
skew this because it will disfigure it

cheat<00:04:19.290> you'll<00:04:19.560> notice<00:04:19.860> that<00:04:19.980> there<00:04:20.160> is<00:04:20.190> no

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
cheat you'll notice that there is no

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
them up because no one really pays

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.310 
them up because no one really pays
attention<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.670> roads<00:04:56.880> that<00:04:57.150> much<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:58.260> you

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
attention to the roads that much so you

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.100 
attention to the roads that much so you
really<00:04:58.650> just<00:04:58.680> gotta<00:04:59.240> make<00:05:00.240> them<00:05:00.390> look

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
really just gotta make them look

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.400 
really just gotta make them look
convincing<00:05:01.830> enough<00:05:02.600> so<00:05:03.600> remove<00:05:04.080> just

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
convincing enough so remove just

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.620 
convincing enough so remove just
basically<00:05:04.740> remove<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.340> tiling<00:05:05.790> effects<00:05:06.150> that

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
basically remove the tiling effects that

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.380 
basically remove the tiling effects that
you're<00:05:06.990> getting<00:05:07.170> from<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.500> road<00:05:10.190> and<00:05:11.390> then

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
you're getting from the road and then

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:20.010 
you're getting from the road and then
you<00:05:12.510> will<00:05:12.690> have<00:05:12.810> a<00:05:13.670> perfect<00:05:14.670> road

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.870 

and<00:05:21.940> again<00:05:22.940> I'm<00:05:23.330> going<00:05:24.460> to<00:05:25.460> also<00:05:25.610> show<00:05:25.730> you

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
and again I'm going to also show you

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.520 
and again I'm going to also show you
guys<00:05:26.120> how<00:05:26.420> to<00:05:26.450> make<00:05:26.660> a<00:05:27.050> three-way

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
guys how to make a three-way

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.570 
guys how to make a three-way
intersection<00:05:30.100> making<00:05:31.100> a<00:05:31.190> three-way

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
intersection making a three-way

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.220 
intersection making a three-way
intersection<00:05:31.790> is<00:05:32.270> relatively<00:05:32.720> simple<00:05:34.030> just

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
intersection is relatively simple just

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.140 
intersection is relatively simple just
create<00:05:36.230> another<00:05:36.380> copy<00:05:36.950> of<00:05:37.130> your<00:05:38.030> road<00:05:38.240> brush

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
create another copy of your road brush

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.960 
create another copy of your road brush
and<00:05:41.150> then<00:05:41.540> you<00:05:42.410> want<00:05:42.620> it<00:05:42.770> to<00:05:42.920> intrude<00:05:43.370> halfway

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
and then you want it to intrude halfway

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.480 
and then you want it to intrude halfway
through<00:05:45.040> the<00:05:46.040> other<00:05:46.190> piece<00:05:46.400> of<00:05:46.520> road<00:05:46.700> then<00:05:48.490> cut

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
through the other piece of road then cut

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.740 
through the other piece of road then cut
a<00:05:49.520> tip<00:05:49.970> out<00:05:50.930> of<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:52.040> intruding<00:05:52.580> piece<00:05:52.880> on<00:05:53.210> a<00:05:53.300> 45

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
a tip out of the intruding piece on a 45

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.640 
a tip out of the intruding piece on a 45
degree<00:05:53.870> angle<00:05:54.020> on<00:05:54.470> both<00:05:54.860> sides<00:05:56.380> so<00:05:57.380> we're

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
degree angle on both sides so we're

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.360 
degree angle on both sides so we're
pretty<00:05:57.740> much<00:05:57.950> making<00:05:58.130> a<00:05:58.310> point<00:05:58.640> or<00:05:58.940> an<00:05:59.030> arrow

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
pretty much making a point or an arrow

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.100 
pretty much making a point or an arrow
then<00:06:01.370> you<00:06:01.490> want<00:06:01.670> to<00:06:01.760> select<00:06:01.970> your<00:06:02.300> other<00:06:02.900> piece

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
then you want to select your other piece

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.520 
then you want to select your other piece
of<00:06:03.230> Road<00:06:04.450> cut<00:06:05.450> it<00:06:05.570> in<00:06:05.660> half<00:06:05.900> I<00:06:07.690> mean<00:06:08.690> split<00:06:09.380> it

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
of Road cut it in half I mean split it

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.890 
of Road cut it in half I mean split it
in<00:06:09.680> half<00:06:09.740> don't<00:06:10.430> cut<00:06:10.820> it<00:06:10.940> so<00:06:11.510> you<00:06:11.600> want<00:06:11.750> both

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
in half don't cut it so you want both

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.310 
in half don't cut it so you want both
sides<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:12.260> be<00:06:12.320> white<00:06:12.620> on<00:06:12.800> the<00:06:12.920> clipping<00:06:13.190> tool

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
sides to be white on the clipping tool

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.180 
sides to be white on the clipping tool
then<00:06:15.320> cut<00:06:16.220> out<00:06:16.370> the<00:06:16.970> inside<00:06:17.930> here<00:06:18.410> so<00:06:18.890> we

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
then cut out the inside here so we

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.660 
then cut out the inside here so we
remove<00:06:19.670> the<00:06:19.910> overlapping<00:06:20.300> texture<00:06:21.670> and

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
remove the overlapping texture and

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.660 
remove the overlapping texture and
delete<00:06:23.000> it<00:06:23.120> and<00:06:23.300> there<00:06:23.960> we<00:06:24.050> go<00:06:24.520> there's<00:06:25.520> a

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
delete it and there we go there's a

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.820 
delete it and there we go there's a
simple<00:06:26.120> three-way<00:06:26.390> intersection<00:06:26.740> for<00:06:27.740> our

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
simple three-way intersection for our

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.530 
simple three-way intersection for our
four-way<00:06:28.190> intersection<00:06:28.730> just<00:06:28.970> repeat<00:06:29.390> the

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
four-way intersection just repeat the

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.170 
four-way intersection just repeat the
same<00:06:29.660> thing<00:06:29.870> on<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.050> other<00:06:30.080> side<00:06:30.850> most<00:06:31.850> Road

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
same thing on the other side most Road

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:39.850 
same thing on the other side most Road
