hello today is Sunday March 9th 2014 and
I'm<00:00:10.050> going<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.410> do<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:12.920> demo<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.460> RFID<00:00:16.369> tag

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
I'm going to do a demo of this RFID tag

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.429 
I'm going to do a demo of this RFID tag
using<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> Arduino<00:00:18.630> that's<00:00:18.869> back<00:00:19.080> here<00:00:21.439> I've

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
using the Arduino that's back here I've

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.550 
using the Arduino that's back here I've
got<00:00:22.680> four<00:00:22.980> tags<00:00:24.500> set<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:26.550> turn<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:27.560> LEDs

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
got four tags set up to turn these LEDs

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.580 
got four tags set up to turn these LEDs
on<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.039> off<00:00:31.610> which<00:00:32.610> would<00:00:32.850> demonstrate<00:00:33.590> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
on and off which would demonstrate you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.530 
on and off which would demonstrate you
know<00:00:34.680> being<00:00:35.370> able<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> turn<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.120> relays<00:00:36.870> or

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
know being able to turn on relays or

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.770 
know being able to turn on relays or
whatever<00:00:39.649> whatever<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.829> need<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.129> do

whatever whatever you need to do
I<00:00:44.239> found<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.480> code<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.890> let's<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.520> I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
I found the code for this let's see if I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.069 
I found the code for this let's see if I
can<00:00:47.789> find<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.120> side<00:00:48.360> again<00:00:52.730> here<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:54.079> Gibson

know<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.579> he's<00:02:05.759> using<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.600> or<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:06.780> he

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
know if he's using all of it or if he

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.320 
know if he's using all of it or if he
just<00:02:06.930> provided<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> commands<00:02:08.489> or<00:02:08.640> what

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
just provided all the commands or what

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.130 
just provided all the commands or what
but<00:02:10.849> anyway

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.720 

really<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.290> only<00:02:16.320> information<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.220> found<00:02:17.520> out

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
really the only information I found out

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.630 
really the only information I found out
about<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.240> thing<00:02:18.300> was<00:02:18.750> on<00:02:18.960> his<00:02:19.170> website<00:02:19.680> it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
about this thing was on his website it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:31.670 
about this thing was on his website it
is<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:21.110> SBI<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.850> can<00:02:30.000> see<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.300> mine<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.440> very

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
is a SBI so you can see on mine the very

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.010 
is a SBI so you can see on mine the very
first<00:02:32.040> pin<00:02:32.820> on<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.630> says<00:02:33.840> s<00:02:34.110> ad<00:02:35.600> on<00:02:36.600> his

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
first pin on it it says s ad on his

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.920 
first pin on it it says s ad on his
website<00:02:37.500> he<00:02:37.709> has<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:38.070> listed<00:02:38.490> as<00:02:38.670> SS<00:02:39.120> going

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
website he has that listed as SS going

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.340 
website he has that listed as SS going
to<00:02:40.020> pin<00:02:40.230> 10<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:42.510> can<00:02:42.630> see<00:02:42.870> right<00:02:43.080> there<00:02:43.140> I

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
to pin 10 you can see right there I

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.750 
to pin 10 you can see right there I
don't<00:02:43.860> have<00:02:44.070> an<00:02:44.220> SS<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.989> s<00:02:46.230> ad<00:02:46.680> apparently<00:02:47.610> it's

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
don't have an SS so s ad apparently it's

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.930 
don't have an SS so s ad apparently it's
the<00:02:47.850> same<00:02:48.090> as<00:02:48.270> SS<00:02:49.370> that's<00:02:50.370> really<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.850> only

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
the same as SS that's really the only

00:02:50.940 --> 00:03:00.160 
the same as SS that's really the only
difference<00:02:53.300> but<00:02:54.300> what<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.660> sketch<00:02:54.930> does<00:02:55.320> I

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.870 

modified<00:03:01.170> his<00:03:01.380> sketch<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> bit<00:03:01.980> obviously<00:03:02.520> for

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
modified his sketch a bit obviously for

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.840 
modified his sketch a bit obviously for
four<00:03:03.420> LEDs<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.380> whatnot<00:03:04.709> but<00:03:05.430> what<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
four LEDs and whatnot but what the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.240 
four LEDs and whatnot but what the
sketch<00:03:06.120> does<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:07.370> I've<00:03:08.370> got<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:08.820> RFID<00:03:09.450> tag

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250

four other ID numbers the first the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.060 
four other ID numbers the first the
first<00:03:49.290> number<00:03:49.709> is<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.190> unique<00:03:50.640> ID<00:03:51.420> for<00:03:52.070> that

first number is the unique ID for that

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.569 
first number is the unique ID for that
card<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.670> then<00:03:54.660> he<00:03:54.930> had<00:03:55.110> on<00:03:55.290> he<00:03:55.920> had<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.250> set<00:03:56.280> up

unique ID part all the unique numbers so
there<00:05:10.120> is<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.360> very<00:05:10.750> simple<00:05:11.430> rfid<00:05:13.470> reader<00:05:14.470> with

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
there is a very simple rfid reader with

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.780 
there is a very simple rfid reader with
the<00:05:15.640> Arduino<00:05:16.320> I<00:05:17.320> don't<00:05:17.920> think<00:05:18.160> this<00:05:18.310> art<00:05:18.580> this

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
the Arduino I don't think this art this

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.180 
the Arduino I don't think this art this
reader<00:05:19.360> has<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:20.170> ability<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.650> write<00:05:20.920> to<00:05:21.070> the

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
reader has the ability to write to the

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.250 
reader has the ability to write to the
cars<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:21.550> think<00:05:21.580> it<00:05:21.880> just<00:05:22.060> reads<00:05:23.010> so<00:05:25.170> there<00:05:26.170> you

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
cars I think it just reads so there you

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.610 
cars I think it just reads so there you
go

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
go

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.330 
go
thanks<00:05:27.070> for<00:05:27.220> watching<00:05:27.310> have<00:05:28.030> a<00:05:28.120> great<00:05:28.240> day
