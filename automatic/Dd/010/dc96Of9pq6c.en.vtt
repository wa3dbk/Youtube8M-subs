so I still kind of feel like it's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.550

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
inappropriate even if they didn't want

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.830 
inappropriate even if they didn't want
to<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.310> what<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.759> guys<00:02:02.969> think<00:02:03.240> whose

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
version off the story do you believe do

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.370 
version off the story do you believe do
you<00:02:05.909> believe<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> state-run<00:02:06.600> media<00:02:06.780> which

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
you believe the state-run media which

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.050 
you believe the state-run media which
said<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:08.009> students<00:02:08.429> wanted<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.819> do<00:02:08.970> it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
said that the students wanted to do it

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.949 
said that the students wanted to do it
voluntarily

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
voluntarily

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.150 
voluntarily

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
but even then do you think it was

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.770 
but even then do you think it was
appropriate<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:12.180> as<00:02:12.270> though<00:02:12.390> your<00:02:12.540> thoughts

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
appropriate that as though your thoughts

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.640 
appropriate that as though your thoughts
