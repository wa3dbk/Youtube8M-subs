first I thought writing this paper about
Harry<00:01:53.159> Potter<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.759> Doctor<00:01:54.149> Who<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.590> I

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
Harry Potter and Doctor Who but then I

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.800 
Harry Potter and Doctor Who but then I
realized<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.610> would<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.329> much<00:01:57.540> work

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
realized that it would be so much work

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.980 
realized that it would be so much work
and<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
and I

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.320 
and I
time<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.500> do<00:01:59.620> it<00:01:59.799> and<00:02:00.040> I<00:02:00.370> mean<00:02:00.580> I<00:02:00.760> have<00:02:01.090> taken

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
time to do it and I mean I have taken

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.899 
time to do it and I mean I have taken
time<00:02:01.750> from<00:02:01.810> August<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.799> December<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.520> do<00:02:03.670> an

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
time from August to December to do an

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.450 
time from August to December to do an
Harry<00:02:04.270> Potter<00:02:04.570> magazine<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.320> if<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:05.740> would<00:02:06.280> be

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
Harry Potter magazine and if it would be

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.309 
Harry Potter magazine and if it would be
about<00:02:06.729> both<00:02:07.060> Harry<00:02:07.659> Potter<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:07.960> Doctor<00:02:08.200> Who

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
about both Harry Potter and Doctor Who

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.010 
about both Harry Potter and Doctor Who
