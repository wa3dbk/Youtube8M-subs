00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.380
Well, let's repeat the "KOEO" test.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.500
Well, let's repeat the "KOEO" test.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.600
Because in the last Test, he gave a permanent
fault code, the 522.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:17.200
And this code means "to make the test KOEO
or KOER, the lever of an automatic auto, must

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.900
be in" PARK "position.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:32.700
So we're going to go to PARK, to start the
KOEO test.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.500
Ready!

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.400
Let's start the test.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.300
First we put the switch key in "on".

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.000
Previously already bypassed in the Tester
under bonnet (as shown in the image of the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
video "10" of this same channel)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.100
Terminal 2 is attached, with the test terminal
or Terminal 5, with a wire or connector.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.100
Ready!

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.400
First, it gives me a very fast flash of "input",
a total voltage (12volts).

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.200
Now, there is a 10-second space, before a
startup Flash, which is given at medium voltage

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.220
(approximately 5volts).

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.820
First, the permanent codes will be given.
Those that keep the light "MIL" on all the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.800
time.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:23.400
The first code comes: 1-1-1 space of 4 seconds
and repeats: 1-1-1, because there are no more

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.900
permanent codes.
Which means that there are NO permanent failures.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.700
Enter a flash separator between permanent codes and temporal codes, spacing them for 4 seconds.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.000
Then, after 4 seconds, all 3-digit permanent
codes are flashed, separating ten and hundreds

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.300
units for 1 second spaces.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.400
and between temporary or permanent code and
temporary or permanent code, there's a 3-second

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.100
space.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.400
The first TEMPORAL code is: 1-1-8..

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.600
At the end of all the permanent codes, spaced
for 4 seconds, they are repeated all over

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.500
again.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.700
1-1-8

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.900
and repeats: 1-1-8, for only one temporal
code.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.300

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:12.400
It is a KOEO test ("Key on Engine off"), so the test ends when repeating all the temporary codes.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.200

it, give me a SUPER I like it.
