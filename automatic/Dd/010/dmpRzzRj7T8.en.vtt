00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.660
 it certainly is to the champion of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.450
 enduro world that came mostly 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.259
 the story let's start with the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.360
 cockpit 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.980
 because it's important that we have a 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.020
 good position of derivatives at the level of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.760
 handlebar levers so the handlebars need to 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.189
 that they're pretty much in the city of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.230
 skin because if the handlebars and robin 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.060
 you risk getting your elbows 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.920
 lower or if it is too high 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.560
 so it might hinder you for the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.510
 piloting the ideal is to have the arm 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.910
 in extension therefore the lever must 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.070
 it is pretty low nitro his vocation 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.390
 general the first bed too low 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.890
 otherwise you are like that would take 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.280
 so the best is in the extension 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.510
 it has to be pretty flat at 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.100
 less when you sit down you have 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.780
 a good position and that you are 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.129
 standing your wrist is not broken no 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.750
 more for the selector and we're going 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.079
 on a neutral basis for a little bit the whole 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.550
 world 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.489
 after each fits a little as he wants 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.320
 it must be in lax at least 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.969
 we made it easier to get under 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.280
 to be able to pass the speed and above 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.830
 to be graded without moving too much because if 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.000
 the lever too much we have to lift his 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 country whose feet to lower the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.630
 speed and therefore it is better to have 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.290
 under so for the brake pedal it's 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.030
 a little different 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.689
 we're going to keep 40 line and callus 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.060
 foot whether it be in lax because in 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.080
 euro we do not go back the pedal of 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.759
 brake life we ​​do that to support 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.549
 above it is high enough to 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.140
 able to remove from his foot in 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.460
 some turns and can not keep 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.320
 foot on the brake because that makes 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.540
 to heat the brother is a small detail 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.189
 which often makes the difference 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.350
 we will talk about the settings of the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.670
 fork before the settings I think 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.220
 to speak of the bleed screw 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.990
 in fact you have to know that a fork 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.310
 when we drive often with it sucks 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.810
 a little bit of air and to have the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.960
 better operation to remove 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.290
 the air is the first one so we have 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.290
 screws 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:03.790
 that's his vices and it's 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.010
 floor and we live again so the screw here 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.750
 from the middle it's the compression the 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.250
 compression it serves to adjust his fork 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.350
 on the impacts the more we serve it more to 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.640
 vale has braked she will become hard and 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.770
 further more it will louvre so 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.720
 flexible so it's called compression 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.500
 and here it is on all the forks 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.239
 so the second set screw it is 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.000
 here inside it's called the 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.120
 relaxation is the same operation 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.860
 when it's served it slows down the extension 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.100
 from the fork and when we have greenhouses 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.200
 it accelerates so you have to know that it 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.630
 must not roll nor found annie very closed 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.250
 because if we reopen motorcycle will have 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.840
 tendency to bounce if you are too closed 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.730
 their tendency to work too low 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.959
 so for the damper the screw of 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.370
 compression is a little different than 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.489
 for the fork because there are two settings 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.760
 central life which in general for a 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.840
 flat and low screwdriver and speed la 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.970
 low speed compression 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.040
 the more you open it the more you confess 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.660
 vase or you relax on small 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.600
 wheels and grace and vicenç who 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.860
 is working on the end of the race so on 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.030
 big shocks 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.620
 so it's always the same you 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.190
 open it more to soften it for him 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.140
 you close it more to the hardens then 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.720
 we will talk about the relaxation of 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.880
 the damper it happens at the foot of 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.450
 the damper is a life without rookie 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.810
 room for a flat screwdriver and that's 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.310
 always the same louvre more 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.870
 gives reaction to the relaxation of 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.420
 the damper more we close it then 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.920
 slows down the damper it's like the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.780
 fork is important enough because if 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.569
 we 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.220
 close too much in general the bike is going gonna 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.980
 be slow and start waddling 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.900
 left right and if we worked it too much she 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.790
 will tend to push you on the front 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.720
 so that'll give you an effect what 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.550
 the back is all the time in the air 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.380
 so here you are going to talk about the 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.140
 last thing of the damper that 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.110
 is called preload that's what will 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.940
 help you see the motorcycle team 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.020
 knowing that a very low bike behind 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.720
 you will have very good traction 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.090
 but she's going hard to fly 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.800
 so we all set apart here by 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.680
 the damper so we'll start with 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:18.780
 tighten the screw from the top so the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:20.790
 contract cro so after that if you want 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.340
 have the bike lower from behind 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.530
 will loosen this damper in reverse 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.880
 you want to have a higher motorcycle 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.270
 is behind because you feel that 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.830
 the back is too low we will remove by 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.020
 there then this action allows to stretch 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.390
 or relax the damper what 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.880
 influences the balance of the bike and 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.150
 now we will explain how 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.770
 measure and see the measure seems 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.650
 so there must be the bike is on a 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.919
 tripod so that the roya do not touch me 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.250
 floor 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.810
 we are going to measure the buduate grow and 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.830
 we must take a reference on the bike 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.990
 who is always the same 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.200
 so here we are going to take the middle 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.780
 between louis the side plate and 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:08.880
 the smell of seeing yesterday so here is there 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.770
 59.5 and now we're going to do the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.590
 same thing with the rider on the bike 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.539
 so there we must stand on love 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.640
 turned into balance you have to have a 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.050
 central position between sitting 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.430
 really in the middle of the bike what if 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.710
 you're sitting too much back it's going 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.010
 modify the preload and it's not good 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.780
 so you have to be like that and so the 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.390
 measure will happen here at the same place 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.220
 where we did earlier and it takes 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.610
 calculate who is 10 cm walk between 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.229
 the bike on the tripod and here you know 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.820
 about the balance of the bike 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.620
 is pretty perfect after it will be up to you 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.620
 to adjust it according to your desire
