00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
eight Meg's on a 3G I've managed to find

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.339 
eight Meg's on a 3G I've managed to find
a<00:00:07.170> tweak<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:08.160> will<00:00:08.460> then<00:00:08.790> enable<00:00:09.139> from<00:00:10.139> eight

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
a tweak that will then enable from eight

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.499 
a tweak that will then enable from eight
up<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:11.780> 25<00:00:12.780> megabits<00:00:13.700> so<00:00:14.700> just<00:00:15.059> keep<00:00:15.330> following

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
up to 25 megabits so just keep following

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.109 
up to 25 megabits so just keep following
and<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.109> will<00:00:16.320> now<00:00:16.440> show<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.800> how<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.400> get<00:00:18.000> that

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
and I will now show you how to get that

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.939 
and I will now show you how to get that
second<00:00:18.660> okay

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
second okay

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.310 
second okay
I<00:00:20.390> now<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:21.630> 4G<00:00:24.590> let's<00:00:25.590> see<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.250> stays<00:00:26.580> on

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
I now have 4G let's see this stays on

00:00:27.320 --> 00:01:01.720 
I now have 4G let's see this stays on
after<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.710> reboot

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.430 

got<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> network<00:01:03.030> back<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.810> it's<00:01:03.960> back<00:01:04.170> down

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
got the network back but it's back down

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.960 
got the network back but it's back down
to<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.760> HS<00:01:05.760> PDA<00:01:06.680> which<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.830> basically<00:01:08.220> 3G<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:10.970> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
to a HS PDA which is basically 3G so to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.770 
to a HS PDA which is basically 3G so to
get<00:01:12.120> that<00:01:12.300> back<00:01:13.820> as<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.000> saw<00:01:15.210> those<00:01:15.420> mega

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
get that back as you saw those mega

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.510 
get that back as you saw those mega
speeds<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> type<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:19.400> star<00:01:20.400> hash<00:01:20.700> star<00:01:21.090> hash

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
speeds so I type in star hash star hash

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.030 
speeds so I type in star hash star hash
four<00:01:23.520> six<00:01:24.240> three<00:01:25.550> six<00:01:26.840> then<00:01:27.840> hash<00:01:28.380> doll<00:01:28.800> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040

start<00:01:30.800> phone<00:01:31.800> information<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.570> go<00:01:36.570> down<00:01:36.930> to

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:50.650 

third<00:01:40.410> Network<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:42.740> select<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:48.170> LTE<00:01:49.369> GSM

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
third Network here select the LTE GSM

WCDMA da that'll change there and if you
notice<00:01:57.720> in<00:01:57.960> second<00:01:58.440> here<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.830> got<00:01:59.070> four

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
notice in second here we go got four
