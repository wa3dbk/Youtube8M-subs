minute there we go I'm going to use an

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.880 
minute there we go I'm going to use an
underpowered<00:00:50.789> servo<00:00:51.469> because<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.649> what<00:00:52.860> I

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
underpowered servo because it's what I

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.029 
underpowered servo because it's what I
have<00:00:53.219> available<00:00:53.579> right<00:00:54.199> now<00:00:55.199> that's<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.559> in

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
have available right now that's not in

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.819 
have available right now that's not in
use<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.579> another<00:00:56.879> vehicle<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.989> good<00:01:01.170> news<00:01:01.379> is

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
use in another vehicle the good news is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.620 
use in another vehicle the good news is
that<00:01:02.270> being<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.510> 1.9<00:01:04.260> rigged<00:01:05.010> not<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> 2.2<00:01:06.090> it's

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
that being a 1.9 rigged not a 2.2 it's

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.100 
that being a 1.9 rigged not a 2.2 it's
not<00:01:06.780> gonna<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.080> tremendous<00:01:07.830> forces<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:09.110> on

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
not gonna have tremendous forces on on

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.340 
not gonna have tremendous forces on on
the<00:01:10.439> servo<00:01:10.680> itself<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.659> should<00:01:12.930> work<00:01:13.110> out

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the servo itself so it should work out

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.999 
the servo itself so it should work out
okay<00:01:14.299> I'm<00:01:15.299> gonna<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.600> using<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.080> SABIC<00:01:16.799> s'

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
okay I'm gonna be using this SABIC s'

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.950 
okay I'm gonna be using this SABIC s'
SC<00:01:17.970> zero<00:01:18.450> three<00:01:19.080> five<00:01:19.110> two<00:01:20.180> just<00:01:21.180> under<00:01:21.479> 100

volts<00:01:27.530> but<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.650> pretty<00:01:28.799> fast<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.630> think<00:01:30.630> this

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
volts but it's pretty fast I think this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:40.940 
volts but it's pretty fast I think this
will<00:01:31.079> work<00:01:31.290> out<00:01:31.500> ok<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:33.570> go<00:01:34.320> there<00:01:39.170> mmm<00:01:40.229> why

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
will work out ok you go there mmm why

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.440 
will work out ok you go there mmm why
don't<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.460> some<00:01:41.970> Phillips

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
don't we have to have some Phillips

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.420 
don't we have to have some Phillips

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
period it should be these are the ends

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:16.140 
period it should be these are the ends
for<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.580> steering<00:02:05.120> column<00:02:13.930> there<00:02:14.930> are<00:02:15.140> those

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
for the steering column there are those

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.360 
for the steering column there are those
the<00:02:17.150> long<00:02:17.300> one<00:02:17.510> uses<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.960> bent<00:02:18.200> end<00:02:18.560> links

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
the long one uses the bent end links

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:32.620 
the long one uses the bent end links
sure<00:02:20.030> one<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:20.870> I'll<00:02:21.020> just<00:02:21.230> straight<00:02:31.210> now<00:02:32.210> this

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
things because these are frame rails

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.460 
things because these are frame rails
nice<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.360> long<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:42.890> time<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:44.510> open<00:02:45.050> up<00:02:45.320> a

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
nice and long it is time to open up a

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.560 
nice and long it is time to open up a
bag<00:02:45.709> F<00:02:46.780> get<00:02:47.780> out<00:02:47.900> some<00:02:48.080> more<00:02:48.230> hardware<00:02:48.650> and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
bag F get out some more hardware and

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.600 
bag F get out some more hardware and
start<00:02:50.570> assembling<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.410> actual<00:02:51.770> main<00:02:52.040> chassis

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
start assembling the actual main chassis

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.640 
start assembling the actual main chassis
itself

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
itself

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.199 
itself
well<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:55.130> spread<00:02:55.459> took<00:02:55.640> me<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.820> little<00:02:55.970> while

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
well this spread took me a little while

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.920 
well this spread took me a little while
to<00:02:56.500> set<00:02:57.500> up<00:02:57.680> because<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.060> parts<00:02:59.480> were<00:02:59.630> from

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
to set up because the parts were from

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.860 
to set up because the parts were from
all<00:03:00.140> sorts<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.770> different<00:03:01.010> parts<00:03:01.430> bins<00:03:01.870> but

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
all sorts of different parts bins but

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.500 
all sorts of different parts bins but
eventually<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.380> came<00:03:03.560> together<00:03:03.880> yeah<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:04.910> got

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
eventually it came together yeah I got

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.930 
eventually it came together yeah I got
everything<00:03:05.630> just<00:03:06.110> laid<00:03:06.410> out<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:07.520> way<00:03:07.730> it's

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
everything just laid out the way it's

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.110 
everything just laid out the way it's
gonna<00:03:08.120> go<00:03:08.209> together<00:03:09.100> with<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.519> necessary

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
gonna go together with the necessary

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.340 
gonna go together with the necessary
hardware<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:11.690> everything<00:03:12.019> some<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.260> these

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
hardware and everything some of these

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.150

transmission got a little a couple of
slots<00:04:54.870> right<00:04:55.229> in<00:04:55.350> here<00:04:55.699> and<00:04:56.699> it's<00:04:57.150> just<00:04:57.449> one

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
slots right in here and it's just one

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
screw per side no nut needed cuz it's

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.279

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
uppers get bolted to the chassis now it

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.129

diameter motor a five forty motor and

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.719 
diameter motor a five forty motor and
the<00:05:24.510> screw<00:05:25.139> right<00:05:25.380> here<00:05:25.440> that<00:05:25.740> attaches<00:05:26.520> the

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
the screw right here that attaches the

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.620 
the screw right here that attaches the

upper link the upper wishbone Y link a
third<00:05:31.320> link<00:05:32.300> actually<00:05:33.300> not<00:05:33.570> the<00:05:33.690> screw<00:05:33.990> but

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
third link actually not the screw but

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.610 
third link actually not the screw but
the<00:05:34.289> nut<00:05:34.590> actually<00:05:35.340> impacts<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.960> motor<00:05:37.200> with

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
the nut actually impacts the motor with

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.370 
the nut actually impacts the motor with
the<00:05:37.770> stock<00:05:38.099> gearing<00:05:38.690> so<00:05:39.690> if<00:05:39.750> you<00:05:39.870> want<00:05:40.050> that<00:05:40.229> to

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
the stock gearing so if you want that to

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.440 
the stock gearing so if you want that to
not<00:05:40.710> happen<00:05:41.370> there<00:05:41.669> aren't<00:05:41.789> any<00:05:41.940> additional

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
not happen there aren't any additional

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.170 
not happen there aren't any additional
holes<00:05:43.310> into<00:05:44.310> which<00:05:44.460> to<00:05:44.760> move<00:05:44.970> the

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
holes into which to move the

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.670 
holes into which to move the
transmission<00:05:45.870> to<00:05:45.960> slide<00:05:46.200> it<00:05:46.349> forward<00:05:46.470> or

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
transmission to slide it forward or

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.950 
transmission to slide it forward or
backward<00:05:47.130> what<00:05:47.940> you<00:05:48.090> pretty<00:05:48.360> much<00:05:48.450> need<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.810> do

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
backward what you pretty much need to do

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.100 
backward what you pretty much need to do
is<00:05:49.229> change<00:05:49.979> your<00:05:50.099> gearing<00:05:50.789> so<00:05:51.180> first<00:05:51.630> change

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
is change your gearing so first change

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.660 
is change your gearing so first change
the<00:05:52.169> spur<00:05:52.789> and<00:05:53.789> then

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
the spur and then

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.260 
the spur and then
the<00:05:54.900> opinion<00:05:55.900> in<00:05:56.530> order<00:05:56.890> to<00:05:57.040> move<00:05:57.340> that<00:05:57.580> that

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
the opinion in order to move that that

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.010 
the opinion in order to move that that
motor<00:05:58.960> in<00:05:59.230> inboard<00:06:00.420> at<00:06:01.420> least<00:06:01.690> a<00:06:01.840> couple

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
motor in inboard at least a couple

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.590 
motor in inboard at least a couple
millimeters<00:06:02.430> it's<00:06:03.430> actually<00:06:03.880> it's<00:06:04.300> actually

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
millimeters it's actually it's actually

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.940 
millimeters it's actually it's actually
pushing<00:06:04.810> against<00:06:05.230> the<00:06:05.290> motor<00:06:05.530> slave<00:06:05.830> you

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
pushing against the motor slave you

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.670 
pushing against the motor slave you
there<00:06:06.100> it's<00:06:06.250> not<00:06:06.400> it's<00:06:06.820> not<00:06:06.970> really<00:06:07.330> bad<00:06:07.540> but<00:06:07.810> I

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
there it's not it's not really bad but I

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.790 
there it's not it's not really bad but I
don't<00:06:09.190> want<00:06:09.610> that<00:06:09.790> to<00:06:09.940> be<00:06:10.030> happening<00:06:10.210> at<00:06:10.480> all

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
don't want that to be happening at all

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.190 
don't want that to be happening at all
so<00:06:11.800> I<00:06:11.830> will<00:06:12.240> eventually<00:06:13.240> need<00:06:13.600> to<00:06:13.660> change<00:06:13.990> out

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
so I will eventually need to change out

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.960 
so I will eventually need to change out
that<00:06:14.230> spur<00:06:15.130> for<00:06:15.520> a<00:06:16.380> different<00:06:17.380> unit<00:06:17.970> that

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
that spur for a different unit that
