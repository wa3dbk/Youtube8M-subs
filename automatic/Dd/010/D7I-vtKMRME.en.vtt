00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
right now but you get the idea you can

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.670 
right now but you get the idea you can
take<00:04:09.910> that<00:04:10.060> off<00:04:10.300> change<00:04:11.020> view<00:04:11.230> buttons<00:04:11.500> work

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
take that off change view buttons work

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.090 
take that off change view buttons work
just<00:04:11.860> like<00:04:12.010> they<00:04:12.190> should<00:04:13.590> brake<00:04:14.590> works<00:04:14.860> just

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
just like they should brake works just

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.159 
just like they should brake works just
as<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.400> should<00:04:15.430> we<00:04:16.239> can<00:04:16.359> keep<00:04:16.540> changing<00:04:16.780> view

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
as it should we can keep changing view

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.690 
as it should we can keep changing view
and<00:04:17.380> we<00:04:17.470> could<00:04:17.620> really<00:04:17.890> crank<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.280> volume<00:04:18.310> and

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
and we could really crank the volume and

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.960 
and we could really crank the volume and
go<00:04:18.760> crazy<00:04:19.030> with<00:04:19.329> this<00:04:19.480> -<00:04:20.640> I'm<00:04:21.640> trying<00:04:21.700> to

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
go crazy with this - I'm trying to

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.000 
go crazy with this - I'm trying to
attempt<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.300> teach<00:04:23.169> myself<00:04:23.350> how<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.680> drive

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
attempt to teach myself how to drive

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.880 
attempt to teach myself how to drive
again<00:04:24.340> here<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.990> all<00:04:26.140> these<00:04:26.290> different<00:04:26.650> views

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
again here so all these different views

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.560 
again here so all these different views
and<00:04:27.130> of<00:04:27.370> course<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.669> shifters<00:04:28.000> work<00:04:28.210> as<00:04:28.390> well

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
and of course the shifters work as well

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.850 
and of course the shifters work as well
let<00:04:28.780> me<00:04:28.840> show<00:04:29.020> you<00:04:29.110> how<00:04:29.200> that<00:04:29.260> works<00:04:29.530> on<00:04:29.770> the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
let me show you how that works on the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.920 
let me show you how that works on the
other<00:04:30.010> side<00:04:33.030> take<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.090> quick<00:04:34.360> look<00:04:34.600> we've<00:04:34.780> got

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
other side take a quick look we've got

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.970 
other side take a quick look we've got
outrun<00:04:35.560> -<00:04:35.830> all<00:04:35.980> fired<00:04:36.310> up<00:04:40.320> we<00:04:41.320> got<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.500> shifter

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
outrun - all fired up we got a shifter

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.420 
outrun - all fired up we got a shifter
set<00:04:42.280> going<00:04:42.940> to<00:04:43.000> tell<00:04:43.180> us<00:04:43.240> when<00:04:43.390> to<00:04:43.419> ship

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.879 

simple<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.240> that<00:04:47.449> just<00:04:48.020> slap<00:04:48.410> it<00:04:48.440> for<00:04:48.800> your

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
simple of that just slap it for your

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.230 
simple of that just slap it for your
upshift<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.430> take<00:04:49.729> it<00:04:49.850> down<00:04:50.000> for<00:04:50.180> your

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
upshift and take it down for your

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.980 
upshift and take it down for your
downshifting<00:04:51.550> makes<00:04:52.550> it<00:04:52.669> really<00:04:53.000> fun<00:04:53.419> to<00:04:53.630> do

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
downshifting makes it really fun to do

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.260 
downshifting makes it really fun to do
it<00:04:54.080> with<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.259> gears<00:04:54.820> and<00:04:55.820> this<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.060> a<00:04:56.090> game

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
it with the gears and this is a game

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.960 
it with the gears and this is a game
that<00:04:56.300> wants<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:57.259> to<00:04:57.380> really<00:04:58.250> get<00:04:58.820> the

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
coasting arcade style in there they

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.050 
coasting arcade style in there they
don't<00:05:00.979> even<00:05:01.070> worry<00:05:01.310> about<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.550> physics<00:05:01.970> they

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
don't even worry about the physics they

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.310
