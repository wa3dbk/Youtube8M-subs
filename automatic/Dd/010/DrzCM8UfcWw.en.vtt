time since war tunes done amount we're
finding<00:00:03.780> events<00:00:04.140> and<00:00:04.290> it's<00:00:04.410> been<00:00:04.560> an<00:00:04.680> even

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
finding events and it's been an even

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.710 
finding events and it's been an even
longer<00:00:05.069> time<00:00:05.279> since<00:00:05.700> I've<00:00:05.819> did<00:00:06.000> have<00:00:06.120> done<00:00:06.690> a

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
longer time since I've did have done a

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.960 
longer time since I've did have done a
video<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.290> me<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:08.130> know<00:00:08.250> doing<00:00:08.400> anything<00:00:08.700> for

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
video of me you know doing anything for

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.310 
video of me you know doing anything for
my<00:00:09.150> mountains<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.599> figured<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.080> would<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.200> a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
my mountains so I figured it would be a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.959 
my mountains so I figured it would be a
good<00:00:10.469> opportunity<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:11.190> sift<00:00:11.639> through<00:00:11.700> my

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
good opportunity to sift through my

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.140 
good opportunity to sift through my
mouth<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:13.469> 15<00:00:14.160> months<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.759> don't<00:00:14.969> have

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
mouth I have 15 months that don't have

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.620 
mouth I have 15 months that don't have
any<00:00:15.179> stars<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.870> them<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:17.210> we<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.330> an<00:00:18.420> event

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
any stars on them and we have an event

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.599 
any stars on them and we have an event
it's<00:00:19.199> not<00:00:19.470> very<00:00:19.619> good<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.130> know<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.460> just

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
it's not very good you know it's just

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.849 
it's not very good you know it's just
refine<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.300> get<00:00:21.449> some<00:00:21.689> materials<00:00:22.140> back<00:00:22.590> I

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
refine and get some materials back I

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.590 
refine and get some materials back I
don't<00:00:23.189> even<00:00:23.279> really<00:00:23.550> care<00:00:23.670> about<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.210> daily

don't even really care about this daily
one<00:00:24.810> because<00:00:25.140> there's<00:00:25.320> no<00:00:26.330> no<00:00:27.330> event<00:00:27.630> Chester

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050

or anything like that and then the other

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440 
or anything like that and then the other
one<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.710> refined<00:00:32.219> three<00:00:32.489> times<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:33.270> one

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
one is just refined three times get one

back so a thirty-three percent return
and<00:00:35.899> and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> couple<00:00:37.530> sacks<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.070> gold<00:00:38.899> for

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
filled out okay so maybe i'll just for

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.039 
filled out okay so maybe i'll just for
the<00:03:26.769> sake<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.130> round<00:03:27.370> number<00:03:27.750> I'll<00:03:28.750> get

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
the sake of a round number I'll get

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.809 
the sake of a round number I'll get
these<00:03:29.230> two<00:03:29.530> five<00:03:29.769> stars<00:03:30.129> and<00:03:30.519> just<00:03:30.670> leave

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
these two five stars and just leave

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.500 
these two five stars and just leave
myself<00:03:31.650> ten<00:03:32.650> mounts<00:03:33.099> that<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:34.000> have<00:03:34.209> or

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
myself ten mounts that that have or

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.920 
myself ten mounts that that have or
basically<00:03:35.019> 10<00:03:35.319> stars<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:35.980> can<00:03:36.190> work<00:03:36.400> on

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
basically 10 stars that I can work on

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.509 
basically 10 stars that I can work on
should<00:03:37.930> there<00:03:38.110> be<00:03:38.440> an<00:03:38.560> event<00:03:38.860> you<00:03:39.400> know<00:03:39.489> I

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
should there be an event you know I

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.490 
should there be an event you know I
think<00:03:39.670> if<00:03:41.069> if<00:03:42.090> there<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.239> good<00:03:43.569> mount<00:03:44.230> aloof

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
think if if there is a good mount aloof

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.800 
think if if there is a good mount aloof
event<00:03:44.829> and<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.519> know<00:03:45.640> they<00:03:45.760> give<00:03:45.940> currencies

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
event and you know they give currencies

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.020 
event and you know they give currencies
or<00:03:46.840> whatever<00:03:47.260> it's<00:03:47.829> going<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.250> be<00:03:48.340> limited<00:03:48.549> and

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
or whatever it's going to be limited and

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.500 
or whatever it's going to be limited and
and<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.980> there<00:03:51.310> won't<00:03:51.430> be<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:52.209> know<00:03:52.329> the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
and so there won't be you know the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.270 
and so there won't be you know the
unlimited<00:03:52.840> part<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.620> event<00:03:53.859> will

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
unlimited part of the event will

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.550 
unlimited part of the event will
probably<00:03:54.670> not<00:03:54.819> be<00:03:54.880> nearly<00:03:55.510> as<00:03:55.690> interesting<00:03:56.079> as

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
probably not be nearly as interesting as

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.729 
probably not be nearly as interesting as
the<00:03:56.609> limited<00:03:57.609> part<00:03:57.880> so<00:03:58.630> I'm<00:03:59.380> just<00:03:59.530> going<00:03:59.680> to

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
the limited part so I'm just going to

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.500 
the limited part so I'm just going to
leave<00:03:59.889> myself<00:04:00.069> a<00:04:00.430> few<00:04:00.579> stars<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:01.060> work<00:04:01.239> with

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
leave myself a few stars to work with

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.710 
leave myself a few stars to work with
but<00:04:01.780> otherwise<00:04:02.049> I'd<00:04:02.889> like<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.340> VR<00:04:03.639> plus<00:04:04.180> you

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
but otherwise I'd like the VR plus you

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.750 
but otherwise I'd like the VR plus you
know<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.870> haven't<00:04:05.230> seen<00:04:05.440> this<00:04:05.560> these<00:04:06.130> amounts<00:04:06.400> I

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
mean these events such a long time that

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.349 
mean these events such a long time that
I<00:04:11.470> feel<00:04:11.709> like<00:04:11.829> or<00:04:12.579> two<00:04:12.730> might<00:04:12.910> be<00:04:12.940> stingy

attack<00:05:38.840> and<00:05:39.710> then<00:05:39.889> really<00:05:40.340> happy<00:05:40.669> about<00:05:40.819> the

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
attack and then really happy about the

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.140

the<00:05:41.449> defense's<00:05:42.139> I've<00:05:43.099> been<00:05:43.400> really<00:05:43.669> feeling

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
the defense's I've been really feeling

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.119 
the defense's I've been really feeling
like<00:05:44.180> my<00:05:44.449> physical<00:05:44.960> defense<00:05:45.289> is<00:05:45.440> too<00:05:45.620> low<00:05:45.860> and

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
like my physical defense is too low and

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.909 
like my physical defense is too low and
that<00:05:46.580> my<00:05:46.699> m<00:05:46.849> def<00:05:47.120> could<00:05:47.930> always<00:05:48.229> use<00:05:48.440> help<00:05:48.469> and

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
that my m def could always use help and

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.939 
that my m def could always use help and
then<00:05:49.669> a<00:05:49.699> little<00:05:49.969> bit<00:05:50.060> HP<00:05:50.330> and<00:05:51.050> what<00:05:51.409> does<00:05:51.560> HP

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
then a little bit HP and what does HP

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.369 
then a little bit HP and what does HP
does<00:05:52.190> is<00:05:52.400> maybe<00:05:52.669> I<00:05:52.789> can<00:05:53.150> switch<00:05:53.509> one<00:05:53.810> more<00:05:53.840> of

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:54.379 
does is maybe I can switch one more of

00:05:54.379 --> 00:06:01.329
