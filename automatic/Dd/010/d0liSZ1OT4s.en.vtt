know<00:00:27.790> in<00:00:27.940> the<00:00:28.030> water<00:00:28.240> so<00:00:28.660> you<00:00:28.990> can<00:00:29.170> feel<00:00:29.800> the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.750 
boat what I love to do in my free time
which<00:00:34.989> is<00:00:35.110> not<00:00:35.290> very<00:00:35.500> often<00:00:35.680> it's<00:00:36.430> really

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
which is not very often it's really

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.240 
which is not very often it's really
biting<00:00:39.960> pretty<00:00:40.960> much<00:00:41.110> as<00:00:41.290> my<00:00:41.440> vacation<00:00:42.129> the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
biting pretty much as my vacation the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.070 
biting pretty much as my vacation the
end<00:00:42.370> of<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.550> year<00:00:42.760> that<00:00:43.239> I<00:00:43.270> have<00:00:43.540> really<00:00:43.809> two

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
end of the year that I have really two

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.619 
end of the year that I have really two
or<00:00:44.200> three<00:00:44.440> weeks<00:00:44.650> off<00:00:44.950> there's<00:00:45.910> really<00:00:46.150> for

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
or three weeks off there's really for

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.049 
or three weeks off there's really for
myself<00:00:47.020> but<00:00:47.350> otherwise<00:00:47.650> is<00:00:48.100> pretty<00:00:48.280> busy<00:00:51.059> well

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
myself but otherwise is pretty busy well

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.600 
myself but otherwise is pretty busy well
I<00:00:52.089> think<00:00:52.300> it's<00:00:52.570> hard<00:00:52.809> to<00:00:52.870> do<00:00:53.220> Miniver<00:00:54.220> season

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
I think it's hard to do Miniver season

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.380 
I think it's hard to do Miniver season
we<00:00:55.110> playing<00:00:56.110> so<00:00:56.409> many<00:00:56.589> tournaments<00:00:57.030> from<00:00:58.030> like

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
we playing so many tournaments from like

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.799 
we playing so many tournaments from like
ten<00:00:58.690> months<00:00:59.080> and<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.879> know<00:01:01.000> you<00:01:01.300> finish<00:01:01.570> one

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
ten months and you know you finish one

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.860 
ten months and you know you finish one
then<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.350> next<00:01:02.650> week<00:01:03.129> is<00:01:03.309> another<00:01:03.610> one<00:01:03.909> so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
then the next week is another one so

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.660 
then the next week is another one so
it's<00:01:05.560> just<00:01:05.710> hard<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.159> just<00:01:06.340> forget<00:01:06.640> about

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
it's just hard to just forget about

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.730 
it's just hard to just forget about
tennis<00:01:07.180> in<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.570> middle<00:01:07.840> of<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.110> season

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.249 

you<00:01:12.250> can<00:01:12.400> really<00:01:12.670> feel<00:01:12.939> like<00:01:12.970> every<00:01:13.450> year<00:01:13.630> you

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
you can really feel like every year you

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.460 
you can really feel like every year you
need<00:01:14.590> more<00:01:15.009> rest<00:01:15.189> than<00:01:15.430> before<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.149> I<00:01:16.840> stopped

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
need more rest than before and I stopped

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.670 
need more rest than before and I stopped
playing<00:01:17.590> doubles<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.189> guess<00:01:18.369> three<00:01:18.640> years<00:01:18.909> ago

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
playing doubles I guess three years ago

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.929 
playing doubles I guess three years ago
of<00:01:20.680> course<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.100> know<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.250> couple<00:01:21.580> of<00:01:21.700> injuries

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
of course you know a couple of injuries

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.359 
of course you know a couple of injuries
on<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.240> way<00:01:22.390> also<00:01:23.290> stopped<00:01:23.560> me<00:01:23.680> from<00:01:24.040> playing

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
on the way also stopped me from playing

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.999 
on the way also stopped me from playing
doubles<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:25.119> those<00:01:26.080> one<00:01:26.439> and<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.680> half<00:01:26.829> hour

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
doubles and those one and a half hour

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.219 
doubles and those one and a half hour
which<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.670> spent<00:01:27.939> playing<00:01:28.630> doubles

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
which I spent playing doubles

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.880 
which I spent playing doubles
I'm<00:01:29.590> putting<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.159> physio<00:01:30.909> room<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.409> I<00:01:32.679> think

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
I'm putting the physio room and I think

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.830 
I'm putting the physio room and I think
this<00:01:33.009> is<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.159> surprise<00:01:33.970> as<00:01:34.090> I<00:01:34.149> have<00:01:34.299> to<00:01:34.479> you<00:01:34.689> know

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
this is a surprise as I have to you know

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.380 
this is a surprise as I have to you know
make<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:36.100> know<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.280> really<00:01:36.909> focus<00:01:37.060> on<00:01:37.299> the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
make you know to really focus on the

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.850 
make you know to really focus on the
singles<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:40.500> don't<00:01:41.500> like<00:01:41.619> cars

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.460 

um<00:01:46.030> maybe<00:01:47.030> I'm<00:01:47.180> not<00:01:47.330> spitting<00:01:47.600> then<00:01:47.900> much<00:01:48.140> of

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
um maybe I'm not spitting then much of

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.290 
um maybe I'm not spitting then much of
course<00:01:49.010> everything<00:01:49.610> goes<00:01:49.850> with<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.060> rules

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
course everything goes with the rules

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.320 
course everything goes with the rules
but<00:01:50.720> I<00:01:51.710> think<00:01:52.310> it's<00:01:52.460> much<00:01:52.700> easier<00:01:53.150> when<00:01:53.270> you

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
but I think it's much easier when you

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.930 
but I think it's much easier when you
have<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.630> good<00:01:53.840> car<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.350> just<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:54.770> know

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
have a good car and you just you know

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.730 
have a good car and you just you know
touch<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.300> then<00:01:56.479> you<00:01:56.570> just<00:01:56.780> go<00:01:56.990> not<00:01:57.290> like<00:01:57.500> you

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
touch and then you just go not like you

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.560 
touch and then you just go not like you
know<00:01:57.860> pushing<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:58.640> much<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.240> then<00:01:59.420> you're

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
know pushing so much and then you're

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
know pushing so much and then you're
just<00:01:59.810> slowly<00:02:00.850> driving<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.330> yeah

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.990 

without<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.420> car<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:06.960> without<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.320> hand

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
without the car is like without the hand

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.900 
without the car is like without the hand
