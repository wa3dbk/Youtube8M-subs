course<00:02:10.280> once<00:02:10.760> you've<00:02:10.880> changed<00:02:11.180> one<00:02:11.360> chord<00:02:11.630> you

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
course once you've changed one chord you

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.240 
course once you've changed one chord you
need<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.110> change<00:02:12.260> all<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.590> rest<00:02:12.770> of<00:02:12.920> them<00:02:12.980> and

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
need to change all the rest of them and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.700 
need to change all the rest of them and
this<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:14.000> where<00:02:14.120> my<00:02:14.330> handy<00:02:14.750> diagram<00:02:15.260> comes<00:02:15.530> in

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
this is where my handy diagram comes in

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.280 
this is where my handy diagram comes in
this<00:02:18.710> here<00:02:19.040> is<00:02:19.300> all<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.360> notes<00:02:21.430> ever<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:23.290> so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
this here is all the notes ever and so

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.590 
this here is all the notes ever and so

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
you start from the sea didn't see you go

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.979 
you start from the sea didn't see you go

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
one two three four yeah that's four I

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.600 
one two three four yeah that's four I
can't<00:02:51.080> point<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.590> look<00:02:51.980> at<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.220> camera<00:02:52.520> at

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
can't point and look at the camera at

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.190 
can't point and look at the camera at
the<00:02:52.640> same<00:02:52.820> time<00:02:53.030> there<00:02:53.750> will<00:02:53.840> be<00:02:53.959> four

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
the same time there will be four

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.340 
the same time there will be four
movements<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.760> for<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.660> next<00:02:56.690> chord<00:02:57.200> in<00:02:57.320> the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
movements so for the next chord in the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.370 
movements so for the next chord in the
chord<00:02:57.709> sequence<00:02:58.190> which<00:02:58.370> is

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.940

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
which is a scene to get into the new key

that's<00:03:51.689> how<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.840> goes<00:03:52.079> of<00:03:52.859> course<00:03:53.099> this<00:03:53.280> works

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
that's how it goes of course this works

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.819 
that's how it goes of course this works
for<00:03:53.790> moving<00:03:54.150> songs<00:03:54.450> down<00:03:54.870> as<00:03:55.170> well<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:55.590> could

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
for moving songs down as well I could

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.500 
for moving songs down as well I could
probably<00:03:56.069> explain<00:03:56.249> why<00:03:56.819> I've<00:03:56.969> colored<00:03:57.359> this

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
probably explain why I've colored this

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.449 
probably explain why I've colored this
in<00:03:57.659> different<00:03:57.989> colors<00:03:58.290> by<00:03:58.469> the<00:03:58.530> way<00:03:58.739> basically

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
in different colors by the way basically

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.599 
in different colors by the way basically
this<00:03:59.790> is<00:03:59.849> for<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.299> sake<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:00.540> guitarists<00:04:01.319> and

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
this is for the sake of guitarists and

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.069 
this is for the sake of guitarists and
for<00:04:02.609> all<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.790> major<00:04:02.939> chords<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.659> red<00:04:03.810> ones

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
for all the major chords the red ones

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.629 
for all the major chords the red ones
are<00:04:04.200> hard<00:04:04.409> to<00:04:04.560> play<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.099> blue<00:04:05.280> ones<00:04:05.519> are

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
are hard to play and the blue ones are

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.170 
are hard to play and the blue ones are
fairly<00:04:05.909> easy<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:07.260> f-sharp<00:04:07.590> one<00:04:08.219> is<00:04:08.489> debatable

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
fairly easy the f-sharp one is debatable

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.819 
fairly easy the f-sharp one is debatable
it's<00:04:09.599> a<00:04:09.719> bar<00:04:09.930> chord<00:04:10.230> but<00:04:10.409> is<00:04:10.530> actually<00:04:10.620> a

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
it's a bar chord but is actually a

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.629 
it's a bar chord but is actually a
fairly<00:04:11.010> easy<00:04:11.189> bar<00:04:11.579> chord<00:04:11.849> so<00:04:13.099> yeah<00:04:14.099> that<00:04:14.519> one

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
fairly easy bar chord so yeah that one

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.029 
fairly easy bar chord so yeah that one
should<00:04:15.000> probably<00:04:15.389> be<00:04:15.540> purple<00:04:15.930> but<00:04:16.650> it's<00:04:16.799> red

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
should probably be purple but it's red

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.080 
should probably be purple but it's red
so<00:04:17.940> if<00:04:18.299> you're<00:04:18.479> struggling<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.930> play<00:04:19.199> a<00:04:19.229> song

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
so if you're struggling to play a song

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.150 
so if you're struggling to play a song
then<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.359> suggest<00:04:21.479> getting<00:04:22.139> a<00:04:22.349> capital<00:04:22.800> out<00:04:22.949> and

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
then I suggest getting a capital out and

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.969 
then I suggest getting a capital out and
following<00:04:23.699> these<00:04:23.940> managers<00:04:24.500> so<00:04:25.500> let's<00:04:25.710> say

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
following these managers so let's say

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.589 
following these managers so let's say
that<00:04:26.370> there<00:04:26.550> was<00:04:26.669> a<00:04:26.699> song<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.150> wanted<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.449> play

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
that there was a song you wanted to play

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.839 
that there was a song you wanted to play
but<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.139> cause<00:04:28.320> were<00:04:28.500> too<00:04:28.680> hard<00:04:29.009> let's<00:04:29.520> say<00:04:29.759> it

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
but the cause were too hard let's say it

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:41.540 
but the cause were too hard let's say it
was<00:04:29.970> in<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.210> key<00:04:30.419> of<00:04:30.630> E<00:04:31.310> flat

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.800 

that's<00:04:42.550> how<00:04:42.699> the<00:04:42.759> song<00:04:42.969> goes<00:04:43.030> it's<00:04:43.449> all<00:04:43.599> bar

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
that's how the song goes it's all bar

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.980 
that's how the song goes it's all bar
chords<00:04:44.199> and<00:04:44.409> it's<00:04:44.530> ridiculously<00:04:45.159> hard

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
chords and it's ridiculously hard

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.790 
chords and it's ridiculously hard
however<00:04:46.990> if<00:04:47.379> we<00:04:48.129> make<00:04:48.340> a<00:04:48.370> few<00:04:48.789> changes<00:04:48.819> to<00:04:49.800> do

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
however if we make a few changes to do

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.200 
however if we make a few changes to do
with<00:04:51.759> our<00:04:51.909> wheel<00:04:53.430> we<00:04:54.430> can<00:04:54.580> try<00:04:54.789> and<00:04:54.879> get<00:04:54.999> into<00:04:55.120> a

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
with our wheel we can try and get into a

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.760 
with our wheel we can try and get into a
key<00:04:55.539> where<00:04:56.020> it's<00:04:56.169> going<00:04:56.349> to<00:04:56.439> be<00:04:56.529> a<00:04:56.560> little

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
key where it's going to be a little

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.700 
key where it's going to be a little
easier<00:04:57.009> now<00:04:57.520> I<00:04:58.419> already<00:04:58.900> know<00:04:59.110> down<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.499> hair

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
easier now I already know down the hair

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.059 
easier now I already know down the hair
but<00:05:00.449> if<00:05:01.449> we<00:05:01.629> take<00:05:01.810> an<00:05:01.990> E<00:05:02.199> flat<00:05:02.469> and<00:05:02.830> move<00:05:02.949> it

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
but if we take an E flat and move it

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.369 
but if we take an E flat and move it
down<00:05:03.099> one<00:05:04.020> up<00:05:05.020> it<00:05:05.229> goes<00:05:05.349> to<00:05:05.590> a<00:05:05.650> D<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:07.199> these<00:05:08.199> are

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
down one up it goes to a D and these are

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.779 
down one up it goes to a D and these are
values<00:05:08.680> go<00:05:08.979> to<00:05:09.039> play<00:05:10.919> but<00:05:11.919> now<00:05:12.039> problem<00:05:12.460> is<00:05:12.550> in

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
values go to play but now problem is in

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:18.570 
values go to play but now problem is in
different<00:05:13.029> key<00:05:16.469> which<00:05:17.469> is<00:05:17.680> it<00:05:17.919> an<00:05:18.009> easy<00:05:18.219> one<00:05:18.460> to

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
different key which is it an easy one to

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.490 
different key which is it an easy one to
play<00:05:18.819> but<00:05:19.150> it's<00:05:19.270> in<00:05:19.389> a<00:05:19.449> different<00:05:19.569> key<00:05:19.930> so<00:05:20.379> what

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
play but it's in a different key so what

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.550 
play but it's in a different key so what
are<00:05:20.560> you<00:05:20.650> going<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:20.830> do<00:05:21.509> well<00:05:22.509> if<00:05:23.139> we<00:05:23.319> stick<00:05:23.529> a

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
are you going to do well if we stick a

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.300 
are you going to do well if we stick a
capo<00:05:24.069> on<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.729> first<00:05:25.000> fret<00:05:27.150> it's<00:05:28.150> essentially

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
capo on the first fret it's essentially

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.119 
capo on the first fret it's essentially
going<00:05:30.310> down<00:05:30.669> to<00:05:31.029> the<00:05:31.060> day<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.919> then<00:05:32.919> hop<00:05:33.099> it

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
going down to the day and then hop it

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:39.770 
going down to the day and then hop it
back<00:05:33.279> up<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:34.449> the<00:05:34.479> flat

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.490 

which<00:05:40.780> is<00:05:40.930> that<00:05:41.110> same<00:05:41.380> as<00:05:41.470> it<00:05:41.590> was<00:05:43.080> up<00:05:44.080> there

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
which is that same as it was up there

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.550 
which is that same as it was up there
the<00:05:45.340> flats<00:05:45.790> come<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.390> day<00:05:46.690> but<00:05:47.110> we<00:05:47.260> put<00:05:47.470> the

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
the flats come to a day but we put the

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.530 
the flats come to a day but we put the
cap<00:05:47.770> back<00:05:47.800> on<00:05:48.220> it<00:05:48.370> to<00:05:48.520> make<00:05:48.640> it<00:05:48.700> go<00:05:48.910> up<00:05:48.940> to<00:05:49.150> Aniak

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
cap back on it to make it go up to Aniak

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.410 
cap back on it to make it go up to Aniak
flat<00:05:49.870> again<00:05:50.200> so<00:05:51.070> the<00:05:51.190> B<00:05:51.550> flat<00:05:51.760> will<00:05:52.060> now<00:05:52.240> become

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
flat again so the B flat will now become

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.860 
flat again so the B flat will now become
an<00:05:52.780> a<00:05:53.670> but<00:05:54.670> because<00:05:54.940> we<00:05:55.060> got<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.270> cap<00:05:55.600> on<00:05:55.750> the

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
an a but because we got the cap on the

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.020 
an a but because we got the cap on the
first<00:05:56.110> fret<00:05:56.410> it'd<00:05:56.650> still<00:05:57.010> be<00:05:57.070> flat<00:05:57.700> being

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
first fret it'd still be flat being

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.720 
first fret it'd still be flat being
heard<00:05:58.410> C<00:05:59.410> minor<00:05:59.770> which<00:06:00.340> is<00:06:00.460> what<00:06:00.580> we're

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
heard C minor which is what we're

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.550 
heard C minor which is what we're
playing<00:06:00.910> before<00:06:01.440> goes<00:06:02.440> down<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.920> a<00:06:02.980> b-minor

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
playing before goes down to a b-minor

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.350 
playing before goes down to a b-minor
again<00:06:05.560> because<00:06:05.890> the<00:06:05.980> capital<00:06:06.370> is<00:06:06.400> on<00:06:06.580> it<00:06:06.730> it

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
again because the capital is on it it

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.330 
again because the capital is on it it
still<00:06:07.750> see<00:06:08.020> a<00:06:08.050> minor<00:06:08.320> is<00:06:08.530> her<00:06:08.680> down<00:06:08.920> to<00:06:09.070> the<00:06:09.100> top

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
still see a minor is her down to the top

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.420 
still see a minor is her down to the top
G<00:06:09.970> sharp<00:06:11.910> goes<00:06:12.910> down<00:06:13.150> to<00:06:13.300> G<00:06:14.010> because<00:06:15.010> Cowboys

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
G sharp goes down to G because Cowboys

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.550 
G sharp goes down to G because Cowboys
on<00:06:15.580> it<00:06:15.700> it's<00:06:16.330> still<00:06:16.540> a<00:06:16.600> G<00:06:16.810> sharp<00:06:17.080> that's<00:06:17.350> heard

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
on it it's still a G sharp that's heard

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.920 
on it it's still a G sharp that's heard
so<00:06:18.310> I<00:06:18.340> hope<00:06:18.640> that<00:06:18.700> your<00:06:19.060> brains<00:06:19.330> have<00:06:19.540> exploded

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
so I hope that your brains have exploded

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.260 
so I hope that your brains have exploded
from<00:06:20.230> that<00:06:20.440> overload<00:06:20.950> of<00:06:21.130> information<00:06:21.220> in<00:06:21.970> a

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
from that overload of information in a

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.270 
from that overload of information in a
short<00:06:22.300> amount<00:06:22.660> of<00:06:22.930> time<00:06:22.990> and<00:06:23.530> I<00:06:24.040> hope<00:06:24.220> that

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
short amount of time and I hope that

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.220 
short amount of time and I hope that
you're<00:06:24.610> not<00:06:24.670> even<00:06:25.270> more<00:06:25.450> confused<00:06:25.900> than<00:06:26.020> you

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:26.230 
you're not even more confused than you

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.290 
you're not even more confused than you
were<00:06:26.410> when<00:06:26.620> we<00:06:26.680> started<00:06:26.830> all<00:06:27.460> being<00:06:27.820> well<00:06:27.910> I
