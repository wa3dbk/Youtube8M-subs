00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.330
 Now I'll show you how I made the 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.940
 button configuration on the side of the 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.620
 my feeling that I use more than anything in the 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.240
 world almost no use of the keyboard I use 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.800
 even these buttons do not know that I have to 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.450
 do something different for 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.910
 remember 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:30.079
 I'm using those buttons here then 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:32.180
 first is that the pen setting 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.070
 By the time you click it, it shows. 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.040
 good that he shows you that's what 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.440
 It's very easy, there's no secret. 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.140
 the only thing that happens at times that 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.910
 I was a little confused that she at 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.170
 times it does not work on a monitor that 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.160
 I want to 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.760
 he kisses the fifth liberation 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.650
 and then he talks about which monitor the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.420
 pen will be working just like you 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.370
 can see the wrong 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.760
 I do not know why he keeps running alone. 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.770
 every hour of anger but it happens then 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.470
 I come here and I do not want to stay here 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.770
 It works here spring around here working 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:17.150
 normal 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:21.110
 So we come back here then the 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:26.390
 pen has two buttons that I also use 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.240
 from below it is that little hand is 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.540
 for you to move the image for example if 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.450
 you zoom in and you want to move the 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.610
 image is that button here that calls 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.330
 colts legs 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.140
 I say little hand because it's a little hand and 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:50.090
 one from the top which is the right click that 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.909
 me-term option sorry everyone thinks 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.290
 that I have in my bookstore bible there 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.270
 that has is on the ascension not 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.189
 do not do any of this because I do not know 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:08.569
 and to me it's good the way it is and the 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:13.129
 the top of the pen is a 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.950
 I do not use rubber that is not productive 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:19.099
 to turn a pen upside down 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.040
 all the time just because I even did that 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.950
 quite rubbery so I prefer that the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.170
 rubber small tablet buttons 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.890
 money that that ball that stays 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.879
 in the middle of the left side or 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.989
 right 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.920
 that's another thing I know is he 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.870
 talk you can put it or not to your 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.150
 left or right and dependent 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.019
 you're staying in another not because the 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.730
 cable 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.480
 in my case that is right for me 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.519
 would have stumped if he left 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.930
 As I'm going to push the buttons, right? 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:58.790
 here I have the oxy in which I think it is the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.890
 altino windows on the right is to increase 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.959
 potential on the left to decrease in 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.170
 sky 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.549
 the destination is to zoom low to 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.390
 decreased 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:15.410
 whatever the tool the key 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.030
 I do not know the vest on the shortcut word failure 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:23.180
 whatever shortcut you use the most 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.100
 You can set it here to be 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.269
 make it easy for you to use the attack 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.480
 This is the way I like it and has the 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.200
 others 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.280
 here these two from above these two from 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.920
 low 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.630
 This one from the top I did not use I could use 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.630
 for something else you have to think 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.660
 This is waste of time, it's one thing. 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.920
 remaining 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:54.680
 This one down below is me I use a lot 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.450
 make a dash I do not like click 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.700
 here parents 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:04.489
 This one is bosh too because I'm 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.329
 click on this second that all the time I 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.730
 I'm switching between a brush 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:14.530
 rubber eraser brush lying 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.530
 quite these lusa
