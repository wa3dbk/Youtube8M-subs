00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.270 
I thought about it I was like I'd rather
win<00:00:47.630> it<00:00:47.780> instead<00:00:48.320> of<00:00:48.350> it<00:00:48.560> being<00:00:48.590> handed<00:00:49.130> to<00:00:49.220> us

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
win it instead of it being handed to us

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
accomplished and the finals is what my

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.170 
accomplished and the finals is what my
main<00:01:18.170> focus<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:18.710> on<00:01:19.010> getting<00:01:19.040> back<00:01:19.520> there<00:01:19.729> you

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
main focus is on getting back there you

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.560 
main focus is on getting back there you
know<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:20.330> think<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:20.900> does<00:01:21.049> more<00:01:21.260> for<00:01:21.320> our

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
know I think it does more for our

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
know I think it does more for our
character<00:01:23.570> than<00:01:23.810> anything<00:01:24.170> else<00:01:24.380> because

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
character than anything else because

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.039 
character than anything else because
going<00:01:24.920> 1-nil<00:01:25.340> down<00:01:25.400> of<00:01:25.820> course<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.299> then<00:01:26.450> and

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
going 1-nil down of course and then and

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.420 
going 1-nil down of course and then and
then<00:01:27.170> bringing<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:27.530> back<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:27.979> know<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.190> shows

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
then bringing it back you know it shows

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.310 
then bringing it back you know it shows
that<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.729> team<00:01:28.940> has<00:01:29.150> got<00:01:29.360> character<00:01:29.690> so<00:01:30.110> we

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
that the team has got character so we

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.679 
that the team has got character so we
need<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.159> be<00:01:31.640> ready<00:01:31.820> for<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:32.210> next<00:01:32.270> game
