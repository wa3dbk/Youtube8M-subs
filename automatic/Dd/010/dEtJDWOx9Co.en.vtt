00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
insane if we get a docs in this video I

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.440 
insane if we get a docs in this video I
really<00:01:38.369> would<00:01:38.490> appreciate<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.299> these

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
really would appreciate that but these

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.060 
really would appreciate that but these
supply<00:01:39.750> drops<00:01:40.020> are<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.439> best<00:01:40.619> all<00:01:40.979> right

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
supply drops are not the best all right

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.620 
supply drops are not the best all right
they're<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.579> best<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.030> they're<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
they're not the best but they're not the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.179 
they're not the best but they're not the
worst<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> couple<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.070> good

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
worst I do get a couple of really good

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.950 
worst I do get a couple of really good
weapons<00:01:44.759> out<00:01:44.880> there<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
weapons out there I think that I get a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.660 
weapons out there I think that I get a
quick<00:01:46.200> bowl<00:01:46.439> that's<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.040> pretty<00:01:47.189> good<00:01:47.340> weapon

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
quick bowl that's a pretty good weapon

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
quick bowl that's a pretty good weapon
in<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:47.850> opinion<00:01:48.119> I've<00:01:48.840> used<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.290> couple

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
in my opinion I've used it a couple

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.889 
in my opinion I've used it a couple
times<00:01:49.590> off<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> ground<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.299> I'm<00:01:51.390> really<00:01:51.750> glad

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
times off the ground so I'm really glad

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.899 
times off the ground so I'm really glad
that<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.409> able<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.700> said<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that I was able to get it like I said I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.190 
that I was able to get it like I said I
think<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.240> couple<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.570> videos<00:01:54.780> ago<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.170> I

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
think a couple of videos ago that I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.319 
think a couple of videos ago that I
wanted<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> doctor<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.180> I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
wanted the doctor but this is like I

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.910 
wanted the doctor but this is like I
guess<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> second<00:01:57.990> best<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> doctor

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
guess the second best to the doctor

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.350 
guess the second best to the doctor
because<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.219> does<00:01:59.369> give<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.759> crease<00:02:00.060> fire

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
because it does give you crease fire

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.389 
because it does give you crease fire
aids<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.170> guys<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.500> opened<00:02:01.890> any<00:02:02.009> supply
