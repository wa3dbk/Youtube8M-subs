00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.920
 hello to all guys first of all vi 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.689
 I apologize if in the last few weeks 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.939
 I didn't post videos but I was really 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.860
 very busy with the university for 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.630
 let me forgive you in this video I'll talk 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.550
 of something that many of you were 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.890
 really waiting for a long time 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.840
 you have been asking for so many months in 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.240
 this video I will present you an excellent one 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.949
 card for intermediate bodybuilders then 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.230
 if you have been training for at least a year 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.850
 whole with constant training well 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.739
 carried out and with commitment 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.500
 this is the right card for you or 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.119
 if you have followed for at least 8 10 months 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.070
 the beginner card I had 

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:46.510
 shown in the previous video you can 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.400
 go to the card that I propose today 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.780
 that of a slightly more advanced level 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.830
 and keep getting good 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.059
 results 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.769
 now I'll show you how it is 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.570
 structured the card and video all 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.489
 information necessary to carry out the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.189
 better so that it works and I saw ha 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.930
 so many excellent results we see a little 

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.489
 here is the training card like 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.619
 see this card provides that there 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.540
 train four days a week a 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.310
 difference of only three days as in the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.140
 card for beginners whenever 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.210
 you will train will not train all 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.310
 body as in the other card badly neither 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.440
 network only the upper part or only the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.390
 lower body in this way 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.310
 each muscle group having trained two 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.440
 times a week and this is really it 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.360
 the perfect training frequency for 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.460
 an intermediate bodybuilder also like 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.440
 you can already see there will be days 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.900
 in which you will use heavier weights e 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.909
 therefore less repetitions and other days 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.340
 where you will use lighter and more countries 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.620
 repetitions because this choice because 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.600
 in addition to training doing hypertrophy 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.580
 quite high repetitions we want 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.890
 also stimulate pure strength by doing 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.600
 lower repetitions in this way i 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.030
 muscles will grow more so 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.710
 complete and faster in this 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.270
 tab as you see I propose several 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.850
 exercises are exercises that I find a lot 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.440
 good and effective but no one forbids you 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.120
 to replace them with other exercises 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.740
 compatible more important as I have 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.960
 just said is that the replaced with 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.180
 compatible exercises such as a 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.070
 multi-joint exercise for the chest 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.540
 like the flat bench cannot be 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.489
 replaced by a mono exercise 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.379
 articulate for the shoulders for example is 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.299
 clear if you have any doubts about how 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.950
 replace the exercises let me as well 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.659
 a comment below the video and vi 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.159
 I will answer by giving you help 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.989
 then let's see a bit like this tab 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.739
 of training takes place during the 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.120
 week 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.170
 we assume that the first day of 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.720
 training is the look 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.640
 on Monday or the first day we will train 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.069
 the upper part of the body then 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.930
 shoulders, chest and back, etc. with 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.150
 quite heavy loads then 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.280
 low reps and enough rest 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.590
 long repetitions I put them not 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.750
 too low from 5 to 7 I recommend 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.730
 but if you feel it if you have one 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.890
 good experience if you don't feel and pain 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.870
 and if you know how to do the exercises well 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.640
 then you can try to go down too 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.950
 a little more then increase the weight e 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.019
 do only three or four repetitions on 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.120
 second day then Tuesday for example 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.730
 we will always train with heavy loads 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.040
 the lower part of the body on Wednesday 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.840
 the third day will be the fourth rest 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.850
 day as you see we will train the part 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.950
 upper body but with more loads 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.510
 light then higher repetitions e 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.130
 rest more content 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.989
 We will train the lower part on Friday 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.549
 of the body always with light loads 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.590
 then a more focused workout 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.019
 hypertrophy and the fifth on the sixth day 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.790
 for example Saturday and Sunday will be for 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.920
 rest this is the card that you 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.420
 I propose an excellent board for intermediates 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.400
 I am sure that if executed 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.110
 correctly and brought it forward in 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.359
 time you will always have excellent 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.190
 results you have to bring it forward in 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.320
 time in the sense that you have to slightly 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.060
 change it slowly so that you can 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.489
 always guarantee good results 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.950
 how then, first of all, course 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.570
 will have progressive load then increase 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.570
 from week to week in the month 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.579
 month weights you use replaced by 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.500
 occasionally even the exercises at least 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.269
 once every month every two months 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.579
 try to vary the rest times 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.079
 to repetitions the serial number like 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.000
 you see I didn't put any numbers 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.200
 for example, on Monday I have them 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.019
 recommended from four to five 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.670
 series from 5 to 7 repetitions from 34 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.739
 minutes of rest this because I want to 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.450
 that periodically changes these 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.069
 variable so as to stimulate the body 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.660
 always differently 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.060
 one last thing about repetitions 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.130
 these must always be done with 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.690
 excellent execution but must be 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.519
 really difficult we see not put 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.560
 to the test then use the countries that you 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.570
 allow you to do repetitions always 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.489
 in a correct way but really committing yourself 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.350
 at most, you don't always get assins 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.180
 every day in all series 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.740
 because they explained it in other videos 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.360
 could be harmful 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.830
 I seem to have said everything if you have 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.570
 still some doubts let me a 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.159
 comment below and I will give you all the 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.140
 information you need 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.500
 if you decide to follow this card vi 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.360
 hope 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.680
 a good workout if you found the 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.540
 interesting video as always 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.130
 let me like to share it with
