00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
you're going to need more blade speed

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.670 
you're going to need more blade speed
but<00:02:21.630> then<00:02:21.780> you're<00:02:21.900> also<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.320> go<00:02:22.410> higher

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
but then you're also going to go higher

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.490 
but then you're also going to go higher
in<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.950> air<00:02:23.240> collective<00:02:24.240> pitch<00:02:24.450> ins<00:02:24.750> with<00:02:25.470> a

in the air collective pitch ins with a

in the air collective pitch ins with a
blood<00:02:26.490> extra<00:02:26.850> twist<00:02:27.060> don't<00:02:27.450> seem<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.750> have

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
blood extra twist don't seem to have

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.720 
blood extra twist don't seem to have
that<00:02:27.930> problem<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:29.040> again<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.640> an

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
that problem and again this is an

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.310 
that problem and again this is an
amateur<00:02:30.090> review<00:02:30.420> I've<00:02:30.630> never<00:02:30.840> pulled<00:02:31.170> a

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
amateur review I've never pulled a

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.040 
amateur review I've never pulled a
plunger<00:02:32.250> dish<00:02:32.520> but<00:02:33.209> about<00:02:33.390> five<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.870> six

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
plunger dish but about five and six

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.620 
plunger dish but about five and six
miles<00:02:34.290> per<00:02:34.500> hour<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:35.030> actually<00:02:36.030> think<00:02:36.360> it's

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
miles per hour I actually think it's

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.630 
miles per hour I actually think it's
almost<00:02:36.870> handles<00:02:37.290> better<00:02:37.470> because<00:02:38.370> when<00:02:38.520> this

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
almost handles better because when this

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.150 
almost handles better because when this
trips<00:02:38.940> away<00:02:39.120> that's<00:02:39.840> 100<00:02:40.110> feet<00:02:40.500> when<00:02:41.010> it's

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
trips away that's 100 feet when it's

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.000 
trips away that's 100 feet when it's
just<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.489> way<00:02:41.610> 25<00:02:42.600> 50

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.670 

I<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:49.060> think<00:02:49.629> one<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.959> reasons<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.439> because

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
I I think one of the reasons is because

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.280 
I I think one of the reasons is because
it's<00:02:51.430> fixed<00:02:51.879> pinch<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.510> cuz<00:02:52.870> it's<00:02:53.019> such<00:02:53.260> a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
it's fixed pinch and cuz it's such a

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.080 
it's fixed pinch and cuz it's such a
heavy<00:02:53.970> are<00:02:54.970> not<00:02:55.150> heavy<00:02:55.360> but<00:02:55.510> why<00:02:55.840> your<00:02:56.049> ween<00:02:57.090> it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
heavy are not heavy but why your ween it

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.140 
heavy are not heavy but why your ween it
actually<00:02:58.360> catches<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.170> wind<00:02:59.349> more<00:03:00.090> kind<00:03:01.090> of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
actually catches the wind more kind of

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.259 
actually catches the wind more kind of
like<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.269> kite<00:03:01.599> that<00:03:01.629> while<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:03.239> has<00:03:04.239> a

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
like a kite that while this has a

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.300 
like a kite that while this has a
tendency<00:03:04.629> to<00:03:04.840> seems<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.379> penetrate<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.099> a

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
tendency to seems to penetrate it a

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.690 
tendency to seems to penetrate it a
little<00:03:06.849> better<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.540> get<00:03:08.500> doesn't<00:03:09.010> catch<00:03:09.400> as

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
little better I get doesn't catch as

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.330 
little better I get doesn't catch as
much<00:03:10.120> when<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.690> know<00:03:10.930> it's<00:03:11.049> lighter<00:03:11.319> when<00:03:12.310> I

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
much when you know it's lighter when I

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.089 
much when you know it's lighter when I
tilt<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.879> in<00:03:13.030> or<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.390> fight<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.930> wind<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.500> all<00:03:14.680> I

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
tilt it in or I fight the wind the all I

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.190 
tilt it in or I fight the wind the all I
seems<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.090> be<00:03:16.209> able<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.629> almost<00:03:16.810> at<00:03:17.079> least

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
seems to be able to almost at least

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.069 
seems to be able to almost at least
maintain<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:18.209> course<00:03:19.409> well<00:03:20.409> what<00:03:20.769> this<00:03:20.980> does<00:03:22.079> it

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
maintain a course well what this does it

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.009 
maintain a course well what this does it
will<00:03:23.409> fight<00:03:24.129> the<00:03:24.310> wind<00:03:24.549> I'll<00:03:25.480> do<00:03:25.690> my<00:03:25.720> little

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
will fight the wind I'll do my little

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.680 
will fight the wind I'll do my little
dip<00:03:26.440> thing<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:27.129> if<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.310> know<00:03:27.459> about<00:03:27.700> this

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
dip thing and if you know about this

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.930 
dip thing and if you know about this
fish<00:03:29.049> they<00:03:29.230> like<00:03:29.409> to<00:03:29.530> do<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.859> maneuver<00:03:30.639> when

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
fish they like to do this maneuver when

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.390 
fish they like to do this maneuver when
you<00:03:31.090> come<00:03:31.720> down<00:03:31.870> from<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.230> dive<00:03:32.409> but<00:03:33.280> that

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
you come down from the dive but that

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.180 
you come down from the dive but that
does<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:34.030> now<00:03:34.720> look<00:03:34.959> what<00:03:35.139> happens<00:03:35.190> you

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
does that now look what happens you

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.920 
does that now look what happens you
fight<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.700> win<00:03:36.849> and<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.239> same<00:03:37.540> when<00:03:37.780> you're

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
fight and win and that same when you're

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.309 
fight and win and that same when you're
fighting<00:03:38.260> becomes<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.370> kite<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.540> takes<00:03:41.109> it<00:03:41.200> up

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
fighting becomes a kite and takes it up

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.910 
fighting becomes a kite and takes it up
higher<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:41.920> you'll<00:03:42.730> try<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.000> dip<00:03:43.269> down<00:03:43.299> again

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
higher so you'll try to dip down again

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.589 
higher so you'll try to dip down again
go<00:03:44.920> up<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.519> even<00:03:45.819> has<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:46.030> more<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:46.510> a

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
go up and it even has a more of a

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.020 
go up and it even has a more of a
pendulum<00:03:46.930> effect<00:03:47.139> any<00:03:47.620> Emma's<00:03:47.980> are<00:03:48.159> so<00:03:48.909> it

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
pendulum effect any Emma's are so it

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.289 
pendulum effect any Emma's are so it
catches<00:03:49.239> more<00:03:49.569> with<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.200> goes<00:03:51.040> further<00:03:51.370> so

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
catches more with and goes further so

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.500 
catches more with and goes further so
the<00:03:53.260> answer<00:03:53.370> reason<00:03:54.370> there<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:54.819> glam<00:03:55.180> to

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
the answer reason there is glam to

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.839 
the answer reason there is glam to
review<00:03:55.780> how<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.410> keep<00:03:57.250> people<00:03:57.459> from
