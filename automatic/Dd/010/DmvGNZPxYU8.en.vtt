00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 and welcome all the kids in the piano 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.650
 this brand new video as you see 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.420
 we are on minecraft 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.719
 this video today I want to show a 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.520
 tutorial we are on a package ftv la 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.379
 from the rumors 20 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.360
 I want to show you how to generate 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.080
 infinite current through the voice of the 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.470
 earth but of expansion in union with the 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.330
 with the fashion of the mind factory in fact 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.830
 you need some machinery 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.990
 fundamentals I try to hurry 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.669
 because I don't have much time so there 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.500
 need a plant air is a robe 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.480
 reconstructed you know that the flanker in 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.890
 principle cover 3x3 size then 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.500
 don't put precision in the queen 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.560
 leave a distance space for 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.000
 go upstairs 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.860
 you know that builds for between this area 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.530
 then the center comes from there and therefore 1 2 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.150
 3 1 2 3 then put a block of 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.250
 put it prester and remove the block 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.620
 under even go here over the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.320
 unpublished a block the having worked are 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.000
 there behind a house and put them there 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.130
 pasta this happy question everything is 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.620
 returned stress your digging that 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.570
 you did build before 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.009
 this size water source made in 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.020
 which was made just like this 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.810
 within which of the age put 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.960
 a water accumulator machinery 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.610
 thermal expansion 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.410
 ok i 'll tell you a little about using this now 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.420
 therefore above it will serve as a pharma of 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.070
 wood in abundance this below vi 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.900
 will serve as a pharma of derived energy 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.300
 from making a wooden so what 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.330
 you have to do now you have to put 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.100
 four steam dynamo I used 4 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.680
 because 4 seems to me quite a number 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.020
 quite efficient not fasting there ve 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.429
 I recommend more 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.460
 eat close to yourself 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:45.120
 here you put them to be afraid of bad luck 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.420
 Pope 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.420
 who needs 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.360
 well here we are, therefore it comes out 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.090
 put these four fluids to 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.280
 connect them take the branch e 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.320
 from the bees before taking brunch 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.900
 on the opposite side I connected the tubes 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.810
 of the current then take the branch e 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.960
 turn in the right direction 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.640
 here, of course, you put them there 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.460
 connected here you can put one 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.140
 battery one of those of course 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.010
 of the land sea expansion that I am the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.720
 the leader of sel you connect and you will have 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.520
 obviously obtained is a first form 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.230
 probable these months we are still that 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.120
 if this mission is no longer needed 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.800
 you will have obtained a small circuit in 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.050
 able to generate current only 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.890
 putting coal inside, though 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.200
 obviously we have to render them 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.030
 automatic as we do 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.610
 we connect the case clearly 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.440
 takes only from the house not from the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.980
 western bordon we connect the case 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.820
 alpes lantern and put a redstone 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.200
 although born near here or even before before 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.570
 we connect with the jardin de roberto 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.060
 pini the energy conduit and we connect it 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.130
 with battery with beak battery 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.850
 the real energy saddle happen that 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.650
 let's put on a furnace he obviously has 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.560
 arezzo we do not enter into fairies 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.300
 link none here upper case key 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.690
 left and canceled adults put on 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.670
 high the exit is on the left 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.410
 the anti entrance to the right entrance for da 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.390
 not just overflow 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.590
 put a curtain over all the engines 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.780
 turned down with the arrow then 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.450
 put another to the trend art that arrives 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.360
 up to above the furnace installed in a 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.940
 pneumatic servo right rate with the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.780
 glue brand turn it upwards hand 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.760
 free right click and of course put 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.870
 white list and leave me the coal 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.660
 inside and then put none here 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.490
 connect the pneumatic servola 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.430
 the furnace you have 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.110
 connected first upstairs you will have to 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.490
 do is install another pneumatic 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.150
 Serbian 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.830
 obviously here always as we did 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.390
 we have to do right click to 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.270
 make it turned down because 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.850
 I have to leave no signal or white list 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.500
 and you put them only at the dawn of saplings 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.940
 and jungle wood here in the 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.070
 plant what is being said put them 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.100
 inside the arborelle now what do you do 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.950
 connect everything through the cables or 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.290
 by means of power cables because 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:28.840
 obviously also the plan ter and the arrest 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:31.150
 they must have the current right then 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.960
 he had put too high if I have to do it 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.620
 pass so I can do so well 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.510
 we give him another round 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.560
 we have him do this tour here that 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.150
 the less it absolutely changes 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.010
 anything 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.510
 and then what you need to do as a last 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.190
 what as a last mixed thing you will have to 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.690
 have a small starting current 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.790
 as fact I will tend small current of 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.060
 departure with coal is put on 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.340
 a little inside every single furnace that 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.260
 so much have you seen that already with water 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.850
 of the cruze accumulator is working 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.470
 correctly 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.040
 put too little 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.040
 inside of 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.090
 here in this I forgot there 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.410
 you need to install a servo tire 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.700
 put white list and put on wood 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.610
 go this way 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.640
 take a few saplings right click 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.620
 for inserting matic servo whiteley e 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.930
 you only see the saplings because of that 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.130
 it hinders having to send things well 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.540
 we connected everything as above 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.550
 obviously you see here that it started 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.010
 give us some current 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.590
 the bare minimum so we go 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.690
 above where he is not planting because 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.700
 I didn't connect this right 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.750
 I have to put nobody in the meantime 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.750
 and configure that 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.640
 no no which one is right 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.470
 here it's not him so well 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.270
 we have the output so we know that 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.910
 from the other parts of we must put 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.740
 all entrance 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.780
 here we have the exit and from the other parts 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.100
 apart below 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.750
 oh well we do so that connects him 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.750
 directly here so we do before 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.860
 so we have everything connected of course 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.990
 the furnace works 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.760
 these receive watch these receive 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.920
 current therefore will have planted 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.270
 over it 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.520
 let's go upstairs and that's it 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.050
 only a little at the beginning can do 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.720
 grow a tree that he veils 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.670
 will begin to cut instantly will put 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.990
 everything in here also puts him 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.530
 a little wood that had gotten one 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.940
 first to speed everything up here 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.160
 underneath what happens the saplings 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.960
 all the mandates come here in fact if 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.300
 see in the box there are not more than 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.010
 to do so there are few because obviously 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.730
 they try to be sent in more 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.050
 possibility 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.700
 the wood where it is sent in here 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.270
 to the register furness the register 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.560
 furnis what does it bake what things cooks 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.630
 here c in wood that turns into 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.160
 calculate the kart with the vaden among these 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.260
 engines these engines genus year 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.450
 current that in turn goes to be 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.460
 stored and then subsequently 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.100
 we have an infinite cycle in which we are 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.630
 transforms current from wood nothing 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.400
 more to say simply than if you put 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.900
 of the upgrades generates more wood e 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.210
 so the process will be faster more 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.440
 engines and more furnaces you will put in more the 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.820
 process will be even bigger and 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.160
 later you can use this 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.840
 energy to do what you love 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.980
 I would say that for this tutorial and all if 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.240
 you have questions write in 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.050
 comments let me like see you 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.710
 next video 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.710
 Hi guys
