 Automatically translated by the machine. Today, I am doing a very simple style, 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.680
 It looks really effective: looping dice! Brush your hair and divide it into two 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.680
 Even part. Your ear lice holdings just started 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.900
 It is a little bit far away from your head, so it sits on the town. 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.440
 The ends of the rolls begin to pleat up and down. 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.149
 The needle is in place. The end of the dice and push it in 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 The end of the pine end, so it is completely hidden. Add more pins if you need to. 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.500
 Repeat the above steps on the other side to start with the tweezers. Some versions of this style use headbands 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.630
 At the top, but I prefer the pins because it makes the loop round a lot. 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.630
 Don't forget to hide the end of the dice, its pins are very strong. 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.070
 This is what it looks like from the back. Add some decorations like a headband or 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.820
 Flowers. Completed! 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.080
 This style is good, if this is a casual look, even the classic Lolita style 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.450
 go with. I hope this is a useful video, please check
