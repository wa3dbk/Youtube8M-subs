other<00:00:22.320> appliance<00:00:22.830> right<00:00:23.550> off<00:00:23.760> your<00:00:23.910> motorhome

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
other appliance right off your motorhome

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.210 
other appliance right off your motorhome
tank<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.199> also<00:00:25.350> allows<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.070> use<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
tank but it also allows you to use a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.849 
tank but it also allows you to use a
cylinder<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.090> here<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.500> there<00:00:28.650> and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
cylinder like this here right there and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.460 
cylinder like this here right there and
you<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.179> literally<00:00:30.630> tees<00:00:30.869> into<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.260> also

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
you can it literally tees into this also

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.220 
you can it literally tees into this also
so<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.189> don't<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.270> use<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.750> propane<00:00:34.200> on

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
so you don't have to use the propane on

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.170 
so you don't have to use the propane on
your<00:00:34.500> motorhome<00:00:34.829> because<00:00:35.700> otherwise<00:00:35.880> if<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
your motorhome because otherwise if you

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.610 
your motorhome because otherwise if you
run<00:00:36.329> out<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.750> got<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.020> pick<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.530> leave

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
run out you got to pick up and leave

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.440 
run out you got to pick up and leave
yeah<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> takes<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.250> lot<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.430> time<00:00:38.730> okay<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
yeah it takes a lot of time okay and the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.549 
yeah it takes a lot of time okay and the
first<00:00:39.660> part<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> installation<00:00:40.530> process

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
first part of the installation process

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.520 
first part of the installation process
is<00:00:41.219> installing<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.239> tee<00:00:42.480> right<00:00:42.840> yeah<00:00:43.290> very

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
is installing this tee right yeah very

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.470 
is installing this tee right yeah very
easy<00:00:43.620> okay<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.300> right

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
easy okay what do we do that but right

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.750 
easy okay what do we do that but right
here<00:00:45.510> okay<00:00:46.020> let's<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> okay<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.280> now<00:00:47.640> I've

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
here okay let's do it okay so now I've

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.100 
here okay let's do it okay so now I've
got<00:00:47.940> our<00:00:48.030> tee<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> guess<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.629> got<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> loosen

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
got our tee and I guess we got to loosen

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410 
got our tee and I guess we got to loosen
this<00:00:49.200> first<00:00:49.469> right<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> 7/8<00:00:51.149> wrench

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
this first right this is a 7/8 wrench

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.240 
this first right this is a 7/8 wrench
that<00:00:51.600> actually<00:00:51.960> fits<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.770> he's<00:00:52.860> just

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that actually fits on here and he's just

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
that actually fits on here and he's just
left<00:00:53.489> hand<00:00:53.760> thread<00:00:53.969> because<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.600> gas<00:00:54.899> okay

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
left hand thread because it is gas okay

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.400 
left hand thread because it is gas okay
so<00:00:56.420> basically<00:00:57.420> we're<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.960> back<00:00:58.199> this

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
so basically we're going to back this

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.139 
so basically we're going to back this
regulator<00:00:58.859> assembly<00:00:59.039> right<00:00:59.579> out<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.850> there

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
regulator assembly right out of there

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.830 
regulator assembly right out of there

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
yeah sometimes sometimes these valves if

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.970 
yeah sometimes sometimes these valves if
the<00:02:22.810> fittings<00:02:23.410> have<00:02:23.500> been<00:02:23.650> in<00:02:23.739> there<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.920> long

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
the fittings have been in there a long

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.680 
the fittings have been in there a long
time<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.790> get<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> little<00:02:25.030> burr<00:02:25.300> in<00:02:25.510> there

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
time and it get a little burr in there

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.940 
time and it get a little burr in there
and<00:02:25.810> they'll<00:02:25.900> actually<00:02:26.110> leak<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.650> little<00:02:26.830> bit

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950

and they'll actually leak a little bit
then<00:02:27.069> I'm<00:02:27.160> going<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.310> test<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.700> one<00:02:27.819> more<00:02:28.030> time

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
then I'm going to test it one more time

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.420 
then I'm going to test it one more time
I<00:02:28.660> don't<00:02:29.410> see<00:02:29.590> anything<00:02:29.800> now<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.220> looks

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430

the top of the tee there again you
really<00:02:57.910> can't<00:02:58.150> make<00:02:58.299> a<00:02:58.359> mistake<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.140> cap<00:02:59.380> only

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
really can't make a mistake the cap only

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.830 
really can't make a mistake the cap only
matches<00:03:00.010> we're<00:03:00.850> going<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.060> pull<00:03:01.209> this<00:03:01.329> cap<00:03:01.600> off

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
matches we're going to pull this cap off

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.960 
matches we're going to pull this cap off
we're<00:03:02.799> going<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:02.980> go<00:03:03.040> right<00:03:03.310> into<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.609> top<00:03:03.790> of

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
we're going to go right into the top of

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.449 
we're going to go right into the top of
the<00:03:04.060> tee<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> little<00:03:05.829> bit<00:03:05.920> tight<00:03:06.190> because

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
the tee it is a little bit tight because

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.830 
the tee it is a little bit tight because
there's<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.700> heavy<00:03:06.880> check<00:03:07.180> valve<00:03:07.450> in<00:03:07.630> there<00:03:07.750> to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
there's a heavy check valve in there to

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.390 
there's a heavy check valve in there to
keep<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.109> propane<00:03:08.350> from<00:03:08.709> escaping<00:03:09.130> when

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
keep the propane from escaping when

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.340 
keep the propane from escaping when
you're<00:03:09.549> not<00:03:09.700> using<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.180> okay<00:03:10.810> that<00:03:11.140> one's

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
you're not using it okay that one's

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.680 
you're not using it okay that one's
hooked<00:03:11.590> up<00:03:11.799> so<00:03:12.010> now<00:03:12.160> our<00:03:12.190> second<00:03:12.790> hose<00:03:12.970> goes

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
hooked up so now our second hose goes

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.140 
hooked up so now our second hose goes
where<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.260> goes<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:15.150> extended-stay

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
where that goes to this extended-stay

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.400 
where that goes to this extended-stay
cylinder<00:03:16.900> here<00:03:17.519> now<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:19.420> has<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.930> go<00:03:20.079> into<00:03:20.230> the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
cylinder here now it has to go into the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.050 
cylinder here now it has to go into the
tee<00:03:20.590> first<00:03:20.920> on<00:03:21.160> this<00:03:21.340> one<00:03:21.400> because<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.880> does

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
tee first on this one because it does

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.729 
tee first on this one because it does
not<00:03:22.180> swivel<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:23.049> let's<00:03:23.290> take<00:03:23.440> this<00:03:23.560> little

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
not swivel so let's take this little

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.910 
not swivel so let's take this little
plug<00:03:24.100> out<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.400> bottom<00:03:24.790> here<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.799> if<00:03:26.799> you

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
plug out of the bottom here and if you
