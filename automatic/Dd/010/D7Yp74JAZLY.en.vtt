has $91,000 every see y'all probably saw
the<00:00:35.079> misfire<00:00:36.079> video<00:00:37.420> that<00:00:38.420> i<00:00:38.540> did<00:00:38.570> recently<00:00:42.220> it

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
the misfire video that i did recently it

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.310 
the misfire video that i did recently it
was<00:00:43.460> getting<00:00:43.880> a<00:00:44.980> jerking<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.840> loss<00:00:47.840> of<00:00:48.110> power

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
was getting a jerking and loss of power

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.740 
was getting a jerking and loss of power
under<00:00:48.650> acceleration<00:00:49.520> but<00:00:49.670> ran<00:00:49.910> okay<00:00:50.300> when<00:00:50.630> it

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
under acceleration but ran okay when it

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.000 
under acceleration but ran okay when it
went<00:00:50.990> under<00:00:51.170> except<00:00:51.740> under<00:00:52.190> load<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:56.620> i<00:00:57.620> just

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
went under except under load and i just

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.670 
went under except under load and i just
wanted<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.340> show<00:00:58.520> you<00:00:58.550> all<00:00:59.050> what<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.200> problem

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
wanted to show you all what the problem

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.830 
wanted to show you all what the problem
was

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
was

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
design okay as you see all these plugs

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.430 
design okay as you see all these plugs
are<00:01:24.740> in<00:01:24.890> good<00:01:25.100> condition<00:01:28.000> one<00:01:29.000> did<00:01:29.240> break<00:01:29.540> on

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
are in good condition one did break on

are in good condition one did break on
removal<00:01:32.440> here's<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.770> little<00:01:35.050> thing<00:01:36.050> that

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
removal here's the little thing that

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.800 
removal here's the little thing that
runs<00:01:37.159> a<00:01:37.370> spark<00:01:37.700> through<00:01:37.970> two<00:01:38.270> down<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.690> the

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
runs a spark through two down to the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.969 
runs a spark through two down to the
electrode<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.990> can<00:01:42.140> see<00:01:42.320> where<00:01:42.470> they<00:01:42.620> had<00:01:42.860> to

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
electrode you can see where they had to

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.789 
electrode you can see where they had to
tap<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.460> threads<00:01:43.760> in<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.180> pull<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:47.560> one<00:01:48.560> of<00:01:48.710> the

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
tap the threads in to pull it one of the

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.890 
tap the threads in to pull it one of the
things<00:01:49.070> that<00:01:49.370> I<00:01:49.400> noticed<00:01:51.520> part<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.670> this

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
things that I noticed part of this

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.230 
things that I noticed part of this
porcelain<00:01:53.900> piece<00:01:54.729> this<00:01:55.729> is<00:01:55.940> where<00:01:56.120> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
porcelain piece this is where the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.520 
porcelain piece this is where the
electrode<00:01:56.780> would<00:01:57.049> be<00:01:57.229> like<00:01:57.979> this<00:01:58.220> part<00:01:58.549> here

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
electrode would be like this part here

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.539 
electrode would be like this part here
part<00:02:00.530> of<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:00.740> bottom<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.369> missing<00:02:03.340> it's<00:02:04.340> like

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
part of the bottom is missing it's like

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.830 
part of the bottom is missing it's like
the<00:02:05.500> electrode<00:02:06.500> broke<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.479> just<00:02:08.479> fell<00:02:08.810> down

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
the electrode broke and just fell down

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.300 
the electrode broke and just fell down
on<00:02:09.229> top<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.470> piston<00:02:10.069> and<00:02:10.689> I<00:02:11.689> guess<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.310> piston

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
on top of piston and I guess the piston

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.000 
on top of piston and I guess the piston
probably<00:02:13.670> pushed<00:02:13.909> it<00:02:14.120> through<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.390> exhaust

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.710 

this<00:02:18.010> spark<00:02:18.370> plug<00:02:18.430> right<00:02:18.909> here<00:02:19.269> I<00:02:20.159> believe<00:02:21.720> was

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
this spark plug right here I believe was

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.970 
this spark plug right here I believe was
my<00:02:22.900> problem<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:25.540> see<00:02:25.810> words<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.920> said

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
my problem you see words but like I said

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:37.530 
my problem you see words but like I said
you<00:02:27.310> can<00:02:27.430> see<00:02:27.580> where<00:02:27.730> it's<00:02:27.849> broke<00:02:28.090> here<00:02:36.540> this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
you can see where it's broke here this

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.330 
you can see where it's broke here this
one<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.200> silliest<00:02:38.680> one<00:02:39.129> of<00:02:40.120> all<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.599> them

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
one is the silliest one of all of them

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.250 
one is the silliest one of all of them
the<00:02:42.340> rest<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.819> them<00:02:43.000> are<00:02:43.120> pretty<00:02:43.150> clean<00:02:43.810> this

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
the rest of them are pretty clean this

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.069 
the rest of them are pretty clean this
one's<00:02:44.530> kind<00:02:44.799> of<00:02:44.860> gots<00:02:45.069> them<00:02:45.659> it's<00:02:46.659> kind<00:02:46.959> of

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
one's kind of gots them it's kind of

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.750 
one's kind of gots them it's kind of
nasty<00:02:49.319> but<00:02:50.319> this<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.950> there's<00:02:51.190> no<00:02:51.370> reason

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
nasty but this that there's no reason

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.110 
nasty but this that there's no reason
this<00:02:51.910> would<00:02:52.120> have<00:02:52.239> broke<00:02:53.670> there's<00:02:54.670> no<00:02:54.819> reason

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
this would have broke there's no reason

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.759 
this would have broke there's no reason
this<00:02:55.209> should<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.840> electrode<00:02:56.500> should<00:02:56.680> have

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
this should the electrode should have

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.979 
this should the electrode should have
broke<00:02:57.010> pulling<00:02:57.879> it<00:02:58.000> out<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.420> believe<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.870> was

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
broke pulling it out I believe it was

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.839 
broke pulling it out I believe it was
broke<00:03:00.720> when<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:02.109> little<00:03:02.739> while<00:03:02.920> back<00:03:03.129> when<00:03:03.819> I

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
broke when it a little while back when I

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.880 
broke when it a little while back when I
had<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.180> misfire<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:05.109> just<00:03:05.319> started

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
had the misfire and it just started

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.920 
had the misfire and it just started
breaking<00:03:06.159> worse<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:06.879> started<00:03:07.510> cracking

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
breaking worse and started cracking

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.170 
breaking worse and started cracking
worse<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.379> worse<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:09.519> where<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.790> was<00:03:09.879> causing

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
worse and worse to where it was causing

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.289 
worse and worse to where it was causing
them<00:03:10.620> spark<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:12.099> know<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.250> foul<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.060> spark

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
them spark you know a foul and the spark

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.349 
them spark you know a foul and the spark
but<00:03:16.299> all<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.629> rest<00:03:16.840> of<00:03:17.079> them<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.530> can<00:03:18.459> see<00:03:18.700> are

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
but all the rest of them you can see are

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.390 
but all the rest of them you can see are
not<00:03:19.840> City<00:03:21.720> other<00:03:22.720> than<00:03:23.109> just<00:03:23.290> normal<00:03:23.470> feel<00:03:23.980> sit

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
not City other than just normal feel sit

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.740 
not City other than just normal feel sit
and<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:26.500> one's<00:03:26.769> pretty<00:03:27.310> clean<00:03:27.730> it's<00:03:28.540> got

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
and this one's pretty clean it's got

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.860 
and this one's pretty clean it's got
some<00:03:28.989> it's<00:03:29.410> got<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.620> pretty<00:03:29.889> good<00:03:29.980> bit<00:03:30.190> soot<00:03:30.459> on

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
some it's got a pretty good bit soot on

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.309

more<00:03:31.870> than<00:03:32.079> I<00:03:32.200> would<00:03:32.260> like<00:03:33.840> but<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:37.900> was<00:03:38.139> my

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
more than I would like but this was my

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.650 
more than I would like but this was my
bad<00:03:38.590> spark<00:03:39.010> plug<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.430> was<00:03:39.549> broken<00:03:39.940> electrode

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
bad spark plug it was broken electrode

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.920 
bad spark plug it was broken electrode
around<00:03:41.410> here<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:44.849> so<00:03:45.849> if<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.180> ever<00:03:46.209> have<00:03:46.720> if

acceleration it would be a good idea to

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.710 
acceleration it would be a good idea to
change<00:04:00.280> your<00:04:00.400> spark<00:04:00.669> plugs<00:04:01.000> because<00:04:01.299> that's

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
change your spark plugs because that's

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.140 
change your spark plugs because that's
the<00:04:01.930> first<00:04:02.260> foremost<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.459> cheapest<00:04:03.879> thing

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
the first foremost and cheapest thing

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.710 
the first foremost and cheapest thing
that<00:04:05.109> you<00:04:05.290> can<00:04:05.500> do<00:04:05.739> at<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.639> beginning<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.569> a

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
misfire if it's not as far as usually

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.839

looking<00:04:17.739> at<00:04:17.829> further<00:04:18.099> problems<00:04:18.609> but<00:04:18.849> this<00:04:19.060> was

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
looking at further problems but this was

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.240 
looking at further problems but this was
my<00:04:19.389> problem<00:04:19.690> all<00:04:20.380> my<00:04:20.739> coals<00:04:21.070> are<00:04:21.400> good<00:04:21.660> and

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
my problem all my coals are good and

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.610 
my problem all my coals are good and
that's<00:04:24.250> why<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.550> wasn't<00:04:25.030> getting<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.620> of

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
that's why I wasn't getting that of

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.690 
that's why I wasn't getting that of
course<00:04:26.890> I've<00:04:27.039> heard<00:04:27.190> of<00:04:27.340> people<00:04:27.460> getting

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
course I've heard of people getting

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.339 
course I've heard of people getting
check<00:04:28.000> engine<00:04:28.180> lights<00:04:28.419> for<00:04:28.630> bad<00:04:28.780> spark<00:04:29.080> plugs

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
check engine lights for bad spark plugs

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:29.900 
check engine lights for bad spark plugs
but

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
but

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.610 
but
I never<00:04:30.120> got<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.360> check<00:04:30.600> engine<00:04:30.810> light<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.530> he

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
I never got to check engine light and he

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.830 
I never got to check engine light and he
got<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.980> miss<00:04:32.130> him<00:04:32.310> pretty<00:04:32.490> bad<00:04:32.760> he<00:04:33.090> got<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:33.510> bad

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
got to miss him pretty bad he got so bad

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.210 
got to miss him pretty bad he got so bad
where<00:04:34.140> I<00:04:34.170> couldn't<00:04:34.440> drive<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:34.910> anymore<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:37.560> I

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
where I couldn't drive it anymore and I

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.010 
where I couldn't drive it anymore and I
asked<00:04:38.550> him<00:04:38.670> for<00:04:38.820> all<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.120> old<00:04:39.270> parts<00:04:39.600> back

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
asked him for all the old parts back

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.860 
asked him for all the old parts back
because<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.710> wanted<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:42.000> know<00:04:42.030> do<00:04:42.420> this<00:04:42.630> for

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
because I wanted to you know do this for

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.470 
because I wanted to you know do this for
demonstration<00:04:43.280> in<00:04:44.280> case<00:04:44.940> this<00:04:45.150> was<00:04:45.450> the

demonstration in case this was the

demonstration in case this was the
problem<00:04:46.340> but<00:04:47.340> you<00:04:47.490> can<00:04:47.610> see<00:04:47.790> this<00:04:48.000> one<00:04:48.210> broke

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
just wanted to show what the problem was

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.010 
just wanted to show what the problem was
it<00:05:52.410> was<00:05:52.530> a<00:05:52.560> broken<00:05:52.830> electrode<00:05:53.640> right<00:05:54.419> here<00:05:54.870> I

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
it was a broken electrode right here I

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.320 
it was a broken electrode right here I
guess<00:05:55.860> when<00:05:56.100> I<00:05:56.130> guess<00:05:56.430> it<00:05:56.610> fell<00:05:56.790> down<00:05:56.820> on<00:05:57.210> the

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
guess when I guess it fell down on the

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.680 
guess when I guess it fell down on the
piston<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:58.730> and<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:02.120> the<00:06:03.120> spark<00:06:03.450> just

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
piston and and the the spark just

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.920 
piston and and the the spark just
started<00:06:04.020> fouling<00:06:04.350> out<00:06:04.470> because<00:06:04.919> of<00:06:05.100> that<00:06:05.930> but

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
started fouling out because of that but

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.230 
started fouling out because of that but
anyway<00:06:07.470> thanks<00:06:07.890> for<00:06:07.950> watching<00:06:08.070> and<00:06:08.820> I<00:06:09.090> hope

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
anyway thanks for watching and I hope

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.350 
anyway thanks for watching and I hope
this<00:06:09.600> video<00:06:09.960> was<00:06:10.169> helpful
