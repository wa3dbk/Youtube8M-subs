at 110 degrees the lid automatically

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
at 110 degrees the lid automatically
opens<00:01:36.509> what<00:01:36.930> happens<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> truck<00:01:37.890> will

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
opens what happens is the truck will

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.679 
opens what happens is the truck will
come<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.369> curb<00:01:38.640> an<00:01:38.850> arm<00:01:39.240> will<00:01:39.390> come<00:01:39.570> out

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
come up to the curb an arm will come out

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.679 
come up to the curb an arm will come out
wrap<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.650> around<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.640> bin<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.240> as

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
wrap it around the the bin and then as

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.810 
wrap it around the the bin and then as
it's<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> dump<00:01:43.470> cycle<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.189> lid<00:01:44.340> will<00:01:44.520> open

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
it's in the dump cycle the lid will open

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.789 
it's in the dump cycle the lid will open
so<00:01:45.090> eliminates<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.170> fact<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> person

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
so eliminates the fact that the person

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.710 
so eliminates the fact that the person
physically<00:01:47.220> having<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.610> pick<00:01:47.790> up<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> bin<00:01:48.270> the
