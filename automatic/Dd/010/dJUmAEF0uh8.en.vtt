00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:05.310
 Saturday night at Amman Molybdenum-99 this term a little barbaric does not tell you 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.580
 perhaps nothing yet this radioactive isotope play a role extremely 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.570
 important in medicine especially in the detection and treatment of 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.060
 cancers ouattara in the world 35 million patients a year either 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.079
 concerned but far from suffering 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.059
 to this problem, only five nuclear reactors in France 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:28.939
 molybdenum 99 and they are all experiencing what there is a risk of shortage 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.649
 what can be the consequences answer elements with stÃ©phanie 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.020
 thomas 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.430
 we are at the bichat hospital in the nuclear medicine departments 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.160
 these patients spend ahmed amin scintigraphy that goes much further than the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.240
 simple radio and which allows the observation of the functioning of organs and 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.970
 waters 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.260
 an examination that requires a safe injection of a radioactive product for 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.880
 the patient the technicians over these deposits on the organ that one is 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.320
 observed and water tariffs 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.410
 a gesture that could therefore produce 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.410
 so it's a very good atmosphere product in the locker room 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.140
 nothing to see so in fact it's still a bit hazy but as we can see 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.600
 actually know how to say that 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 protects the radioactivity contained south of bastia 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.310
 25th suicide this match 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.360
 is she saved so many lives I'm here for a screening 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.020
 because 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.990
 the technician is used in 80% of oncology exams 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.320
 he was cared for and detect breast cancer and diseases 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.840
 heart without him 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.970
 emetine would not make a good backward 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.850
 doctors are worried because molybdenum 99 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.840
 the radius at the top manufactured in nuclear reactors 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.329
 and who after game transmutation of the technician men to soon do 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.960
 sorely lacking it can not be kept for more than three days and can not be 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.140
 stored in case of shortage so far it's been because the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.109
 times of peace neither you nor have been relatively short 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.409
 and all the reactors did not stop at the same time as the 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.109
 producers of molybdenum medina but it does not take long and especially 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.410
 should not that it takes more important proportions 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.960
 and clearly the reactor are old reactors country we need 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.190
 of investments in the time of the reactors really to draw medical 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:17.959
 they are five nuclear reactors in the world like that of series 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.670
 located in the Paris region 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.129
 to make molybdenum 99 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:22.970
 the one that 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.340
 those actors who are over 40 years old are gradually closing their doors for 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.649
 reasons for maintenance 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:32.589
 police provide only 5% of the world's production of molybdenum 99 it 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:34.039
 remains very valuable 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.989
 researchers alerting governments around the world but 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.819
 still waiting for accidents 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.739
 it will probably have to be in 2015 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.430
 3 see 4 reactors in operation and for now we only see two 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.749
 so there is a clear problem all public investment 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.069
 new new facilities in europe 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.140
 often decried nuclear thanks also save lives 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.319
 so when will the construction of reactors intended solely for the 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.850
 medical research
