00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 we had the great luck that we 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.790
 actually people from the very beginning 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.470
 have touched and we have when I have 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.870
 Now is from a tourist picture 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.849
 may have at the beginning times 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.309
 We worked four to five markets 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.039
 today we welcome visitors 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.940
 visitors per year out of over 60 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.250
 nations 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.010
 that means international radiance 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.410
 This place has actually 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.050
 multiplied when we are ten years 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.679
 look back then was the home market 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.530
 Austria with at that time 210 1000 visitors 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.829
 closely followed by Germany and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.980
 Italy is the most important origin market 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.070
 Today, Germany is just under 160,000 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.710
 Visitors in front of Austria with 80,000 and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.510
 then comes in with over 62,000 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.430
 visitors the big challenge 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.899
 It was based on this project 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.370
 this existing success of 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.070
 crystal worlds we are not allowed to 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.340
 forget we have in the last 17 18 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.520
 over 12 million visitors 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.760
 to welcome was the challenge 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.350
 what can this note do? 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.390
 successful is still successful 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.310
 and we thought about this 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.530
 concept of underground miracles came 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.369
 just to put it outside and we 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.259
 be with our artist duo in the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.110
 create a garden of uniqueness 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.430
 with a huge floating crystal 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.340
 cloud over the mirror pond an outdoor 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.090
 Wunderkammer if you like it too 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.329
 with a lot of over 600,000 crystals 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.670
 will be provided and so too 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.979
 crystal in this opulence unique 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.509
 it will be used outdoors 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.290
 new offers for families and children 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.659
 give 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.140
 There will be a new restaurant 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.030
 also become very much inside the giant 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.220
 it will transform five new wonders 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.869
 come with very well-known and 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.740
 internationally known designers and 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.439
 give to artists 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.159
