00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 I always get back to inquire 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.559
 certain knits and crochets understood 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.280
 and I will now have a series of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.970
 make short videos where such terms 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.779
 be shown and explained 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.460
 a current question was the topic 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.429
 double stitches 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.569
 I often use that in mine 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:34.170
 instructions di luci must of course 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:36.330
 it is quite clear that it is his own 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.440
 Double by looking at them from the front 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.420
 Strictly down the back and I will you 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.400
 show that you can both right 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.430
 as well as with left-hand stitches 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.840
 I just have a little here 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:58.280
 sample comes showed times like that 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:03.750
 So I work three times 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:07.799
 normal right stitches and the next 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.109
 I will be back from the beginning 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.109
 and knit once from the back 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:19.969
 once knit as always but the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.969
 mesh still remains on the left needle 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.960
 and now you strictly stand in the 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.889
 rear a threadlike 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.789
 and now you leave the stitch of the 

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:35.100
 glide needle 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.090
 I make another right masch I 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.090
 show yourself again 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.530
 If you knit off you would knit 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.630
 yes take the back stitch thread 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.729
 So fall in the back stitches 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.820
 sting that we use here too 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.600
 First we knit them from the front 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.600
 absolutely normal 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.080
 Lucy finds that extremely amusing and 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.970
 then we knit them, so to speak 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.250
 entangled off with the middle finger 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.230
 I push the back thread there 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.130
 a little bit forward so that is easier 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.830
 a sting can and the second time 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.459
 crossed and glide from the needle 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.370
 to let 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.450
 Basically, you can also reverse it 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.239
 So you can do it first 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.640
 knit from knit and then from 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.360
 first stretch in front of the first 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.830
 pierce the back thread and then from 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.790
 knit at the front 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.860
 the difference is marginal so the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.329
 is very tiny then look at us 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.750
 right on and so that's easy 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:58.140
 An increase means that you double 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:01.519
 make a mesh that a mesh 2 so 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:06.500
 I'm knitting fast 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.500
 a left rey about it 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:27.330
 the loose funny since you had to 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.349
 very careful how always afraid that me 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.150
 here with the needles or stu so still 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:39.739
 I'll do a reckoning again 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.739
 so we better see these increase 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.660
 So we need blue ideas backside 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:54.480
 but really not and if you are 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:57.260
 that's exactly what you look at then 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.170
 difference is very tiny maybe 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.849
 is the variant where we first 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.410
 folded and then on the front 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:09.870
 still knitted a trace 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.099
 inconspicuous so first from the back 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.380
 then from the beginning 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.450
 By the way, in English, that becomes 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.639
 abbreviated 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:23.580
 Do you see that as an abbreviation kfb netfront 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.850
 So beck from the front and from 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.850
 behind 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.060
 so now we do the whole thing with left 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.110
 Of course, stitching works first, too 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:40.919
 normal left stitches and now 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.490
 knit off to the left then I do the thread 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:48.780
 backwards and strictly from the back left 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:54.050
 the back thread I'll show you yet 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:59.510
 once normal left mesh and now 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.510
 I knit first from the back first 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:10.760
 the thread is in front of the needle from behind 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:13.450
 a sting left and now in front 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:18.050
 knitting thread left 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:24.920
 once again I do three left stitches 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:30.110
 between crossed so once left 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:33.650
 knit off from behind and knit 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.570
 once the front thread left 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:42.530
 knit 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:44.980
 So it works and normal left 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.980
 mesh 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:53.590
 so also we'll see if 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:57.350
 because there is a significant difference 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:01.630
 I knit one again quickly 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:05.780
 right and a left rey about it 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08.800
 so you better get it through 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.800
 have increased 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:29.470
 the left rey about that had to be here 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:31.510
 You call it smooth right when you're on the 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.960
 front right stitches on the 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:37.060
 Back left stitch strictly it should 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.210
 on the back it does not look much 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:46.830
 and if we look closely then it is 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:49.720
 actually inconspicuous the first 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:54.070
 So the first duplication we do 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:57.150
 Knitted where we first front 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:00.040
 knitted on the front thread on the left 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.500
 and then the back thread 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:08.950
 so you see the difference 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:11.560
 really minimal so who is very 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.280
 fussy picky is already seeing one 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.770
 difference 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:22.540
 and if we compare the two 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:28.150
 the right and left doubling 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:31.180
 then these feet are the same 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.970
 the right one is behind each other 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.729
 left at the left to name stands 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.979
 this feet to the right so at the 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:42.130
 left mesh is less noticeable first 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:45.100
 from the front then knit back at the 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:47.800
 right-hand stitching is less noticeable at first 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:51.580
 knit at the back and then at the front 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:54.910
 but you can do it like it 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:08:01.110
 you are more comfortable than what you see 

00:07:54.910 --> 00:08:01.110
 the difference is a lot of fun
