00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.040 
running into that dreadknot which will
kill<00:02:18.010> me<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:20.490> once<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.670> land<00:02:21.940> on<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.510> planet

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
kill me and once I land on the planet

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.810 
kill me and once I land on the planet
I<00:02:23.080> will<00:02:23.410> undergo<00:02:23.770> another<00:02:24.550> minigame<00:02:26.820> that's

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
I will undergo another minigame that's

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.670 
I will undergo another minigame that's
me<00:02:28.030> just<00:02:28.060> pew<00:02:28.540> pew<00:02:28.780> went<00:02:28.900> along<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.500> there's

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
me just pew pew went along and there's

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.130 
me just pew pew went along and there's
the<00:02:29.860> planet<00:02:30.250> shooting<00:02:30.610> at<00:02:30.730> me<00:02:31.020> you're<00:02:32.020> not

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
the planet shooting at me you're not

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.330 
the planet shooting at me you're not
even<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:33.100> planet<00:02:34.200> yeah<00:02:35.200> but<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:36.010> give<00:02:36.250> an

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
even the planet yeah but you can give an

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.550 
even the planet yeah but you can give an
approach<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.730> diagonals<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.870> see<00:02:38.140> I've

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
approach of diagonals to so you see I've

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.910 
approach of diagonals to so you see I've
already<00:02:38.800> arrived<00:02:39.660> next<00:02:40.660> minigame<00:02:41.670> math<00:02:42.670> time

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
already arrived next minigame math time

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.620 
already arrived next minigame math time
8<00:02:44.920> plus<00:02:45.250> 8<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.730> 16

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
8 plus 8 is 16

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.010 
8 plus 8 is 16
I<00:02:46.660> hope<00:02:47.140> 4<00:02:47.890> times<00:02:48.190> 4<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.459> also<00:02:48.670> 16<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.420> s

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
I hope 4 times 4 is also 16 and s

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.570 
I hope 4 times 4 is also 16 and s
squared<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.680> be<00:02:50.709> broken<00:02:51.070> into<00:02:51.190> two<00:02:51.370> sets

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
squared can be broken into two sets

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.880 
squared can be broken into two sets
which<00:02:51.730> can<00:02:51.850> be<00:02:51.940> rotated<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.480> R<00:02:52.720> cubed<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.709> give

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
which can be rotated in R cubed to give

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.320 
which can be rotated in R cubed to give
s<00:02:54.070> squared<00:02:54.610> back<00:02:56.850> well<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.090> higher

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
s squared back well it is higher

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:07.620 
s squared back well it is higher
mathematics<00:03:00.930> absolutely<00:03:02.130> sweet<00:03:06.120> now<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.150> get<00:03:07.600> a

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
mathematics absolutely sweet now I get a

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.680 
mathematics absolutely sweet now I get a
choice<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:08.170> minigames<00:03:08.650> there<00:03:09.520> are<00:03:09.670> three<00:03:10.480> that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
choice of minigames there are three that

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.630 
choice of minigames there are three that
can<00:03:10.840> pop<00:03:11.110> up<00:03:11.140> at<00:03:11.440> any<00:03:11.470> time<00:03:11.890> but<00:03:12.220> it'll<00:03:12.430> only

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
can pop up at any time but it'll only

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.090 
can pop up at any time but it'll only
give<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.030> two<00:03:13.300> at<00:03:13.570> most<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.680> there's<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:14.950> total

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
give you two at most so there's a total

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.820 
give you two at most so there's a total
3/4<00:03:15.610> here<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.000> now<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.750> have<00:03:17.110> an<00:03:17.260> opportunity<00:03:17.500> to

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
3/4 here so now I have an opportunity to

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.770 
3/4 here so now I have an opportunity to
choose<00:03:18.070> where<00:03:18.370> I'm<00:03:18.580> going<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.000> land<00:03:19.150> my<00:03:19.450> ship

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
choose where I'm going to land my ship

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.710 
choose where I'm going to land my ship
the<00:03:20.530> easiest<00:03:20.950> option<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.640> not<00:03:22.000> available<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:22.540> I

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
the easiest option is not available so I

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.600 
the easiest option is not available so I
get<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:22.959> try<00:03:23.170> remote<00:03:23.230> landing<00:03:23.860> pad<00:03:24.070> or<00:03:24.370> the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
get to try remote landing pad or the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.660 
get to try remote landing pad or the
hills<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:26.799> only<00:03:26.920> time<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.280> tried<00:03:27.549> the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
hills and the only time I tried the

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.880 
hills and the only time I tried the
remote<00:03:27.910> landing<00:03:28.299> pad<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.720> died<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:29.560> we're<00:03:29.739> going

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
remote landing pad I died so we're going

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.539 
remote landing pad I died so we're going
into<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.280> hips<00:03:31.860> all<00:03:32.860> right<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.220> that's<00:03:33.340> my

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
into the hips all right so that's my

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.840 
into the hips all right so that's my
little<00:03:33.700> ship<00:03:33.970> if<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.209> get<00:03:34.390> hit<00:03:34.600> I<00:03:34.630> die<00:03:35.730> there's<00:03:36.730> a

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
little ship if I get hit I die there's a

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.190 
little ship if I get hit I die there's a
little<00:03:37.090> landing<00:03:37.390> pad<00:03:37.600> that<00:03:37.780> I'm<00:03:37.900> trying<00:03:38.170> to

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
little landing pad that I'm trying to

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.920 
little landing pad that I'm trying to
get<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.380> it's<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.739> gray<00:03:39.010> thing

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
get to it's the gray thing

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.539 
get to it's the gray thing
there<00:03:40.930> are<00:03:41.049> also<00:03:41.170> missiles<00:03:41.650> there<00:03:41.860> but<00:03:42.280> this

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
there are also missiles there but this

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.130 
there are also missiles there but this
is<00:03:42.850> actually<00:03:43.239> going<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.450> work<00:03:43.540> out<00:03:43.750> pretty

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
is actually going to work out pretty

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.699 
is actually going to work out pretty
well<00:03:44.230> for<00:03:44.380> me<00:03:48.209> yeah<00:03:49.230> whenever<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.440> get<00:03:50.560> an

well for me yeah whenever you get an

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.930 
well for me yeah whenever you get an
opportunity<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.310> watch<00:03:51.430> some<00:03:51.730> other<00:03:51.850> videos

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
opportunity to watch some other videos

or perhaps later on during this fucking
record<00:03:54.670> fast<00:03:55.000> by<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.900> way<00:03:56.049> viewers<00:03:56.530> there<00:03:56.860> are

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
record fast by the way viewers there are

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.920 
record fast by the way viewers there are
going<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.400> be<00:03:57.489> multiple<00:03:57.850> videos<00:03:58.180> unless<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:58.750> die

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
going to be multiple videos unless I die

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.039 
going to be multiple videos unless I die
then<00:03:59.739> we're<00:03:59.950> going<00:04:00.190> to<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.340> new<00:04:00.580> game<00:04:00.970> because<00:04:01.959> I
