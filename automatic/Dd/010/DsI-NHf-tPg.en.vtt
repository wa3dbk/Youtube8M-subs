00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.769
 the look sila and laila hello guys hello 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 to all of you guys then this is today 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.250
 gathered here because how you will be seeing 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.210
 from the images that are flowing there 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.699
 under the eyes 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.279
 we have been invited to Milan by 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.650
 personal gamer to participate in a 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.960
 event they organized to try 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.300
 the new arduous battlefield in which how 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.189
 surely you will know it is no longer ie it is not 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.820
 no longer has it been developed by dies but 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.440
 from visceral and therefore in addition to the change of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.290
 programmers there was also a change 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.219
 of setting therefore this game will take 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.660
 the moves in today's los angeles and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.899
 so there will be many more 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.789
 street fighting so I leave the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.070
 word to that which he will analyze 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.500
 a bit the characteristics of this new one 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.600
 I play then with regards to the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.730
 We are always on a chart 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.160
 excellent level that was anyway already 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.110
 seen in battlefield 4 then in the title 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.510
 previous, however, have been made 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.640
 many many graphic changes they have 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.590
 made the game much more fluid and much 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.990
 more enjoyable unfortunately in the beta 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.729
 we had the chance to try 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.189
 only obviously a narrow range 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.900
 of weapons let's say snipers 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.720
 I'll talk better about the ucsi I tried in 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.530
 particular assault rifles and smg that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.299
 I noticed really really improved 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.280
 They have also been introduced in many 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.159
 accessories the most interesting of which 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.979
 is the crossbow that practically beyond 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.229
 let us kill our gods 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 enemies will also allow us to 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.670
 reach the buildings by zip line 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.290
 more distant then a real cool is 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.840
 also the mechanics of the shops changed 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.270
 in fact in this title to buy 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.040
 new weapons new accessories both for the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.000
 our weapons precisely and also for ours 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.790
 vehicles 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.759
 we would need money for money 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.770
 which will accumulate gradually 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.869
 while we play our games 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.670
 now I leave the word deluxe there 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.229
 will introduce the game modes that it is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.240
 It was possible to try in the beta 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.590
 then with regard to the methods and 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.239
 the game modes are two 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.849
 modalities that are haste that is 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.230
 robbery and blood money to the race consists there 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.560
 it is precisely these two factions that they are 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.000
 the crimes 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.650
 by the police and by the very mode 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.239
 fast consists of a few words 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.950
 the main objective is that of 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.330
 criminals to recover the briefcases they 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.709
 they are located within the two 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.020
 armored that at first through one 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.580
 video script I don't know how to call it good 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.470
 however we will find these two armored vehicles 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.060
 in the center of the map and these criminals 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.120
 they will have to take two briefcase varieties 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.069
 inside two armored and will have to 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.900
 try to get them to the destination 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.610
 destination will be in the middle of the map 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.780
 so it's even more difficult because the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.510
 police in other words the other team 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.000
 opponent will already be approached 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.110
 to block the action of criminals 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.030
 then the goal of the bee of 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.560
 police and block criminals the other 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.200
 mode and blood money which is one 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.580
 variant of capturing the flag where it is 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.130
 a bit, however, a central location 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.900
 with 5 million dollars both 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.459
 teams that are criminals will have to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.849
 try to collect as much as possible 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.140
 possible and as much money as possible and 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.230
 try to bring them back to your face 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.120
 so the spot is discovered then 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.470
 the pouring team will be able to steal i 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.910
 money just the team from 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.410
 central location of 5 million 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.120
 dollars but also get to the face a 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.830
 harassing steal money from thinking time 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.269
 which is precisely discovered these are the 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.950
 Sundays not life and east and blood 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.900
 money now leaves the floor to the threshing floor 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.359
 there was talk of the night then the map 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.900
 which was released for this beta e 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.760
 ai tension or high voltage and it is not 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.799
 it was a random choice indeed for those 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.569
 had followed the three knows very well that it is 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.310
 was set right in the heart of a los 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.989
 angeles in downtown 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.660
 and in short this is what is proposed again 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.640
 this map is a very modern downtown 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.709
 with these extremely cool skyscrapers it is 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.780
 in fact for the presentation of this 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.120
 new battlefield title could be seen 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.950
 precisely for the boys they tried 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.959
 the beta on one of the skyscrapers 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.100
 reproduced on the map itself 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.139
 the thing that stands out immediately 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.410
 then it is the improvement that has been 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.090
 made with interaction 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.090
 in the environment itself or will be 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.340
 possible to collapse a whole crane that 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.230
 it will then block part of the map 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.910
 with all the various plates that will be 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.280
 falls to the ground but the thing I found 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.620
 of more interest was to see one's own 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.209
 how some means of transport could 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.039
 interact with the environment 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.180
 in fact in this map the knights action 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.470
 just 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.630
 we have some points on the map that 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.190
 what tricks do motorbikes 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.680
 really very cool 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.510
 I will have lost so much time doing the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.520
 my thousand stunts so too 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.280
 transport is too good 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.420
 vary according to the faction of which 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.330
 we are part 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.790
 let's move from the helicopter to the bike at the 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.550
 armored truck and the car of 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.110
 police and now a conclusion with i 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.340
 flakes thanks to our great 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.530

 it also goes to our area though 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.630
 unfortunately today due to logistical problems 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.270

 this fantastic experience in that 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.040
 they allowed us to try 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.230
 this arline in absolute preview which 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.240
 we remember it should come out around 20

 October 23 precisely do not remember the 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.380
