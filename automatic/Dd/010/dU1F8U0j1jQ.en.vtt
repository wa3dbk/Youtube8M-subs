 Appearance day of a topgame 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.950
 optimized game ready driver around one 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.070
 Play immediately on the optimized 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.510
 to enjoy the attitude 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.660
 we then want to hand that new nvidia 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.670
 whql driver 347 point 88 and it straight 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.560
 appeared triple a title battlefield 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.890
 Hotline demonstrate how the whole thing 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.960
 in practice affects for comparison 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.339
 we use the same thing twice 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.359
 test systems namely our mister gamer 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:39.809
 xtreme gtx 960 this is equipped 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:43.339
 with a nvidia geforce gtx 960 with 2 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.370
 gb graphic memory an intel core i5 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:49.399
 4690k quad core processor and 8gb ddr3 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.629
 random access memory 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.179
 We use the system on a system 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.940
 old driver version 3.4 7.52 on the 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.769
 others the current version 3.4 7.8 8 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.870
 since the new driver already 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.729
 edge smoothing by nfl for battlefield 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.119
 line allows us to use this 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:08.070
 instead of edge smoothing by ms the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.579
 optical differences between many 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.799
 mfs and quadruple ms are barely too 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.700
 recognize 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.530
 however, you can get one right away 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.000
 significant increase in images per 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.670
 Seconds notice what to do 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.500
 smooth gaming experience leads without that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.659
 you can take graphic losses 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.460
 just has to be action packed with sequences 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.340
 at the part of the refresh rate 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.880
 solid collapses comes to full mfl 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.750
 carry 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.750
 but see for yourself

 wrong for badges said what says

 nothing to me 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.240
 there is
