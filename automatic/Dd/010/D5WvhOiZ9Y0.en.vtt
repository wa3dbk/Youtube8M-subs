00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.449
 I am at the head of the cactus 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.730
 any cantú to cut the head already 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:14.199
 does not grow more in height then what 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.460
 It is done by taking advantage of it 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.710
 to make a graft 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.919
 you have to disinfect it is good 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.919
 forever 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.749
 It does not have an appointment as if it were a banana 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.690
 but they are hairs 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.410
 the first means 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.410
 but with me 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.420
 do not speak because everything commented 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.909
 of the Dutchman because you think you're 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.909
 looking for this port 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:29.820
 has the cactus has always change what 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.960
 what makes them vascular does not have it as 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.770
 the rest of the lack that have it 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.390
 abroad here in the center all the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.980
 circulation of the birds of the captur va 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.670
 around here the rest of the material 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.180
 reservation 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.520
 simply of water that we need then 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.620
 We need to contact that area of ​​the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.620
 change with any area of ​​change 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.050
 we can put this little one we can 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.050
 put a big one 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.860
 this cactus could reproduce it like this 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.640
 just as it is here by separation from 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.640
 mother plant 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.660
 but what I want to do is graft this 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.190
 about efe I have to put the contact 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.190
 also of this change 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.490
 It is as clean as possible 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.990
 because yes 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.970
 the trash has left the shit 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.520
 Or simply 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.300
 you have an infection problem 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.300
 head 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.390
 as long as possible the most 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.069
 possible clean and change this that 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.120
 is there in the center or is there 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.120
 place it with the change 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.409
 it is simply placed here and now what 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.680
 that you have to keep this attached to the other 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.400
 for at least 45 days from 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.310
 ready room 10 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.330
 As it sets we're going to see more 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.220
 I would serve 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:17.220
 no I do not tell you yes a restraint system 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.020
 in this case by a simple rubber that 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.020
 could hold up nothing in the area 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.970
 how do you have to be 45 days please 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.910
 days are enough five days 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.830
 another thing that you can do if this one 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.940
 chaste will not grow this cactus anymore and 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.130
 that will grow more 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.740
 on the sides as if it were a substrate 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.380
 normal what should be done is for 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.220
 give it a visit of more than vision 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.220
 that is more beautiful 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.080
 so that these peaks do not remain 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.850
 this is always going to form a callus there 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.850
 with a callus it is going to close the cut 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:04.129
 when it has grown and do it even 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:12.930
 and all are all that the majority of 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.670
 what happens to us never gets for a 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.859
 repeat because the track ones can not be 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.010
 paste then is totally the 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.299
 growth of a hospital totally 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:26.340
 stage that has the same structure 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.090
 of birth and had contact with 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.979
 the change 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.710
 I could put this stick and be at 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.410
 side I put two from some also what 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.270
 we can do here on the step in a 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.169
 step we put with him 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.090
 on a step of the d 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.830
 of the touch we could put perfectly 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.160
 and also acquire properties of 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.590
 Acquires skills from the employer 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.200
 this is simply a substrate as per 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.860
 here is also going to be the good change 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.860
 well here 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.260
 in operation on the sides 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.740
 but also in the growth of 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.910
 outside also the reservation is not like 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.040
 the rest of the plants that carry them 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.810
 only in what is outside and going 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.100
 growing while outside but going in 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.380
 center 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:23.610
 and in the growth of outside but in 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.610
 the outside this never 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:37.060
 this is what I could see planting 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:40.330
 as long as these x this is what 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.430
 let him get closer because then to 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:53.340
 keep it from rotting to the ground 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:53.340
 possible fresh and at a time when it 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:02.590
 they form the roots of this always what 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.920
 the callus is formed and what it does is that 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.290
 the 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.490
 of the changes let's say that self 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.490
 connect the changes
