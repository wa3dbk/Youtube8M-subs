00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:13.009
 close 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.160
 the art academy in Dusseldorf is a college of artists the empty one 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.779
 finds essentially the encounter between the teachers and the artists 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.250
 the students and focuses on the artistic tone 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.110
 the student of the Berlin native Josephine series managed one of the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.329
 coveted places to study at the prestigious college since 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.329
 For three years, she studied painting and graphics 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.870
 Artists go 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 but already his decision and he breaks with me 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.440
 so announced 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.920
 over a long time has begun 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.060
 This called internships in the ninth grade at the theater and doubling in percentage 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.260
 which are processed very well 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.350
 For years necessarily worked on the theater equipment-cleaned and has it too 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.310
 percent 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.820
 in front of 1400 workers there worked and struggling for fighting and internships 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.590
 then I have only one year after graduating from high school 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.220
 granted on release if a parent slipped in the area 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.060
 for musicians and percent 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.930
 Videos so what 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.960
 and then I always thought that I actually no longer feel like it 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.860
 the equipment etc 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 I'll be there at the art academy 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.400
 The entrance exam at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf is a high one 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.350
 Requirements for the applicants they must make substantial upfront payments 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.990
 furnish 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.130
 on the basis of which the examining board gets a picture of the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.030
 artistic talent 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.290
 So you have to resume which one learns primarily a folder 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.530
 There are certain formal requirements 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.810
 Of course, it's free to do and what you want to study live 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
 after this folder was spotted by the commission 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.930
 You will be accepted if I die and then for special 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.200
 artistically talented if you were accepted so there are countries 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.030
 also did not spoil a qualifying examination normally you have three days to 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.030
 Aptitude test invited the step falls way here 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.699
 The study conditions at the Art Academy give students space 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:18.769
 a huge scope for a free, artistically creative self-development 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.229
 on 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.939
 our clients profit and lose 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.569
 one should look at the customers 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.809
 especially for self-employment 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.789
 then there can be Obama 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.649
 «Everything you want to do what you change 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.179
 own 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.059
 that had to be too 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.969
 if you do that we include representatives additionally taking that 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.159
 Water right per cent 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.969
 the big challenge but also the big plus said a mega one on it 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.109
 being prepared in Strasbourg 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.509
 finished later and works alone as well as no other side nothing 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.499
 make one morning early by 10 percent minimized 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.499
 at 6 pm from the ground without a dot 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.219
 Experimental Mind Creativity and perseverance are the study of 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.809
 asked for free art 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.939
 So who you have to be in the end 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.169
 can vary 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.609
 those in which are now attached to their future value we do not think 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.129
 necessarily always immediately implementable 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.559
 you go gone 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:21.479
 Well visited 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:25.609
 That's what Crafter does not always do right away at the first time company 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.609
 actually sounds the standard processes more tense search must 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.989
 to find for it 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.790
 how to put it that way or how to be that technical that you represent 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.489
 would like to 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.359
 for that you have to have a certain shape 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.139
 Guntersdorf bets 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.919
 creative head of the 40 percent filigree and not at the time too 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.949
 the fun of the thing Chapman I may 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.319
 think us over 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.389
 your own vision 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.389
 Phnom Penh floods the reason 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.309
 So I think that you should not expect it 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:02.849
 At the beginning of the study, the painting star becomes the art scene 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.259
 At some point on the front page of Ortner of course, that life on 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:10.569
 Very good even their basic education is with the one actually everything 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.029
 do 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:15.639
 So there are artists who have studied here not so Nufer exercise 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.709
 the simplest creative potential require mouth 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.100
 Flexibility and that is what you have unlearned you learn very well 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.099
 think independently and engage in tourism topics 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:33.059
 and percent so argue and his attitude 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.689
 somehow make it clear and 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:39.719
 the us court what you call a claim when i live my life just fine 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.210
 can use 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.400
 insofar 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.530
 Start plants in connection with the studies
