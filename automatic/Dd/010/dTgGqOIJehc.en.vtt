don't i truly personally believe that
there's<00:04:01.140> no<00:04:01.260> such<00:04:01.440> thing<00:04:01.620> as<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.860> wrong

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
anything because if it were the wrong

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.060 
anything because if it were the wrong
something<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.290> wouldn't<00:04:04.470> have<00:04:04.560> happened<00:04:04.860> I'm

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
something it wouldn't have happened I'm

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.900 
something it wouldn't have happened I'm
the<00:04:05.220> kind<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.400> person<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.610> believes

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
the kind of person that believes

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.580 
the kind of person that believes
everything<00:04:06.570> happens<00:04:06.930> for<00:04:07.049> a<00:04:07.110> reason

everything happens for a reason
I<00:04:07.620> think<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.370> big<00:04:08.700> message<00:04:09.090> from<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.420> is

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
I think the big message from that is

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.720 
I think the big message from that is
that<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.959> are<00:04:10.110> your<00:04:10.260> own<00:04:10.290> person<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.980> your

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
that you are your own person and your

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.759 
that you are your own person and your

history doesn't have to tell you who
that<00:04:13.890> is

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
that is
