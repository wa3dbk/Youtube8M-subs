today<00:00:06.810> our<00:00:06.839> lesson<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.710> how<00:00:08.309> do<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.519> write<00:00:08.790> a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
today our lesson is how do I write a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.589 
today our lesson is how do I write a
number<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.450> expanded<00:00:10.200> form<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:11.450> order<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.509> be

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
number in expanded form in order to be

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.209 
number in expanded form in order to be
able<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.900> write<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> number<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.620> expanded<00:00:14.190> form

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
able to write a number in expanded form

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.420 
able to write a number in expanded form
you<00:00:15.059> must<00:00:15.179> first<00:00:15.570> understand<00:00:16.289> how<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.130> find

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
you must first understand how to find

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.920 
you must first understand how to find
the<00:00:17.550> value<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.119> number

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.839 

this<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.110> little<00:00:25.380> review<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.740> finding<00:00:26.460> value

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
this is a little review on finding value

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.420 
this is a little review on finding value
and<00:00:27.119> remember<00:00:28.110> that<00:00:28.259> value<00:00:28.710> represents<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
and remember that value represents the

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.179 
and remember that value represents the
work<00:00:29.610> of<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.570> number<00:00:30.750> based<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.680> place<00:00:31.980> that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
work of a number based on the place that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.150 
work of a number based on the place that
it<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.570> look<00:00:33.720> at<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.930> number

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
it is in so if we look at this number

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
it is in so if we look at this number
432<00:00:35.160> which<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.699> a<00:00:35.730> very<00:00:36.000> basic<00:00:36.239> number<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:37.710> can

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
432 which is a very basic number we can

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.950 
432 which is a very basic number we can
see<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.340> 4<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.239> that's<00:00:39.720> in<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
see that the 4 is in the that's in the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.470 
see that the 4 is in the that's in the
hundreds<00:00:40.260> place<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.280> has<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> value<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:42.000> four

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
hundreds place so it has a value of four

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.549 
hundreds place so it has a value of four
hundred<00:00:42.660> four<00:00:43.260> times<00:00:43.589> 100<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> 400<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.379> I<00:00:46.379> only

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
hundred four times 100 is 400 and I only

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.110 
hundred four times 100 is 400 and I only
collect<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.010> my<00:00:47.100> students<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.640> think

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
collect this for my students to think

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
collect this for my students to think
about<00:00:48.390> how<00:00:48.660> much<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.019> would<00:00:49.199> be<00:00:49.290> giving<00:00:49.650> them<00:00:49.830> if

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
about how much I would be giving them if

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.570 
about how much I would be giving them if
I<00:00:50.250> gave<00:00:50.430> them<00:00:50.610> money<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.150> a<00:00:51.360> number<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
I gave them money for a number so to

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.759 
I gave them money for a number so to
find<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> expanded<00:00:57.449> form<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.869> number<00:00:57.989> we

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
find the expanded form of a number we

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.710 
find the expanded form of a number we
simply<00:00:59.159> write<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.489> value<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.059> each

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
simply write the value of each

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.990 
simply write the value of each
individual<00:01:01.530> digit<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.850> get<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
individual digit and this can get a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.190 
individual digit and this can get a
little<00:01:03.089> long<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.659> you<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.930> big<00:01:04.170> numbers<00:01:04.350> here

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.200 

I<00:01:10.200> took<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> number<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:11.430> hundred<00:01:11.790> seventy

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
I took the number one hundred seventy

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.359 
I took the number one hundred seventy
two<00:01:12.240> thousand<00:01:12.930> six<00:01:13.290> hundred<00:01:13.439> thirty-nine<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
two thousand six hundred thirty-nine and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.510 
two thousand six hundred thirty-nine and
I<00:01:15.330> wrote<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> value<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.200> each<00:01:16.320> digit<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:17.280> one

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
I wrote the value of each digit the one

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.800 
I wrote the value of each digit the one
in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.760> hundred<00:01:18.030> thousands<00:01:18.390> place<00:01:18.570> has<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
in the hundred thousands place has a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.620 
in the hundred thousands place has a
value<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.380> hundred<00:01:19.710> thousand<00:01:20.390> seven<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
value of a hundred thousand seven and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.350 
value of a hundred thousand seven and
the<00:01:21.869> ten<00:01:22.080> thousand<00:01:22.470> Spice<00:01:22.680> has<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> value<00:01:23.220> of

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
the ten thousand Spice has a value of

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.720 
the ten thousand Spice has a value of
70,000<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.560> two<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.950> thousands<00:01:26.460> two

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
70,000 the two of the thousands two

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.990 
70,000 the two of the thousands two
thousand<00:01:27.240> six<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.110> hundred<00:01:28.380> six<00:01:28.650> hundred

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
thousand six and one hundred six hundred

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.480 
thousand six and one hundred six hundred
three<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.120> the<00:01:30.210> tens<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.690> 30<00:01:31.050> and<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:32.130> nine<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
three and the tens is 30 and a nine and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.460 
three and the tens is 30 and a nine and
the<00:01:32.550> ones<00:01:32.760> is<00:01:33.000> nine<00:01:33.300> and<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.140> these<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the ones is nine and so these are the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.020 
the ones is nine and so these are the
values<00:01:34.620> of<00:01:34.920> each<00:01:35.010> digit

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.670 

after<00:01:43.030> writing<00:01:43.210> values<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:44.110> must<00:01:44.320> remember

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
after writing values you must remember

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.039 
after writing values you must remember
to<00:01:45.159> place<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.970> symbol<00:01:46.180> for<00:01:46.479> addition<00:01:46.570> in<00:01:46.960> the

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
to place the symbol for addition in the

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.320 
to place the symbol for addition in the
spaces<00:01:47.560> between<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:48.010> numbers<00:01:48.430> so<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.180> can

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
spaces between the numbers so you can

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.660 
spaces between the numbers so you can
see<00:01:49.510> I<00:01:49.540> rewrote<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.050> here<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:50.680> added<00:01:51.490> my

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
see I rewrote it here and added my

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.850 
see I rewrote it here and added my
symbol<00:01:52.030> for<00:01:52.150> addition<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:53.229> that<00:01:53.380> now<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.680> looks

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
symbol for addition so that now it looks

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.399 
symbol for addition so that now it looks
like<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:54.250> long<00:01:54.490> addition<00:01:55.090> problem<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.720> hundred

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
like a long addition problem a hundred

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.320 
like a long addition problem a hundred
thousand<00:01:56.830> plus<00:01:56.920> seventy<00:01:57.460> thousand<00:01:57.909> plus<00:01:58.119> two
