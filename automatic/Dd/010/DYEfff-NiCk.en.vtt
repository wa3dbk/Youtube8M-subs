00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.039 
knee so I can film what you want to do
is<00:01:52.860> take<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.340> controller<00:01:53.850> put<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:54.720> thumbs

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
is take the controller put your thumbs

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.770 
is take the controller put your thumbs
on<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.979> sticks<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.610> get<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.600> your

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
on the sticks I get like your

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.010 
on the sticks I get like your
fingernails<00:01:58.259> around<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.219> edge<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
fingernails around the edge like it the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.080 
fingernails around the edge like it the
controllers<00:02:01.590> two<00:02:01.770> halves<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.030> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
controllers two halves so and if you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.730 
controllers two halves so and if you
push<00:02:03.329> down<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.869> thumb<00:02:04.049> sticks<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.530> lift

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
push down on the thumb sticks and lift

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.520 
push down on the thumb sticks and lift
up<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.490> crease<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.939> controller

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
up like on the crease of the controller

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.219 
up like on the crease of the controller
you<00:02:07.530> should<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.369> able<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:09.090> pop<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.720> open<00:02:09.869> and

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
you should be able to pop it open and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.770 
you should be able to pop it open and
now<00:02:10.379> once<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.979> got<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.340> initial<00:02:11.910> pop<00:02:12.150> you'll

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
now once you got the initial pop you'll

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.000 
now once you got the initial pop you'll
notice<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.200> like

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
notice that like

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.710 
notice that like
I<00:02:14.040> could<00:02:14.280> lift<00:02:14.459> this<00:02:14.610> off<00:02:14.879> right<00:02:15.150> now<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.450> top

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
I could lift this off right now the top

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.960 
I could lift this off right now the top
off<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:17.040> all<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.310> buttons<00:02:17.640> don't<00:02:17.879> go

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
off and so all the buttons don't go

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.580 
off and so all the buttons don't go
flying<00:02:18.209> everywhere<00:02:18.480> what<00:02:19.079> you<00:02:19.170> want<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.349> do<00:02:19.409> is

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
flying everywhere what you want to do is

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.030 
flying everywhere what you want to do is
flip<00:02:20.189> it<00:02:20.370> over<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.180> then<00:02:21.920> well<00:02:22.920> actually

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
flip it over and then well actually

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.319 
flip it over and then well actually
actually<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.299> just<00:02:24.480> pop<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.110> off<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:27.090> now

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
actually you can just pop it off so now

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.179 
actually you can just pop it off so now
you<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.569> pop<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:28.019> off<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.409> this<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.010> the

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
you just pop it off like this and the

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.979 
you just pop it off like this and the
buttons<00:02:29.549> will<00:02:29.939> go<00:02:30.090> flying<00:02:30.269> but<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.780> does

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
buttons will go flying but it does

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.720 
buttons will go flying but it does
really<00:02:31.200> matter<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.099> you<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.370> remove

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
really matter so you can just remove

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.960 
really matter so you can just remove
those<00:02:32.970> buttons<00:02:33.390> off<00:02:33.629> to<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.500> side<00:02:34.769> take<00:02:35.700> off

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
those buttons off to the side take off

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.660 
those buttons off to the side take off
this<00:02:37.700> but<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.909> is<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.510> little<00:02:40.379> button<00:02:41.190> pushing

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
this but this is a little button pushing

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.149 
this but this is a little button pushing
thing<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.180> now<00:02:42.659> you<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.650> controller

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
thing and now you have the controller

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:50.630 
thing and now you have the controller
the<00:02:44.879> joysticks<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:46.400> pop<00:02:47.400> off<00:02:48.739> also<00:02:49.739> you

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the joysticks can just pop off also you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.199 
the joysticks can just pop off also you
can<00:02:50.670> take<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.180> out<00:02:51.329> of<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.780> actual<00:02:52.230> case<00:02:53.209> let

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
can take it out of the actual case let

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.129 
can take it out of the actual case let
me<00:02:54.299> just<00:02:54.450> put<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:54.629> back<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:54.959> here<00:02:55.139> for<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.349> second

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
me just put it back in here for a second

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.009 
me just put it back in here for a second
so<00:02:58.139> you<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.530> actually<00:02:58.560> take<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.720> PCB<00:03:00.720> board

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
so you can actually take the PCB board

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.069 
so you can actually take the PCB board
which<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.799> green<00:03:01.980> thing<00:03:02.280> out<00:03:02.849> by<00:03:03.239> pushing

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
which is the green thing out by pushing

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.660 
which is the green thing out by pushing
in<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.500> triggers<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.040> then<00:03:05.129> just<00:03:05.220> pulling<00:03:05.519> on

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
in the triggers and then just pulling on

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.970 
in the triggers and then just pulling on
it<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.599> can<00:03:06.780> take<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.170> joysticks<00:03:07.709> off

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
it and you can take the joysticks off

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.250 
it and you can take the joysticks off
just<00:03:08.310> by<00:03:08.459> pulling<00:03:08.760> on<00:03:09.060> them<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.569> little<00:03:09.989> bit<00:03:10.170> of

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
just by pulling on them a little bit of

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.190 
just by pulling on them a little bit of
force<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.859> they<00:03:11.549> will<00:03:11.790> come<00:03:12.000> off<00:03:12.269> so<00:03:13.019> now<00:03:13.139> you

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
force and they will come off so now you

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.640 
force and they will come off so now you
have<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.500> bear<00:03:14.010> xbox<00:03:14.700> controller<00:03:15.389> as<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.470> can

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
have the bear xbox controller as you can

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.619 
have the bear xbox controller as you can
see<00:03:16.859> it's<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.099> a<00:03:17.280> normal<00:03:17.459> xbox<00:03:17.790> controller
