the storms tonight again for the

this<00:02:26.459> afternoon<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.120> Sun<00:02:27.360> pops<00:02:27.599> out<00:02:27.870> we

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
this afternoon and the Sun pops out we

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.330 
this afternoon and the Sun pops out we
think<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.379> that<00:02:28.409> will<00:02:28.590> make<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> air<00:02:28.980> fairly

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
think and that will make the air fairly

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.399 
think and that will make the air fairly
unstable<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.180> when<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> next<00:02:31.019> shortwave

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
unstable so when the next shortwave

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.720 
unstable so when the next shortwave
comes<00:02:31.709> through<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.069> will<00:02:32.159> kick<00:02:32.340> off<00:02:32.489> more

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
comes through that will kick off more

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.490 
comes through that will kick off more
storms<00:02:33.120> tonight<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.540> better<00:02:33.750> chance<00:02:34.110> tonight

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
storms tonight the better chance tonight

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.589 
storms tonight the better chance tonight
should<00:02:35.280> be<00:02:35.430> over<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.849> southern<00:02:36.180> half<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.540> the

should be over the southern half of the
state<00:02:37.430> tomorrow<00:02:38.430> got<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.879> slight<00:02:39.209> risk<00:02:39.590> over<00:02:40.590> a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
state tomorrow got a slight risk over a

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.490 
state tomorrow got a slight risk over a
large<00:02:41.069> part<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.489> deep<00:02:41.640> south<00:02:42.500> Longview

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
Texas all the way to Macon Georgia and

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.380 
Texas all the way to Macon Georgia and
we<00:02:46.890> are<00:02:46.920> concerned<00:02:47.609> that<00:02:47.790> there<00:02:48.030> will<00:02:48.150> be<00:02:48.180> an

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
we are concerned that there will be an

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.119 
we are concerned that there will be an
enhanced<00:02:48.930> risk<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.379> there<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.650> again<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.859> can

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
enhanced risk in there and again you can

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.470 
enhanced risk in there and again you can
see<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.549> 30%<00:02:50.910> circle<00:02:51.720> running<00:02:52.590> from<00:02:52.769> roughly

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
see that 30% circle running from roughly

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.280 
see that 30% circle running from roughly
Longview<00:02:54.480> Texas<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:55.609> Nashville<00:02:56.609> and

Longview Texas to Nashville and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.190 
Longview Texas to Nashville and
Birmingham<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:59.540> within<00:03:00.540> there<00:03:00.900> inevitably

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
Birmingham and within there inevitably

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.960 
Birmingham and within there inevitably
there<00:03:01.650> will<00:03:01.739> be<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.890> moderate<00:03:02.430> risk<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:02.879> there

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
there will be a moderate risk and there

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.729 
there will be a moderate risk and there
might<00:03:03.120> even<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.450> high<00:03:03.690> risk<00:03:03.959> depending<00:03:04.590> on

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
might even be a high risk depending on

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.520 
might even be a high risk depending on
how<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.950> mesoscale<00:03:05.400> features<00:03:05.640> play<00:03:06.239> out<00:03:06.530> the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
how the mesoscale features play out the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.349 
how the mesoscale features play out the
event<00:03:07.920> will<00:03:08.069> initially<00:03:08.519> begin<00:03:08.849> to<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.120> west

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
event will initially begin to the west

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.030 
event will initially begin to the west
and<00:03:09.599> then<00:03:09.690> move<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.049> here<00:03:10.260> tomorrow<00:03:10.799> night

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
and then move in here tomorrow night

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.069 
and then move in here tomorrow night
late<00:03:11.579> tomorrow<00:03:11.849> night<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.540> I'll<00:03:12.659> say<00:03:12.900> this

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
late tomorrow night and I'll say this

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.670 
late tomorrow night and I'll say this
the<00:03:13.260> latest<00:03:13.590> GFS<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.459> definitely<00:03:15.120> slower

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
the latest GFS is definitely slower

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.770 
the latest GFS is definitely slower
really<00:03:16.680> suggesting<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.400> will<00:03:17.549> be<00:03:17.700> well<00:03:18.450> after

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
really suggesting it will be well after

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.280 
really suggesting it will be well after
midnight<00:03:19.169> maybe<00:03:19.560> into<00:03:19.859> Saturday<00:03:20.250> morning<00:03:20.280> and

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
midnight maybe into Saturday morning and

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.960 
midnight maybe into Saturday morning and
then<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.380> day<00:03:22.590> three<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:22.980> risk<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.609> from

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
then on day three the risk is from

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.370 
then on day three the risk is from
Alabama<00:03:24.720> on<00:03:25.109> east<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:27.480> enhanced<00:03:27.959> look

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
Alabama on east and the enhanced look

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.470 
Alabama on east and the enhanced look
there<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.739> 30%<00:03:29.370> circle<00:03:29.730> covers<00:03:30.090> much<00:03:30.299> of<00:03:30.329> the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
there the 30% circle covers much of the

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.800 
there the 30% circle covers much of the
eastern<00:03:30.959> half<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.290> Alabama<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.150> we're

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
eastern half of Alabama so we're

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.270 
eastern half of Alabama so we're
beginning<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.230> think<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.650> window<00:03:34.980> might<00:03:35.250> be

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
beginning to think the window might be

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.720 
beginning to think the window might be
midnight<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.419> noon<00:03:37.160> midnight<00:03:38.160> Friday<00:03:38.459> night

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
to noon Saturday for this big threat as

to noon Saturday for this big threat as

in<00:03:49.440> North<00:03:49.650> Shelby<00:03:50.010> County<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:51.180> far<00:03:51.209> let's<00:03:51.780> tack

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
in North Shelby County so far let's tack

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.830 
in North Shelby County so far let's tack
on<00:03:52.260> another<00:03:52.410> five<00:03:53.069> inches<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:54.629> again

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
on another five inches and so again

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.589 
on another five inches and so again
obviously<00:03:55.129> flash<00:03:56.129> flooding<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.819> then

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
obviously flash flooding and then

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.330 
obviously flash flooding and then
ultimately<00:03:57.780> river<00:03:58.620> flooding<00:03:59.069> will<00:03:59.190> be<00:03:59.220> a

ultimately river flooding will be a

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.659 
ultimately river flooding will be a

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
lifting out so we're gonna see improving

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.620
