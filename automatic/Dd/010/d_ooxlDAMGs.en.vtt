demonstrating its functionality for you

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.120 
demonstrating its functionality for you
first<00:00:12.780> i'd<00:00:12.960> like<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.139> start<00:00:13.440> off<00:00:13.559> with<00:00:13.620> what

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
first i'd like to start off with what

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.790 
first i'd like to start off with what
can<00:00:14.519> top<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:15.199> essentially<00:00:16.199> what<00:00:16.410> i've<00:00:16.500> done<00:00:16.619> is

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
can top is essentially what i've done is

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.980 
can top is essentially what i've done is
i've<00:00:16.920> written<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.220> program<00:00:17.449> that<00:00:18.449> taps<00:00:18.750> into

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
i've written a program that taps into

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.130 
i've written a program that taps into
the<00:00:19.140> car<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.710> pulls<00:00:20.670> off<00:00:20.820> information<00:00:21.539> that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the car and pulls off information that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.650 
the car and pulls off information that
is<00:00:22.260> pertinent<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.000> kind<00:00:24.570> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
is pertinent to the the kind of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.089 
is pertinent to the the kind of
functionality<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> car<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:26.039> example

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
functionality of the car for example

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.589 
functionality of the car for example

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
rpms miles per hour throttle brakes and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.490 
rpms miles per hour throttle brakes and
then<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.900> then<00:00:30.990> some<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.289> more

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
then and then some of the more

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.530 
then and then some of the more
interesting<00:00:32.309> things<00:00:32.790> such<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.270> voltage

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
like this that would be important for a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.270 
like this that would be important for a
plug-in<00:00:38.700> hybrid<00:00:38.730> conversion<00:00:39.770> as<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.100> see

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
from the original toyota battery and as

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.920 
from the original toyota battery and as
in<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.820> moment<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.240> I'll<00:01:48.329> drive<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.570> car<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
in a moment here I'll drive the car and

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.020 
in a moment here I'll drive the car and
you'll<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.409> will<00:01:49.590> change<00:01:49.850> as<00:01:50.850> well

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
you'll see that this will change as well

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.450 
you'll see that this will change as well
this<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> state<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> charge<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:53.280> is

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this is the state of charge here this is

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.940 
this is the state of charge here this is
a<00:01:53.490> graph<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.450> over<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> past<00:01:55.140> five<00:01:55.439> minutes<00:01:55.649> or

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
a graph of over the past five minutes or

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.030 
a graph of over the past five minutes or
so<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.320> see<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.530> remains

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
so and as you can see it remains

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.889 
so and as you can see it remains
relatively<00:01:59.520> constant<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.509> that's<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.869> course

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
relatively constant and that's of course

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.230 
relatively constant and that's of course
due<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.469> plug-in<00:02:02.100> hybrid<00:02:02.399> conversion

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
due to the plug-in hybrid conversion

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.780 
due to the plug-in hybrid conversion
this<00:02:04.020> also<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.040> another<00:02:05.130> graph<00:02:05.490> of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
this also this is another graph of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.149 
this also this is another graph of
voltage<00:02:06.149> graph

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
voltage graph

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.800 
voltage graph
that<00:02:08.090> will<00:02:08.239> track<00:02:10.269> then<00:02:11.269> these<00:02:11.390> two<00:02:11.569> buttons

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
that will track then these two buttons

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.440 
that will track then these two buttons
are<00:02:12.260> they<00:02:13.010> don't<00:02:13.160> do<00:02:13.250> anything<00:02:13.459> right<00:02:13.700> now<00:02:13.760> but

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
are they don't do anything right now but

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.660 
are they don't do anything right now but
eventually<00:02:14.629> they<00:02:15.230> will<00:02:15.260> integrate<00:02:15.709> into<00:02:16.280> the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.190 
I'm going to drive around a little bit
so<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.579> can<00:02:43.610> see<00:02:43.730> some<00:02:44.030> values<00:02:44.360> some<00:02:44.810> relative

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
so you can see some values some relative

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.580 
so you can see some values some relative
values<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:47.390> again

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
conversion and yeah the the throttle you

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.750 
conversion and yeah the the throttle you
can<00:03:03.140> see<00:03:03.319> is<00:03:03.440> changing<00:03:03.799> colors<00:03:04.099> based<00:03:04.340> on<00:03:04.549> how

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
can see is changing colors based on how

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.140 
can see is changing colors based on how
hard<00:03:05.030> it's<00:03:05.239> pushing<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.560> red<00:03:06.829> is

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
hard it's pushing and the red is

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.129 
hard it's pushing and the red is
indicates<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.299> I'm<00:03:08.450> exceeding<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.739> amount
