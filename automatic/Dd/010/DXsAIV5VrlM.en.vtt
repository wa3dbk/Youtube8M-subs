Hello. This is Kyeoung_eun Choi.

00:00:02.587 --> 00:00:04.646
I came to eat 족발 (pigs' feet).

00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:07.242
I will show you the pigs feet in a moment.

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:08.686
But what has come out now is.

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:11.987
I ordered pigs feet.  However the riceballs came out like this.

00:00:11.987 --> 00:00:17.752
And they gave me this plastic glove.

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:20.126
We are supposed to make and eat them (rice balls) ourselves.

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:34.303
If you look here, you can see they gave 
 us seaweed, pickled radish, sesame seed and rice.

00:00:34.303 --> 00:00:44.662
You just mix as much as you want to 
 eat (the rice right now is really hot)

00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:47.736
Ahh it looks delicious

00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:51.846
because I'm really hungry right now.

00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:57.346
I want to eat it right now because of its sesame oil smell.

00:00:57.346 --> 00:01:03.120
However much you want to eat, you can 
 make the rice balls that big. 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:13.974
But I think making them small so they 
 can fit inside my mouth is better.

00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:21.701
I ordered it half and half, spicy pigs' feet and non-spicy pigs feet.

00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:27.627
When I eat spicy pigs' feet, I eat it with this because 
 it is spicy, so I think it tastes good together.

00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:37.331
Shall I make some?

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:46.970
Its delicious.

00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:50.770
I will show you the pigs' feet shortly.

00:01:50.772 --> 00:01:55.120
The pigs' feet our here, pigs' feet.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.160
Taa-da!

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.650
It is half plain pigs' feet, half seasoned. I 
 ordered it half and half like this.

00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:03.750
But honestly normally when I order pigs' feet it 
 comes out like this.  Like this.

00:02:03.754 --> 00:02:05.460
This is what pigs' feet normally look like.

00:02:05.456 --> 00:02:09.990
and this, this is a special way that it is seasoned here.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.330
I really like plain pigs' feet too.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:18.470
pigs' feet look like this.

00:02:18.468 --> 00:02:19.510
It is extremely tasty.

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:22.940
This the most important part of pigs' feet.

00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:28.450
I like this quiet a bit.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.380
It is very tasty.

00:02:30.377 --> 00:02:41.200
This is how you eat it, you are supposed to 
 dip it in sauce like this and eat it.

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:49.570
It is really delicious. It has collagen in it 
 so it is really good for your skin.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:03:00.910
And I am going to eat the pigs' feet with some Makoli.

00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:08.350
You have to shake the makoli.

00:03:08.352 --> 00:03:16.120
When it is well shaken it turns this color.  You 
 can drink it once it turns a milky color.

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:17.710
You pour it in a cup like this.

00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:33.410
Drink makoli and eat pigs' feet.

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:37.980
Its good.

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:40.090
Come eat with me next time.
