recoil<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.340> impact<00:01:12.240> I've<00:01:12.420> noticed

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
recoil on this impact I've noticed

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.789 
recoil on this impact I've noticed
there's<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> lot<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> stuff<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.619> shoot

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
there's not a lot of stuff to shoot

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.570 
there's not a lot of stuff to shoot
there<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.159> game

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
there in this game

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.749 
there in this game
focus<00:01:15.619> reduced<00:01:16.619> flinch<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.340> nice<00:01:17.520> on

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
focus reduced flinch is really nice on

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.249 
focus reduced flinch is really nice on
the<00:01:18.240> weaker<00:01:18.540> weapons<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.640> SMGs<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
the weaker weapons like the SMGs and the

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
the weaker weapons like the SMGs and the
full<00:01:22.259> automatically<00:01:23.009> automatic<00:01:23.520> assault

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
full automatically automatic assault

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.520 
full automatically automatic assault
rifles<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.689> bounce<00:01:24.869> off<00:01:25.020> target

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
rifles because you bounce off target

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.350 
rifles because you bounce off target
with<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.250> though<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> lot<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.240> one

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
with this though you get a lot of one

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.749 
with this though you get a lot of one
burst<00:01:27.570> kills<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.259> generally<00:01:29.100> am<00:01:29.189> NOT<00:01:29.340> bouncing

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
burst kills I generally am NOT bouncing

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.580 
burst kills I generally am NOT bouncing
off<00:01:29.909> target<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.290> that's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
off target with this so I think that's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.590 
off target with this so I think that's
kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.920> waste<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> other<00:01:33.360> two

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
kind of a waste and then the other two

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.920 
kind of a waste and then the other two
are<00:01:33.780> essentially<00:01:34.470> sniper<00:01:34.799> rifle

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
are essentially sniper rifle

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.230 
are essentially sniper rifle
proficiencies<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:38.220> go<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.490> two<00:01:38.640> attachments

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
proficiencies so go with two attachments

rapid<00:01:51.030> fire<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.540> gonna<00:01:51.720> make<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.079> gun

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
rapid fire is gonna make this gun

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.219 
rapid fire is gonna make this gun
absolutely<00:01:53.670> ridiculous<00:01:54.329> with<00:01:54.720> rapid<00:01:55.200> fire

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229

this<00:01:55.860> gun<00:01:56.070> reminds<00:01:56.399> me<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> FAMAS<00:01:57.270> from

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
this gun reminds me of the FAMAS from

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.350 
this gun reminds me of the FAMAS from
water<00:01:58.680> warfare<00:01:59.070> 2<00:01:59.250> combined<00:01:59.820> with<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> g11

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
water warfare 2 combined with the g11

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.530 
water warfare 2 combined with the g11
from<00:02:00.899> black<00:02:01.140> ops<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.270> good

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
from black ops it is really that good

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.880 
from black ops it is really that good
that's<00:02:04.020> why<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.140> want<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.409> guys<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.560> try<00:02:04.829> this

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
and let me know what you think as far as

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.300 
and let me know what you think as far as
secondaries<00:02:10.319> go<00:02:10.440> pick<00:02:10.679> whatever<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.099> want

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310

secondaries go pick whatever you want
I've<00:02:11.430> been<00:02:11.580> messing<00:02:11.730> around<00:02:11.849> with<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
I've been messing around with the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
I've been messing around with the
scorpion

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
scorpion

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.000 
scorpion
I<00:02:13.170> do<00:02:13.560> like<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.860> uh<00:02:14.480> was<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.630> called<00:02:16.010> mp412

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
I do like that uh was it called mp412

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.920 
I do like that uh was it called mp412
that's<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.670> really<00:02:17.940> really<00:02:17.970> good<00:02:18.210> revolver<00:02:18.780> too

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
that's a really really good revolver too

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.860 
that's a really really good revolver too
so<00:02:19.200> maybe<00:02:19.710> try<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.160> one<00:02:20.310> as<00:02:20.430> well

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
so maybe try that one as well

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.550 
so maybe try that one as well
secondaries<00:02:21.870> aren't<00:02:22.050> really<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> big<00:02:22.380> deal<00:02:22.500> I

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
secondaries aren't really a big deal I

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.610 
secondaries aren't really a big deal I
want<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> try<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.190> gun<00:02:23.630> for<00:02:24.630> lethal<00:02:24.810> I've

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
want you to try the gun for lethal I've

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.470 
want you to try the gun for lethal I've
been<00:02:25.830> using<00:02:26.010> syntax<00:02:26.370> bouncing<00:02:27.090> Betties<00:02:27.360> are

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
been using syntax bouncing Betties are

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.790 
been using syntax bouncing Betties are
kind<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.690> fun<00:02:27.870> because<00:02:28.110> they<00:02:28.320> kind<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.590> throw

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
kind of fun because they kind of throw

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.130 
kind of fun because they kind of throw
out<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:28.890> c4<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.790> could<00:02:29.910> pop<00:02:30.750> them<00:02:30.930> down

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
out like c4 so you could pop them down

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.990 
out like c4 so you could pop them down
on<00:02:31.320> an<00:02:31.440> objective<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.130> need<00:02:32.310> it

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
on an objective if you need it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.730 
on an objective if you need it
I<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.690> got<00:02:33.840> Claymore<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.380> I'm<00:02:34.440> gonna<00:02:34.530> try

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
I just got Claymore so I'm gonna try

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.410 
I just got Claymore so I'm gonna try
those<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.190> now<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.580> move<00:02:35.730> around<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.090> lot<00:02:36.240> though

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
those for now I move around a lot though

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.730 
those for now I move around a lot though
so<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:36.690> don't<00:02:37.080> know<00:02:37.140> how<00:02:37.260> effective<00:02:37.470> they're

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
so I don't know how effective they're

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.020 
so I don't know how effective they're
gonna<00:02:37.830> be<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> probably<00:02:38.280> go<00:02:38.340> back<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.610> syntax

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
gonna be a probably go back to syntax

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.330 
gonna be a probably go back to syntax
but<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.990> would<00:02:40.320> throw<00:02:40.410> semtex<00:02:40.710> on<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.190> if<00:02:41.280> I

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
but I would throw semtex on this if I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.200 
but I would throw semtex on this if I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
because I've noticed that ammo is so

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.170 
because I've noticed that ammo is so
efficient<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.710> weapon<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.820> get<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> lot

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
efficient in this weapon you get a lot

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.940 
efficient in this weapon you get a lot
of<00:03:00.210> one<00:03:00.480> burst<00:03:00.690> kills<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.410> don't<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.770> go

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
of one burst kills you don't you go

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.710 
of one burst kills you don't you go
through<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.220> lot<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.460> ammo<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:02.940> I've<00:03:03.480> noticed

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
through a lot of ammo so I've noticed

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.690 
through a lot of ammo so I've noticed
you<00:03:03.930> don't<00:03:04.110> need<00:03:04.260> scavenger<00:03:04.860> extreme

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
you don't need scavenger extreme

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
syntax and stuff faster but I don't know
that's<00:04:02.670> not<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.910> big<00:04:03.120> deal

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
that's not a big deal

gonna make you immune to flash banks and
stuff<00:04:14.100> like<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.459> but<00:04:14.750> it's<00:04:15.750> just<00:04:15.930> not<00:04:16.140> worth

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
stuff like that but it's just not worth

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.110 
stuff like that but it's just not worth
it<00:04:16.650> compared<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.310> what<00:04:17.459> you're<00:04:17.580> getting<00:04:17.730> from

it compared to what you're getting from
assassin<00:04:18.780> pro<00:04:19.020> so<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.560> would<00:04:19.830> rate<00:04:20.040> them<00:04:20.220> in

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
assassin pro so I would rate them in

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.120 
assassin pro so I would rate them in
this<00:04:20.700> order<00:04:20.850> assassin<00:04:21.299> pro<00:04:21.810> then<00:04:22.620> probably

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
this order assassin pro then probably

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.440 
this order assassin pro then probably
quick-draw<00:04:23.669> pro<00:04:23.970> then

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
quick-draw pro then

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.720
