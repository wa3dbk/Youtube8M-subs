00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
you could go to medical school there are

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.290 
you could go to medical school there are
only<00:00:21.800> about<00:00:21.980> 10<00:00:22.310> or<00:00:22.430> 15<00:00:22.520> people<00:00:22.970> that<00:00:23.150> were

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
only about 10 or 15 people that were

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.170 
only about 10 or 15 people that were
allowed<00:00:23.630> to<00:00:23.660> do<00:00:24.020> that<00:00:24.259> and<00:00:24.529> I<00:00:25.400> knew<00:00:25.550> right<00:00:25.759> from

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
allowed to do that and I knew right from

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.690 
allowed to do that and I knew right from
the<00:00:26.570> my<00:00:26.840> plebe<00:00:27.140> year<00:00:27.169> that<00:00:28.160> I<00:00:28.189> wanted<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.520> go<00:00:28.640> to

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
the my plebe year that I wanted to go to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.670 
the my plebe year that I wanted to go to
medical<00:00:28.910> school<00:00:29.119> so<00:00:29.750> I<00:00:29.779> had<00:00:30.439> to<00:00:30.529> be<00:00:30.649> a

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
medical school so I had to be a

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.799 
medical school so I had to be a
chemistry<00:00:31.160> major<00:00:31.369> and<00:00:31.790> did<00:00:32.029> all<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:32.419> right

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
chemistry major and did all the right

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.229 
chemistry major and did all the right
things<00:00:32.840> to<00:00:33.440> have<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.520> prerequisites<00:00:35.180> for

things to have the prerequisites for
medical<00:00:35.390> school<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.550> so<00:00:37.550> that's<00:00:38.030> what<00:00:38.329> I

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
medical school and so that's what I

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.200 
medical school and so that's what I
applied<00:00:38.719> for<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:39.350> luckily<00:00:39.980> I<00:00:40.010> got<00:00:40.430> in<00:00:40.760> to

in<00:02:03.350> refractive<00:02:03.890> surgery<00:02:04.090> research<00:02:06.009> looking

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
in refractive surgery research looking

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.910 
in refractive surgery research looking
at<00:02:07.159> how<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.579> improve<00:02:08.179> refractive<00:02:09.140> surgery<00:02:09.170> for

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
at how to improve refractive surgery for

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.890 
at how to improve refractive surgery for
the<00:02:10.039> military<00:02:10.429> warfighter<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.780> they

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
the military warfighter so that they

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.900 
the military warfighter so that they
don't<00:02:12.019> need<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.440> deploy<00:02:13.100> with<00:02:13.340> glasses<00:02:13.640> or

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
don't need to deploy with glasses or

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.729 
don't need to deploy with glasses or
contact<00:02:14.480> lenses<00:02:14.540> they<00:02:15.049> don't<00:02:15.230> work<00:02:15.380> too<00:02:15.590> well

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
contact lenses they don't work too well

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.000 
contact lenses they don't work too well
in<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.920> field<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:18.019> do<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.380> lot<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.620> research

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
in the field so I do a lot of research

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.900 
in the field so I do a lot of research
