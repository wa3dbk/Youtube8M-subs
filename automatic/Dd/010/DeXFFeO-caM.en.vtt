00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.340

 as for a survival I luther 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.290

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.060
 out a pvp ok but I would stay 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.810

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.220

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.540
 of an improvement and the penta nothing left me 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.430
 of itching or of following itching or 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.200

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.020

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.450
 as you see here would be the land that is 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.980
 as blue and is and is like silver the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.030

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.490
 will receive as a kind of land more 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.420
 ugly as mud practically and I 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.849
 I also like how it looks nice 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.880
 also the red chair this red chair 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.330
 here ok also several things ok to me 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.250
 I really like how the red one looks 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.030
 I like it a lot as for pvp it's very 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.030
 very very cool 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.480
 as I told you many things are from 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.390
 facebook and times ok cantalapiedra del 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.400
 chingona young ending 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.750
 they look like tiles like 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.250
 transformations that they used in dragon 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.650
 good ball in the arts tournament 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.990
 martial something like that look like you're ok 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.920
 I do not remember me well 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.630
 and another thing in the ice that the ice 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.069
 You see very very little I liked how 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.579
 remains 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.959
 little ice the ice they would be I think 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.340
 Most blogs also change 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.650
 some others but I do not know which one is 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.329
 very good of how to tell them which ones 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.519
 will change ok you discussion of that 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.620
 you check it I'm taking a lot 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.079
 speak forgiveness she hears that you 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.420
 check it out that's very good the truth 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.239
 it is like to worry how they see 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.370
 latent attitudes that the logo of the 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.840
 of the red patrol I think it's called 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.840
 well the red patrol speaks 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.100
 red I do not remember to tell you that 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.290
 saliendra with bolt give a bowl this 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.390
 dragonball no dragon ball z would be dragon 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.100
 ball yes I think it will be the red patrol 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.500
 the red patrol 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.660
 good also this the androids the 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.340
 18 and all those had this logo on 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.150
 some part of his clothes and I think so 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.550
 well that changes itself also some 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.440
 things like apple spots 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.300
 as you will see here is very very father 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.640
 Gold some hours and some items 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.230
 it looks like dragon ball but nobody 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.080
 because you keep listening to him 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.600
 because these checks more than anything else 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.530

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.750
