00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.980

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.300
 stillman nails to start us 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.580
 will need a base 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.250
 yves rock correction we will make 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:25.460
 white background on four of the nails with a 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:28.400
 white polish then on the major we 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:35.360
 let's go make a blue background I have 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:37.579
 chose the n Â° 14 from sephora you the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.329
 next we will need a varnish 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.470
 red 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.920
 so I chose the cradle 4.2 at 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.920
 Yves Rocher 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:57.530
 we will need a black varnish of a 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:02.540
 gilded lacquer and I took the spring 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.100
 always from yves rock and for 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:12.579
 finish as usual we will need 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:12.579
 to have an ice and a drying fluid 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:26.480
 and we will take as usual the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:29.370
 landscape brush is a new tool 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:37.170
 unique it was a marble tool and of 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:40.250
 his landscapes as usual we 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.250
 laid the foundation 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.520
 c 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.630
 we're going a little bit leblanc applied on 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.630
 every year it hurts 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.229
 this dear 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.340
 on the middle finger we will apply a 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.340
 fake blue 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
 m 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.540
 now we did a french 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.540
 always blue on the other flights 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.060
 going 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.760
 we will now draw a 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.469
 anchor on the blue background we run this one 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.170
 will take some air in white on the 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:12.069
 left and we will draw a line 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:15.609
 vertical or long center like 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.150
 this then he'll draw a little 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.150
 round above 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.610
 then he will draw very beautiful face 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.780
 like this now with a curve 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.819

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:58.810
 small of the small points on the 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:04:01.569
 edge on the lake shores or now 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.049

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.380
