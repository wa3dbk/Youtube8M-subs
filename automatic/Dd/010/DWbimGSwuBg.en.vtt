00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
cold water on one side public half of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.870 
cold water on one side public half of
that<00:00:33.180> cold<00:00:33.540> water<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.960> half<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:35.010> I'm<00:00:35.460> gonna

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
you can see bacon looks like it's the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.840 
you can see bacon looks like it's the
same<00:00:42.230> actually<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> did<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
same actually the one that I did not is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.510 
same actually the one that I did not is
the<00:00:45.270> cold<00:00:45.629> water<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:47.100> bit<00:00:47.250> more

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
the cold water on it a little bit more

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.540 
the cold water on it a little bit more
crispier<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.539> little<00:00:49.440> bit<00:00:49.590> darker<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
crispier and little bit darker and the

crispier and little bit darker and the
other<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:51.030> less<00:00:51.809> darker<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.680> they<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.520> not

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
other one less darker but they do not

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.410 
other one less darker but they do not
change<00:00:54.410> 50%<00:00:55.410> less<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:56.399> are<00:00:56.579> exactly<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
change 50% less they are exactly the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.189 
change 50% less they are exactly the
same<00:00:57.449> ones<00:00:57.960> look<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.160> -<00:00:59.750> well<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> call<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
same ones look at this - well I call it

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.210 
same ones look at this - well I call it
a<00:01:01.440> fail<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:03.030> does<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.300> work<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> be

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
a fail and that does not work so to be

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.850 
a fail and that does not work so to be
hundred<00:01:05.610> per<00:01:05.850> ship<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.470> hundred

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
hundred per ship so to be hundred

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.340 
hundred per ship so to be hundred
percent<00:01:07.890> sure<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.820> did<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.090> again<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.170> you

that<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.810> works<00:01:46.140> without<00:01:46.500> knowing<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.460> it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
that it works without knowing that it

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.530 
that it works without knowing that it
works

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
works

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.859
