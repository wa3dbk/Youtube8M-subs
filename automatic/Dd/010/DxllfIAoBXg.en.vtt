 currently silva 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.809
 will be placed more than four more than 400 teams of the American continent 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.829
 been from the united states and canada patagones 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.720
 this process team 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.849
 pharmaceutical industry, food industry and industry 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.410
 i cosmetic 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.230
 the great advantage but that we are using 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.250
 the construction of this machinery in China with an important cost benefit 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.020
 because how can it be possible that you producing something very confusing 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.710
 we are thinking everything under 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.070
 is not buying more debt in europe 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.490
 we are not using the 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.320
 high cost 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.390
 are transforming the field a productive place of value 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.210
 so 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.220
 Our responsibility has been to bring equipment that are manufactured in Asia 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.660
 but with European components 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.660
 to give a robustness our life a progressive force 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.810
 and this equipment to be translated into a productive process 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 results in a low production cost 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.740
 tim burton very fast version 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.750
 We have more than 140 clients 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.200
 this he realized that the text is convinced of it 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.090
 this principle 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.980
 yes really growth has been exponential because we are like one of 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.840
 the 20th of the second managed the third 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.360
 in argentina we have 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.580
 16 15 at this time 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.850
 within nine million dollars in the last two years 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.850
 inti is beginning to multiply exponentially 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.880
 for December 2009 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.880
 build a plant in the use of food 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.060
 the other two are an important effort to serve as a lesson 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.339
 which we can mount productive processes 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:10.449
 for what 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.169
 anyone who has federal vegetable fruits vegetables 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:15.809
 meat 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.469
 percent e 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:18.839
 at the bottom of the sea 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.489
 Come closer 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.849
 some test 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.879
 two tests three full tests on the computer and we can sell the 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.149
 push technology 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:33.060
 for us the credibility of the rocky productive world at pilot level level 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.269
 developing 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.549
 It is very important because 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.540
 this will give the farmer and the producer the certainty that it can be seen 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.449
 your product 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.669
 perform 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.939
 the fact of breaking the paradigm that this 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.379
 we do it the countries of the world 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.269
 in fact 15 we talked about the economy of the United States really these 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.389
 hospital of a transformer 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.179
 because they do not have 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.179
 they receive transforma added the rebels 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:05.180
 ee it might sound commercial because 2003 is selling plants 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:07.469
 but it happens to pp 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.739
 Miguel is the ideal business profile when focusing on the combination of 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.659
 benefit 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.789
 with the benefit of all 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.939
 and if the client's benefit is his own and the decision was highlighted 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.369
 consumer 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.719
 despite everything we are 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.999
 hiro requests the fruit of the evil fruit of the earth 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.589
 wait 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.659
 requires cold chains to be conserved 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.269
 and all this logistics of what is 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.439
 harvested 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.529
 until it is placed in the hands of the consumer 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:45.529
 pierrick girona a logistics chain that is k 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.860
 and it's uncompetitive because each part and being the women we have are 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.309
 old 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:53.499
 so 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.099
 that the location 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.099
 the reuse is a freeze 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.299
 that later 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.999
 to freeze 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.439
 it dries 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.439
 through sublimation processes 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.629
 Although the water has three states, the solid state in liquid state was 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:12.829
 sos 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.829
 we want a 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.030
 furtado a vegetable never risk by the sea 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.889
 if they have a liquid water content 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.849
 not only do we do skiing and in the place of connecting it to a race of 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.229
 Warm up valued by water 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.229
 which will be the foundation groups 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:35.360
 what we do is freeze 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.599
 and this liquid state and pass it to gas 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.960
 without going through the state lic again 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.120
 that's called an uprising 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.719
 spyker the moles what does it consist 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.669
 the location kiguel passed according to it will be a very expensive process because 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.110
 a square camera 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.690
 I received a certain amount of product in which freeze is applied high vacuum 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.590
 and sublimate the water by vacuum to leave classic ko 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:07.699
 there are two issues around this one are the benefits gave two ovens pos 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.120
 emerges from a data process 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.199
 in which the camera 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.279
 ii 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.749
 that is to say to make a process of 24 hours the decision 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:22.139
 In total around 500 kilos of product 24 hours 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:24.550
 a reverse 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.809
 thousands of square kilometers of land 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:28.789
 it is an unprofitable matter 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.789
 and that's why reuse has not been explored 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.610
 On the other hand, the benefits they have is that 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.050
 if you grab a raw 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.349
 wolf steel sublemas 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:45.460
 vitamins and minerals proteins amino acids 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.689
 everything is preserved 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.300
 in its natural state 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.999
 as the plant did not produce 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:53.029
 how the future produced 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:54.180
 so 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.720
 you are a product that really has everything personally is a product 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.039
 cool 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.849
 but very high eye 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.210
 because no bullet process 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.169
 very expensive traditional 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.930
 us what we have done 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.610
 I have gone to those who are not who invented it but we are the ones who are 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.680
 is promoting it at an industrial level 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.530
 separate this process 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.529
 stages 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.650
 then first we freeze 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.910
 iqms that is a very common process vegetables in meat 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:33.059
 the other two elements fast 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.059
 and they cite difficult 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:39.039
 then we left that tunnel 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.490
 the wind said 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.800
 we are going to a stage of 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.279
 ice stabilization 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.219
 a quarter highlight the 40 degrees centigrade 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:51.860
 we are already in trays with cars that are real through the roof of the 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.740
 of the sky of the rooms 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.220
 and we have a camera where you check purely cover your goals 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.669
 we discovered a process that swords 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:04.050
 of a semi-continuous process
