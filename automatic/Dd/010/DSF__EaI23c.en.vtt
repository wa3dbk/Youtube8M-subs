00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.190
 It's what I really liked the most. 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.380
 classes which is what I expected and that 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.209
 give this something really cool to 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.580
 teachers who brought a lot of 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.949
 content and I like most is to teach 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.259
 really go without a process that is 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:26.380
 They use passage for us, the people. 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:29.519
 can learn crean about your prediction 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.500
 of houses that already take on the great tragedy 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.520
 giants are expensive and names are the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.410
 people who will evaluate your portfolio 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.440
 this kind of give feedback a feedback 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.260
 very real sorry you'll have to 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.140
 to do an interview at the time is a punch 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.240
 in your house you enter there without anything without 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.390
 folder no sector at all and leaves there 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.740
 without knowing how to do this time 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:01.990
 A great one is a face that comes from outside like this. 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:05.379
 sometimes has a lot of base and does not know 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.410
 not even dark is any 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.450
 clean field and that we get into the 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:17.160
 but in actual briefings 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.160
 environment that is thus differentiated from 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.200
 actuality of 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.820
 that will be going to be propaganda that a 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.820
 time I wanted is watching today 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.210
 the domain folder with this then motor 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.330
 as I think 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.460
 according to him the folder that I in santa 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.870
 then I had to make a paste 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.970
 new 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.300
 it was on this basis that he succeeded 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.400
 entering the area brought a lot of new things is 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.830
 very different that they occupied in a 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.730
 paying more attention and was a 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.890
 very large change in perception of 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.840
 want to do things other than things 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.050
 I was cool, and when I 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.850
 I started thinking about winning your portfolio 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.600
 start improving your trade criterion 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.990
 generally 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:14.900
 and then the feedback starts to change in the 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:20.870
 beginning when you make an interview 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.820
 our role in Quebec's bad unites with there 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.280
 The time you will exchange no feedback 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.530
 will improve to do and redo all 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:34.610
 hotel portfolio and leave behind 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.370
 new equal opportunities independently 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.890
 on the nail and you come here with a sling 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.890
 plate on hear today and away from here.
