right<00:00:46.920> now<00:00:47.129> my<00:00:47.340> car<00:00:47.550> has<00:00:47.670> set<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.969> exactly<00:00:48.660> 24

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
right now my car has set in exactly 24

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:57.590 
right now my car has set in exactly 24
millimeters<00:00:49.800> from<00:00:54.800> well<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.070> example<00:00:56.610> an<00:00:56.879> SRS

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
millimeters from well for example an SRS

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.240

the<00:00:57.780> cactus<00:00:58.109> classic<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.649> year<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> grip

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the cactus classic this year the grip

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.939 
the cactus classic this year the grip
was<00:00:59.489> insane<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.989> we<00:01:01.140> ended<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.469> running<00:01:01.649> like

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
was insane so we ended up running like

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.020 
was insane so we ended up running like
20<00:01:02.489> millimeters<00:01:03.000> from<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.510> for

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
20 millimeters from there for

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.030 
20 millimeters from there for
which<00:01:04.750> is<00:01:04.870> going<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.020> keep<00:01:05.200> the<00:01:05.320> car<00:01:05.500> more<00:01:05.710> flat

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
which is going to keep the car more flat

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.130 
which is going to keep the car more flat
not<00:01:06.820> gonna<00:01:07.000> love<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.210> suspension<00:01:07.780> roll<00:01:07.960> as

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
not gonna love the suspension roll as

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.410 
not gonna love the suspension roll as
much<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.860> just<00:01:08.890> overall<00:01:09.370> easier<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:10.030> drive<00:01:10.210> on

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
much and just overall easier to drive on

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.390 
much and just overall easier to drive on
higher<00:01:10.630> good<00:01:10.900> conditions<00:01:11.410> so<00:01:12.040> what<00:01:12.190> are<00:01:12.280> your

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
higher good conditions so what are your

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.380 
higher good conditions so what are your
steps

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
steps

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.149 
steps
you<00:01:13.540> know<00:01:14.050> set<00:01:14.290> your<00:01:14.409> right<00:01:14.560> height<00:01:14.770> then<00:01:15.040> what

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
you know set your right height then what

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.469 
you know set your right height then what
do<00:01:15.220> you<00:01:15.250> do<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.520> change<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:15.909> from<00:01:16.120> lower<00:01:16.450> to

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
do you do to change it from lower to

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.719 
do you do to change it from lower to
higher<00:01:16.659> so<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.800> just<00:01:18.010> want<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.280> take<00:01:18.490> the

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
higher so you just want to take the

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.840 
higher so you just want to take the
callers<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:19.930> want<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.229> turn<00:01:20.409> them<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
callers you want to turn them to the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.910 
callers you want to turn them to the
right<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.780> would<00:01:22.930> be<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.320> raise<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.740> right

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
right that would be to raise the right

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.170 
right that would be to raise the right
height<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.369> you<00:01:24.430> want<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.640> turn<00:01:24.790> it<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:24.970> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
height and you want to turn it to the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.640 
height and you want to turn it to the
left<00:01:25.390> so<00:01:25.630> they<00:01:25.780> were<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:26.020> right<00:01:26.170> height<00:01:26.350> and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
left so they were the right height and

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.960 
left so they were the right height and
then<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.860> just<00:01:27.010> check<00:01:27.220> it<00:01:27.369> once<00:01:27.520> again<00:01:27.640> then

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
then you just check it once again then

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.160 
then you just check it once again then
once<00:01:28.240> again<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.510> just<00:01:28.570> lift<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.960> car<00:01:29.140> up

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
once again you just lift the car up

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.900 
once again you just lift the car up
about<00:01:29.410> a<00:01:29.470> foot<00:01:29.530> drop<00:01:30.520> it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
about a foot drop it

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.240 
about a foot drop it
give<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.840> suspension<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.410> little<00:01:32.619> top<00:01:32.830> you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
give the suspension a little top you

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.270 
give the suspension a little top you
take<00:01:34.030> your<00:01:34.210> right<00:01:34.390> height<00:01:34.600> gauge<00:01:35.070> make<00:01:36.070> sure

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
take your right height gauge make sure

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.920 
take your right height gauge make sure
it's<00:01:36.490> sitting<00:01:36.759> flat<00:01:36.790> on<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.450> table<00:01:37.630> that

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
it's sitting flat on the table that

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.140 
it's sitting flat on the table that
you're<00:01:38.080> setting<00:01:38.409> your<00:01:38.470> right<00:01:38.650> eye<00:01:38.680> on<00:01:39.150> just

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
you're setting your right eye on just

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.850 
you're setting your right eye on just

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
giving you the top up and down I have no

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.920 
giving you the top up and down I have no
play<00:01:42.280> at<00:01:42.430> all<00:01:42.550> so<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:43.000> means<00:01:43.180> it's<00:01:43.360> exactly

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
play at all so that means it's exactly

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.200 
play at all so that means it's exactly
24<00:01:44.500> millimeters<00:01:45.009> and<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.580> know<00:01:45.729> some<00:01:46.060> guys

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
24 millimeters and I know some guys

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.240 
24 millimeters and I know some guys
sometimes<00:01:46.690> will<00:01:46.840> mark<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.259> shock<00:01:47.500> collars<00:01:47.950> to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
sometimes will mark the shock collars to

I used the digital calipers every time I
rebuild<00:01:56.920> my<00:01:57.039> shocks<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.640> just<00:01:57.759> measure<00:01:57.940> out

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300
