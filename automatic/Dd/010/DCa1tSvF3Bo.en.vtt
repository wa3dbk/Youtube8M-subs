whatever<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.289> they<00:00:58.680> repack<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.250> another

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
whatever and they repack it with another

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.069 
whatever and they repack it with another
piece<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.090> don't<00:01:00.449> necessarily<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.050> to

piece so you don't necessarily have to
buy<00:01:01.260> all<00:01:01.559> six<00:01:01.800> characters<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.270> think<00:01:03.570> that's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
buy all six characters so I think that's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.570 
buy all six characters so I think that's

so<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.640> thought<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.090> was<00:02:21.180> kind<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.420> cool<00:02:21.569> and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
so I thought that was kind of cool and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.050 
so I thought that was kind of cool and
even<00:02:22.140> if<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.470> EU<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.099> exactly<00:02:23.520> G

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
even if it is EU it's not exactly G

even if it is EU it's not exactly G
Canon<00:02:24.480> or<00:02:25.550> in<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.730> movie<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.209> think<00:02:27.840> that's

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
Canon or in the movie I think that's

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.559 
Canon or in the movie I think that's
still<00:02:28.050> pretty<00:02:28.230> cool<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.980> very<00:02:29.610> very<00:02:30.060> very<00:02:30.269> cool

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
still pretty cool so very very very cool

was until a few minutes early when I was
looking<00:03:52.049> at<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.530> finally<00:03:52.769> know<00:03:53.010> what

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
looking at it that I finally know what

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.280 
looking at it that I finally know what
it<00:03:53.190> noticed<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.359> torso<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.870> champagne

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
it noticed that the torso is champagne

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.280 
it noticed that the torso is champagne
so<00:03:56.450> obviously<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.750> can<00:03:57.780> mix<00:03:58.139> and<00:03:58.200> match

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
so obviously you can mix and match

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.780 
so obviously you can mix and match
colors<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:59.040> doesn't<00:03:59.370> matter<00:03:59.549> if<00:03:59.639> it's

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
colors it doesn't matter if it's

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.940 
colors it doesn't matter if it's
champagne<00:03:59.940> or<00:04:00.299> silver<00:04:00.630> champagne<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.620> guess

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
champagne or silver champagne I guess

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.229 
champagne or silver champagne I guess
just<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.220> describe<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.760> it's<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:03.000> little<00:04:03.090> bit

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
just to describe it it's a little bit

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.650 
just to describe it it's a little bit
more<00:04:03.480> just<00:04:03.900> kind<00:04:04.079> of<00:04:04.109> a<00:04:04.819> kind<00:04:05.819> of<00:04:05.880> like<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.209> light

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
more just kind of a kind of like a light

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.160 
more just kind of a kind of like a light
gold<00:04:07.650> yellow<00:04:08.340> tint<00:04:08.760> it's<00:04:09.090> kind<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.299> flat<00:04:09.930> a

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
gold yellow tint it's kind of flat a

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.190 
gold yellow tint it's kind of flat a
little<00:04:10.470> bit<00:04:10.680> flat<00:04:11.450> flatter<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.569> guess<00:04:12.870> the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
little bit flat flatter I guess the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.509 
little bit flat flatter I guess the
color<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.560> doesn't<00:04:13.709> shine<00:04:14.010> as<00:04:14.160> much<00:04:14.310> as<00:04:14.430> the

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
color it doesn't shine as much as the

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.569 
color it doesn't shine as much as the
silver<00:04:14.850> so<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.450> hope<00:04:16.229> that's<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.590> good<00:04:16.950> enough

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
silver so I hope that's a good enough

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.560 
silver so I hope that's a good enough
