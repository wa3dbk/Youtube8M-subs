00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hi, I'm Eduardo RodrÃ­guez and in this 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.280
 video I want to talk to you about how to read the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.469
 mind of your pet the mind of your 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.860
 your animal's pet entertaining good 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.379
 because the animals are capable of 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.240
 think about having deep feelings and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.410
 experience emotions 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:27.099
 about spending quality time with 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.990
 your pet all you can time of 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.669
 rest with your pet and also a 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.280
 game time seems to change affection and 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:36.120
 tenderness some people think that the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.400
 animals can read our mind 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.410
 many times we have our pet 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.450
 I was able to make it true 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.800
 know your house all your dog read your mind 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.629
 Do you really believe 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.210
 Well, there are many owners 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.870
 who believe that your pet has that 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.810
 ability to establish a communication 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.910
 telepathic 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.010
 and in cats they can disappear 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.290
 for hours and yet whenever 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.000
 you need to have them there appear from 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.950
 suddenly and for example when when 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.520
 you are sad or depressed or defined 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.280
 always appears your cat purring and 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.870
 animal is a strange phenomenon that only 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.570
 It can be explained through some 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.730
 of mental communication telepathy we can 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.360
 We then do the same with 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.360
 they say 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.960
 They say the answer is yes Yes 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.880
 maybe we can communicate with them 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.000
 mentally but it takes a bit of 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.350
 work is clear not the conclusion is 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.380
 What if you try to communicate 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 telepathically with your pet you can 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 get it or maybe it does not depend on your 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.570
 degree of interest about this are going to 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.720
 also depend on your qualities 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.939
 psychic and from the hairs of your cat or 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.740
 pet dog but good in both cases 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.119
 it will be fun to try it safe and you 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.040
 will give the opportunity to spend time 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.930
 quality with your friend 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.710
 well let's see the steps we have 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.030
 what to give but I will say by steps well 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.920
 first have confidence in the ability 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.070
 indicates that you have to communicate 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.090
 with your animal and with you he finds forgiveness 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.850
 that you can tune in with your pet 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.680
 because we are all born with sensitivity 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.590
 necessary to make a communication 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.910
 spiritual with another living being so 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.940
 we have to have an open mind without 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.950
 cultural prejudices that all forget 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.410
 the thoughts that you can not what 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.140
 can you get believe me well second 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.300
 think of animals as beings 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.800
 same as you, some people think 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.290
 that animals are inferior beings 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.880
 that is not true do not think that your cat 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.860
 your squirrel dog or any other 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.050
 animal is inferior to you because it is 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.090
 different or smaller that is a 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.670
 narrow and limited world view 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.810
 so for example the bears that are 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.900
 smarter than us 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.910
 we are equal we are living beings well 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.980
 third get ready for meditation 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.630
 Learn to relax your mind a little longer 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.080
 concentrate, it's worth to let go of the 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.870
 hectic everyday life and spend about ten 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.370
 minutes in that intimate communion 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.830
 with you to say it somehow 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.269
 same before mentally tuning 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.630
 the others with I love you if you want your 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.140
 mind 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.120
 relax your mind fourth step look 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.739
 Fix your pet after 10 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.940
 reflecting minutes stares at you 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.430
 your pet ok and sit by his side and 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.470
 he contemplates his face fixed his eyes on her 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.750
 and try to share your feelings and 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.790
 deeper thoughts try to see 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.340
 what do you think probably you 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.430
 look in the eyes 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.430
 Observe the expressions that you put clearly 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.989
 or your body language is the beginning of 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.900
 communication the ability to observe 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.250
 the other one so that he feels a little 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.019
 strange because the cases observing from 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.760
 a different way and as you want 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.170
 know what you think you 're never before 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.840
 you've made it feel a little 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.269
 intimidated you you rather fifth step 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.849
 you have to be receptive to messages 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.349
 do not go thinking I'm going to say something 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.130
 because if you go thinking 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.680
 judgments that will tell you something 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.740
 bad we go in the open mind try 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.280
 see what it is that is telling you 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.620
 the first will be a greeting from your pet 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.570
 that you see what happens when you 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.560
 find in a state of true 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.480
 relaxation 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.800
 you can receive thoughts and 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.360
 feelings 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.570
 the images that comes in your pet 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.730
 the hardest part is getting to prevent 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.310
 that the beginning of communication is cut 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.610
 stay calm, quiet and open 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.590
 here has open mindedly let's go to 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.570
 try to imperative those messages 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.510
 that your pet sends you come from these 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.520
 places speech talks lee is the time to 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.230
 Stillness of communication but talk to your 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.710
 mind not with the Nahua tongue your mouth 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.970
 Be careful you can extend your hand 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.220
 and touch only the head of your 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.530
 pet because physical contact 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.150
 will facilitate better communication 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:02.370
 but moves your hand very clearly baleno 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:05.460
 movement is very smooth without being abrupt 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.320
 now make it like a perfect formulate 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.100
 a pretty simple question your animal 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.570
 and wait to see what reactions have 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.919
 but mentally agree seventh step 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.020
 Do not expect an answer only 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.970
 you just have to admit the 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.160
 answer of your pet do not ask 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.320
 if he is cheating you and then the 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.910
 your position just try 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.110
 perceive what you want to say and 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.910
 remember that cultural prejudices 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.220
 you are always throwing so 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.350
 try to get away those present recommended 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.500
 the dedication of Friday 10 minutes by 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.690
 at least eighth step if you practice 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.580
 continuously will facilitate and 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.100
 improve mental communication with with 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.289
 your pet and exchange messages with 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.360
 your pet is going to strengthen little 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.530
 It is clear that at first, as 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.110
 I told you maybe it feels a little 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.970
 I miss saying that you are cutting me 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.440
 the hour after so long that 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.789
 I've been here by your side now 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.430
 listen to me and feel a little 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.199
 intimidated and do not understand it, but if 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.240
 you do it continuously when 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.620
 you have already taken several times because the animal 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.360
 is going to say hey yes he wants 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.740
 communicate with me 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.000
 You are gaining confidence in the 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:16.710
 communication with that animal communication 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.270
 the exchange is that over time it happens 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.800
 that each establishes a relaxed talk and 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.919
 fun when you will also go 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.580
 understanding the best and worth and the 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:29.460
 ninth step the last one is the moment that 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:32.310
 well for when you've already had a 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.139
 small little talk with the animal is 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.439
 the moment you disconnect 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.360
 because pets are delicate 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:41.789
 feelings and are very sensitive so 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.600
 do not say goodbye in a brusque way 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:48.780
 from that moment to establish a 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.740
 a fun and enjoyable communication 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.180
 your animal quietly not saying goodbye 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.300
 you do it abruptly flat and you 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:00.450
 you stay because your little animal understands that 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.169
 you for you to him or her are the 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.919
 god of his 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.819
 its all ok then try 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.479
 fire you in a way that he 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:10.270
 like 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:13.450
 it has worked for you 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:16.840
 I hope it works for you and that you get 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.520
