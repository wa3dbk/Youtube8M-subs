00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:09.049
 the staff is there one more video and now 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.349
 all the traffic here and I decided to do 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.349
 this video 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.690
 showing 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.279
 For you who have no experience will 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:25.050
 start now starting how to proceed 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.060
 it is in traffic in the traffic jam 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.660
 many people are very afraid 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.100
 before even starting to drive the car 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.360
 of a transit situation such as 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.790
 proceed 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.239
 so we tried some situations that 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.440
 may occur or now show that the 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.800
 in front of you once everything is 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 bottled 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.570
 Everything is still, I'm here on a highway. 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.390
 The first thing I want to show you is 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.400
 next if I do not have much 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.840
 experience 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.030
 I'm going to keep my car in 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.549
 right 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:11.920
 right up because the left to the left is 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:16.329
 the major thoroughfare of the city and the right 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.620
 you keep the minimum speed leaves the 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:22.810
 free guides to make the 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:25.470
 overdrive and so I think that's all 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.240
 bottled up but I keep here 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.090
 distance is very important 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.020
 in case of bottling you keep 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.450
 distance 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.229
 I'm not stuck in that vehicle of the 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.570
 front 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.659
 differently as the state that 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.570
 truck ahead can realize that it 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.229
 is glued to that front truck 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.840
 if the truck stops for some reason 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.159
 car has no vision of the 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.210
 which is ahead of the truck a 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.850
 situation that the truck may occur 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.850
 brake the car to enter the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.390
 back of the truck and I here 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.820
 keep a distance here keeps 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.649
 a distance here must have more or 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.360
 less gomide sky day 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.360
 I will not be walking measuring one 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.430
 distance but with vehicle 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.439
 with bottling I'm keeping 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.879
 here about four meters to five meters 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.830
 front 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.240
 differently you can see others 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.490
 vehicles to the front 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.300
 that white car there can see that he 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.610
 it is adapted 2 paulo a span of the van and 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.040
 this one approaching the back of the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.950
 white car the distance of about here 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.540
 my biggest distance side 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.330
 now I'm going to send the march that 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.280
 I'm using here 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.870
 bottling or maintaining the second 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.360
 march 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.270
 Sometimes you'll fall and you 'll do this. 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.610
 walking only on the first gear 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.530
 I'm keeping the second because it looks the 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.040
 distance that such a vehicle from the front 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.640
 I'm not going to give it to stay there now. 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.310
 best 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.610
 now I played the third gear and already 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.540
 It's here from here soon for now you come from 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.050
 a car the car continues to maintain 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.050
 side 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.320
 and I keep this distance and I 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.300
 I try to base myself on the middle band and 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.270
 shoulder belt 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.090
 I keep it in the middle so I do not 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:38.860
 I'm over the track there and I'm going to keep 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:41.350
 here in the middle of the track that has now 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.350
 clear sky 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.740
 So this tip I give 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.190
 to bottle my here let's stop 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.190
 here again 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:05.740
 I keep here the distance keep 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.950
 distance since I can know what it is 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:12.220
 that the attitude I'm going to take involving the 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:18.520
 bus walked the first voice still 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:21.430
 at first I see here now 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.280
 and with this movement I give the first 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.740
 march 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.740
 what comes out bottle 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:38.480
 I will not go putting speed 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.480
 on the first gear 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.000
 I will not impose speed does not have a 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.810
 country space 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.080
 I'm in first gear and very 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.960
 be careful also to keep right and leave 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.780
 the space left here precisely due to 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.030
 to this here today biker 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.210
 completely wrong that a lady is 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.000
 a young woman on the grindstone the two without a helmet and 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.490
 helmet on the arm 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.910
 so when you stop the vehicle 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.440
 also try to keep a distance from the 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.110
 your car to the car that is at your 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.450
 left to keep a 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.620
 runner because motorcycle nowadays is a 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.590
 reality 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.389
 so you have to walk too 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.380
 distance from the vehicle to your 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.949
 left 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.380
 so that the bikes can pass between the 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:37.919
 your vehicle vehicle to maintain a corridor 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:41.060
 without this abel to take care is 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.310
 always looking at the rearview mirror on the left 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.770
 checking if they do not see any motorcycles 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.960
 Why do you throw the car to the left? 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.979
 and you can play the populated biker 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.310
 so I want to make it clear sky 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.310
 bottling 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.200
 You keep this distance in the 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.790
 least this distance 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.360
 come on 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.349
 bottom gear 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.340
 I'm going to make a right right conversion . 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.340
 to the right grows 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:20.969
 it's very important the distance 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:23.909
 keep your distance does not stand in the back 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.169
 of the vehicle in front of the vehicle 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.499
 front stopped 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.449
 Look from a distance and I'm holding on, I'm not 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:31.289
 calculating but would be four meters and 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.839
 5 meters 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.759
 see that car in front of 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.599
 know what puts it in the back of the 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.389
 bus 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:42.539
 This car is already trying to get in here. 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:45.529
 in front of me closing that attacked 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:49.439
 side there to rear 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:51.240
 look rests on that knowing the 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:55.199
 colÃ³n in the back of the vehicle 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:58.259
 the only one wonders why so many 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.180
 accidents because of that you have to walk 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:03.919
 pasted on the back of another friend to 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.919
 that here 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.840
 randy always keeping this distance 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:22.640
 Okay then this little video demonstrating 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:24.710
 how should you act in the case of 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.900
 bottling 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.110
 I'm going to get it out of the lake just to film. 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:34.280
 here is the distance and this car here from 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.630
 buses and you can see that here 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.780
 leaving a climb 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:41.150
 select and release the brake probably 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.860
 the bus will descend and he coming down can 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:46.340
 reach the vehicle that is here 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:48.560
 here with a high sony suffered the 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.780
 tie in front of that car that you 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.820
 shall keep the following distance to the 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:56.860
 that this little video for you a 

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.860
 hug to the football itself
