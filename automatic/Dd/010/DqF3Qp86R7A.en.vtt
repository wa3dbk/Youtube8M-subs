digital camo you can't have regular

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.229 
digital camo you can't have regular
stuff<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.770> know<00:00:40.829> that's<00:00:41.129> old-school<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:42.090> is

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
stuff you know that's old-school this is

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.860 
stuff you know that's old-school this is
new<00:00:42.450> school<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.710> anyway<00:00:44.250> basically<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.750> know

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
new school but anyway basically you know

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.440 
new school but anyway basically you know
not<00:00:46.649> too<00:00:46.829> much<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.129> say<00:00:47.190> still<00:00:47.789> got<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.969> stupid

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
not too much to say still got the stupid

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.260 
not too much to say still got the stupid
little<00:00:48.629> gun<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.110> clips<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> side<00:00:50.270> then

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
little gun that clips on the side then

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.139 
little gun that clips on the side then
you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.719> flip<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.860> guns<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.699> missile

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
you can flip out the guns and missile

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.840 
you can flip out the guns and missile
launchers<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.719> all<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.920> happy<00:00:56.309> little<00:00:56.489> stuff

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
launchers and all the happy little stuff

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.180 
launchers and all the happy little stuff
that<00:00:57.030> makes<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.480> pretty<00:00:58.320> much<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.739> plastic

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
that makes this pretty much the plastic

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.260 
that makes this pretty much the plastic
incarnation<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.000> death<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.550> from<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> top

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
incarnation of death and from the top

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.420 
incarnation of death and from the top
you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:04.530> how<00:01:04.680> much<00:01:04.739> wire<00:01:05.189> this

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you can see just how much wire this

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.300 
you can see just how much wire this
makes<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:07.380> does<00:01:07.710> work<00:01:07.740> pretty<00:01:07.979> well

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
makes it and it does work pretty well

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.690 
makes it and it does work pretty well
but<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.150> my<00:01:09.600> mind<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.380> key<00:01:10.830> gimmick<00:01:11.220> stuff<00:01:11.490> is

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
but in my mind the key gimmick stuff is

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.399 
but in my mind the key gimmick stuff is
really<00:01:12.000> more<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.860> robot<00:01:13.860> mode<00:01:14.689> sit<00:01:15.689> him<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
really more for robot mode sit him and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.820 
really more for robot mode sit him and
scatter<00:01:16.740> shot<00:01:16.830> next<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> each<00:01:17.640> other<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
scatter shot next to each other and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.870 
scatter shot next to each other and
compare<00:01:19.830> paint<00:01:20.130> schemes<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:22.610> overload<00:01:23.610> is

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
compare paint schemes the overload is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
compare paint schemes the overload is
just<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.450> much<00:01:24.600> more<00:01:24.840> unified<00:01:25.350> looking<00:01:27.829> where

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
just so much more unified looking where

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.499 
just so much more unified looking where
scattershot<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.670> pretty<00:01:29.939> much<00:01:30.060> all<00:01:30.210> over<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
scattershot is pretty much all over the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.719 
scattershot is pretty much all over the
place<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> bright<00:01:31.380> blue<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.070> silver

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
place with the bright blue the silver

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.990 
place with the bright blue the silver
the<00:01:33.000> gold<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:34.369> battleship<00:01:35.369> gray<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the gold the battleship gray on the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.330 
the gold the battleship gray on the
weapon<00:01:39.110> overload<00:01:40.110> pretty<00:01:40.680> much<00:01:40.799> sticks<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
weapon overload pretty much sticks to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.749 
weapon overload pretty much sticks to
earth<00:01:41.490> tones<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:43.380> looks<00:01:43.770> good<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
earth tones and it looks good I like it

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.819 
earth tones and it looks good I like it
the<00:01:44.880> only<00:01:45.030> thing<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.509> don't<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.619> color

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
the only thing I don't like on the color

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.429 
the only thing I don't like on the color
scheme<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.310> overload<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:49.049> tracks<00:01:49.939> the

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
scheme for overload is the tracks the

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.289 
scheme for overload is the tracks the
surfaces<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.470> them<00:01:52.799> are<00:01:52.979> painted<00:01:53.549> black<00:01:53.820> but

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
surfaces of them are painted black but

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.120 
surfaces of them are painted black but
the<00:01:54.420> sides<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:55.049> painted<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.680> mustard<00:01:56.100> yellow

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the sides are painted a mustard yellow

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.929 
the sides are painted a mustard yellow
that<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.350> there's<00:01:59.250> actually

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
that I just do not like there's actually

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.020 
that I just do not like there's actually
gray<00:02:00.329> pet<00:02:01.049> greyish<00:02:01.530> silver<00:02:02.040> paint<00:02:02.310> used<00:02:02.790> on

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
gray pet greyish silver paint used on

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.560 
gray pet greyish silver paint used on
the<00:02:03.960> figure<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.280> I'll<00:02:05.640> see<00:02:05.909> why<00:02:06.119> they<00:02:06.329> couldn't

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the figure so I'll see why they couldn't

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.889 
the figure so I'll see why they couldn't
have<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:06.840> done<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.890> grape

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
have just done that in a grape

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.589 
have just done that in a grape
instead<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.530> mustard<00:02:10.920> yellow

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
instead of that mustard yellow

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.020 
instead of that mustard yellow
transformed<00:02:12.599> into<00:02:12.840> robot<00:02:13.319> mode<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.400> only

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
transformed into robot mode the only

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.600 
transformed into robot mode the only
mustard<00:02:15.420> yellow<00:02:15.510> left<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.439> ABS<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
mustard yellow left is in the ABS the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.500 
mustard yellow left is in the ABS the
head<00:02:17.909> shoulders<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.110> forearms<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:21.420> a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
head shoulders and forearms and it's a

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.170 
head shoulders and forearms and it's a
lot<00:02:21.629> less<00:02:21.840> jarring<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.769> find<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.849> mode

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
lot less jarring I find in this mode

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.890 
lot less jarring I find in this mode
