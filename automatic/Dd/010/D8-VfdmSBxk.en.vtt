00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.410 

here's<00:00:09.240> another<00:00:09.360> example<00:00:10.100> y<00:00:11.100> equals<00:00:11.180> 3/4<00:00:12.180> X

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
here's another example y equals 3/4 X

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.230 
here's another example y equals 3/4 X
minus<00:00:12.900> 2<00:00:13.280> what

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
minus 2 what

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.680 
minus 2 what
with<00:00:16.820> that's<00:00:17.820> right<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.060> should<00:00:18.300> start<00:00:18.570> with

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
with that's right I should start with

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
with that's right I should start with
the<00:00:18.810> negative<00:00:19.230> 2<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:20.340> means<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.730> time<00:00:20.910> I'm

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
the negative 2 that means this time I'm

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.220 
the negative 2 that means this time I'm
going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.300> go<00:00:21.450> down<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.230> put<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.860> big<00:00:23.040> fat<00:00:23.220> dot

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
going to go down to put a big fat dot

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.720 
going to go down to put a big fat dot
next<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.320> want<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.560> think<00:00:25.740> about<00:00:25.860> my<00:00:26.130> slope<00:00:26.490> in

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
next I want to think about my slope in

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.089 
next I want to think about my slope in
terms<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.150> rise<00:00:27.360> over<00:00:27.630> run<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.740> need<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.980> go

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
terms of rise over run so I need to go

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.300 
terms of rise over run so I need to go
up<00:00:29.369> 3<00:00:29.790> into<00:00:30.360> the<00:00:30.450> right<00:00:30.630> 4<00:00:30.960> from<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.739> existing

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
up 3 into the right 4 from the existing

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.780 
up 3 into the right 4 from the existing
point<00:00:32.610> 1<00:00:33.360> 2<00:00:33.870> 3<00:00:34.489> 1<00:00:35.489> 2<00:00:35.760> 3<00:00:36.210> 4<00:00:37.130> I'm<00:00:38.130> going<00:00:38.310> to<00:00:38.370> take<00:00:38.579> my

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
point 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 I'm going to take my

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.200 
point 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 I'm going to take my
straight<00:00:39.180> edge<00:00:40.550> connects<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.670> my<00:00:41.700> points

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
straight edge connects to my points

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:56.200 
straight edge connects to my points
beautiful<00:00:45.210> line

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.869 

you

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.130 

all<00:01:01.600> right<00:01:02.460> let's<00:01:03.460> do<00:01:03.670> this<00:01:03.820> example<00:01:04.059> y<00:01:04.659> equals

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
all right let's do this example y equals

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.149 
all right let's do this example y equals
3x<00:01:05.500> plus<00:01:06.040> 2<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:08.140> first<00:01:08.409> thing<00:01:08.590> I<00:01:08.770> want<00:01:09.009> of

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
3x plus 2 now the first thing I want of

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.910 
3x plus 2 now the first thing I want of
course<00:01:09.369> is<00:01:09.700> my<00:01:09.909> B<00:01:10.150> value<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:11.320> easy<00:01:11.590> enough

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
course is my B value that's easy enough

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.800 
course is my B value that's easy enough
to<00:01:11.979> find<00:01:12.400> but<00:01:12.850> then<00:01:13.000> I'm<00:01:13.090> going<00:01:13.210> to<00:01:13.270> want<00:01:13.509> rise

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
to find but then I'm going to want rise

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.109 
to find but then I'm going to want rise
over<00:01:14.200> run

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
over run

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.120 
over run
notice<00:01:16.119> that<00:01:16.509> when<00:01:16.720> it<00:01:16.840> starts<00:01:17.170> as<00:01:17.320> just<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.740> 3

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
notice that when it starts as just the 3

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.350 
notice that when it starts as just the 3
I<00:01:18.460> don't<00:01:18.909> have<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.119> run<00:01:20.789> remember<00:01:21.789> I<00:01:21.820> can<00:01:22.119> take

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
I don't have a run remember I can take

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.380 
I don't have a run remember I can take
any<00:01:22.600> whole<00:01:22.930> number<00:01:22.960> such<00:01:23.799> as<00:01:23.950> this<00:01:24.130> 3<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.700> turn

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
any whole number such as this 3 and turn

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.120 
any whole number such as this 3 and turn
it<00:01:25.539> into<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.840> fraction<00:01:26.049> by<00:01:26.470> putting<00:01:26.680> a<00:01:26.890> 1

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
it into a fraction by putting a 1

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.330 
it into a fraction by putting a 1
underneath<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.909> 3<00:01:28.780> over<00:01:29.200> 1<00:01:29.409> will<00:01:29.860> give<00:01:30.039> me<00:01:30.190> that

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
underneath it 3 over 1 will give me that

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.109 
underneath it 3 over 1 will give me that
idea<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.270> rise<00:01:31.590> over<00:01:32.590> run<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.190> my<00:01:33.909> B<00:01:34.090> value

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
idea of the rise over run so my B value

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.779 
idea of the rise over run so my B value
hasn't<00:01:34.929> changed<00:01:35.440> my<00:01:35.890> B<00:01:36.100> value<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.610> still

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
hasn't changed my B value is still

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.120 
hasn't changed my B value is still
positive<00:01:37.060> 2<00:01:37.630> so<00:01:37.899> from<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.319> origin<00:01:38.350> I'm<00:01:38.920> going

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
positive 2 so from the origin I'm going

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.570 
positive 2 so from the origin I'm going
to<00:01:39.220> go<00:01:39.310> up<00:01:39.460> 1<00:01:39.759> 2<00:01:40.030> put<00:01:40.479> a<00:01:40.539> big<00:01:40.690> fat<00:01:40.869> dot<00:01:41.310> from<00:01:42.310> that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
to go up 1 2 put a big fat dot from that

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.210 
to go up 1 2 put a big fat dot from that
point<00:01:42.970> I<00:01:43.210> need<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.569> rise<00:01:43.840> 3<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.740> run<00:01:45.220> 1<00:01:45.520> 1<00:01:46.509> 2<00:01:46.929> 3<00:01:47.220> 1

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
point I need to rise 3 and run 1 1 2 3 1

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.149 
point I need to rise 3 and run 1 1 2 3 1
there's<00:01:48.940> my<00:01:49.119> big<00:01:49.300> fat<00:01:49.569> dot<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:50.319> need<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:51.009> use<00:01:51.130> my

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
there's my big fat dot I need to use my

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.469 
there's my big fat dot I need to use my
straight<00:01:51.789> edge<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.869> make<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.049> beautiful<00:01:53.319> line

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
straight edge and make a beautiful line

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:06.969 
straight edge and make a beautiful line
for<00:01:55.479> my<00:01:55.600> equation<00:01:56.140> y<00:01:56.350> equals<00:01:56.679> 3x<00:01:56.950> plus<00:01:57.399> 2

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.040 

let's<00:02:07.549> look<00:02:07.729> at<00:02:07.850> this<00:02:08.030> example<00:02:08.239> y<00:02:09.020> equals

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
let's look at this example y equals

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.360 
let's look at this example y equals
negative<00:02:09.979> 4x<00:02:10.670> plus<00:02:11.030> 3<00:02:11.650> what<00:02:12.650> value<00:02:12.980> should<00:02:13.040> we

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
negative 4x plus 3 what value should we

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.350 
negative 4x plus 3 what value should we
start<00:02:13.610> with<00:02:15.459> that's<00:02:16.459> right<00:02:16.640> I'm<00:02:17.060> going<00:02:17.300> to

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
start with that's right I'm going to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.940 
start with that's right I'm going to
start<00:02:17.629> with<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.870> positive<00:02:18.440> 3

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
start with the positive 3

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.449 
start with the positive 3
he's<00:02:19.190> my<00:02:19.400> B<00:02:19.610> value<00:02:20.560> but<00:02:21.560> next<00:02:21.739> I<00:02:21.950> need<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.160> find

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
he's my B value but next I need to find

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.850 
he's my B value but next I need to find
the<00:02:22.580> rise<00:02:22.730> over<00:02:23.090> run<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.620> thought<00:02:27.800> about

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
the rise over run have you thought about

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.860 
the rise over run have you thought about
what<00:02:28.190> we<00:02:28.310> should<00:02:28.519> do<00:02:30.130> yeah<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.700> need<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.630> turn

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
what we should do yeah I need to turn

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.050 
what we should do yeah I need to turn
that<00:02:33.080> negative<00:02:33.290> 4<00:02:33.769> into<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.250> fraction<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.030> I

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
that negative 4 into a fraction so I

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.839 
that negative 4 into a fraction so I
have<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.540> idea<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.959> rise<00:02:36.230> over<00:02:36.590> run<00:02:36.790> only<00:02:37.790> in

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
have this idea of rise over run only in

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.910 
have this idea of rise over run only in
this<00:02:37.970> case<00:02:38.209> it's<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.540> negative<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.650> we're<00:02:39.799> going

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
this case it's a negative so we're going

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.570 
this case it's a negative so we're going
to<00:02:40.040> fall<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.730> then<00:02:41.569> run<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.140> right<00:02:42.580> so

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
to fall and then run to the right so

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.300 
to fall and then run to the right so
again<00:02:43.819> my<00:02:44.030> B<00:02:44.239> value<00:02:44.269> hasn't<00:02:45.049> changed<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.799> need

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
again my B value hasn't changed I need
