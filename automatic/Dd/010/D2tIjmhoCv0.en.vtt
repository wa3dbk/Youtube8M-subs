00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 forces us to attack them ben gu and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.740
 sent today on the edge of attack 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.059
 and your screens here Moscow Spartak 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.599
 Davydov today is located on the left 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.510
 cool and number 55 igor lebedenko is by 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.029
 numbers 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:26.670
 now we will be with you all slowly 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.460
 yet Mauricio run very far 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.640
 the violent reaction of the stands hit the execution 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.170
 the ball hit the net 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.170
 but also from the other side 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.019
 Glushakov beautiful scoop throws 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.360
 the ball on the parshivlyuk is dangerous and here it is 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.829
 she is so Spartacus when it's finally 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.829
 managed to penetrate the penalty 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.530
 let's watch again was not 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.530
 here is an offside position 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.880
 and here krotov is of course absolutely 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.880
 one here is no one at all 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.690
 I appeal to colleagues 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.950
 if we have the opportunity 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.950
 no position 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.909
 it's yellow of course 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.369
 where they donated duffy is also not 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.740
 beautiful but for that it would be possible 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.719
 get and direct red now oleg 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.390
 Ivanov completely in vain, he went 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:33.930
 here to protect Davydov and right 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.600
 but it is an absolutely fair decision 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.280
 arbiter completely out of the blue 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.100
 red for unsporting behavior 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.380
 before broke the rules davydov 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.729
 the judge was next showed instantly 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.560
 yellow for what next does Oleg Ivanov 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:58.400
 this defies any explanation 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.400
 except to write it off as an emotion 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.870
 Windows in the attack at the Terek and the score 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:24.819
 becomes nothing 11 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:29.370
 we'll look at what happened here 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:32.069
 gear from the depth of field delivered 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.290
 very important emotional 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.800
 - and my sense of course is the moment of the daughter 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.520
 when the game was scored 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.520
 domingo 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.080
 two 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.080
 but 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.610
 from the depth of the transfer this time cost 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.640
 without the help of a Windows partner and 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.460
 hall what's here 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.130
 one with mccain false movement and punch 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.080
 under the crossbar on the creator row under 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.090
 the crossbar is brute force just very 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.090
 a strong beat 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.530
 so what 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.530
 and on events on the field 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.210
 cities 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.730
 we have one distance 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:29.100
 striker because you need not just 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.100
 turn this game over again 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.630
 Kama 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.760
 further penalty 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.500
 22 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.920
 everything is so i'm starting 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.530
 so the figure 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.690
 dry the abbot let's see and chance how 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.030
 it was 1 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.819
 here is a combination with kambarov and 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.750
 tropera panda glasses from 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.060
 absolutely one nobody i 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.780
 me to that would seriously prevent him draw 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.790
 22 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.780
 but that 's not all 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.520
 another 15 minutes of the match is 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.520
 in any direction all this can 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.070
 below went transfer 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.920

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.290

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.840
 at the base by the sword 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.939
 seed it was 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.990
 the tower lives 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.990

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.080
 IM married 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.780

 in most and lose again 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.440

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.770

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.910
 resistance not for falling not for 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.500
