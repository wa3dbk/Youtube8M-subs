00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello everyone my name is bad fame and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.490
 welcome to the metro with number 22 on 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.049
 channel of the person who told me this 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.880
 mini trick I'm going to put it is going to be the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.830
 first link in the description and with this 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.230
 I want to invite also people who believe 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.080
 if they have someone who has 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.910
 minister that I may be able to climb up on 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.410
 my channel for more people who see your 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.119
 channel of course I'm going to put the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.670
 description and good send me a message 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.160
 private that I'm looking at them so spec 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.930
 if they are not repeated or anything I upload 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
 without any problem but good and here 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.500
 I'm going to start talking to the minister and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.290
 I'm going to do now look what 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.120
 pointing it out half a half cursor no 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.649
 when you point, you get the line that and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.270
 when you point that part down there 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.940
 on the map here merci how are you seeing 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.300
 you can cross practically with 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.739
 any kind of weapon as you can see 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.660
 if they did not see well the one of the grenade 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.129
 likewise afterwards I'll repeat it well 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.230
 with the spear with the spear you can 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.969
 traverse the wall with yervoy wool 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.110
 showing different types of weapons with 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.390
 which it is what may be crossed 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.840
 this area is just practically in the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.949
 edge where is where you do the damage 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.080
 they see that it's like the bottom part 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.580
 as it is invisible as it puts you 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.530
 in that way as there is something there but it 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.900
 see that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.790
 there was some kind of glitch failure like 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.220
 these things are usually called in the other 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.200
 side is also exactly the same 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.960
 It goes on the grenade at night with 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.759
 anything after shooting the 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.130
 ink incendiary grenades pass 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.810
 equally the arch can also be 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.070
 to nail though they saw there that it put like 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.259
 that was not going like it was going to stay 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.729
 stuck on the wall but do not also pass 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.380
 you do not have to put it like it's going to 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.700
 move to the other side but if you 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.380
 It's like it's going to be stuck in the wall 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.960
 also it passes away and also 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.880
 it hurts on the other side is a I think that 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.429
 It's terrific mini trick that I did not know 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.320
 I had no idea about this and that 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.850
 I'm probably going to put I'm going to put 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.600
 to use in the games of when I 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.130
 goal 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.780
 there are many occasions like for example 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.759
 when they stay hidden there you can 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.380
 throw an incendiary grenade at a 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.659
 person who is camping or one of 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.280
 ink and it may come in handy I hope that 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.670
 you liked it and see you in another 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.670
 video
