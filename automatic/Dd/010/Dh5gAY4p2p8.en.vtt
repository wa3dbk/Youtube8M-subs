Gerard tankless water heater and what we
have<00:00:15.440> right<00:00:15.679> here<00:00:15.949> is<00:00:16.129> the<00:00:16.430> model<00:00:16.669> GS<00:00:17.539> WH<00:00:18.289> -<00:00:18.740> one

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
have right here is the model GS WH - one

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.460 
have right here is the model GS WH - one
now<00:00:20.150> what<00:00:20.360> I'm<00:00:20.480> going<00:00:20.630> to<00:00:20.689> do<00:00:20.900> is<00:00:21.079> I'm<00:00:21.259> going<00:00:21.289> to

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.400 
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go<00:00:21.619> through<00:00:22.070> the<00:00:22.939> proper<00:00:23.419> way<00:00:23.599> to<00:00:23.660> operate<00:00:24.140> the

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
go through the proper way to operate the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.890 
go through the proper way to operate the
water<00:00:24.619> because<00:00:25.339> of<00:00:25.580> this<00:00:25.699> tankless<00:00:26.420> that<00:00:26.689> does

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
water because of this tankless that does

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.099 
water because of this tankless that does
operate<00:00:27.529> differently<00:00:27.949> than<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:28.339> tank<00:00:28.580> water

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
operate differently than the tank water

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.079 
operate differently than the tank water
so<00:00:30.109> there's<00:00:30.500> a<00:00:30.650> few<00:00:30.890> points<00:00:31.189> that's<00:00:31.640> been<00:00:31.910> make

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:32.089 
so there's a few points that's been make

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:34.750 
so there's a few points that's been make
life<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:32.509> lot<00:00:32.629> easier<00:00:32.689> for<00:00:33.470> you<00:00:33.680> with<00:00:34.610> the
