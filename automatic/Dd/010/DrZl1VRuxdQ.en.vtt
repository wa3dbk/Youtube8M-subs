00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.440
 we start the second block of km x 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.179
 showing you an event that I'm sure 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.340
 you'll love it first because it's a 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.980
 competition in which all cars 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.139
 participants are baquets and second 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.570
 because the whole tour is done by 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.460
 dirt roads so without losing a 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.490
 minute I invite you to see everything 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.510
 happened in the second grand admiral prize 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.510
 brown rosary 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.380
 think of cars, think of makeup 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.820
 I belong to your task then friends 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.550
 of ancient authors 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.670
 this is the second exit we make to 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.680
 rosario is the second grand prize 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.140
 Admiral Browm Rosary all by land 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.480
 one hundred percent the dirt road are 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.230
 400 kilometers or so we do 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.230
 Dirt Road 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.820
 that 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.880
 of two parts 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.190
 well these cars are a replica and 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.770
 some are exactly the same as 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.300
 passed from generation to generation of 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.979
 the first race cars that there were 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.229
 in Argentina before the start of the 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.810
 road tourism was running with these 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.150
 cars that were fundamentally cars 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.070
 standard that are alleviated nothing for 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.290
 have a good weight / power ratio 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.150
 of walking much lighter of course 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.360
 always on dirt roads there was no 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.180
 another type of path there is a group 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.220
 quite large of people fond of 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.580
 this type of cars that generally 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.869
 are in the vast majority are made 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.350
 some are original with the majority 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.290
 they're done 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.790
 is where the genesis of this 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.060
 car was the earth and probably in the 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.070
 Asphalt is very nice and very smooth but 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.140
 if we go back to what reality is 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.680
 these songs were made to walk 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.680
 on dirt road 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.830
 i 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.620
 a technical issue almost cut a 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.930
 support of the exhaust pipe so that it does not 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.640
 the good plate was damaged the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.040
 wire also motors and we have another 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.590
 bit of when opening or generate and if not 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.480
 we have we have a named cut of 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.620
 there but all very well with a lot of land 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.909
 what I do not smoke I eat it as land 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.909
 but happy 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.870
 we left admiral brown more or less 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.370
 in a caravan to look for them 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.470
 we made the whole asphalt part without 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.720
 be in competition there instead 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.970
 we went through the earth we went through 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.700
 mercedes and mercedes we come out wind 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.000
 which is a beautiful little town of very few 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.550
 inhabitants and very very cute very very 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.130
 logical and that very few people know it 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.100
 so here we go to lunch and 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.270
 those we follow for jumps tomorrow 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.190
 we jump out and do jump colom 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.700
 we have lunch in colors as we do colom 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.310
 rosario in total are a little bit more than 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.860
 400 kilometers of land that we do the 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.380
 activity is quite an effort 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.400
 pretty strong for people for the 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.400
 cars and for people 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.070
 in the distance it is saved because back 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.440
 of the car that goes forward you do not see 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.410
 absolutely nothing you are swallowing everything 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.090
 the dust of the car that goes forward 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.490
 then that is the prudential distance 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.550
 we have between each other must 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.320
 handle it with care is no longer a car 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.590
 new and a new race car or a 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.770
 new sport car are bugs is this car 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.459
 of the year 24 or that is almost 90 years old 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.100
 of antiquity with everything nice and everything 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.000
 how successful it is to manage a 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.000
 bicharraco of this 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.640
 there will be two 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.010
 conductive skill tests a 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.250
 master today at noon after 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.300
 lunch the other one is going to be the day of 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.250
 morning 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.639
 provide once we have left 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.639
 jump 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.949
 with opulent angel as an adult with me 

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:02.079
 friend héctor elías within time that the 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.279
 takes his life his machine was going to do 

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:05.229
 what are you doing problems a 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:08.829
 conductive or quintana skill that 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:11.429
 comply is to go thoroughly in a circuit without 

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:11.429
 work 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.700
 and shows what the car gives here is 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.800
 time trial the faster the better 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.930
 tomorrow morning while you are 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.790
 doing the second conductive video and 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.280
 the sum of time of the twelve of the two 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.930
 events for the winners first 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.820
 second and third bridge of so 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.890
 we have the conductive ability and for 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.900
 another we do not have the regularity en route 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.060
 in the planned route as I am know the 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.290
 we do 50 kilometers watching 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.540
 all traffic laws as 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.610
 corresponds here they do not take out we take the 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.700
 taste and we show the positioned well 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.700
 is 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.340
 and as brothers sheet metal workshop and

 we serve all insurance companies 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.760
 and the clear system niccoló brothers 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.340
 quality is guaranteed is that 881 neighborhood 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.170
 general peace decree in contact with 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.000
 we go back to see the contents of the 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.130
 program or know all the news 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.380
 you just have to stay a like in
