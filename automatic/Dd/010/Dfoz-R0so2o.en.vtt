in<00:00:05.029> this<00:00:05.240> movie<00:00:05.629> we're<00:00:05.779> gonna<00:00:05.870> add<00:00:06.109> spaces<00:00:06.890> to

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:07.190 
in this movie we're gonna add spaces to

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.270 
in this movie we're gonna add spaces to
our<00:00:07.300> project<00:00:08.300> now<00:00:08.930> adding<00:00:09.620> spaces<00:00:09.890> is

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
our project now adding spaces is

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.940 
our project now adding spaces is
actually<00:00:10.820> the<00:00:11.000> first<00:00:11.330> step<00:00:11.930> of<00:00:12.140> a<00:00:12.410> multi-step

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
actually the first step of a multi-step

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.440 
actually the first step of a multi-step
process<00:00:13.340> that<00:00:13.370> we'll<00:00:13.670> use<00:00:13.700> to<00:00:13.970> start

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
process that we'll use to start

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.680 
process that we'll use to start
accessing<00:00:15.290> the<00:00:15.470> data<00:00:15.740> that's<00:00:16.040> in<00:00:16.160> our<00:00:16.280> model

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
accessing the data that's in our model

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.180 
accessing the data that's in our model
many<00:00:17.690> of<00:00:17.870> the<00:00:17.990> tests<00:00:18.530> that<00:00:18.620> we've<00:00:18.770> done<00:00:18.950> so<00:00:19.160> far

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
many of the tests that we've done so far

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.590 
many of the tests that we've done so far
have<00:00:19.580> been<00:00:19.700> concerned<00:00:20.060> pretty<00:00:20.450> much

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
have been concerned pretty much

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.540 
have been concerned pretty much
exclusively<00:00:20.960> with<00:00:21.500> graphics<00:00:22.040> how<00:00:22.250> do<00:00:22.310> things

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
exclusively with graphics how do things

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.400 
exclusively with graphics how do things
look<00:00:22.700> what<00:00:23.210> kind<00:00:23.330> of<00:00:23.480> drawings<00:00:23.900> do<00:00:24.050> we<00:00:24.170> want

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
look what kind of drawings do we want

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.859 
look what kind of drawings do we want
but<00:00:24.770> all<00:00:25.100> of<00:00:25.550> this<00:00:25.730> drawing<00:00:26.000> information<00:00:26.630> all

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
but all of this drawing information all

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.240 
but all of this drawing information all
of<00:00:26.900> these<00:00:27.170> model<00:00:27.560> elements<00:00:27.950> that<00:00:28.039> we've<00:00:28.160> been

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
of these model elements that we've been

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.560 
of these model elements that we've been
creating<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.700> walls<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.180> doors<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:29.539> windows

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
creating the walls the doors the windows

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.900 
creating the walls the doors the windows
they<00:00:29.990> all<00:00:30.199> have<00:00:30.500> information<00:00:31.220> in<00:00:31.430> them<00:00:31.640> that

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
they all have information in them that

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.900 
they all have information in them that
we<00:00:32.210> can<00:00:32.450> access<00:00:32.689> and<00:00:33.140> so<00:00:33.680> a<00:00:33.710> big<00:00:34.130> part<00:00:34.400> of<00:00:34.550> using

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
we can access and so a big part of using

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.000 
we can access and so a big part of using
autocad<00:00:35.329> architecture<00:00:35.480> is<00:00:36.110> actually<00:00:36.710> getting

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
autocad architecture is actually getting

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.970 
autocad architecture is actually getting
at<00:00:37.250> that<00:00:37.579> information<00:00:38.570> that's<00:00:39.050> stored<00:00:39.560> in

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
at that information that's stored in

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.880 
at that information that's stored in
those<00:00:40.220> objects<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.270> industry<00:00:41.780> term<00:00:42.050> for<00:00:42.560> this

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
those objects the industry term for this

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.760 
those objects the industry term for this
kind<00:00:43.160> of<00:00:43.220> thing<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.700> Building<00:00:44.480> Information

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
kind of thing is Building Information

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.120 
kind of thing is Building Information
modeling<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.040> built<00:00:46.760> into<00:00:47.329> that<00:00:47.630> term<00:00:48.260> bi<00:00:48.710> M

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
modeling so built into that term bi M

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.069 
modeling so built into that term bi M
that<00:00:49.489> Building<00:00:49.850> Information<00:00:50.000> modeling<00:00:50.809> is

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
that Building Information modeling is

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.040 
that Building Information modeling is
both<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.160> concept<00:00:52.579> of<00:00:52.760> model<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:53.360> the

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
both the concept of model and the

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.410 
both the concept of model and the
concept<00:00:54.500> of<00:00:54.620> information<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:55.969> in<00:00:56.270> this

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
concept of information and so in this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.670 
concept of information and so in this
chapter<00:00:56.840> we're<00:00:56.960> going<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.110> be<00:00:57.230> focusing

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
chapter we're going to be focusing

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.400 
chapter we're going to be focusing
almost<00:00:57.980> exclusively<00:00:58.399> on<00:00:59.180> information<00:01:00.079> to

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
almost exclusively on information to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.080 
almost exclusively on information to
kind<00:01:00.620> of<00:01:00.680> show<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.430> different<00:01:01.910> ways<00:01:02.059> that

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
kind of show you the different ways that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.270 
kind of show you the different ways that
you<00:01:02.480> can<00:01:02.629> access<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.260> information<00:01:03.379> that's<00:01:03.890> in

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
you can access the information that's in

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.029 
you can access the information that's in
your<00:01:04.609> AutoCAD<00:01:05.299> architecture<00:01:05.780> model<00:01:06.109> so<00:01:06.920> we're

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
your AutoCAD architecture model so we're

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.609 
your AutoCAD architecture model so we're
gonna<00:01:07.130> start<00:01:07.459> with<00:01:07.549> spaces<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:08.929> I'm<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:09.319> a

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
gonna start with spaces so I'm in a

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.789 
gonna start with spaces so I'm in a
project<00:01:10.009> called<00:01:10.310> add<00:01:10.880> spaces<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:11.869> I've<00:01:12.409> got

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
project called add spaces and I've got

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.429 
project called add spaces and I've got
the<00:01:13.100> main<00:01:13.579> level<00:01:13.850> construct<00:01:14.600> open<00:01:14.990> on<00:01:15.109> screen

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
the main level construct open on screen

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.399 
the main level construct open on screen
now<00:01:16.069> which<00:01:16.759> construct<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:17.600> put<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.959> spaces

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
now which construct you put the spaces

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.230 
now which construct you put the spaces
in<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.740> really<00:01:18.889> up<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.249> you<00:01:19.369> sometimes<00:01:19.939> it

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
in is really up to you sometimes it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.389 
in is really up to you sometimes it
makes<00:01:20.509> sense<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.929> put<00:01:20.959> them<00:01:21.350> with<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.009> walls

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
makes sense to put them with the walls

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.489 
makes sense to put them with the walls
like<00:01:22.729> I'm<00:01:22.909> gonna<00:01:23.029> do<00:01:23.299> here<00:01:23.689> sometimes<00:01:24.350> it

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
like I'm gonna do here sometimes it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:25.599 
like I'm gonna do here sometimes it
makes<00:01:24.649> sense<00:01:24.799> to<00:01:25.130> make<00:01:25.219> a<00:01:25.279> whole<00:01:25.579> new

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:25.609 
makes sense to make a whole new

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.569 
makes sense to make a whole new
construct<00:01:26.420> just<00:01:26.840> exclusively<00:01:27.560> for<00:01:27.859> spaces<00:01:28.399> so

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
construct just exclusively for spaces so

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:29.589 
construct just exclusively for spaces so
there<00:01:28.729> are<00:01:28.819> pros<00:01:29.029> and<00:01:29.209> cons<00:01:29.359> to<00:01:29.569> both

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:29.599 
there are pros and cons to both

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:31.480 
there are pros and cons to both
approaches<00:01:30.259> but<00:01:30.679> in<00:01:30.770> this<00:01:30.889> case<00:01:31.099> I'm<00:01:31.279> going<00:01:31.399> to

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
approaches but in this case I'm going to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.160 
approaches but in this case I'm going to
keep<00:01:31.609> it<00:01:31.729> simple<00:01:31.909> and<00:01:32.240> just<00:01:32.270> put<00:01:32.899> them<00:01:33.049> with

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
keep it simple and just put them with

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.319 
keep it simple and just put them with
the<00:01:33.289> walls<00:01:33.469> what<00:01:34.340> is<00:01:34.490> important<00:01:34.969> understand

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
the walls what is important understand

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.440 
the walls what is important understand
is<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.630> spaces<00:01:36.170> belong<00:01:36.619> in<00:01:36.950> constructs<00:01:37.939> so

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
is the spaces belong in constructs so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.660 
is the spaces belong in constructs so
even<00:01:38.840> though<00:01:39.020> graphically<00:01:39.859> we're<00:01:40.279> not<00:01:40.459> really

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
even though graphically we're not really

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.120 
even though graphically we're not really
interested<00:01:40.999> in<00:01:41.359> displaying<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.499> spaces<00:01:42.950> so

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
interested in displaying the spaces so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.550 
interested in displaying the spaces so
much<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:43.939> need<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.479> data<00:01:44.749> to<00:01:45.049> be<00:01:45.169> available

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
much we need that data to be available

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.559 
much we need that data to be available
at<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.130> construct<00:01:46.729> level<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.389> it<00:01:47.479> will

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
at the construct level so that it will

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.389 
at the construct level so that it will
feed<00:01:47.929> into<00:01:48.259> all<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:48.799> other<00:01:48.919> parts<00:01:49.219> of<00:01:49.310> the

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
feed into all the other parts of the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.159 
feed into all the other parts of the
project<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:50.509> I'm<00:01:50.599> gonna<00:01:50.689> come<00:01:50.869> over<00:01:51.020> here<00:01:51.049> to

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:51.169 
project so I'm gonna come over here to

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:53.589 
project so I'm gonna come over here to
my<00:01:51.289> tool<00:01:51.499> palettes<00:01:51.919> and<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:53.240> want<00:01:53.389> to<00:01:53.450> make

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
my tool palettes and you want to make

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.269 
my tool palettes and you want to make
sure<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:54.079> you're<00:01:54.229> on<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.409> design<00:01:54.859> tool

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
sure that you're on the design tool

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.879 
sure that you're on the design tool
pallet<00:01:55.669> group<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.119> then<00:01:56.719> on<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.380> design<00:01:57.679> tool

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:57.889 
pallet group and then on the design tool

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:59.769 
pallet group and then on the design tool
pallet<00:01:58.219> group<00:01:58.399> there's<00:01:58.639> actually<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> spaces

00:01:59.769 --> 00:01:59.779 
pallet group there's actually a spaces

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:02.379 
pallet group there's actually a spaces
tab<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:00.409> what<00:02:01.219> you've<00:02:01.369> got<00:02:01.579> here<00:02:01.849> is<00:02:02.029> several

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.209 
tab and what you've got here is several
different<00:02:02.840> space<00:02:03.139> styles<00:02:03.619> that<00:02:03.799> are<00:02:03.979> already

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
different space styles that are already

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.569 
different space styles that are already
available<00:02:04.729> for<00:02:05.419> us<00:02:05.569> to<00:02:05.810> use<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.799> many<00:02:07.219> of<00:02:07.459> these

suit<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.450> kinds<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.899> spaces<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.560> already

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
suit the kinds of spaces that I already

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.250 
suit the kinds of spaces that I already
have<00:02:10.070> here<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:10.430> my<00:02:10.550> model<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.360> for<00:02:11.840> example

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
have here in my model so for example

have here in my model so for example
I've<00:02:12.470> got<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.650> conference<00:02:13.040> room<00:02:13.250> right<00:02:13.520> here

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
I've got a conference room right here

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.000 
I've got a conference room right here
in<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.060> center<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:15.200> space<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:15.920> I'm

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
in the center of the space and so I'm

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.560 
in the center of the space and so I'm
going<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.220> click<00:02:16.460> this<00:02:16.670> conference<00:02:17.390> room

at<00:02:26.480> properties<00:02:26.990> before<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.410> place<00:02:27.740> it<00:02:27.950> just

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
at properties before I place it just

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.910 
at properties before I place it just

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
type for this space is one such property

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.090 
type for this space is one such property
and<00:02:43.490> there<00:02:43.760> are<00:02:44.030> four<00:02:44.630> possibilities<00:02:45.260> we<00:02:45.890> can

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
and there are four possibilities we can

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.460 
and there are four possibilities we can
insert<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.730> which<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.240> what<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.690> defaulted<00:02:48.260> to

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
insert it which is what it defaulted to

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.710 
insert it which is what it defaulted to
we<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.130> draw<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.310> rectangle<00:02:49.880> or<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.030> polygon<00:02:50.480> or

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
we can draw a rectangle or a polygon or

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.500 
we can draw a rectangle or a polygon or
we<00:02:51.230> can<00:02:51.410> use<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.770> generate<00:02:52.280> option<00:02:52.760> now<00:02:53.270> if

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
we can use the generate option now if

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.650 
we can use the generate option now if
you<00:02:53.690> just<00:02:53.900> do<00:02:54.080> insert<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:55.370> clicks<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.180> point<00:02:56.450> and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
you just do insert it clicks a point and

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.780 
you just do insert it clicks a point and
then<00:02:56.840> asks<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.560> rotate<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:58.130> but<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.520> comes

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
then asks you to rotate it but it comes

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.840 
then asks you to rotate it but it comes
in<00:02:59.030> at<00:02:59.270> a<00:02:59.300> standard<00:02:59.870> size<00:03:00.140> if<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:01.190> do<00:03:01.430> the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
in at a standard size if you do the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.850 
in at a standard size if you do the
rectangle<00:03:02.690> or<00:03:02.840> polygon<00:03:03.350> then<00:03:03.620> you're<00:03:03.740> going

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
rectangle or polygon then you're going

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.040 
rectangle or polygon then you're going
to<00:03:03.920> be<00:03:04.040> able<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.280> make<00:03:04.550> an<00:03:04.760> irregular<00:03:05.540> shape<00:03:05.570> to

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
to be able to make an irregular shape to

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.780 
to be able to make an irregular shape to
it<00:03:06.230> either<00:03:06.470> using<00:03:06.740> a<00:03:06.920> rectangular<00:03:07.430> form<00:03:07.670> or

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
it either using a rectangular form or

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.660 
it either using a rectangular form or
polygon<00:03:08.300> form<00:03:08.630> but<00:03:09.260> generate<00:03:09.830> is<00:03:10.010> probably

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
polygon form but generate is probably

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.360 
polygon form but generate is probably
the<00:03:10.970> most<00:03:11.150> useful<00:03:11.570> of<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.500> four<00:03:12.710> choices<00:03:12.950> and

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the most useful of the four choices and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.060 
the most useful of the four choices and
the<00:03:13.760> reason<00:03:14.120> for<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.690> if<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.350> now<00:03:15.530> move<00:03:15.860> my

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
the reason for that is if I now move my

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.180 
the reason for that is if I now move my
mouse<00:03:16.340> into<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:17.390> drawing<00:03:18.050> area<00:03:18.320> notice<00:03:18.800> that

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
mouse into the drawing area notice that

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.940 
mouse into the drawing area notice that
there's<00:03:19.760> this<00:03:20.000> red<00:03:20.330> line<00:03:20.630> going<00:03:21.080> around<00:03:21.200> the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
there's this red line going around the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.390 
there's this red line going around the
various<00:03:22.580> spaces<00:03:22.910> in<00:03:23.330> my<00:03:23.540> model<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.350> using<00:03:25.250> the

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
various spaces in my model so using the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.640 
various spaces in my model so using the
generate<00:03:25.820> option<00:03:26.240> it<00:03:26.450> goes<00:03:26.720> out<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:26.960> it<00:03:27.260> sees

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
generate option it goes out and it sees

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.950 
generate option it goes out and it sees
the<00:03:27.680> boundaries<00:03:28.490> of<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:29.210> walls<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.870> you

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
the boundaries of the walls that you

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.930 
the boundaries of the walls that you
already<00:03:30.140> have<00:03:30.470> in<00:03:30.710> your<00:03:30.770> model<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.520> now<00:03:31.730> with

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
already have in your model and now with

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.780 
already have in your model and now with
a<00:03:31.970> single<00:03:32.420> click<00:03:32.600> I<00:03:32.990> can<00:03:33.650> create<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:34.190> conference

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
a single click I can create a conference

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.020 
a single click I can create a conference
room<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.210> fills<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.110> space<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:37.400> I'm<00:03:37.790> just

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
room that fills that space so I'm just

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.400 
room that fills that space so I'm just
going<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.210> go<00:03:38.360> through<00:03:38.390> my<00:03:38.660> tool<00:03:39.020> palettes

have over here I don't need that one and
let<00:04:19.340> me<00:04:19.459> zoom<00:04:19.489> in<00:04:19.850> on<00:04:20.090> this<00:04:20.239> area<00:04:20.630> here<00:04:20.930> now<00:04:21.739> you

let me zoom in on this area here now you

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.640 
let me zoom in on this area here now you
could<00:04:22.490> come<00:04:22.790> in<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.090> draw<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.479> new<00:04:23.720> wall<00:04:23.960> right

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
could come in and draw a new wall right

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.200 
could come in and draw a new wall right
there<00:04:24.680> but<00:04:25.100> I<00:04:25.130> really<00:04:25.460> don't<00:04:25.610> want<00:04:25.760> to<00:04:25.850> change

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
there but I really don't want to change

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.730 
there but I really don't want to change
the<00:04:26.570> design<00:04:26.750> of<00:04:27.260> my<00:04:27.470> art

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
the design of my art

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.379 
the design of my art
texture<00:04:28.160> in<00:04:28.340> order<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:28.759> accommodate<00:04:29.030> my

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
texture in order to accommodate my

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.120 
texture in order to accommodate my
software<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:30.020> seems<00:04:30.289> a<00:04:30.410> little<00:04:30.440> bit<00:04:30.800> like

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
software that seems a little bit like

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.520 
software that seems a little bit like
the<00:04:31.340> tail<00:04:31.550> wagging<00:04:31.819> the<00:04:32.090> dog<00:04:32.120> there<00:04:32.599> so<00:04:33.080> we

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
the tail wagging the dog there so we

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.129 
the tail wagging the dog there so we
have<00:04:33.770> something<00:04:34.400> called<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.849> space<00:04:35.330> separator

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
have something called a space separator

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.990 
have something called a space separator
that's<00:04:36.470> available<00:04:36.710> on<00:04:37.099> that<00:04:37.310> same<00:04:37.580> tool

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
that's available on that same tool

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.700 
that's available on that same tool
palette<00:04:38.419> so<00:04:38.660> if<00:04:38.810> I<00:04:38.930> come<00:04:39.139> over<00:04:39.259> here<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.560> the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
palette so if I come over here to the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.890 
palette so if I come over here to the
tool<00:04:39.889> palettes<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.430> I<00:04:40.550> scroll<00:04:40.880> down<00:04:40.910> you've

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
tool palettes and I scroll down you've

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.900 
tool palettes and I scroll down you've
got<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.199> space<00:04:42.530> separator<00:04:43.039> option<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.699> what

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
got the space separator option and what

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.640 
got the space separator option and what
this<00:04:44.120> does<00:04:44.330> is<00:04:44.539> that<00:04:44.569> lets<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:44.960> just<00:04:45.169> draw<00:04:45.440> a

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
this does is that lets you just draw a

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.890 
this does is that lets you just draw a
line<00:04:45.889> basically<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:47.180> I'll<00:04:47.270> just<00:04:47.449> draw<00:04:47.660> a<00:04:47.690> line

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
line basically and I'll just draw a line

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.830 
line basically and I'll just draw a line
across<00:04:48.110> from<00:04:48.560> here<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.919> here<00:04:49.270> press<00:04:50.270> ENTER<00:04:50.660> and

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
across from here to here press ENTER and

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.020 
across from here to here press ENTER and
then<00:04:51.470> what<00:04:51.800> you'll<00:04:51.949> see<00:04:52.190> is<00:04:52.370> that<00:04:52.669> actually

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
then what you'll see is that actually

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.980 
then what you'll see is that actually
cut<00:04:53.330> this<00:04:53.599> into<00:04:54.349> two<00:04:54.650> spaces<00:04:54.919> here<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.990> here

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
cut this into two spaces here and here

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.860 
cut this into two spaces here and here
now<00:04:57.139> I'm<00:04:57.889> going<00:04:58.009> to<00:04:58.099> select<00:04:58.400> this<00:04:58.669> one<00:04:58.729> go<00:04:59.690> over

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
now I'm going to select this one go over

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.439 
now I'm going to select this one go over
to<00:04:59.960> my<00:05:00.080> tool<00:05:00.319> palettes<00:05:00.740> I'm<00:05:01.009> going<00:05:01.729> to<00:05:01.789> find<00:05:02.210> a

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
to my tool palettes I'm going to find a

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.890 
to my tool palettes I'm going to find a
reception<00:05:02.930> space<00:05:03.440> right<00:05:04.430> here<00:05:04.909> right<00:05:05.569> click

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
reception space right here right click

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.260 
reception space right here right click
it<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:06.169> apply<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.650> tool<00:05:07.039> properties<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:08.060> that

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
it and apply the tool properties to that

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.960 
it and apply the tool properties to that
space<00:05:08.599> so<00:05:09.319> all<00:05:09.680> I<00:05:09.710> have<00:05:10.009> to<00:05:10.130> do<00:05:10.310> is<00:05:10.520> just<00:05:10.729> add<00:05:10.909> a

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
space so all I have to do is just add a

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.029 
space so all I have to do is just add a
big<00:05:11.300> space<00:05:11.569> come<00:05:12.110> in<00:05:12.259> and<00:05:12.440> separate<00:05:12.770> it<00:05:12.919> in

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
big space come in and separate it in

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:14.680 
big space come in and separate it in
half<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.520> then<00:05:13.580> I<00:05:13.729> can<00:05:13.880> apply<00:05:14.060> another<00:05:14.360> style

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
half and then I can apply another style

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.710 
half and then I can apply another style
now<00:05:15.470> for<00:05:15.860> this<00:05:15.949> big<00:05:16.190> workshop<00:05:16.550> area<00:05:17.030> here<00:05:17.569> I
