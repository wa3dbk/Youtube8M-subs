00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
 hello to all if the smells in my 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.959
 previous videos I have a lot 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.000
 criticized the new iphone as well as 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.010
 the apple keynote in general it pleased 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 some others have less appreciated and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.410
 some limit lost the life which 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.049
 explains I guess 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.460
 the insults I received brief on it 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.199
 come back today the iphone 6 the iphone 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.550
 6 plus the return before I start 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.930
 wanted to put some clear points 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.369
 and if it's still not done you 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.199
 can see or review my video 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.310
 concerning the iphone 6 by clicking on the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.019
 thumbnail that appears on the screen 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.250
 firstly, I apologize to the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.630
 people who have come close to the crisis 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.279
 cardiac enough to insult me 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.080
 many told me you shoot 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.399
 conclusions too fast you're too harsh 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.899
 already it is necessary to understand that my videos 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.309
 are not tests that are 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.469
 chronicles in which I bring a 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.610
 vision which is mine which I hope 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.989
 in any case is different from what we 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.460
 can find elsewhere on the internet 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.200
 actually there are certain points on 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.610
 which I'm wrong but it's normal I 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.649
 say what I think I can not have 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.149
 the monopoly of thought for some 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.410
 I would be wrong for others not that 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.760
 depends on people some me too 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.260
 reproached for being in excess but the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.550
 guys I 've always been just the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.329
 most notice now because I 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.190
 go against apple 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.570
 if I was with samsung why I 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.770
 will not be with the apple and this 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.000
 is not a role I play it's my 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.559
 personality and it was not 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 the goal of this video but I hope 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.799
 that all the people who saw me 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.210
 as an apple addicts have realized that 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.860
 I'm just making sense 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.720
 that's it we're done now 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.040
 switch to these famous new iphone in 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.750
 asking on twitter I noticed that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.060
 many of you have already seasoned 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.020
 iphone 6 or iphone 6 more than another 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.310
 side I would not wind 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.509
 that she is making apple but I have 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.070
 took the opportunity to ask you what you 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.700
 think about it and I had that answers 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.049
 positive 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.700
 so it's still proof that his 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.229
 iphone are not bad and even though 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.580
 I was very negative I never 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.530
 wanted to say that it's mostly because he 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.420
 enormously disappointed his presentation disappointed me 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.009
 his design disappointed me his homeland disappointed me 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.990
 I really did not see the point of 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.579
 go from fifth to cices so yes 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.409
 like launched line and a lot of between 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.450
 I did not test the product 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.860
 nobody had tested it I pulled them 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.270
 conclusions too fast but what I have 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.820
 judged it's just what we got 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.950
 presented apple being a faithful apple 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.270
 I did not feel this ergonomics and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.530
 this bubble in which we feel 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.700
 every keynote and that's why 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.360
 that today I come back to this 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.770
 video 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.329
 because since I had a lot of opinions 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.369
 they are very positive what has the 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.840
 more surprised is the battery I do not 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.090
 I had not necessarily criticized it and 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.130
 I had expressed my disappointment the most 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.810
 big on this iphone because apple had 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.130
 really not press this point and he 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.179
 should have you very many to 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.369
 to send me the statistics of your 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.840
 iphone and whether it's the 6 or the 6 plus 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.220
 it's excellent it's still good 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.989
 better on the more and that's a 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.580
 excellent point it's really the fault 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.260
 of the apple the achilles heel of 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.400
 the iphone and I'm really tired of 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.810
 this battery that lasts not even a 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.220
 course day it was really the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.080
 point that could make me leave from 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.370
 the iphone so apple goes up the slope and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.290
 I am very happy with it I am 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.549
 glad it shows I'm waiting for everything 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.079
 even to see if it's as good in 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.250
 a few months but I am very confident 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.989
 then I talked about the size of 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.670
 the screen I was saying that it was not a 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.130
 change that was necessary to my 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.110
 sense and finally I have to confess that the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.790
 4.7 is very interesting against the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.560
 5.5 10 6 plus it's just not possible 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.390
 and I had the opportunity to have them all 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.650
 both in hand and I will not bear 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.180
 this board that serves as the phone 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.769
 however some people told me they had 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.940
 many mills early may be 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.349
 very happy afterwards with regard to 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.360
 regards the design I do not change 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.220
 I'm still not a fan of 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.790
 this aspect a little rounded gum on the 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.560
 edges 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.750
 even though it may be less fragile and 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.799
 certainly more comfortable this aspect 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.060
 did not really convince me 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.470
 by the way, many of them 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.139
 points out sometimes by attacking me 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.180
 that the white bands the species of 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.650
 certainly joined to let the waves 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.450
 okay that's awful good have a 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.620
 utility do not tell me that apple does not know 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.090
 most make good products 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.470
 work very well and who in the 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.090
 same time are aesthetically speaking 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.739
 very beautiful otherwise I would not pass either 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.780
 immediately to conclude the iphone 6 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.549
 and 6 plus its great product but who 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.170
 for my part does not deserve the passage 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.880
 collections of his fat to these 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.349
 I will not buy the iphone 6 to 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.220
 unless you spend a little cooked 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.239
 in 2,800 euros 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.799
 I let you see that in the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.359
 description wanted to thank you because 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.180
 this video exploded the goal record 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.340
 of the chain reach 9000 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.560
 the more than 300 like but more than 200 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.510
 comments and you are now 4000 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.870
 souls live on this channel thank you this is 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.870
 and smells 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.950
 and as for the mustache 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.060
 many of you have done 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.320
 notice but I left them since 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.910
 apparently when I have a hair 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.910
 visible makes you fart the counter
