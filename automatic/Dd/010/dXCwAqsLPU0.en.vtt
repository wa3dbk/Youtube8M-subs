galaxy s2 with 18t on the right there is

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.509 
galaxy s2 with 18t on the right there is
the<00:00:08.639> epic<00:00:08.910> 4g<00:00:08.940> touch<00:00:09.300> with<00:00:09.809> sprint<00:00:10.290> now<00:00:11.040> the

are slightly off and those we were
talking<00:01:25.619> about<00:01:25.680> earlier<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.430> orientation<00:01:27.060> of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the camera is slightly different but it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.300 
the camera is slightly different but it
still<00:01:29.100> has<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.280> same<00:01:29.579> exact<00:01:29.909> sensor<00:01:31.220> still<00:01:32.220> an

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.110 
difference between up and down basically
aside<00:02:09.959> from<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.790> you'll<00:02:11.790> notice<00:02:11.910> a

aside from that you'll notice a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.970 
aside from that you'll notice a

and the speaker grill placement but they

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.830 
and the speaker grill placement but they
both<00:02:21.070> have<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.430> same<00:02:21.460> kind<00:02:21.820> of<00:02:21.940> textured<00:02:22.360> back

just<00:02:25.840> slightly<00:02:25.960> different<00:02:26.590> patterns<00:02:26.950> nothing

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
just slightly different patterns nothing

nothing really significant though in
terms<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.760> thickness<00:02:32.370> as<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:35.080> can<00:02:35.200> see<00:02:35.470> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
terms of thickness as you can see the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.810 
terms of thickness as you can see the
epic<00:02:36.490> is<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.710> technically<00:02:39.220> thinner<00:02:39.520> but

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
epic is this is technically thinner but

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.360 
epic is this is technically thinner but
really<00:02:40.480> not<00:02:40.600> by<00:02:40.780> much<00:02:41.040> you're<00:02:42.040> not<00:02:42.160> going<00:02:42.310> to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
really not by much you're not going to

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.590 
really not by much you're not going to
tell<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:42.670> much<00:02:42.820> of<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.060> difference<00:02:43.090> there

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
tell that much of a difference there

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.750 
tell that much of a difference there
unless<00:02:44.020> you're<00:02:44.200> just<00:02:44.380> looking<00:02:44.710> at<00:02:44.830> them<00:02:44.920> super

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
unless you're just looking at them super

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.580 
unless you're just looking at them super
close<00:02:46.380> next<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.470> each<00:02:47.560> other<00:02:47.710> like<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:50.500> are<00:02:50.650> now

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
close next to each other like we are now

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.000 
close next to each other like we are now
so<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:54.580> gives<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:55.110> fair<00:02:56.110> idea<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.680> how<00:02:56.950> the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
so that gives you a fair idea of how the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.390 
so that gives you a fair idea of how the
two<00:02:57.250> phones<00:02:57.540> compare<00:02:58.540> with<00:02:58.570> each<00:02:58.810> other<00:02:59.400> now

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
two phones compare with each other now

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.680 
two phones compare with each other now

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
progression here in terms of the overall

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.050 
progression here in terms of the overall
size<00:03:10.600> this<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:10.960> the<00:03:11.200> Samsung<00:03:11.590> Focus<00:03:14.790> will<00:03:15.790> turn
