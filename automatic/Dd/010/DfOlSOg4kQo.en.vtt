00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello everyone with you sledge don't refuse everything 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.930
 another way to increase fps world of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.420
 tanks incidentally he appeared quite 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.389
 recently more precisely in patch 092 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.219
 what kind of saved right now will tell u 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.890
 we in general have a new one 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 graphic us threesome trip 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.400
 transparency of foliage in sniper mode 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.650
 see the screen presents two 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.650
 the screenshot is from the same position 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 but on the left we have a screenshot of 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.359
 included bushes leaves yes like this 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.489
 It was before, but from the right, Seneca 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.410
 the screenshot is disabled and the flattery that is 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.930
 this is already off this one 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.910
 graphical setting if we disable 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.640
 transparency foliage then fps with us 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.430
 rises but the guys are also besides 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 of this I have noticed that yes that is how 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.610
 in addition to increasing the fps, we still do 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.440
 one useful thing that is opened when 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.140
 unplugged leaves I think many with 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.629
 I agree to probably even all that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.270
 the goal of this is left tolerant harder 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.370
 aim as an opponent here everything is 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.510
 the leaves in these bushes are up to the right then 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.760
 we have clean clean i don't know 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.520
 like the image on without any garbage then 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.880
 we have it in this way 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.700
 solve two problems we increase fps and us 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.030
 it will be easier to play for gameplay will be 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.180
 better, that is, we are solving two problems and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.869
 so guys wanna draw your attention 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.759
 that this only affects transparency 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.100
 foliage that is when you are worth drove into 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.670
 the bush and q again becomes transparent to 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.290
 an hour in this situation up to the left then here in 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.299
 this situation will act here 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.939
 disable foliage if in reply 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.490
 from the bush to 15 meters that is, the bush will be 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.049
 that's how for example here here 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.680
 opaque here it will 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.479
 opaque exactly in sniper mode 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.189
 it is for transparent foliage now 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.920
