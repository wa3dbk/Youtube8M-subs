short<00:06:16.590> it's<00:06:16.800> actually<00:06:17.310> like<00:06:17.460> shorter<00:06:18.000> than

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
short it's actually like shorter than

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.670 
short it's actually like shorter than
the<00:06:18.330> other<00:06:18.360> one<00:06:18.720> I<00:06:18.930> thought<00:06:19.230> it<00:06:19.320> would<00:06:19.410> go<00:06:19.530> by

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680

longer<00:06:20.100> but<00:06:20.970> no<00:06:21.120> I<00:06:21.150> guess<00:06:21.450> not<00:06:21.560> so<00:06:22.560> that's

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
longer but no I guess not so that's

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.070

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
detail with it because I don't have

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.950 
detail with it because I don't have
enough<00:06:26.760> time<00:06:26.970> to<00:06:27.270> get<00:06:27.390> teacher<00:06:27.710> but<00:06:29.750> but<00:06:30.750> yeah
