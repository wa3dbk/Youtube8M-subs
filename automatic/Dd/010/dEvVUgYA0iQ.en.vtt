00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
out so the beat that I was playing in

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.980 
out so the beat that I was playing in
that<00:00:25.470> video<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:26.070> 7/8<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.539> heavily

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
that video is 7/8 and it's heavily

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.890 
that video is 7/8 and it's heavily

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
inspired by Matt garde Scott I think one

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.089 
inspired by Matt garde Scott I think one
of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.050> variations<00:00:31.289> I'm<00:00:31.679> playing<00:00:31.920> he

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
of the variations I'm playing he

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.090 
of the variations I'm playing he
actually<00:00:32.430> plays<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.899> song<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> woven<00:00:34.920> web

by Animals As Leaders for at least a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.920 
by Animals As Leaders for at least a
couple<00:00:37.050> bars<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.540> heavy<00:00:39.809> on

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
couple bars so it's really heavy on

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.709 
couple bars so it's really heavy on
ghost<00:00:40.379> notes<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:42.030> weird<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.329> play<00:00:42.600> it

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
ghost notes it's really weird to play it

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.600 
ghost notes it's really weird to play it
first<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> kind<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.649> difficult<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.280> took<00:00:44.430> me<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
first and kind of difficult it took me a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.450 
first and kind of difficult it took me a
long<00:00:44.730> time<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.210> get<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.899> speed<00:00:46.309> but<00:00:47.309> it's

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
long time to get it up to speed but it's

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.880 
long time to get it up to speed but it's
a<00:00:47.550> whole<00:00:47.700> lot<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:48.000> fun<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.930> let's<00:00:49.410> check<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> out

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
a whole lot of fun so let's check it out

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.520 
a whole lot of fun so let's check it out
okay<00:00:50.850> right<00:00:51.120> off<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.360> bat<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.170> what<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
okay right off the bat this is what the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:05.090 
okay right off the bat this is what the
look<00:00:52.649> sounds<00:00:52.949> like<00:01:02.420> ok<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> before<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.830> begin<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
look sounds like ok so before I begin I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.859 
look sounds like ok so before I begin I
just<00:01:05.250> want<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.760> explain<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> notation<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
just want to explain the notation that I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.359 
just want to explain the notation that I
use<00:01:07.200> because<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> software<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> use

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
use because I know the software I use

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.149 
use because I know the software I use
can<00:01:08.520> kind<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.790> write<00:01:09.299> stuff<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.630> little<00:01:09.720> weird

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
can kind of write stuff a little weird

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.800 
can kind of write stuff a little weird
so<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> hollow<00:01:11.460> diamonds<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> snare<00:01:12.540> line

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so the hollow diamonds on the snare line

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.749 
so the hollow diamonds on the snare line
are<00:01:13.140> rim<00:01:13.979> shots<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:15.799> any<00:01:16.799> snare<00:01:17.430> head<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
are rim shots and any snare head to the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.399 
are rim shots and any snare head to the
parentheses<00:01:18.240> are<00:01:18.450> ghost<00:01:18.689> notes<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.350> when<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
parentheses are ghost notes so when it

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.690 
parentheses are ghost notes so when it
comes<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> learning<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.520> most

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
comes to learning this the most

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.690 
comes to learning this the most
important<00:01:24.420> thing<00:01:24.710> is<00:01:25.710> getting<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.250> left<00:01:26.460> hand

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
important thing is getting the left hand

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.160 
important thing is getting the left hand
technique<00:01:26.909> down<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> distinction

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
technique down to get the distinction

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.420 
technique down to get the distinction
between<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.530> ghost<00:01:28.740> notes<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> rim

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
between the ghost notes and the rim

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.800 
between the ghost notes and the rim
shots<00:01:29.670> because<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.180> kind<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> weird<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.689> go

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
shots because it's kind of weird to go

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.510 
shots because it's kind of weird to go
back<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.380> quickly<00:01:31.619> between<00:01:31.950> where<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.189> shakos

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
back so quickly between where and shakos

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.990 
back so quickly between where and shakos
no<00:01:32.670> room<00:01:32.820> shot<00:01:33.030> goes<00:01:33.210> no<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.520> well<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> figured

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
no room shot goes no so well I figured

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.859 
no room shot goes no so well I figured
out<00:01:36.119> works<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.600> me<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.259> least<00:01:37.380> is

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
out works for me for this at least is

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
out works for me for this at least is
always<00:01:39.869> kind<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> keep<00:01:40.380> your<00:01:40.829> wrist<00:01:41.549> your<00:01:41.970> hand

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
always kind of keep your wrist your hand

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.020 
always kind of keep your wrist your hand
elevated<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:43.500> wrist<00:01:43.740> slightly<00:01:44.640> down

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
elevated and your wrist slightly down

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.030 
elevated and your wrist slightly down
because<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.450> makes<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.810> hard<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.590> play<00:01:46.740> loud

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
because it makes it hard to play loud

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.440 
because it makes it hard to play loud
like<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.729> kind<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.939> ensures<00:01:48.299> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
like that and it kind of ensures that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.280 
like that and it kind of ensures that
you're<00:01:48.659> gonna<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.170> nice<00:01:49.470> quiet<00:01:50.040> ghost<00:01:50.549> note

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
you're gonna get a nice quiet ghost note

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.080 
you're gonna get a nice quiet ghost note
also<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.680> puts<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.820> really<00:01:53.970> good

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
also it puts you in a really good

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.940 
also it puts you in a really good
position<00:01:54.299> when<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> need<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.350> quickly<00:01:55.649> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
position when you need to get quickly to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.480 
position when you need to get quickly to
a<00:01:55.979> rimshot

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
a rimshot

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.340 
a rimshot
you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.090> whip<00:01:57.299> your<00:01:57.509> wrist<00:01:57.659> down<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:58.200> into

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.550 
one
and<00:02:00.429> then<00:02:00.850> once<00:02:01.030> you're<00:02:01.149> down<00:02:01.270> here<00:02:01.689> you<00:02:02.289> Styx

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
and then once you're down here you Styx

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.770 
and then once you're down here you Styx
rebounded<00:02:03.159> you're<00:02:03.729> in<00:02:03.789> a<00:02:03.850> good<00:02:03.939> position<00:02:04.119> to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
rebounded you're in a good position to

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.569 
rebounded you're in a good position to
just<00:02:04.960> lift<00:02:05.259> your<00:02:05.439> hand<00:02:05.619> back<00:02:05.799> up<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.250> get<00:02:06.549> a

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
just lift your hand back up and get a

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.280 
just lift your hand back up and get a
ghost<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.390> find<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.539> makes<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.140> lot

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
ghost so I find that that makes it a lot

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.979 
ghost so I find that that makes it a lot
easier<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:12.129> do<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:13.120> beat<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.540> play<00:02:13.720> stuff

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
easier to do this beat you play stuff

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.509 
easier to do this beat you play stuff
like<00:02:14.140> this<00:02:14.319> where<00:02:14.500> you're<00:02:14.680> having<00:02:15.190> all<00:02:15.430> those

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
like this where you're having all those

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.770 
like this where you're having all those
accents<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.090> lot<00:02:16.269> of<00:02:16.360> ghost<00:02:16.540> notes

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
accents and a lot of ghost notes

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.199 
accents and a lot of ghost notes
happening<00:02:17.170> all<00:02:17.379> at<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.680> same<00:02:17.830> time<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:18.970> good

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
happening all at the same time so a good

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.580 
happening all at the same time so a good
way<00:02:19.269> to<00:02:19.390> get<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.720> down<00:02:19.930> if<00:02:20.110> you're<00:02:20.230> not<00:02:20.349> used

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
way to get this down if you're not used

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.289 
way to get this down if you're not used
to<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.099> if<00:02:21.310> it's<00:02:21.489> kind<00:02:21.879> of<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.090> feels

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
to it and if it's kind of a feels

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.710 
to it and if it's kind of a feels
awkward<00:02:22.510> for<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:24.209> just<00:02:25.209> play<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.480> first

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
awkward for you is just play the first

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.110 
awkward for you is just play the first
two<00:02:25.930> bars<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.530> lick<00:02:26.739> just<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:30.000> over<00:02:31.000> and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
two bars of the lick just the over and

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.020 
two bars of the lick just the over and
over<00:02:31.299> again<00:02:31.390> slowly<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:32.140> working<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
over again slowly just working on the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.430 
over again slowly just working on the
distinction<00:02:34.390> between<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.840> ghost<00:02:35.019> note<00:02:35.260> and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
distinction between the ghost note and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.930 
distinction between the ghost note and
the<00:02:35.500> rimshot<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.130> think<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.549> is<00:02:36.670> just<00:02:36.700> what

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
the rimshot I think this is just what

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.640 
the rimshot I think this is just what
works<00:02:37.120> for<00:02:37.209> me<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:37.720> that's<00:02:38.200> what<00:02:38.349> I'm<00:02:38.470> sharing

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
works for me so that's what I'm sharing

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.380 
works for me so that's what I'm sharing
but<00:02:39.069> if<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.700> have<00:02:39.819> another<00:02:40.000> way<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.180> you

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
but if you have another way that you

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.580 
but if you have another way that you
like<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.660> do<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.900> that's<00:02:40.989> perfectly<00:02:41.739> fine<00:02:42.010> so

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
like to do it that's perfectly fine so

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.369 
like to do it that's perfectly fine so
first<00:02:44.590> I'm<00:02:44.769> going<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.920> look<00:02:44.980> at<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.340> main

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
first I'm going to look at the main

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.280 
first I'm going to look at the main
version<00:02:47.379> of<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.739> lick<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:49.110> it's<00:02:50.110> just

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
version of this lick so it's just

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.190 
version of this lick so it's just
corners<00:02:50.769> on<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.980> hi-hat<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:52.019> making<00:02:53.019> sure

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
corners on the hi-hat and making sure

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.640 
corners on the hi-hat and making sure
you<00:02:53.620> have<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:53.950> nice<00:02:54.660> ghost<00:02:55.660> note<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.140> rimshot

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
you have that nice ghost note in rimshot

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.789 
you have that nice ghost note in rimshot
distinction<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:58.150> slowly<00:02:58.840> this<00:02:59.319> is<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.620> main

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
distinction so slowly this is the main

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:26.670 
distinction so slowly this is the main
lick<00:03:12.239> okay<00:03:13.239> so<00:03:13.299> I<00:03:13.450> got<00:03:13.660> even<00:03:13.840> more<00:03:14.170> slowly<00:03:25.680> and

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
lick okay so I got even more slowly and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.949 
lick okay so I got even more slowly and
the<00:03:26.799> best<00:03:27.010> way<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.190> learn<00:03:27.400> this<00:03:27.639> is<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:28.090> hook<00:03:28.780> up

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
the best way to learn this is to hook up

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.589 
the best way to learn this is to hook up
a<00:03:29.019> metronome<00:03:29.590> on<00:03:30.010> eighth<00:03:30.609> notes<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.359> just

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
a metronome on eighth notes and just

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.159 
a metronome on eighth notes and just
repeat<00:03:32.079> it<00:03:32.109> so<00:03:32.349> you<00:03:32.440> have<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:33.480> or<00:03:34.480> sixteenth

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
repeat it so you have the or sixteenth

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.420 
repeat it so you have the or sixteenth
notes<00:03:35.319> however<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.620> want<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:35.919> that<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.250> have

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
notes however you want so that you have

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.580 
notes however you want so that you have
a<00:03:36.760> constant<00:03:37.540> thing<00:03:37.720> reminding<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.290> where<00:03:38.470> you

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
a constant thing reminding you where you

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.990 
a constant thing reminding you where you
should<00:03:38.620> be<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.130> you're<00:03:39.280> not<00:03:39.370> speeding<00:03:39.700> up<00:03:39.849> and

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
should be so you're not speeding up and

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.360 
should be so you're not speeding up and
slowing<00:03:40.120> down<00:03:40.389> as<00:03:40.810> you're<00:03:40.989> doing<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.410> so<00:03:44.370> once

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
slowing down as you're doing it so once

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.970 
slowing down as you're doing it so once
you<00:03:45.459> get<00:03:45.549> that<00:03:45.730> main<00:03:45.940> variation<00:03:46.510> down<00:03:46.980> and

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
you get that main variation down and

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.099 
you get that main variation down and
then<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.310> can<00:03:48.489> start<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.970> do<00:03:49.120> all<00:03:49.480> these<00:03:49.930> other

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
then you can start to do all these other

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.210 
then you can start to do all these other
little<00:03:50.349> cool<00:03:50.560> things<00:03:50.829> with<00:03:50.980> that

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
little cool things with that

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.849 
little cool things with that
so<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:52.150> first<00:03:52.599> variation<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:53.260> I<00:03:53.319> play<00:03:53.590> in

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
so the first variation that I play in

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.960 
so the first variation that I play in
the<00:03:53.950> video<00:03:54.160> is<00:03:54.639> just<00:03:55.799> moving<00:03:56.799> your<00:03:57.370> right<00:03:57.609> hand

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
the video is just moving your right hand

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.949 
the video is just moving your right hand
the<00:03:58.239> last<00:03:58.750> right<00:03:59.139> hand<00:03:59.380> hit<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:01.120> floor<00:04:01.419> tom<00:04:01.630> or

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
the last right hand hit to floor tom or

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.479 
the last right hand hit to floor tom or
frankly<00:04:02.500> wherever<00:04:02.769> you<00:04:02.889> want<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.250> put<00:04:03.400> it<00:04:03.900> so

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
frankly wherever you want to put it so

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:19.250 
frankly wherever you want to put it so
it<00:04:06.489> sounds<00:04:06.940> something<00:04:07.450> like<00:04:07.629> this

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.750 

so<00:04:20.260> it's<00:04:20.500> just<00:04:20.769> like<00:04:20.920> the<00:04:21.160> main<00:04:21.310> version<00:04:21.670> of

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
so it's just like the main version of

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.460 
so it's just like the main version of
the<00:04:21.850> like<00:04:22.000> except<00:04:22.420> you're<00:04:22.570> just<00:04:22.600> moving<00:04:22.960> that

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
the like except you're just moving that

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.220 
the like except you're just moving that
right<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:24.400> last<00:04:24.640> right<00:04:25.090> hand<00:04:25.330> hit<00:04:25.600> wherever

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
right that last right hand hit wherever

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.960 
right that last right hand hit wherever
you<00:04:26.410> want<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.890> really<00:04:26.950> like<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.730> floor

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
you want I really like it on the floor

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.860 
you want I really like it on the floor
tom<00:04:28.240> bellow<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.870> ride<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.530> kind<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:29.770> stuff

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
tom bellow the ride that kind of stuff

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.080 
tom bellow the ride that kind of stuff
so<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.680> next<00:04:32.890> variation<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.580> building<00:04:33.940> on

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
so the next variation is building on

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.220 
so the next variation is building on
that<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:35.010> it's<00:04:36.090> going<00:04:37.090> along<00:04:37.420> with<00:04:37.540> that<00:04:37.600> last

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
that and it's going along with that last

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.130 
that and it's going along with that last
right<00:04:38.530> hit<00:04:38.800> it's<00:04:39.310> turning<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:39.970> into<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.750> sixth

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
right hit it's turning that into a sixth

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.640 
right hit it's turning that into a sixth
thirty<00:04:41.800> Seconds<00:04:42.220> no<00:04:42.370> sorry<00:04:42.870> between<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.410> base

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
thirty Seconds no sorry between the base

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.110 
thirty Seconds no sorry between the base
and<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.070> right<00:04:45.640> hand<00:04:46.830> so<00:04:47.830> when<00:04:48.820> you<00:04:48.880> play<00:04:49.060> it

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
and the right hand so when you play it

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.940 
and the right hand so when you play it
slowly<00:04:49.420> you<00:04:49.660> can<00:04:49.810> also<00:04:49.960> do<00:04:50.230> triplets<00:04:50.830> with

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
slowly you can also do triplets with

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.650 
slowly you can also do triplets with
that<00:04:51.190> but<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:51.490> kind<00:04:51.700> of<00:04:51.790> consolidate<00:04:52.450> those

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
that but you kind of consolidate those

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.620 
that but you kind of consolidate those
two<00:04:53.100> bass<00:04:54.100> notes<00:04:54.460> into<00:04:54.850> one<00:04:55.090> when<00:04:55.330> you<00:04:55.420> speed

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
two bass notes into one when you speed

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.850 
two bass notes into one when you speed
it<00:04:55.720> up<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.080> way<00:04:56.140> I'm<00:04:56.290> showing<00:04:56.470> it<00:04:56.680> it's

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
it up so the way I'm showing it it's

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:14.010 
it up so the way I'm showing it it's
just<00:04:56.980> those<00:04:57.160> 30<00:04:57.400> seconds<00:04:57.790> so<00:04:58.540> slowly<00:04:59.410> it's<00:05:13.020> it

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
just those 30 seconds so slowly it's it

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.580 
just those 30 seconds so slowly it's it
makes<00:05:14.770> it<00:05:14.860> really<00:05:14.980> cool<00:05:15.220> and<00:05:15.280> kind<00:05:15.580> of<00:05:16.590> because

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
makes it really cool and kind of because

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.409 
makes it really cool and kind of because
it<00:05:17.680> varies<00:05:18.040> from<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.430> normal<00:05:18.940> like<00:05:19.120> straight

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
it varies from the normal like straight

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:30.960 
it varies from the normal like straight
pattern<00:05:19.630> at<00:05:19.960> house<00:05:29.310> so<00:05:30.310> just<00:05:30.520> building<00:05:30.850> on

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
pattern at house so just building on

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.260 
pattern at house so just building on
it's<00:05:31.570> just<00:05:31.810> continuing<00:05:32.230> to<00:05:32.290> build<00:05:32.410> on<00:05:32.620> itself

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
it's just continuing to build on itself

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.890 
it's just continuing to build on itself
and<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:35.320> final<00:05:35.770> variation<00:05:36.360> that<00:05:37.360> I<00:05:37.390> do<00:05:37.510> and

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
and so the final variation that I do and

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.470 
and so the final variation that I do and
the<00:05:38.280> hardest<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.580> took<00:05:39.760> me<00:05:39.880> probably<00:05:40.060> the

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
the hardest and took me probably the

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.909 
the hardest and took me probably the
same<00:05:40.750> amount<00:05:40.780> of<00:05:41.050> time<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.290> learn<00:05:41.590> as<00:05:41.770> the

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
same amount of time to learn as the

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.020 
same amount of time to learn as the
original<00:05:42.460> beat<00:05:42.640> itself<00:05:43.030> was<00:05:44.310> taking<00:05:45.310> those

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
original beat itself was taking those

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.480 
original beat itself was taking those
hi-hat<00:05:46.480> hits<00:05:46.750> and<00:05:47.020> matching<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.950> bass<00:05:48.130> drum

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
hi-hat hits and matching the bass drum

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.400 
hi-hat hits and matching the bass drum
instead<00:05:48.820> of<00:05:48.940> keeping<00:05:49.240> quarters<00:05:49.690> and<00:05:49.960> to<00:05:50.290> do

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
instead of keeping quarters and to do

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.030 
instead of keeping quarters and to do
this<00:05:50.530> I<00:05:50.650> also<00:05:50.860> added<00:05:51.220> in<00:05:51.460> a<00:05:51.520> bass<00:05:51.700> drum<00:05:51.730> hit<00:05:53.040> on

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
this I also added in a bass drum hit on

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.320 
this I also added in a bass drum hit on
be<00:05:54.280> free<00:05:54.460> because<00:05:54.610> there<00:05:54.820> wasn't<00:05:54.970> one<00:05:55.120> all

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
be free because there wasn't one all

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.600 
be free because there wasn't one all
there<00:05:55.540> ready<00:05:55.690> there<00:05:56.380> already<00:05:56.740> so<00:05:57.130> it<00:05:57.370> kind<00:05:57.550> of

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
there ready there already so it kind of

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.970 
there ready there already so it kind of
keeps<00:05:58.180> it<00:05:58.390> flowing<00:05:59.820> so<00:06:00.820> it's<00:06:01.540> just<00:06:01.900> it<00:06:02.440> sounds

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
keeps it flowing so it's just it sounds

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.440 
keeps it flowing so it's just it sounds
like<00:06:03.310> it<00:06:03.430> should<00:06:03.580> be<00:06:03.700> more<00:06:03.820> simple<00:06:04.150> than<00:06:04.210> it<00:06:04.270> is

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
like it should be more simple than it is

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.180 
like it should be more simple than it is
but<00:06:04.630> when<00:06:04.720> you<00:06:04.750> sit<00:06:04.990> down<00:06:05.110> and<00:06:05.320> sperry<00:06:05.740> awkward

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
but when you sit down and sperry awkward

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.180 
but when you sit down and sperry awkward
to<00:06:06.280> play<00:06:06.460> at<00:06:06.610> first<00:06:06.850> so<00:06:07.600> take<00:06:08.230> it<00:06:08.350> really<00:06:08.890> slow

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
to play at first so take it really slow

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.330 
to play at first so take it really slow
and<00:06:09.700> just<00:06:10.000> practice<00:06:10.390> lining<00:06:11.350> up<00:06:11.500> the<00:06:11.980> hi-hat

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
and just practice lining up the hi-hat

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:27.990 
and just practice lining up the hi-hat
with<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:12.550> bass<00:06:12.730> so<00:06:13.090> slowly

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.270 

so<00:06:29.080> that<00:06:30.080> also<00:06:30.320> takes<00:06:30.710> a<00:06:30.800> really<00:06:31.010> long<00:06:31.100> time

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
so that also takes a really long time

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.800 
so that also takes a really long time
but<00:06:31.460> it's<00:06:31.580> very<00:06:31.610> cool<00:06:32.030> and<00:06:32.300> very<00:06:32.360> worthwhile

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
but it's very cool and very worthwhile

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.370 
but it's very cool and very worthwhile
learning<00:06:34.090> so<00:06:35.090> to<00:06:35.360> wrap<00:06:35.450> it<00:06:35.630> up<00:06:35.720> I'll<00:06:35.930> play

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
learning so to wrap it up I'll play

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.640 
learning so to wrap it up I'll play
through<00:06:36.710> all<00:06:37.160> the<00:06:37.940> variations<00:06:38.600> for<00:06:38.960> a<00:06:39.230> few

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
through all the variations for a few

00:06:39.650 --> 00:07:15.100 
through all the variations for a few
bars<00:07:12.100> that's<00:07:13.100> all<00:07:13.310> there<00:07:13.460> is<00:07:13.580> to<00:07:13.760> it<00:07:13.910> so<00:07:14.090> I<00:07:14.780> hope

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
bars that's all there is to it so I hope

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.600 
bars that's all there is to it so I hope
you<00:07:15.290> enjoyed<00:07:15.590> learning<00:07:15.800> this<00:07:16.100> licking<00:07:16.460> can
