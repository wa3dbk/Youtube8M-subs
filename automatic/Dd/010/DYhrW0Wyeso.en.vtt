technique I think as well be fired the

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.770 
technique I think as well be fired the
east<00:01:40.590> coming<00:01:40.950> fool<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.789> he's<00:01:41.969> coming<00:01:42.450> forward

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
east coming fool so he's coming forward

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.539 
east coming fool so he's coming forward

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
and being aggressive particularly the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.550 
and being aggressive particularly the
forward<00:01:44.880> amongst<00:01:45.240> them<00:01:45.359> sometime<00:01:46.049> gangsters

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
forward amongst them sometime gangsters

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.069 
forward amongst them sometime gangsters
sites<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.759> use<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.149> energy<00:01:48.299> against

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
sites that to use that energy against

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.389 
sites that to use that energy against
their<00:01:49.200> opponent<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.039> then<00:01:50.130> things<00:01:50.340> like
