00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
is important I usually have really bad

00:00:47.700 --> 00:01:03.810 
is important I usually have really bad
form<00:00:48.239> so

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.200 

and<00:01:04.820> then<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:05.720> want<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:05.990> give<00:01:06.140> yourself<00:01:07.210> 30

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
and then you want to give yourself 30

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.300 
and then you want to give yourself 30
seconds<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:08.869> rest<00:01:09.110> if<00:01:09.530> you're<00:01:09.800> going<00:01:09.950> for

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
seconds of rest if you're going for

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.940 
seconds of rest if you're going for

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
toning and 60 to 90 seconds of rest if

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.040 
toning and 60 to 90 seconds of rest if
we<00:01:16.220> want<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.490> go<00:01:16.580> for<00:01:16.850> both<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.660> what<00:01:17.810> I<00:01:17.840> would

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
we want to go for both so what I would

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.230 
we want to go for both so what I would
do<00:01:18.200> here<00:01:18.440> is<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:18.770> was<00:01:19.190> able<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.460> do<00:01:19.640> 10<00:01:19.970> or

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
do here is so I was able to do 10 or

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.030 
do here is so I was able to do 10 or
maybe<00:01:20.479> was<00:01:20.659> 9<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:20.869> wasn't<00:01:21.080> really<00:01:21.380> counting<00:01:21.590> and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
maybe was 9 I wasn't really counting and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.190 
maybe was 9 I wasn't really counting and
then<00:01:22.940> you're<00:01:23.090> going<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.240> up<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.659> wait<00:01:23.840> for<00:01:24.140> the

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
then you're going to up the wait for the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.840 
then you're going to up the wait for the
next<00:01:24.500> set<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.009> next<00:01:25.159> step<00:01:25.280> would<00:01:25.460> be<00:01:25.520> 8

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
next set so the next step would be 8

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.120 
next set so the next step would be 8
reps<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:26.690> so<00:01:27.080> you<00:01:27.409> would<00:01:27.560> up<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.950> wait<00:01:28.100> a

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
reps and so you would up the wait a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.950 
reps and so you would up the wait a
little<00:01:28.340> bit<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:28.850> do<00:01:29.090> whatever<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.630> could<00:01:29.780> do

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
little bit and do whatever you could do

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.950 
little bit and do whatever you could do
with<00:01:30.200> good<00:01:30.440> form<00:01:31.030> until<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.149> max<00:01:32.390> out<00:01:32.600> of<00:01:32.780> 8

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
with good form until you max out of 8

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.109 
with good form until you max out of 8
reps<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:33.619> then<00:01:33.860> it<00:01:33.979> goes<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.700> weight<00:01:34.850> goes<00:01:35.060> up

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
reps and then it goes the weight goes up

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.080 
reps and then it goes the weight goes up
and<00:01:35.420> your<00:01:36.320> reps<00:01:36.530> go<00:01:36.740> down<00:01:36.979> until<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.610> do<00:01:37.759> for

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
and your reps go down until you do for

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.870 
and your reps go down until you do for
and<00:01:38.300> that's<00:01:38.390> what<00:01:38.780> ever<00:01:39.580> heavyweight<00:01:40.580> for<00:01:40.789> you

i'd like to do preacher curls as well at
the<00:01:49.429> gym<00:01:49.610> where<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:50.179> think<00:01:50.690> it's<00:01:50.780> pretty<00:01:50.960> girl

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
the gym where I think it's pretty girl

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.960 
the gym where I think it's pretty girl
where<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.009> have<00:01:52.160> your<00:01:54.009> your<00:01:55.009> arms<00:01:55.369> or<00:01:55.520> resting

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
where you have your your arms or resting

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.020 
where you have your your arms or resting
your<00:01:56.119> arms<00:01:56.390> are<00:01:56.539> resting<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.910> your<00:01:58.910> you

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
your arms are resting and your you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.080 
your arms are resting and your you
usually<00:01:59.330> using<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.869> barbell<00:02:00.110> but<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:01.850> can<00:02:01.970> do

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
usually using a barbell but you can do

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.499 
usually using a barbell but you can do
something<00:02:02.420> similar<00:02:02.689> like<00:02:03.409> this<00:02:04.119> put<00:02:05.119> your<00:02:05.270> leg

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
something similar like this put your leg

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.199 
something similar like this put your leg
out<00:02:05.689> right<00:02:05.990> here<00:02:08.290> and<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:10.429> really<00:02:10.610> isolates

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
out right here and it really isolates

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:26.520 
out right here and it really isolates
the<00:02:11.390> bicep

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.900 

so<00:02:27.530> then<00:02:27.740> i<00:02:27.950> maxed<00:02:28.310> out<00:02:28.430> at<00:02:28.460> eight<00:02:28.700> reps

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so then i maxed out at eight reps

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.420 
so then i maxed out at eight reps
they're<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.150> i<00:02:29.360> would<00:02:29.540> have<00:02:29.660> gone<00:02:30.100> at<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.220> lower

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430
