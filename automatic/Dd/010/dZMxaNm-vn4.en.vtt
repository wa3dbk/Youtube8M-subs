four<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.760> you'll<00:02:24.180> hear<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.780> three<00:02:25.680> buzz<00:02:25.890> sound

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
four and you'll hear a three buzz sound

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.390 
four and you'll hear a three buzz sound
and<00:02:27.260> there's<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.350> stick<00:02:28.620> around<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.190> tells

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
and there's a stick around that it tells

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.790 
and there's a stick around that it tells
you<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:30.000> let's<00:02:30.210> see<00:02:36.050> so<00:02:37.050> that's<00:02:37.290> you

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
you that so let's see so that's you

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.220 
you that so let's see so that's you
can't<00:02:38.070> miss<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.610> sound<00:02:38.790> obviously<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:40.110> this

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
can't miss that sound obviously so this

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.810 
can't miss that sound obviously so this
is<00:02:40.350> what<00:02:40.500> happened<00:02:40.830> now<00:02:41.010> once<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.400> push<00:02:41.640> on

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
is what happened now once you push on

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.360 
is what happened now once you push on
this<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.270> gonna<00:02:42.480> release<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:44.459> gas<00:02:44.610> connection

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
this is gonna release the gas connection

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.350 
this is gonna release the gas connection
and<00:02:47.370> then<00:02:47.490> you<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:47.870> untwist<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:53.240> so<00:02:54.240> that's

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
and then you can untwist this so that's

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.830 
and then you can untwist this so that's
it<00:02:54.480> now<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:54.780> carbonated<00:02:55.560> water<00:02:59.840> never

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
it now you have carbonated water never

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.110 
it now you have carbonated water never
fails<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:02.070> let's<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.430> I'm<00:03:02.520> gonna<00:03:02.640> make<00:03:02.910> this

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
fails so let's see I'm gonna make this

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.400 
fails so let's see I'm gonna make this
one<00:03:03.620> orange<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:06.690> don't<00:03:06.870> need<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.110> lot<00:03:07.380> of

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
one orange and you don't need a lot of

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.960 
one orange and you don't need a lot of
this<00:03:07.620> because<00:03:07.830> it's<00:03:07.980> heavily<00:03:08.250> constant<00:03:08.820> they

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
this because it's heavily constant they

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.670 
this because it's heavily constant they
didn't

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
didn't

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:19.000 
didn't
tilt<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:14.720> little<00:03:17.060> now<00:03:18.060> when<00:03:18.239> you're<00:03:18.390> adding

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
tilt it a little now when you're adding

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.280

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
bottles of the sodas be careful this

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.940 
bottles of the sodas be careful this
could<00:03:26.280> really<00:03:26.989> blow<00:03:27.989> up<00:03:28.140> in<00:03:28.290> your<00:03:28.320> face<00:03:28.440> and

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
could really blow up in your face and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.550 
could really blow up in your face and
then<00:03:29.250> just<00:03:29.430> close<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.200> twist<00:03:31.200> back<00:03:31.380> and

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
then just close it and twist back and

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.990 
then just close it and twist back and
forth<00:03:31.830> just<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.220> little<00:03:32.989> now<00:03:33.989> there<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.260> go

so would I recommend this absolutely

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.820 
so would I recommend this absolutely
hands-down<00:03:39.170> especially<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.350> deal<00:03:40.530> where<00:03:40.739> you

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
hands-down especially the deal where you

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.590 
hands-down especially the deal where you
get<00:03:40.980> three<00:03:41.250> bottles<00:03:41.670> instead<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.150> just<00:03:42.360> the
