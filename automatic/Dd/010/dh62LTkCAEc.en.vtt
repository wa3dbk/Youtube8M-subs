here we're outlining the C chord we have

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.590 
here we're outlining the C chord we have
C<00:01:58.140> E<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.530> G<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.009> we're<00:01:59.579> playing<00:01:59.819> the<00:01:59.999> sixth<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
C E and G and we're playing the sixth of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.410 
C E and G and we're playing the sixth of
the<00:02:01.020> C<00:02:01.289> chord<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.649> well<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.100> we<00:02:02.249> have<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:03.149> root

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the C chord as well so we have the root

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.630 
the C chord as well so we have the root
third<00:02:03.929> fifth<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.679> here's<00:02:04.859> the<00:02:05.039> sixth<00:02:05.399> the

third fifth and here's the sixth the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.609 
third fifth and here's the sixth the
sixth<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.119> always<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> whole<00:02:06.659> step<00:02:06.929> above<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
sixth is always a whole step above the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.520 
sixth is always a whole step above the
fifth<00:02:11.420> when<00:02:12.420> we<00:02:12.540> take<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.870> two<00:02:13.049> other<00:02:13.200> Keys

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
fifth when we take that two other Keys

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.309 
fifth when we take that two other Keys
like<00:02:13.860> F<00:02:14.450> we're<00:02:15.450> going<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.690> have<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.110> same

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
like F we're going to have the same

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.220 
like F we're going to have the same
pattern<00:02:16.700> root<00:02:17.700> third<00:02:18.150> fifth<00:02:18.180> here's<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
pattern root third fifth here's the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.400 
pattern root third fifth here's the
sixth<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.709> whole<00:02:19.980> step<00:02:20.250> above<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.180> fifth<00:02:21.629> we're

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
sixth a whole step above the fifth we're

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.860 
sixth a whole step above the fifth we're
skipping<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.950> note

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.280 

here<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.800> G<00:02:28.010> root<00:02:28.640> third<00:02:29.180> fifth<00:02:29.480> here's

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
here it is in G root third fifth here's

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.960 
here it is in G root third fifth here's
the<00:02:30.530> sixth<00:02:30.890> we're<00:02:31.099> going<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.280> skip<00:02:31.550> that<00:02:31.730> note

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
the sixth we're going to skip that note

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.370 
the sixth we're going to skip that note
because<00:02:32.150> it's<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.569> whole<00:02:32.720> step<00:02:32.989> above<00:02:33.319> the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
because it's a whole step above the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:43.110 
because it's a whole step above the
fifth

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:53.430
