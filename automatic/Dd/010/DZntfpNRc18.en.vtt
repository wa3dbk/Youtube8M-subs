models of this device unfortunately this

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.369

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
so that's a little bit disappointing but

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.700 
so that's a little bit disappointing but
it<00:01:06.000> could<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.540> worse<00:01:06.750> now<00:01:07.170> looking<00:01:07.439> at<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.590> from

it could be worse now looking at it from

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.140 
it could be worse now looking at it from

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
an angle I can kind of see it looks like

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.460 
an angle I can kind of see it looks like
there<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.420> screen<00:01:09.720> protector<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.290> this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
an immediate problem here and maybe you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.950 
an immediate problem here and maybe you
can<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> as<00:01:55.829> well<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.969> all<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.210> Chinese

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
can see it as well it's all in Chinese

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.469 
can see it as well it's all in Chinese
and<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.560> don't<00:01:58.619> speak<00:01:59.159> or<00:01:59.399> read<00:01:59.579> Chinese<00:02:00.060> so

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
and I don't speak or read Chinese so

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.429 
and I don't speak or read Chinese so
we're<00:02:01.229> gonna<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.530> guess<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:01.890> this

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
we're gonna have to guess at this

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.300 
we're gonna have to guess at this
alright<00:02:04.439> that's<00:02:04.680> trying<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.950> set<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
alright that's trying to set up the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.080 
alright that's trying to set up the
Wi-Fi<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.380> I'll<00:02:07.469> go<00:02:07.530> ahead<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.770> hit<00:02:07.829> that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.059 

and<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.660> wants<00:02:10.840> me<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:10.989> sign<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:14.620> right<00:02:14.770> we

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
and it wants me to sign in all right we

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.360 
and it wants me to sign in all right we
should<00:02:15.099> be<00:02:15.280> signed<00:02:15.580> in<00:02:15.730> at<00:02:15.849> this<00:02:15.940> point<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:17.370> we

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
should be signed in at this point so we

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.000 
should be signed in at this point so we
can<00:02:18.520> hit<00:02:18.640> next<00:02:19.200> I'm<00:02:20.200> guessing<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.620> says<00:02:20.800> next

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
can hit next I'm guessing that says next

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.170 
can hit next I'm guessing that says next
I'm<00:02:21.220> gonna<00:02:21.310> go<00:02:21.430> ahead<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.640> skip<00:02:21.849> over<00:02:22.000> that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
I'm gonna go ahead and skip over that

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.040 
I'm gonna go ahead and skip over that
whatever<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.720> is

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
whatever that is

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.390 
whatever that is
this<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.950> would<00:02:24.069> guess<00:02:24.250> the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
this is the I would guess the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.270 
this is the I would guess the
fingerprint<00:02:24.880> sensor<00:02:25.090> setup<00:02:25.810> if<00:02:26.769> I<00:02:26.920> remember

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
fingerprint sensor setup if I remember

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.140 
fingerprint sensor setup if I remember
correctly<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.580> think<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.030> the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
correctly I think this is the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.759 
correctly I think this is the
fingerprint<00:02:28.480> sensor<00:02:28.660> down<00:02:28.959> here<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.650> that

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
fingerprint sensor down here and that

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.740 
fingerprint sensor down here and that
just<00:02:29.920> took<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.130> back<00:02:30.310> we're<00:02:31.269> gonna<00:02:31.420> skip<00:02:31.660> over

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
just took it back we're gonna skip over

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.970 
just took it back we're gonna skip over
this<00:02:32.019> we're<00:02:32.260> gonna<00:02:32.410> skip<00:02:32.650> over<00:02:32.739> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
this we're gonna skip over the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.860 
this we're gonna skip over the
fingerprint<00:02:33.400> setup<00:02:33.730> because<00:02:34.150> really<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.540> need

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
fingerprint setup because really I need

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.210 
fingerprint setup because really I need
to<00:02:34.989> get<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.230> where<00:02:35.349> I<00:02:35.380> can<00:02:35.590> set<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.980> language

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
to get to where I can set the language

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.220 
to get to where I can set the language
now<00:02:37.090> luckily<00:02:37.269> I<00:02:37.420> did<00:02:37.599> see<00:02:37.750> somebody<00:02:38.050> in<00:02:38.140> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
now luckily I did see somebody in the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.229 
now luckily I did see somebody in the
car<00:02:38.410> set<00:02:38.769> this<00:02:38.890> up<00:02:39.069> earlier<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.700> kind<00:02:40.120> of

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
car set this up earlier so I kind of

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.210 
car set this up earlier so I kind of
know<00:02:40.360> where<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.660> is<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.019> where<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.200> go<00:02:41.349> so<00:02:42.160> I'm

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
know where it is and where to go so I'm

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.440 
know where it is and where to go so I'm
gonna<00:02:42.340> come<00:02:42.549> down<00:02:42.580> here<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
gonna come down here this is the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.990 
gonna come down here this is the
advanced<00:02:43.989> settings<00:02:44.440> option<00:02:44.920> this<00:02:45.640> should<00:02:45.880> be

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
advanced settings option this should be

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.880 
advanced settings option this should be
the<00:02:46.120> language<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:47.260> should<00:02:47.530> be<00:02:47.560> where<00:02:47.830> I

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
the language and this should be where I

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.890 
the language and this should be where I
change<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.459> English<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.390> I'm<00:02:49.450> now<00:02:49.600> able<00:02:49.750> to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
change it to English and I'm now able to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.320 
change it to English and I'm now able to
actually<00:02:50.080> read<00:02:50.440> things<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:51.910> can<00:02:51.970> change<00:02:52.180> the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
actually read things so I can change the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.000 
actually read things so I can change the
keyboard<00:02:52.750> over<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.989> use<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.140> Android<00:02:53.560> AOSP

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010

keyboard over to use the Android AOSP
keyboard<00:02:54.580> or<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:54.940> can<00:02:55.090> use<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.330> one<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.540> came

interesting<00:03:13.750> anyway<00:03:14.590> we'll<00:03:14.799> go<00:03:14.920> back<00:03:15.100> out

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280

says<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.299> battery<00:03:16.540> level<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.930> 47%<00:03:17.590> but<00:03:18.250> I

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
says the battery level is 47% but I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.310 
says the battery level is 47% but I
believe<00:03:18.579> this<00:03:18.730> supports<00:03:19.120> quick<00:03:19.450> charge<00:03:19.690> 2.0

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
believe this supports quick charge 2.0

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.630 
believe this supports quick charge 2.0
so<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.560> may<00:03:20.769> have<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.040> try<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.280> with<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.430> quick

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
so I may have to try it with a quick

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.190 
so I may have to try it with a quick
charger<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.209> from<00:03:22.540> here<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.780> can<00:03:22.930> do<00:03:23.049> all<00:03:23.170> of

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
charger and from here you can do all of

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.170 
charger and from here you can do all of
your<00:03:23.380> settings<00:03:23.709> there's<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.250> touch<00:03:24.579> now<00:03:25.150> I

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
your settings there's you touch now I

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.610 
your settings there's you touch now I
started<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.750> mention<00:03:25.840> earlier<00:03:26.109> I<00:03:26.290> don't<00:03:26.470> think

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
started to mention earlier I don't think

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.960 
started to mention earlier I don't think
I<00:03:26.680> actually<00:03:26.799> mentioned<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.519> doesn't<00:03:27.730> have

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
I actually mentioned it it doesn't have

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.460 
I actually mentioned it it doesn't have
any<00:03:28.150> on-screen<00:03:28.660> buttons<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.140> doesn't<00:03:29.380> have

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
any on-screen buttons it doesn't have

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.470 
any on-screen buttons it doesn't have
any<00:03:29.620> capacitive<00:03:30.160> buttons<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.910> device<00:03:31.150> itself

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
any capacitive buttons the device itself

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.390 
any capacitive buttons the device itself
I<00:03:31.630> think<00:03:31.690> has<00:03:32.079> capacitive<00:03:32.680> buttons<00:03:32.950> that<00:03:33.220> will

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
I think has capacitive buttons that will

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.520 
I think has capacitive buttons that will
be<00:03:33.549> enabled<00:03:33.730> when<00:03:34.180> cyanogen<00:03:35.019> comes<00:03:35.230> out<00:03:35.380> for

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
be enabled when cyanogen comes out for

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.770 
be enabled when cyanogen comes out for
this<00:03:35.620> device<00:03:35.829> but<00:03:36.250> by<00:03:36.579> default<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.120> has<00:03:37.150> you

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
this device but by default it has you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.780 
this device but by default it has you
touch<00:03:38.019> so<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.319> use<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:39.130> button<00:03:39.400> here<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.579> do

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
touch so you use the button here to do

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.250 
touch so you use the button here to do
everything<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:40.750> basically<00:03:40.959> you<00:03:41.079> can<00:03:41.200> do

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
everything so basically you can do

everything so basically you can do
