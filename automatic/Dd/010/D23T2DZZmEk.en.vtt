is this vented slightly textured plastic
there's<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:06.610> don't<00:03:06.790> think<00:03:06.940> there's<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.239> fan<00:03:07.480> in

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
there's I don't think there's a fan in

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.729 
there's I don't think there's a fan in
there<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:08.019> can<00:03:08.380> see<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:09.090> sumeet<00:03:10.090> six<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:11.200> this<00:03:11.620> is

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
there I can see a sumeet six so this is

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.610 
there I can see a sumeet six so this is
anything<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.220> gonna<00:03:12.489> do<00:03:12.610> most<00:03:12.820> of<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.000> cooling

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
anything is gonna do most of the cooling

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.020 
anything is gonna do most of the cooling
same<00:03:14.620> for<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.830> bottom<00:03:14.950> except<00:03:15.400> you<00:03:15.519> have<00:03:15.640> four

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
same for the bottom except you have four

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.880 
same for the bottom except you have four
rubber<00:03:17.019> feet<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:18.959> then<00:03:19.959> on<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.410> back<00:03:20.620> you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
rubber feet and then on the back you

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.410 
rubber feet and then on the back you
have<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:22.360> zoom<00:03:22.570> in<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.720> little<00:03:22.780> bit

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.870 

so<00:03:25.990> that<00:03:26.140> power<00:03:26.530> button<00:03:27.180> USB<00:03:28.410> Ethernet<00:03:29.880> this

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
so that power button USB Ethernet this

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.720 
so that power button USB Ethernet this
appears<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.300> be<00:03:31.420> a<00:03:31.540> hard<00:03:32.410> reset<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.069> then

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
appears to be a hard reset and then

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:42.000 
appears to be a hard reset and then
there's<00:03:33.970> your<00:03:34.680> power<00:03:35.680> input<00:03:40.530> also<00:03:41.530> in<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:41.800> box

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
there's your power input also in the box

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.580 
there's your power input also in the box
we<00:03:42.250> have<00:03:45.600> plain<00:03:46.600> old<00:03:46.780> power<00:03:46.990> connector<00:03:47.380> I

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
we have plain old power connector I

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:59.550 
we have plain old power connector I
should've<00:03:48.490> guessed<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.930> here's<00:03:59.320> your

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
should've guessed and here's your

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.210 
should've guessed and here's your
ethernet<00:04:00.070> cord<00:04:01.170> kind<00:04:02.170> of<00:04:02.230> short<00:04:02.470> but<00:04:02.860> it'll<00:04:03.100> do

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
ethernet cord kind of short but it'll do

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.710 
ethernet cord kind of short but it'll do
the<00:04:03.250> job<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:05.100> nope<00:04:06.100> doesn't<00:04:07.060> appear<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.540> be<00:04:07.690> a

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
the job and nope doesn't appear to be a

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.140 
the job and nope doesn't appear to be a
USB<00:04:08.470> connection<00:04:08.739> in<00:04:08.950> there<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:13.090> pretty

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
USB connection in there so it's pretty

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.120 
USB connection in there so it's pretty
popular<00:04:13.450> must<00:04:13.870> people<00:04:13.989> have<00:04:14.170> one<00:04:14.380> otherwise

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
popular must people have one otherwise

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.000 
popular must people have one otherwise
you<00:04:15.430> could<00:04:15.580> just<00:04:15.760> buy<00:04:15.850> it

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
you could just buy it

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.289 
you could just buy it
and<00:04:18.010> then<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.519> just<00:04:18.760> her<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:18.940> quick<00:04:19.120> size

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
and then I just her a quick size

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.260 
and then I just her a quick size
comparison<00:04:19.329> we<00:04:20.019> had<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.620> just<00:04:21.190> reach<00:04:21.579> over<00:04:21.730> here

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.040 

this<00:04:25.270> is<00:04:25.390> a<00:04:25.419> Seagate<00:04:25.930> free-agent<00:04:28.050> extreme

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
this is a Seagate free-agent extreme

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.380 
this is a Seagate free-agent extreme
also<00:04:29.560> one<00:04:29.740> terabyte<00:04:30.100> we<00:04:30.520> did<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.700> unboxing<00:04:31.300> this

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
also one terabyte we did a unboxing this

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.570 
also one terabyte we did a unboxing this
a<00:04:31.450> couple<00:04:31.720> days<00:04:31.840> ago<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:35.250> just<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.400> compare

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
a couple days ago so just to compare

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:45.030 
a couple days ago so just to compare
them<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:41.070> WD<00:04:42.070> isn't<00:04:42.790> as<00:04:42.880> tall<00:04:43.620> but<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.770> is<00:04:45.010> a

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
them the WD isn't as tall but it is a

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.070 
them the WD isn't as tall but it is a
lot<00:04:45.430> thicker<00:04:45.940> than<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.870> Seagate<00:04:48.030> so

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
lot thicker than the Seagate so

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.150 
lot thicker than the Seagate so
vertically<00:04:50.080> it's<00:04:50.290> gonna<00:04:50.410> take<00:04:50.590> up<00:04:50.740> more<00:04:50.890> room

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
vertically it's gonna take up more room

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.760 
vertically it's gonna take up more room
and<00:04:51.430> then<00:04:51.550> if<00:04:51.700> you<00:04:51.790> put<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.120> horizontally<00:04:52.770> this

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
and then if you put it horizontally this

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.950 
and then if you put it horizontally this
you<00:04:54.130> could<00:04:54.340> put<00:04:54.910> something<00:04:55.090> on<00:04:55.360> and<00:04:55.690> it<00:04:55.810> has

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
you could put something on and it has

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.460 
you could put something on and it has
feet<00:04:56.320> to<00:04:57.040> place<00:04:57.660> horizontally<00:04:58.660> whereas<00:04:59.290> this

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
feet to place horizontally whereas this

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.030 
feet to place horizontally whereas this
one<00:05:00.720> it<00:05:01.720> doesn't<00:05:02.080> have<00:05:02.169> feet<00:05:02.440> so<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:02.770> guess

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
one it doesn't have feet so I guess

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.020 
one it doesn't have feet so I guess
you're<00:05:03.190> just<00:05:03.220> gonna<00:05:03.490> want<00:05:03.700> to<00:05:03.790> keep<00:05:03.880> it

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
you're just gonna want to keep it

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.850 
you're just gonna want to keep it
vertical<00:05:06.810> but<00:05:07.810> yeah<00:05:07.960> that's<00:05:08.320> about<00:05:08.500> it

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
vertical but yeah that's about it

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.620 
vertical but yeah that's about it
