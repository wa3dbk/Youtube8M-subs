that<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.399> Bush<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:08.700> playing

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.220 

I<00:02:18.709> think<00:02:19.129> I<00:02:19.459> was<00:02:19.879> four<00:02:20.120> every<00:02:20.359> Democrat<00:02:20.840> lost

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.420 
I think I was four every Democrat lost
in<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.650> 80<00:02:21.829> 88<00:02:22.750> 488<00:02:23.750> do<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.709> work<00:02:24.859> for<00:02:24.890> Carter

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
the good thing about it is I didn't do

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.869 
the good thing about it is I didn't do
anything<00:02:39.049> in<00:02:39.290> 1994<00:02:40.189> and<00:02:40.310> they<00:02:40.370> lost<00:02:40.579> without

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879
