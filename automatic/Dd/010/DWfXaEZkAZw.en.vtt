00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 in this third book of the series the people 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.350
 end up getting to know the most 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.980
 interesting by percy jackson a black 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:19.109
 jec 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:20.939
 soon after the money was beauty I am 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.430
 luiz goalkeeper does not read and today I came to do 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.560
 restores the book that is already long awaited 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.480
 especially for guys who like 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.900
 Juvenile child who is the third book 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.830
 b series is if jackson the curse of the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.630
 Titan 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.239
 in this destination book think a little 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.790
 better known and needed as always 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.770
 face villains and monsters who want to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.239
 destroy the Olympus 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.040
 the book itself maintains the same 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.289
 characteristics of the first two 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.149
 books I already reviewed here in the blog 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.969
 The difference is that this time we have 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.430
 a new character on the cover that falls already 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.160
 I was very anxious to know what it is 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.660
 the black jack one of the fellows handles 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.270
 that they had not heard much 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 well the first books here it appears 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.430
 logo on the cover has encouraged me a lot to 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.799
 more interesting reading is that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.770
 now the intrinsic has launched a new 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.110
 i think jackson books collection i 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.119
 I went to the bookstore to tell that from here I 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 I had read through kindle but I 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.130
 I went to buy power to make an example. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.170
 a stent is and all fifth book are in 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.490
 promotion now in all bookstores 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.259
 and in online bookstores is 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.619
 just obtained by silk from the cover 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.780
 old and have been on the cover the new 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.299
 This is very interesting because it 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.329
 the book gets cheaper somehow 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.000
 and also causes the soldering 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.520
 news big fans of the series gave one more 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.200
 collection to have on your shelf over the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.000
 history of the curse of the titan 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 it starts with basically how the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.070
 other books jackson ps started 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.890

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.040
 called his friend group website saying 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.659
 that there are two more means in another 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.520
 school that they need to go there and 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.000
 to rescue those same blood 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.110
 there goes thaliana bete and annabeth much 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.100
 Afternoon to Alberto and pps go there 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.190
 to try to bring 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.910
 these are my dreams procon camp - 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.280
 in've seen right now today has less know 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.530
 It's a lot of bullshit, it's a problem, they're 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.650
 come to rescue these angus media 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.360
 there are already some monsters there 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.030
 lurks and then you've seen that 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.590
 micky bared is the sanction of the law the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.230
 monsters and everything 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.020
 The problem is that there in the middle of the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.020
 Ana is eventually kidnapped by a 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.600
 of these monsters is what causes the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.270
 Price will be free I need a lot 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.240
 save andef just have another problem 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.160
 It's also in that half-fight that he had 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.210
 appeared a new goddess and her 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.990
 companions 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.200
 aet mystery hunting goddess and only the 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.570
 hunters she lives with one with the pld 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.990
 13-year-old child trainer who are 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.570
 their hunters and are people who hunt 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.030
 things together with the actress and article 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.560
 was there opened that monster and talking 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.450
 by Roberto something wrong I 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.000
 I need to let the monster boss 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.700
 simmons who attacked us because he 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.770
 can destroy Olympus and the approach to 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.520
 same old story and she goes after 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.590
 of herself, who ends up guessing 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.490
 kidnapped by monster fuck boss 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.100
 of all and then our group dps italy 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.000
 groove and now together with the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.580
 artmix has to find a way to save the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.130
 artemis find out who this monster is 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.130
 fuck they are so afraid that the 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.560
 Olympus is so afraid and also looking for 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.780
 a way to save the annabeth that is 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.000
 everything intertwined the story revolves in 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.030
 around that they are hunting this monster 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.830
 which is pretty cool and everything else is here in 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.710
 title fight the crazy things 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.100
 that happened in other books as per 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.800
 example 14 year old children riding 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.530
 on top of a wild boar for hard 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.530
 as there are many, many kilometers is 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.160
 keep happening to what people 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.080
 more ethical ends up being a bit 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.210
 disgusted to read the book, I think more 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.520
 you end up taking these points that are 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.760
 more children's even and more indicated 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.460
 for children 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.840
 the book ends up being very good she's active 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.120
 it is also very good 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.920
 click on the link and Guarani actually I think 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.350
 that if you already gave the first two 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.210
 ps jackson's books are looking for 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.310
 knowing about the third is because you already 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.230
 must have enjoyed a story style 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.540
 He'll probably enjoy it then. 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.670
 even more the curse of the titan 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.800
 Something else happened in this one from the book. 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.010
 which made me become 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.590
 very good is that the price powers 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.360
 are more controlled in the other two 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.460
 first few books I sometimes thought 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.620
 I think it 's a shit I sometimes thought 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.480
 he is super fuck is that I think 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.700
 is there in the middle that is 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.750
 discovering who he really is 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.720
 can 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.880
 he can not do and he has nothing to do 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.860
 Speak fucking won boston got to do 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.570
 This has nothing to do precisely 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.780
 the opposite speaks fucking or play is very 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.910
 Fuck, he can get himself there. 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.830
 Another cool thing is also that we 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.840
 begins to meet other gods who 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.300
 people have not yet had contact as per 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.790
 example the art itself is one of the 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.330
 main characters of this story and the 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.860
 people know other gods like hephaestus 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.750
 Aphrodite which is very cool because the 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.560
 people begin to create the 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.870
 stereotype of each god but you see 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.350
 starts reading the part that appears 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.990
 Aphrodite, are you sure that she will be the 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.210
 Spanish if you think that garlic also 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.920
 these playboys that gets spent 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.440
 father's money just goes with clothes 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.650
 mark the time stand and here the people 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.410
 Do you know atella too? 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.870
 sure she's that boring aunt 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.180
 because we do not know when 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.740
 family lunches and compensation more 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.620
 once we have contact with the 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.900
 poseidon that would find datena that 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.750
 house had a boring pessimist was not 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.660
 the Poseidon elt using the time he 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.930
 cool child is vacant beach of 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.870
 Bermuda shirt will walk not even there for nothing 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.630
 it still has the - it is as if it were a 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.430
 workaholic the actress who 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.920
 seems like a spoiled child who knows if the 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.280
 bag and zeus that does not make bills is 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.830
 everybody 's dad , he tries to finish 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.120
 helping them to set things up more or 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.830
 any less 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.710
 the same time and at the end of the 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.380
 accounts that you can not control 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.180
 the children and none is go read read 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.010
 curse of the titan 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.080
 if you already gave the first two books 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.080
 and liked at least a little bit the two 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.810
 and neither is the third book to be. 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.970
 curse of the titan guy goes deep if you 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.340
 I like you wait until you love this 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.169
 At least until now I have been the 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.310
 book I identified myself more and 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:07.300
 I liked it the most 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:09.639
 this for all the negative propaganda by the 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.990
 form of the author written by the size 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:16.990
 of powers to sheik the blood means 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.300
 had and by the very writing of the miracle 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.180
 which I found to have improved a lot 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.620
 good in this third book in the series 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.050
 But that's it folks I hope they have 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.340
 liked the video if you 've read the 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.070

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:41.530
 opinion was the best book in the series until 

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.450
 now is this and is one of the few that I 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.810
 I set up during this book the first 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:51.000
 Dude, I got really pissed when I
