00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
running I think they eight or nine of

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.570 
running I think they eight or nine of
one<00:01:34.270> out<00:01:34.390> of<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.570> last<00:01:34.690> 16<00:01:35.110> runners<00:01:35.740> me<00:01:35.920> saying

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
one out of the last 16 runners me saying

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.550 
one out of the last 16 runners me saying
that<00:01:36.700> so<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.780> they're<00:01:38.020> just<00:01:38.050> coming<00:01:38.380> into

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.990 
that so that they're just coming into
form<00:01:38.800> and<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:39.070> think<00:01:39.280> they're<00:01:39.430> improving<00:01:39.729> it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
form and I think they're improving it

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.210 
form and I think they're improving it
but<00:01:40.750> they've<00:01:40.869> got<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.080> keep<00:01:41.470> stepping<00:01:41.860> up<00:01:41.979> here

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
but they've got to keep stepping up here

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.670 
but they've got to keep stepping up here

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
Marlin for duration it was probably a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.160 
Marlin for duration it was probably a
stipulation<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.850> he'll<00:01:55.360> get<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.539> viola<00:01:55.840> for<00:01:56.020> his

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
in imagination at all I think I'm

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.500 
in imagination at all I think I'm
talking<00:05:02.550> about<00:05:02.670> sense<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.180> you're<00:05:03.270> doing<00:05:03.420> on

a<00:05:03.540> rubbish<00:05:07.760> listen<00:05:08.760> I<00:05:08.880> must<00:05:09.120> just<00:05:09.470> ask<00:05:10.470> you

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
a rubbish listen I must just ask you

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.390 
a rubbish listen I must just ask you
before<00:05:10.680> you<00:05:10.890> go

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
before you go

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.400 
before you go
are<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:11.970> conclusively<00:05:12.690> ruling<00:05:13.080> out<00:05:13.230> the<00:05:13.260> idea

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
are you conclusively ruling out the idea

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.020 
are you conclusively ruling out the idea
of<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.920> Eclipse<00:05:14.310> right<00:05:15.120> well<00:05:15.900> that's<00:05:16.080> not<00:05:17.030> at

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
of the Eclipse right well that's not at

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.470 
of the Eclipse right well that's not at
the<00:05:18.210> moment<00:05:18.540> in<00:05:18.990> my<00:05:19.320> mind<00:05:20.130> I<00:05:20.520> mean<00:05:20.880> twice<00:05:21.090> Ava's

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
the moment in my mind I mean twice Ava's

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.320 
the moment in my mind I mean twice Ava's
probably<00:05:21.810> I<00:05:22.700> mean<00:05:23.700> I<00:05:23.790> think<00:05:23.850> we<00:05:24.000> wanted<00:05:24.240> to

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
probably I mean I think we wanted to

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.750 
probably I mean I think we wanted to
take<00:05:24.480> it<00:05:24.600> step<00:05:24.810> by<00:05:24.870> step<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:25.440> I<00:05:25.530> think<00:05:25.560> but<00:05:25.860> by

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
take it step by step and I think but by

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.700 
take it step by step and I think but by
your<00:05:27.000> get<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.360> idea<00:05:27.660> and<00:05:28.110> then<00:05:28.290> we'll<00:05:28.500> go<00:05:28.590> from

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
your get the idea and then we'll go from

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.310 
your get the idea and then we'll go from
