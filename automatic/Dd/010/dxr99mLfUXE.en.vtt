00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
to show you what I mean so just imagine

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.290 
to show you what I mean so just imagine
you're<00:00:31.949> playing<00:00:32.040> two<00:00:32.250> points<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.120> make<00:00:33.270> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
you're playing two points and you make a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.240 
you're playing two points and you make a
full<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:34.020> confident<00:00:34.590> forehand<00:00:34.980> swing

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
full you know confident forehand swing

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.700 
full you know confident forehand swing
and<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:36.420> missed<00:00:36.690> by<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> couple<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.530> feet

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and you missed by like a couple of feet

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.540 
and you missed by like a couple of feet
and<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.120> nice<00:00:39.739> confident<00:00:40.739> swing<00:00:41.070> but

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and so it's a nice confident swing but

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.280 
and so it's a nice confident swing but
you<00:00:41.670> missed<00:00:41.850> by<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.360> couple<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.930> feet<00:00:43.079> wasn't

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
you missed by a couple of feet wasn't

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.810 
you missed by a couple of feet wasn't
terribly<00:00:43.739> off<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.160> missed<00:00:44.370> by<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> little

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
terribly off but you missed by a little

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.750 
terribly off but you missed by a little
bit<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.510> most<00:00:45.809> common<00:00:46.440> reaction<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> see

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
something like this and they just kind

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.130 
something like this and they just kind
of<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:02.940> guide<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> next<00:01:03.449> one<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.870> because

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
they tell themselves oh the problem is I

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.500 
they tell themselves oh the problem is I
swung<00:01:07.260> too<00:01:07.619> fast<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.340> swung<00:01:08.549> too<00:01:08.760> hard<00:01:09.030> that's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
swung too fast I swung too hard that's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.039 
swung too fast I swung too hard that's
absolutely<00:01:10.470> wrong<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> case<00:01:12.840> if

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
absolutely wrong if that was the case if

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.660 
absolutely wrong if that was the case if
the<00:01:13.170> problem<00:01:13.530> was<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.830> swung<00:01:14.189> too<00:01:14.369> hard

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the problem was that you swung too hard

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.730 
the problem was that you swung too hard
then<00:01:15.420> nobody<00:01:15.840> would<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:16.049> able<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.320> swing<00:01:16.590> any

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
then nobody would be able to swing any

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.859 
then nobody would be able to swing any
faster<00:01:17.220> than<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.759> did<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.299> make<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
faster than you just did and make the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.020 
faster than you just did and make the
forehand<00:01:19.290> which<00:01:19.890> obviously<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.729> case

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
forehand which obviously is not the case

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.749 
forehand which obviously is not the case
because<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.560> players<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.979> TV<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.490> even<00:01:23.580> at

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
because we see players on TV and even at

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.090 
because we see players on TV and even at
your<00:01:23.880> local<00:01:24.090> courts<00:01:24.930> hitting<00:01:25.290> huge<00:01:25.710> shots

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
your local courts hitting huge shots

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.510 
your local courts hitting huge shots
that<00:01:26.310> still<00:01:26.610> land<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:26.970> play<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:28.159> what<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that still land in play so what is the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
that still land in play so what is the
fix<00:01:29.790> well<00:01:30.210> there's<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.479> lot<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.930> different

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
fix well there's a lot of different

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620 
fix well there's a lot of different
factors<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> play<00:01:32.310> into<00:01:32.340> exactly<00:01:33.240> where<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
factors that play into exactly where the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.359 
factors that play into exactly where the
ball<00:01:33.780> goes<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.650> we're<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> focus<00:01:35.070> on

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
ball goes but we're going to focus on

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.940 
ball goes but we're going to focus on
these<00:01:35.610> single<00:01:36.180> biggest<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.140> impacts

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
these single biggest one that impacts

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.530 
these single biggest one that impacts
whether<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> ball<00:01:38.700> goes<00:01:38.880> too<00:01:39.090> far<00:01:39.329> and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
whether or not the ball goes too far and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.109 
whether or not the ball goes too far and
that<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.380> angle<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.070> your<00:01:41.130> racquet<00:01:41.909> face
