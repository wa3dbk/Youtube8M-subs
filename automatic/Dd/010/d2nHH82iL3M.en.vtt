Los Angeles on what California does when

the sky refuses to open up there's lots
of<00:00:17.250> water<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.820> those<00:00:17.970> storm<00:00:18.359> clouds<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:19.080> the

of water in those storm clouds but the

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.599 
of water in those storm clouds but the
problem<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.830> water<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.369> there

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
problem is that the water is up there

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.960 
problem is that the water is up there
not<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> ground<00:00:21.900> where<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:22.380> needed
