once<00:00:21.130> again<00:00:21.460> and<00:00:21.670> the<00:00:22.390> topic<00:00:22.779> of<00:00:22.930> this<00:00:23.140> lesson

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
once again and the topic of this lesson

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.200 
once again and the topic of this lesson
is<00:00:23.680> going<00:00:23.830> to<00:00:23.920> be<00:00:24.040> the<00:00:24.250> first<00:00:24.490> position<00:00:25.000> blue

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
is going to be the first position blue

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.630 
is going to be the first position blue
scale<00:00:25.570> which<00:00:26.140> turns<00:00:26.410> out<00:00:26.560> to<00:00:26.619> be<00:00:26.860> very<00:00:27.220> helpful

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
scale which turns out to be very helpful

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.540 
scale which turns out to be very helpful
not<00:00:28.030> only<00:00:28.530> because<00:00:29.530> if<00:00:29.770> you<00:00:29.890> have<00:00:30.010> a<00:00:30.039> C<00:00:30.280> harp

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
not only because if you have a C harp

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.640 
not only because if you have a C harp
and<00:00:30.730> people<00:00:30.970> are<00:00:31.119> playing<00:00:31.270> in<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.630> C<00:00:32.349> blues

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
and people are playing in the C blues

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.850 
and people are playing in the C blues
that<00:00:33.010> you<00:00:33.160> can<00:00:33.340> play<00:00:33.610> something<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:35.230> also<00:00:35.440> if

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
that you can play something but also if

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.790 
that you can play something but also if
you're<00:00:36.040> playing<00:00:36.340> regular<00:00:37.180> cross<00:00:37.449> harp<00:00:37.809> when

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
you're playing regular cross harp when

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.549 
you're playing regular cross harp when
the<00:00:38.920> band<00:00:39.129> goes<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.520> the<00:00:39.640> 4<00:00:39.879> chord<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.530> key

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
the band goes to the 4 chord in the key

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.250 
the band goes to the 4 chord in the key
of<00:00:41.710> G<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.220> would<00:00:42.309> be<00:00:42.489> C<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.089> so<00:00:43.809> you<00:00:43.870> can<00:00:44.110> play

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
of G that would be C and so you can play

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.799 
of G that would be C and so you can play
licks<00:00:44.650> from<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.159> first<00:00:45.370> position<00:00:45.850> scale<00:00:46.180> and

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
licks from the first position scale and

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.290 
licks from the first position scale and
it<00:00:47.290> gives<00:00:47.470> you<00:00:47.620> just<00:00:47.650> a<00:00:47.890> different<00:00:48.190> way<00:00:48.250> of

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it gives you just a different way of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.820 
it gives you just a different way of
coming<00:00:49.300> up<00:00:49.390> with<00:00:49.420> some<00:00:49.870> different<00:00:50.019> vocabulary

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
coming up with some different vocabulary

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.710 
coming up with some different vocabulary
than<00:00:51.040> you<00:00:51.190> would<00:00:51.430> if<00:00:52.030> you<00:00:52.239> didn't<00:00:52.479> know<00:00:52.570> the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
than you would if you didn't know the

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.210 
than you would if you didn't know the
first<00:00:52.870> position<00:00:53.320> blue<00:00:53.500> scale<00:00:53.769> and<00:00:53.949> if<00:00:54.040> you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
first position blue scale and if you

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.920 
first position blue scale and if you
weren't<00:00:54.489> thinking<00:00:54.790> in<00:00:54.879> that<00:00:55.000> way<00:00:55.210> now<00:00:55.870> the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
weren't thinking in that way now the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.410 
weren't thinking in that way now the
first<00:00:56.199> position<00:00:56.650> blues<00:00:56.890> scale<00:00:57.220> we<00:00:58.089> have<00:00:58.120> three

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
first position blues scale we have three

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.420 
first position blues scale we have three
octaves<00:00:58.839> in<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.080> first<00:00:59.290> position<00:00:59.799> we're

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
octaves in the first position we're

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.469 
octaves in the first position we're
going<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.580> be<00:01:00.729> focusing<00:01:01.120> on<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.360> bottom

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
going to be focusing on the bottom

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.469 
going to be focusing on the bottom
octave<00:01:02.049> today<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.860> middle<00:01:03.129> octave<00:01:03.309> there<00:01:04.210> you

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
octave today the middle octave there you

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.140 
octave today the middle octave there you
actually<00:01:04.900> cannot<00:01:05.140> play<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.650> blue<00:01:05.830> scale

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
actually cannot play the blue scale

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.880 
actually cannot play the blue scale
because<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.240> can't<00:01:07.450> get<00:01:07.720> any<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.500> three

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
because you can't get any of the three

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.680 
because you can't get any of the three
kind<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.610> blue<00:01:09.820> notes<00:01:10.090> which<00:01:10.299> would<00:01:10.450> be<00:01:10.570> the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
kind of blue notes which would be the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.400 
kind of blue notes which would be the
minor<00:01:10.900> seven<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.580> tritone<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.960> minor

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
minor seven the tritone and the minor

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.230 
minor seven the tritone and the minor
third<00:01:14.830> none<00:01:15.160> of<00:01:15.280> those<00:01:15.370> are<00:01:15.580> available<00:01:15.670> in<00:01:16.150> the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
third none of those are available in the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.630 
third none of those are available in the
middle<00:01:16.480> octave<00:01:16.870> in<00:01:17.020> first<00:01:17.290> position<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:17.980> then

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
middle octave in first position and then

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.570 
middle octave in first position and then
the<00:01:18.910> top<00:01:19.120> octave<00:01:19.630> blue<00:01:20.350> scale<00:01:20.650> requires<00:01:21.400> a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
the top octave blue scale requires a

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.730 
the top octave blue scale requires a
technique<00:01:21.910> called<00:01:22.450> blow<00:01:23.080> bends<00:01:23.410> which<00:01:23.560> we

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
technique called blow bends which we

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.350 
technique called blow bends which we
have<00:01:23.860> not<00:01:23.980> covered<00:01:24.250> yet<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:24.940> that'll<00:01:25.240> be

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
have not covered yet so that'll be

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.230 
have not covered yet so that'll be
covered<00:01:25.990> in<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.350> future<00:01:26.380> video<00:01:26.940> but<00:01:27.940> we<00:01:28.060> are

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
covered in a future video but we are

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.180 
covered in a future video but we are
going<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:28.420> be<00:01:28.570> going<00:01:28.720> over<00:01:29.170> just<00:01:29.680> this<00:01:29.920> lower

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
going to be going over just this lower

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.560 
going to be going over just this lower
octave<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:33.550> interesting<00:01:34.090> thing<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.300> know

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
octave so the interesting thing to know

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.660 
octave so the interesting thing to know
in<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.930> lower<00:01:35.080> octave<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:35.800> really<00:01:36.340> we<00:01:36.490> can

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
in the lower octave is really we can

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.020 
in the lower octave is really we can
only<00:01:36.820> get<00:01:37.260> two<00:01:38.260> out<00:01:38.620> of<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:39.010> three<00:01:39.040> blue<00:01:39.760> notes

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
only get two out of the three blue notes

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.370 
only get two out of the three blue notes
if<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.330> want<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.690> think<00:01:40.840> about<00:01:41.080> there<00:01:41.230> being

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
if you want to think about there being

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.040 
if you want to think about there being
three<00:01:42.070> blue<00:01:42.310> notes<00:01:42.550> being<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.120> minor<00:01:43.690> third

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
three blue notes being the minor third

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.240 
three blue notes being the minor third
the<00:01:44.290> tritone<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.070> minor<00:01:45.250> seventh<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.710> the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
the tritone and the minor seventh so the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.770 
the tritone and the minor seventh so the
the<00:01:48.610> limitation<00:01:48.790> that<00:01:49.270> we<00:01:49.480> have<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:52.180> first

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
the limitation that we have in the first

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.660 
the limitation that we have in the first
position<00:01:53.170> blue<00:01:53.380> scale<00:01:53.620> is<00:01:53.830> we're<00:01:54.400> gonna<00:01:54.520> be

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
position blue scale is we're gonna be

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.720 
position blue scale is we're gonna be
starting<00:01:54.909> on<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.180> one<00:01:55.360> blow<00:01:56.430> that's<00:01:57.430> going<00:01:57.670> to

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
starting on the one blow that's going to

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.850 
starting on the one blow that's going to
be<00:01:57.850> our<00:01:58.030> route<00:01:58.300> okay<00:01:59.170> now<00:01:59.350> when<00:01:59.500> we<00:01:59.650> move<00:01:59.800> to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
be our route okay now when we move to

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.560 
be our route okay now when we move to
the<00:02:00.040> second<00:02:00.520> note<00:02:00.640> of<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.790> blue<00:02:01.030> scale<00:02:01.330> which

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
the second note of the blue scale which

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.390 
the second note of the blue scale which
is<00:02:01.720> supposed<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.170> be<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:02.440> minor<00:02:02.650> third<00:02:03.100> or

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
is supposed to be the minor third or

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.160 
is supposed to be the minor third or
maybe<00:02:03.610> someplace<00:02:03.940> between<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.630> major<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.140> a

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
maybe someplace between a major and a

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.199 
maybe someplace between a major and a
minor<00:02:05.200> third<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:07.000> would<00:02:07.150> be<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.450> two<00:02:07.630> blow

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
minor third that would be the two blow

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.300 
minor third that would be the two blow
which<00:02:10.209> is<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.390> major<00:02:10.690> third<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.379> of<00:02:11.920> course<00:02:12.129> we

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
which is a major third and of course we

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.610 
which is a major third and of course we
don't<00:02:12.430> on<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.700> regular<00:02:13.330> diatonic<00:02:13.959> harmonica<00:02:14.500> we

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
don't on a regular diatonic harmonica we

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.849 
don't on a regular diatonic harmonica we
don't<00:02:14.769> have<00:02:14.890> any<00:02:15.069> way<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.400> bending<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.970> down

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
don't have any way of bending that down

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.500 
don't have any way of bending that down
now<00:02:17.859> there<00:02:18.099> are<00:02:18.249> different<00:02:18.819> harmonicas<00:02:19.329> out

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
now there are different harmonicas out

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.440 
now there are different harmonicas out
there<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.799> Hohner<00:02:20.980> XB<00:02:21.549> where<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:22.299> can

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
there like the Hohner XB where you can

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.190 
there like the Hohner XB where you can
bend<00:02:22.659> that<00:02:22.810> down

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
bend that down

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.979 
bend that down
or<00:02:23.370> through<00:02:24.370> another<00:02:24.730> technique<00:02:25.390> called<00:02:25.569> over

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
or through another technique called over

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.170 
or through another technique called over
blows<00:02:26.370> which<00:02:27.370> if<00:02:27.519> you're<00:02:27.640> interested<00:02:28.090> in

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
blows which if you're interested in

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.670 
blows which if you're interested in
learning<00:02:28.300> about<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.900> then<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.440> want<00:02:29.620> to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
learning about that then you want to

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.869 
learning about that then you want to
check<00:02:29.830> out<00:02:29.980> Howard<00:02:30.280> levy

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879

blue<00:02:41.980> note<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> minor<00:02:42.670> third<00:02:43.030> okay<00:02:43.569> then

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
blue note of the minor third okay then

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.229 
blue note of the minor third okay then
going<00:02:44.500> from<00:02:44.800> there<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.220> next<00:02:45.250> scale<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:46.120> we're

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
going from there the next scale so we're

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.580 
going from there the next scale so we're
gonna<00:02:46.360> kind<00:02:46.599> of<00:02:46.660> cheat<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.319> play<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
gonna kind of cheat and just play the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.460 
gonna kind of cheat and just play the
major<00:02:47.739> third<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.730> gist<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.470> then

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
major third this is the gist of it then

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.440 
major third this is the gist of it then
the<00:02:50.650> for<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.980> next<00:02:51.280> scale<00:02:51.760> degree<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.269> going

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
the for the next scale degree is going

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.729 
the for the next scale degree is going
to<00:02:52.540> be<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.200> draw<00:02:53.470> bent<00:02:53.769> down<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:53.980> whole<00:02:54.250> step

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
to be the to draw bent down a whole step

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.020 
to be the to draw bent down a whole step
then<00:02:56.739> we're<00:02:56.890> gonna<00:02:56.980> release<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.310> only<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> half

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
then we're gonna release it only a half

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.009 
then we're gonna release it only a half
step<00:02:58.299> to<00:02:58.330> get<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.959> tritone<00:03:00.720> then<00:03:01.720> release

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
step to get to the tritone then release

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.850 
step to get to the tritone then release
it<00:03:02.200> fully<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:03.780> then<00:03:04.780> for<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.110> minor<00:03:05.260> seventh

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
it fully and then for the minor seventh

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.920 
it fully and then for the minor seventh
of<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.730> next<00:03:06.970> note<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.329> blue<00:03:07.480> scale<00:03:07.750> we're

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
of the next note of the blue scale we're

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.870 
of the next note of the blue scale we're
going<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.079> be<00:03:08.230> on<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.470> three<00:03:08.709> draw<00:03:08.980> bent<00:03:09.670> down

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
going to be on the three draw bent down

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.390 
going to be on the three draw bent down
a<00:03:09.910> half<00:03:10.209> step<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.540> here's<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.810> release<00:03:14.250> we<00:03:15.250> need

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
a half step so here's a release we need

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.920 
a half step so here's a release we need
to<00:03:15.489> get<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:17.340> again<00:03:18.340> that's<00:03:18.579> that<00:03:18.670> F<00:03:19.030> eh

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
to get it to again that's that F eh

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.470 
to get it to again that's that F eh
vowel<00:03:20.319> shape<00:03:20.650> e<00:03:20.890> would<00:03:21.370> be<00:03:21.430> released<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.120> would

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
vowel shape e would be released I would

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.870 
vowel shape e would be released I would
get<00:03:22.630> it<00:03:22.750> down<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.900> half<00:03:23.140> step<00:03:23.319> and<00:03:23.620> then<00:03:23.709> we<00:03:24.340> will

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
get it down a half step and then we will

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.699 
get it down a half step and then we will
be<00:03:24.970> on<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.209> four<00:03:25.420> below<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:26.170> get<00:03:26.319> back<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.680> our

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
be on the four below to get back to our

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:40.970 
be on the four below to get back to our
wrote<00:03:26.980> root<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:30.430> coming<00:03:31.060> back<00:03:31.090> down

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:51.000 

going<00:03:41.980> up

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:01.270 

back<00:03:52.010> down

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.650 

so<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.700> draw<00:04:03.000> we're<00:04:03.209> doing<00:04:03.450> both<00:04:03.630> the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
so on that to draw we're doing both the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.809 
so on that to draw we're doing both the
whole<00:04:03.930> step<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.500> half<00:04:04.680> step<00:04:04.980> Bend<00:04:05.220> that's

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
whole step and the half step Bend that's

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.100 
whole step and the half step Bend that's
another<00:04:06.090> good<00:04:06.330> thing<00:04:06.390> about<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:06.870> first

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
another good thing about the first

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.720 
another good thing about the first
position<00:04:07.620> blue<00:04:07.800> scale<00:04:08.069> is<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.340> really<00:04:08.550> gets

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
position blue scale is it really gets

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.580 
position blue scale is it really gets
you<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:08.940> work<00:04:09.150> on<00:04:09.300> your<00:04:09.510> intonation<00:04:09.810> there<00:04:10.380> on

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
you to work on your intonation there on

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.830 
you to work on your intonation there on
the<00:04:11.010> two<00:04:11.190> draw<00:04:11.489> kind<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.330> like<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.599> major

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
the two draw kind of like the major

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.559 
the two draw kind of like the major
scale<00:04:13.340> was<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.370> good<00:04:14.610> workout<00:04:14.910> for<00:04:14.970> us<00:04:15.300> on<00:04:15.450> the

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
scale was a good workout for us on the

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.360 
scale was a good workout for us on the
three<00:04:15.780> draw<00:04:16.019> because<00:04:16.230> we<00:04:16.950> have<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.160> bend<00:04:17.280> it

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
three draw because we have to bend it

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.949 
three draw because we have to bend it
down<00:04:17.519> a<00:04:17.549> whole<00:04:17.790> step<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.269> not<00:04:18.510> just<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.810> half

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
down a whole step and not just a half

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.580 
down a whole step and not just a half
step<00:04:19.160> on<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.459> first<00:04:20.669> position<00:04:20.880> blue<00:04:21.239> scale

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
step on the first position blue scale

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.900 
step on the first position blue scale
similarly<00:04:22.590> we<00:04:22.830> get<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:23.010> good<00:04:23.280> bending

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
similarly we get a good bending

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.640 
similarly we get a good bending
intonation<00:04:24.419> workout<00:04:24.960> on<00:04:25.139> the<00:04:25.260> to<00:04:25.410> draw

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
intonation workout on the to draw

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.220 
intonation workout on the to draw
because<00:04:26.040> we<00:04:26.669> have<00:04:26.850> got<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.210> do<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.780> whole<00:04:27.990> step

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
because we have got to do the whole step

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.320 
because we have got to do the whole step
and<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.530> half<00:04:28.680> step<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:31.880> that's<00:04:32.880> going<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.180> be

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
and the half step and that's going to be

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.560 
and the half step and that's going to be
a<00:04:33.510> really<00:04:33.930> good<00:04:35.930> muscle<00:04:36.930> memory<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.889> develop

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
a really good muscle memory to develop

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.330 
a really good muscle memory to develop
again<00:04:39.570> for<00:04:40.020> plane<00:04:40.200> licks<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.710> cross<00:04:40.919> harp<00:04:41.190> as

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
again for plane licks and cross harp as

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.670 
again for plane licks and cross harp as
much<00:04:41.550> as<00:04:42.540> in<00:04:42.810> first<00:04:43.050> position<00:04:43.520> so<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:46.440> real

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
much as in first position so the real

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.710 
much as in first position so the real
kind<00:04:47.040> of<00:04:47.160> quintessential<00:04:47.790> first<00:04:48.240> position

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
kind of quintessential first position

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.840 
kind of quintessential first position
blues<00:04:49.200> lick<00:04:49.620> is<00:04:49.830> going<00:04:50.040> to<00:04:50.100> be<00:04:50.220> this<00:04:55.700> okay<00:04:56.700> and

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
blues lick is going to be this okay and

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.480 
blues lick is going to be this okay and
so<00:04:57.540> you<00:04:57.630> notice<00:04:57.960> just<00:04:58.800> like<00:04:58.919> when<00:04:59.220> we're<00:04:59.370> in

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
so you notice just like when we're in

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.159 
so you notice just like when we're in
cross<00:04:59.760> harp<00:05:00.090> I've<00:05:00.360> talked<00:05:00.750> about<00:05:00.900> the

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
cross harp I've talked about the

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.840 
cross harp I've talked about the
quintessential<00:05:01.800> blues<00:05:02.130> lick<00:05:02.340> I've<00:05:02.490> mentioned

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
quintessential blues lick I've mentioned

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.640 
quintessential blues lick I've mentioned
that<00:05:02.940> on<00:05:03.090> several<00:05:03.300> of<00:05:03.510> these<00:05:03.600> videos<00:05:04.020> being

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
that on several of these videos being

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.500 
that on several of these videos being
drawing<00:05:05.039> on<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.400> four<00:05:05.610> below<00:05:05.880> bending<00:05:06.360> up

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
drawing on the four below bending up

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.360 
drawing on the four below bending up
into<00:05:06.840> it<00:05:06.990> bending<00:05:07.410> back<00:05:07.590> down<00:05:07.830> and<00:05:08.010> sliding

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
into it bending back down and sliding

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.920 
into it bending back down and sliding
down<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.850> to<00:05:09.120> draw<00:05:09.300> ie<00:05:09.570> this<00:05:10.970> right<00:05:13.430> so

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
down to the to draw ie this right so

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.510 
down to the to draw ie this right so
what<00:05:15.930> we're<00:05:16.080> doing<00:05:16.110> there<00:05:16.530> is<00:05:16.680> we're<00:05:16.919> starting

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
what we're doing there is we're starting

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.159 
what we're doing there is we're starting
on<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.700> tritone<00:05:17.970> we're<00:05:18.330> sliding<00:05:18.570> it<00:05:18.810> up<00:05:18.990> to

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
on the tritone we're sliding it up to

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.690 
on the tritone we're sliding it up to
the<00:05:19.260> tritone<00:05:19.530> bending<00:05:20.070> it<00:05:20.160> up<00:05:20.280> to<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.490> perfect

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
the tritone bending it up to the perfect

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.779 
the tritone bending it up to the perfect
fifth<00:05:21.090> bending<00:05:21.840> it<00:05:21.990> back<00:05:22.140> to<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.410> tritone

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
fifth bending it back to the tritone

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.060 
fifth bending it back to the tritone
sliding<00:05:23.789> down<00:05:24.000> really<00:05:24.590> theoretically<00:05:25.590> to<00:05:25.890> the

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
sliding down really theoretically to the

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.520 
sliding down really theoretically to the
minor<00:05:26.640> third<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.240> then<00:05:27.330> to<00:05:27.479> the<00:05:27.600> root<00:05:27.840> but<00:05:28.500> it

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
minor third and then to the root but it

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.409 
minor third and then to the root but it
happened<00:05:28.890> so<00:05:29.070> fast<00:05:29.100> that<00:05:29.700> year<00:05:29.970> maybe<00:05:30.120> can't

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
happened so fast that year maybe can't

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.330 
happened so fast that year maybe can't
necessarily<00:05:30.630> detect<00:05:31.410> what<00:05:31.650> that<00:05:31.830> third<00:05:32.070> is

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
necessarily detect what that third is

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.279 
necessarily detect what that third is
and<00:05:32.640> so<00:05:33.210> that's<00:05:33.390> what<00:05:33.539> we're<00:05:33.660> doing<00:05:33.690> in<00:05:34.050> first

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
and so that's what we're doing in first

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.909 
and so that's what we're doing in first
position<00:05:34.470> we're<00:05:34.950> drawing<00:05:35.220> on<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.580> two<00:05:36.919> bent

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
position we're drawing on the two bent

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.060 
position we're drawing on the two bent
and<00:05:38.220> allowing<00:05:38.970> it<00:05:39.060> to<00:05:39.120> release<00:05:39.950> then<00:05:40.950> we're

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
and allowing it to release then we're

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.210 
and allowing it to release then we're
gonna<00:05:41.160> bend<00:05:41.460> it<00:05:41.610> back<00:05:41.789> down<00:05:42.120> blow<00:05:43.110> on<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.950> to

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
gonna bend it back down blow on the to

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.760 
gonna bend it back down blow on the to
blow<00:05:44.669> really<00:05:45.360> quickly<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.020> slide<00:05:46.229> to<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.470> one

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
blow really quickly and slide to the one

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.320 
blow really quickly and slide to the one
so<00:05:47.310> it's

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.480 

or<00:05:53.960> there<00:05:54.139> I'm<00:05:54.260> articulating<00:05:54.950> the<00:05:55.070> one<00:05:55.220> twice

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
or there I'm articulating the one twice

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:03.790 
or there I'm articulating the one twice
so<00:05:55.700> it's<00:05:55.850> like<00:05:55.970> dead<00:05:56.240> at<00:05:56.419> that<00:05:56.630> death<00:06:02.800> that's

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
so it's like dead at that death that's

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.730 
so it's like dead at that death that's
like<00:06:03.980> kind<00:06:04.280> of<00:06:04.340> the<00:06:04.460> quintessential<00:06:05.740> first

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
like kind of the quintessential first

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.720 
like kind of the quintessential first
position<00:06:07.930> blues<00:06:08.930> riff<00:06:09.350> you<00:06:10.160> hear<00:06:10.340> Sonny<00:06:10.550> Boy

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
position blues riff you hear Sonny Boy

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:16.480 
position blues riff you hear Sonny Boy
Williamson<00:06:10.760> doing<00:06:11.450> that<00:06:11.570> for<00:06:11.750> example<00:06:15.490> so

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
Williamson doing that for example so

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.680 
Williamson doing that for example so
you're<00:06:16.610> kind<00:06:16.790> of<00:06:16.850> cheating<00:06:17.240> a<00:06:17.330> little<00:06:17.570> bit

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
you're kind of cheating a little bit

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.270 
you're kind of cheating a little bit
again<00:06:17.900> because<00:06:18.200> the<00:06:18.350> two<00:06:18.500> blow<00:06:18.770> is<00:06:18.950> really

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
again because the two blow is really

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.430 
again because the two blow is really
it's<00:06:19.430> really<00:06:19.490> a<00:06:19.730> major<00:06:20.030> third<00:06:20.419> there<00:06:20.720> but

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
it's really a major third there but

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.320 
it's really a major third there but
again<00:06:21.710> this<00:06:21.919> is<00:06:22.160> this<00:06:22.460> gives<00:06:22.760> you<00:06:22.910> some<00:06:23.120> fun

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
again this is this gives you some fun

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:41.260 
again this is this gives you some fun
things<00:06:23.540> to<00:06:23.870> to<00:06:24.620> work<00:06:24.800> with<00:06:39.220> so<00:06:40.220> that<00:06:40.250> is<00:06:40.669> the

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
things to to work with so that is the

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.409 
things to to work with so that is the
bottom<00:06:41.930> octave<00:06:42.290> blue<00:06:42.740> scale<00:06:43.160> first<00:06:43.880> position

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
bottom octave blue scale first position

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.020 
bottom octave blue scale first position
in<00:06:44.930> a<00:06:45.200> nutshell<00:06:45.460> hopefully<00:06:46.460> that<00:06:46.669> gives<00:06:46.820> you

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
in a nutshell hopefully that gives you

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.490 
in a nutshell hopefully that gives you
enough<00:06:47.240> to<00:06:47.419> start<00:06:47.690> kind<00:06:47.870> of<00:06:48.080> playing<00:06:48.290> around

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
enough to start kind of playing around

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.010 
enough to start kind of playing around
with<00:06:48.770> it<00:06:48.830> a<00:06:49.040> little<00:06:49.220> bit<00:06:49.460> and<00:06:49.669> let<00:06:50.660> me<00:06:50.780> know<00:06:50.900> if

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
with it a little bit and let me know if

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.729 
with it a little bit and let me know if
you<00:06:51.110> have<00:06:51.200> any<00:06:51.410> questions<00:06:51.889> thanks<00:06:52.520> so<00:06:52.669> much
