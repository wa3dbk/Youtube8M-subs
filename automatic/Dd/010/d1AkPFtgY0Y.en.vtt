knows that light that there's a guy out

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.069 
knows that light that there's a guy out

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
there that's killing people the public

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.229 
there that's killing people the public
knows<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:21.040> if<00:03:21.250> you've<00:03:21.579> read<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.820> or<00:03:22.060> watch

knows it and if you've read it or watch

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.640 
knows it and if you've read it or watch
the<00:03:22.450> manga<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.720> know<00:03:22.900> they<00:03:23.019> call<00:03:23.230> him<00:03:23.320> Kiera

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
the manga you know they call him Kiera

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.800 
the manga you know they call him Kiera
they<00:03:24.430> kind<00:03:24.609> of<00:03:24.730> some<00:03:24.820> people<00:03:25.030> idolize<00:03:25.209> him<00:03:25.570> but

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
they kind of some people idolize him but

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.960 
they kind of some people idolize him but
the<00:03:26.079> thing<00:03:26.320> that<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.769> most<00:03:27.070> noticed<00:03:27.730> about<00:03:27.850> it

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
the thing that I most noticed about it

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.640 
the thing that I most noticed about it
was<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.930> manga<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.320> seemed<00:03:29.500> like

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
was and the manga it seemed like

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.930 
was and the manga it seemed like
everything<00:03:29.829> was<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.040> little<00:03:30.190> more<00:03:30.280> master<00:03:30.820> me

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
everything was a little more master me

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.490 
everything was a little more master me
like<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.480> public<00:03:31.750> wasn't<00:03:32.049> quite<00:03:32.170> aware<00:03:32.440> of

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
like the public wasn't quite aware of

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.319 
like the public wasn't quite aware of
every<00:03:32.739> single<00:03:33.040> move<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.400> both<00:03:33.880> sides<00:03:34.180> were

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
every single move that both sides were

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:35.550 
every single move that both sides were
making<00:03:34.630> but<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.870> anime<00:03:34.989> it's<00:03:35.320> always

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
making but in the anime it's always

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.840 
making but in the anime it's always
announced<00:03:36.010> all<00:03:36.160> over<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.459> place

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
announced all over the place

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.670 
announced all over the place
and<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.269> think<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.690> reason<00:03:38.019> for<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.470> is

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
and I think the reason for that is is

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.620 
and I think the reason for that is is
because<00:03:38.829> when<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.370> watch<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.730> anime<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.480> get

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
because when you watch the anime you get

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.720 
because when you watch the anime you get
a<00:03:40.660> 3d<00:03:41.049> dimensional<00:03:41.530> feel<00:03:41.739> of<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:41.980> show<00:03:42.220> when

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
a 3d dimensional feel of the show when

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.460 
a 3d dimensional feel of the show when
you<00:03:42.820> read<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.030> manga<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:43.329> know<00:03:43.480> 2d<00:03:43.780> 2d<00:03:44.109> 2d

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
you read the manga you know 2d 2d 2d

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.900 
you read the manga you know 2d 2d 2d
well<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.739> pictures<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.340> 3d<00:03:45.609> but<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.819> you<00:03:45.880> know

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
well the pictures of 3d but it you know

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.390 
well the pictures of 3d but it you know
it's<00:03:46.120> flat<00:03:46.329> it's<00:03:46.810> flat<00:03:47.019> so<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.290> we<00:03:48.010> don't<00:03:48.250> get

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
it's flat it's flat so you we don't get

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.430 
it's flat it's flat so you we don't get
a<00:03:48.430> lively<00:03:48.850> grasp<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.299> what's<00:03:49.480> going<00:03:49.630> on<00:03:49.840> so

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
a lively grasp of what's going on so

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.039 
a lively grasp of what's going on so
when<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.130> watch<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.819> anime<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.660> get<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.900> see

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
when you watch the anime you get to see

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.750 
when you watch the anime you get to see
well<00:03:53.350> suddenly<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.220> manga<00:03:54.549> that<00:03:54.670> I've

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
well suddenly the manga that I've

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.819 
well suddenly the manga that I've
already<00:03:54.940> read<00:03:55.239> comes<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.750> life<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:56.319> it's

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
already read comes to life and it's

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.670 
already read comes to life and it's
interesting<00:03:57.220> but<00:03:57.850> I<00:03:57.910> don't<00:03:58.450> necessarily<00:03:58.690> buy

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
interesting but I don't necessarily buy

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.039 
interesting but I don't necessarily buy
the<00:03:59.739> change<00:04:00.310> that's<00:04:01.120> why<00:04:01.269> I<00:04:01.299> think<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.720> manga

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
the change that's why I think the manga

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.710 
the change that's why I think the manga
is<00:04:02.200> better<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.400> respect<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:04.090> its<00:04:04.209> pacing

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
is better in that respect of its pacing

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.569 
is better in that respect of its pacing
but<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.410> thing<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:05.799> I<00:04:05.829> think<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.100> manga

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
but the thing that I think the manga

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.420 
but the thing that I think the manga
fails<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.480> capture<00:04:07.930> is<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.709> voices<00:04:09.160> and

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
fails to capture is the voices and

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.580 
fails to capture is the voices and
you're<00:04:10.030> like<00:04:10.209> mr.<00:04:10.389> anime<00:04:10.750> are<00:04:10.900> you<00:04:10.989> stupid

you're like mr. anime are you stupid

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.260 
you're like mr. anime are you stupid
there's<00:04:12.519> no<00:04:12.700> voices<00:04:13.180> in<00:04:13.299> manga<00:04:13.720> I<00:04:13.840> know

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
there's no voices in manga I know

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.050 
there's no voices in manga I know
that's<00:04:14.570> that's<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.260> weakness<00:04:15.590> here<00:04:15.620> um<00:04:16.700> the

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
that's that's the weakness here um the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.300 
that's that's the weakness here um the
voice<00:04:17.209> acting<00:04:17.630> is<00:04:17.660> good<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.170> must<00:04:18.410> say<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.890> really
