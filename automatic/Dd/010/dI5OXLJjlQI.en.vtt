we're<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.310> talk<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.460> little<00:00:05.670> bit<00:00:05.910> about

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.700 
we're going to talk a little bit about
the<00:00:06.359> differences<00:00:06.870> between<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.350> traditional

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
the differences between a traditional

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.589 
the differences between a traditional
French<00:00:08.250> braid<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.760> then<00:00:08.940> what<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.120> would<00:00:09.240> call

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
French braid and then what I would call

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.740 
French braid and then what I would call
a<00:00:09.990> reverse<00:00:10.650> french<00:00:11.010> braid<00:00:11.130> also<00:00:11.969> known<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
a reverse french braid also known as a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.169 
a reverse french braid also known as a
Dutch<00:00:13.230> braid<00:00:13.559> or<00:00:13.980> an<00:00:14.070> inside-out<00:00:14.610> braid<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
Dutch braid or an inside-out braid the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.769 
Dutch braid or an inside-out braid the
main<00:00:15.420> difference<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.970> French<00:00:17.970> braid<00:00:18.270> when

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
main difference is the French braid when

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.179 
main difference is the French braid when
you're<00:00:18.869> braiding<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.320> hair<00:00:19.350> all<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
you're braiding the hair all of the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.220 
you're braiding the hair all of the
braid<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.699> inside<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> hair<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.960> can't

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
braid is inside of the hair you can't

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.349 
braid is inside of the hair you can't
see<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.740> see<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.130> seams<00:00:23.430> almost<00:00:24.029> to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
see you can just see the seams almost to

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.630 
see you can just see the seams almost to
the<00:00:24.449> brain<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.900> then<00:00:25.529> with<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.980> Dutch<00:00:26.400> braid

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the brain and then with the Dutch braid

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.509 
the brain and then with the Dutch braid
or<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> up<00:00:27.240> inside<00:00:27.960> out<00:00:28.140> braid<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.160> braid<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
or the up inside out braid the braid is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.179 
or the up inside out braid the braid is
it's<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.539> top<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.920> hair<00:00:32.099> you

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
it's on the top of the of the hair you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130 
it's on the top of the of the hair you
can<00:00:32.250> see<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> braid<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.660> where<00:00:34.050> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
can see the braid you can see where it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.470 
can see the braid you can see where it
folds<00:00:34.320> under<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.130> all<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.300> we're

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
folds under and all of that so we're

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.670 
folds under and all of that so we're

gonna start and I'm going to show you
how<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> French<00:00:39.450> braid<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
how to do just the French braid the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
how to do just the French braid the
funny<00:00:40.320> thing<00:00:40.590> about<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.550> know<00:00:41.730> how

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
funny thing about it is we all know how

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.450 
funny thing about it is we all know how
to<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.450> type<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.290> may<00:00:43.890> not<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.309> ever

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
to do one type so you may not have ever

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
to do one type so you may not have ever
known<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.059> other<00:00:45.180> existed<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> does

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
known that the other existed but it does

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.670 
known that the other existed but it does
so<00:00:47.219> we're<00:00:47.460> broadening<00:00:47.730> our<00:00:48.239> skills<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.590> I'm

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so we're broadening our skills so I'm

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.430 
so we're broadening our skills so I'm
going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> take<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.780> section<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.960> hair<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.350> in

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
going to take a section of hair here in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.869 
going to take a section of hair here in
the<00:00:52.530> front<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.949> we're<00:00:53.070> doing<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.640> French

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the front and we're doing just a French

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.639 
the front and we're doing just a French
braid<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.390> I'm<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.050> break<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.530> into

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
braid so I'm going to break it into

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.819 
braid so I'm going to break it into
three<00:00:56.070> sections<00:00:56.809> they<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:57.989> start<00:00:58.379> off<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
three sections they all start off the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
three sections they all start off the
same<00:00:59.100> when<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.090> doing<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.420> French<00:01:00.660> braid

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
same when you're doing a French braid

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.529 
same when you're doing a French braid
what<00:01:01.770> makes<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.190> an<00:01:02.280> actual<00:01:02.550> French<00:01:02.910> braid<00:01:03.180> is

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
what makes it an actual French braid is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.260 
what makes it an actual French braid is
your<00:01:04.080> outside<00:01:04.290> sections<00:01:05.159> you're<00:01:05.850> actually

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
your outside sections you're actually

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.450 
your outside sections you're actually
pulling<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.810> over<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> top<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.950> your<00:01:08.100> center

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
pulling it over the top of your center

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.109 
pulling it over the top of your center
section<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> vice<00:01:09.720> versa<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.439> top<00:01:11.130> goes<00:01:11.369> over

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
section and vice versa so top goes over

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.990 
section and vice versa so top goes over
bottom<00:01:13.110> goes<00:01:13.320> over<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.189> middle<00:01:14.220> section<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
bottom goes over the middle section and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.149 
bottom goes over the middle section and
you'll<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> whole<00:01:15.720> way<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
you'll do that the whole way and the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.490 
you'll do that the whole way and the
bottom<00:01:17.640> will<00:01:17.880> go<00:01:18.000> over<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.900> top<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
bottom will go over the top of the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.270 
bottom will go over the top of the
middle

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
middle

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.450 
middle
and<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.450> top<00:01:21.690> goes<00:01:22.020> over<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.190> top<00:01:23.220> of

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
and then the top goes over the top of

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.080 
and then the top goes over the top of
the<00:01:24.420> middle<00:01:24.720> strand<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:26.790> gonna<00:01:26.880> pick

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the middle strand so now I'm gonna pick

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.219 
the middle strand so now I'm gonna pick
up<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.330> little<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.780> hair<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:30.229> I'm

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
up a little bit of hair here and I'm

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
up a little bit of hair here and I'm
gonna<00:01:31.350> go<00:01:31.500> over<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.250> top<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.820> middle

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
gonna go over the top of that middle

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.960 
gonna go over the top of that middle
strand<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:35.130> you're<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> take<00:01:35.640> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
strand so now you're going to take a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270 
strand so now you're going to take a
section<00:01:36.540> from<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.960> top<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.440> incorporate<00:01:38.100> it

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
section from the top and incorporate it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.840 
section from the top and incorporate it
in<00:01:39.180> your<00:01:39.990> top<00:01:40.560> braid<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.220> you're<00:01:41.430> gonna<00:01:41.520> cross

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
in your top braid and you're gonna cross

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.810 
in your top braid and you're gonna cross
it<00:01:41.880> over<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.990> center<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:45.420> we're<00:01:45.600> just

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
it over the center so we're just

00:01:46.820 --> 00:02:00.770 
it over the center so we're just
incorporating<00:01:49.310> over<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> center<00:01:59.509> over<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
incorporating over the center over the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.109 
incorporating over the center over the
center

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:21.120 

Brady<00:02:09.190> over<00:02:10.190> this<00:02:11.380> keeping<00:02:12.380> our<00:02:12.730> go<00:02:13.730> along<00:02:17.800> so

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.830 

the<00:02:22.130> reason<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.489> would<00:02:22.700> choose<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:22.970> do<00:02:23.420> a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
the reason you would choose to do a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.290 
the reason you would choose to do a
traditional<00:02:24.709> French<00:02:24.920> braid<00:02:25.340> would<00:02:25.580> be<00:02:25.730> you

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
traditional French braid would be you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.540 
traditional French braid would be you
wanted<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.810> keep<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.230> braid<00:02:27.440> really<00:02:27.950> flat<00:02:28.340> and

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
wanted to keep the braid really flat and

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.180 
wanted to keep the braid really flat and
tight<00:02:28.700> against<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.270> side<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.900> head

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
tight against the side of the head

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.130 
tight against the side of the head
sometimes<00:02:31.190> we<00:02:31.370> like<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.730> do<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.660> we<00:02:32.959> want

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
sometimes we like to do this is we want

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.430 
sometimes we like to do this is we want
to<00:02:33.200> exaggerate<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.980> shape<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.430> another<00:02:35.440> part

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
to exaggerate the shape of another part

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.920 
to exaggerate the shape of another part
of<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.580> hairstyle<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.600> maybe<00:02:38.780> you

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
of the of the hairstyle so maybe you

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.110 
of the of the hairstyle so maybe you
would<00:02:39.050> keep<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.440> really<00:02:39.890> flat<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.459> then<00:02:40.970> maybe

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
would keep it really flat and then maybe

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.090 
would keep it really flat and then maybe
you<00:02:41.300> have<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.600> big<00:02:41.959> tossing<00:02:42.530> flave<00:02:42.800> on<00:02:42.980> the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
you have this big tossing flave on the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.830 
you have this big tossing flave on the
other<00:02:43.370> side<00:02:43.670> but<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:43.970> would<00:02:44.060> keep<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:44.450> really

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
other side but it would keep this really

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.690 
other side but it would keep this really
flat<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.290> head<00:02:45.470> or<00:02:46.100> maybe<00:02:46.250> you'd<00:02:46.430> have<00:02:46.550> it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
flat to the head or maybe you'd have it

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.979 
flat to the head or maybe you'd have it
really<00:02:46.940> flat<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.209> then<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.510> kind<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.840> do<00:02:47.959> a

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
really flat and then you kind of do a

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.259 
really flat and then you kind of do a
bouffant<00:02:48.470> or<00:02:48.980> top<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.459> or<00:02:49.580> something<00:02:49.940> fun

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
bouffant or top that or something fun

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.810 
bouffant or top that or something fun
with<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.900> larger<00:02:51.410> shape<00:02:51.650> it's<00:02:52.489> just<00:02:52.670> an

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
with a larger shape it's just an

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.070 
with a larger shape it's just an
interesting<00:02:53.330> way<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.510> kind<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.840> play<00:02:54.050> off

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
interesting way to kind of play off

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.640 
interesting way to kind of play off
shapes<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:55.790> would<00:02:55.940> also<00:02:56.120> do<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:56.840> type<00:02:57.260> maybe

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
shapes you would also do this type maybe

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.250 
shapes you would also do this type maybe
if<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:57.920> wanted<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.310> do<00:02:58.459> some<00:02:58.780> smaller<00:02:59.780> braids

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
if you wanted to do some smaller braids

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.280 
if you wanted to do some smaller braids
on<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.560> side<00:03:00.769> of<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.980> head<00:03:01.130> like<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:01.550> most

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
on the side of the head like for most

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.429 
on the side of the head like for most
so<00:03:03.159> now<00:03:03.340> I've<00:03:03.519> been<00:03:03.640> corporated<00:03:04.390> from<00:03:05.290> the

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
so now I've been corporated from the

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:17.180 
so now I've been corporated from the
bottom

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.670 

strange<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.480> now<00:03:19.599> I'm<00:03:19.660> out<00:03:19.840> of<00:03:19.959> section<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:20.650> I

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
strange so now I'm out of section so I

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.040 
strange so now I'm out of section so I
will<00:03:20.950> just<00:03:21.130> continue<00:03:21.580> braiding<00:03:22.450> down<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
will just continue braiding down the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.520 
will just continue braiding down the
hair<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.810> sometimes<00:03:25.810> I'm<00:03:26.140> going<00:03:26.260> we<00:03:26.319> talk

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
hair and sometimes I'm going we talk

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.580 
hair and sometimes I'm going we talk
about<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:27.099> French<00:03:27.459> braid<00:03:27.700> or<00:03:28.060> an<00:03:28.810> upside-down

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
about a French braid or an upside-down

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.070 
about a French braid or an upside-down
French<00:03:30.100> braid<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:31.000> biggest<00:03:31.209> way<00:03:31.510> is<00:03:31.840> how

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
French braid the the biggest way is how

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.660 
French braid the the biggest way is how
you<00:03:32.140> hold<00:03:32.440> your<00:03:32.560> hands<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.160> can<00:03:33.310> see<00:03:33.489> that

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
you hold your hands and you can see that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.900 
you hold your hands and you can see that
pretty<00:03:34.120> clearly<00:03:34.300> with<00:03:35.290> how<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.470> braid<00:03:35.920> just<00:03:36.790> a

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
pretty clearly with how you braid just a

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.030 
pretty clearly with how you braid just a
regular<00:03:37.270> brain<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:38.170> I'm<00:03:38.230> going<00:03:38.470> over<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:39.010> top

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
regular brain so I'm going over the top

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.550 
regular brain so I'm going over the top
over<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.670> top<00:03:39.790> over<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.450> top<00:03:40.569> if<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.440> were

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
over the top over the top if I were

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.900 
over the top over the top if I were
doing<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.860> other<00:03:41.980> one<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.700> would<00:03:42.790> be

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
doing the other one it would be

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.490 
doing the other one it would be
underneath<00:03:43.239> it<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.690> would<00:03:43.810> really<00:03:44.050> see<00:03:44.200> that

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
underneath it you would really see that

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.590 
underneath it you would really see that
clearly<00:03:47.220> put<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.250> rubber<00:03:48.489> band<00:03:48.580> clear<00:03:49.420> rubber

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
clearly put a rubber band clear rubber

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.960 
clearly put a rubber band clear rubber
band<00:03:50.190> at<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.400> top<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.850> secure<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.480> ponytail

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
band at the top to secure the ponytail

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.590 
band at the top to secure the ponytail
so<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.209> is<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:56.049> French<00:03:56.319> braid
