manually so or automatically so and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.859 
manually so or automatically so and
that's<00:01:35.640> how<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.850> would<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.540> would<00:01:36.720> go

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
all the way around the line it's a lot

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.300 
all the way around the line it's a lot
of<00:01:39.360> tedious<00:01:39.630> work<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.560> also<00:01:40.710> works<00:01:41.100> as

video so if you guys want a better

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.319 
video so if you guys want a better
visual<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.189> I'll<00:01:56.969> put<00:01:57.180> an<00:01:57.240> annotation

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
visual of that I'll put an annotation

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.260 
visual of that I'll put an annotation
right<00:01:57.780> here<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.259> video<00:01:58.729> anyways<00:01:59.729> going

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
right here to that video anyways going

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.719 
right here to that video anyways going
on<00:02:00.570> with<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.079> magnetic<00:02:01.500> guide<00:02:01.890> what<00:02:02.579> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
on with the magnetic guide what this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.850 
on with the magnetic guide what this
thing<00:02:02.939> does<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> metal<00:02:04.680> plate

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
thing does is if you have a metal plate

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.600 
thing does is if you have a metal plate
right<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.049> basically<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.860> plop

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
right here you can basically just plop

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.490 
right here you can basically just plop
it<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.509> thing<00:02:09.690> will<00:02:09.840> stay<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.289> place

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it on and this thing will stay in place

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.229 
it on and this thing will stay in place
and<00:02:10.950> it'll<00:02:11.310> help<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.879> guide<00:02:12.319> the

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
and it'll help you guide the

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.020 
and it'll help you guide the
perfectly<00:02:15.319> around<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.760> better<00:02:18.060> example<00:02:18.420> a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
perfectly around so a better example a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.390 
perfectly around so a better example a
visual<00:02:21.030> example<00:02:21.360> actually<00:02:21.900> see<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.440> want<00:02:22.800> one

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
visual example actually see I want one

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.699 
visual example actually see I want one
centimeter<00:02:23.940> out<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.540> met<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.050> put<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.500> at<00:02:25.680> one

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
centimeter out I met I put it at one

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.870 
centimeter out I met I put it at one
centimeter<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.739> make<00:02:29.310> sure<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.610> it's

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
centimeter and I make sure that it's

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.680 
centimeter and I make sure that it's
straight<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:32.190> basically<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.239> take<00:02:33.450> your

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
straight and basically you take your

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.910 
straight and basically you take your
brim<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.640> while<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.940> dog<00:02:36.180> while<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.920> machine

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
brim and while the dog while the machine

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.460 
brim and while the dog while the machine
is<00:02:37.950> feeding<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.819> threading<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.900> basically

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
is feeding and threading you basically

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.160 
is feeding and threading you basically
can<00:02:40.800> just<00:02:40.980> hold<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.580> here<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:44.760> guys<00:02:44.880> hold<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
can just hold it here you guys hold the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.770 
can just hold it here you guys hold the
you<00:02:46.860> hold<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.340> right<00:02:47.459> here<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.630> can<00:02:48.750> just

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
you hold it right here and you can just

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.900 
you hold it right here and you can just
basically<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.810> like<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:53.010> that's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
basically so and like that and that's

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.090 
basically so and like that and that's
basically<00:02:54.390> what<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.810> does<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.410> helps<00:02:55.530> me<00:02:55.799> keep

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
basically what it does it helps me keep

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.280 
basically what it does it helps me keep
my<00:02:56.280> line<00:02:56.519> straight<00:02:56.700> helps<00:02:57.510> keep<00:02:57.810> everything

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
my line straight helps keep everything

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.650 
my line straight helps keep everything
equal<00:02:59.099> that's<00:02:59.489> basically<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.209> tools<00:03:00.450> you'll

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
equal that's basically the tools you'll

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.750 
equal that's basically the tools you'll
need<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.930> do<00:03:01.410> that's<00:03:01.890> basically<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.610> general

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
need to do that's basically the general

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.300 
need to do that's basically the general
tools<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.630> need<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.900> do<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.650> rim<00:03:05.010> curves

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
tools that you need to do the rim curves

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.670 
tools that you need to do the rim curves
so<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.730> type<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:05.970> needle<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.840> use<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.500> do

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
so the type of needle that I use to do

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.820 
so the type of needle that I use to do
the<00:03:07.950> brim<00:03:08.340> curves<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:09.090> usually<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.110> heavy-duty

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
the brim curves is usually a heavy-duty

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.430 
the brim curves is usually a heavy-duty
needle<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:12.299> don't<00:03:12.480> necessarily<00:03:12.900> get<00:03:13.019> need<00:03:13.380> to

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
needle you don't necessarily get need to

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.170 
needle you don't necessarily get need to
get<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.680> size<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.310> just<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.610> size<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
get this size it's just the size that I

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.180 
get this size it's just the size that I
have<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:16.349> show<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.590> guys

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
have to show you guys

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.400 
have to show you guys
sometimes<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.239> go<00:03:18.390> lower<00:03:18.660> or<00:03:18.870> something<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.290> go

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
sometimes I go lower or something to go

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.590 
sometimes I go lower or something to go
higher<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.950> depending<00:03:20.340> on<00:03:20.400> how<00:03:20.459> harsh<00:03:21.150> the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
higher just depending on how harsh the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.860 
higher just depending on how harsh the
material<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.380> but<00:03:23.160> generally<00:03:23.880> would<00:03:24.720> just

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
material is but generally would just

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.190 
material is but generally would just
need<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.140> get<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.290> heavy-duty<00:03:25.769> needle

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
need to get a heavy-duty needle

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.289 
need to get a heavy-duty needle
specifically<00:03:28.200> not<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.040> not<00:03:29.519> too<00:03:29.730> big<00:03:29.940> not<00:03:30.150> too

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
specifically not a not too big not too

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.539 
specifically not a not too big not too
small<00:03:30.329> it's<00:03:30.900> up<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.560> guys<00:03:31.769> it's<00:03:32.100> up<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.459> you

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
small it's up to you guys it's up to you

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.870 
small it's up to you guys it's up to you
guys<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.850> test<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:34.590> can't<00:03:34.859> really<00:03:34.980> tell<00:03:35.579> for

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
guys to test and I can't really tell for

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.449 
guys to test and I can't really tell for
most<00:03:36.500> people<00:03:37.500> because<00:03:37.620> people<00:03:37.829> have<00:03:38.310> their

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
most people because people have their

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.099 
most people because people have their
fabrics<00:03:38.940> different<00:03:39.239> hats<00:03:39.390> all<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.720> other

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
fabrics different hats all the other

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.449 
fabrics different hats all the other
stuff<00:03:40.519> so<00:03:42.200> moving<00:03:43.200> on<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.470> my<00:03:43.739> sewing<00:03:43.980> machine

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
stuff so moving on to my sewing machine

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.270 
stuff so moving on to my sewing machine
I<00:03:44.730> keep<00:03:45.630> my<00:03:45.780> link<00:03:46.079> at<00:03:46.319> two<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.799> three<00:03:46.829> the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
I keep my link at two to three the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.849 
I keep my link at two to three the
smaller<00:03:47.579> it<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.000> better<00:03:48.239> your<00:03:48.780> curves<00:03:49.620> are

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
smaller it is the better your curves are

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.660 
smaller it is the better your curves are
because<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:51.480> longer<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.470> get<00:03:53.010> started

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
because the longer it is you get started

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.720 
because the longer it is you get started
getting<00:03:53.880> distorted<00:03:54.569> or<00:03:55.019> whatever<00:03:55.350> so<00:03:56.130> keep<00:03:56.609> it

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
getting distorted or whatever so keep it

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.420 
getting distorted or whatever so keep it
at<00:03:56.819> a<00:03:56.850> low<00:03:56.880> length<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.889> also<00:03:58.889> keep<00:03:59.310> your

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
at a low length and also keep your

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.270 
at a low length and also keep your
tension<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.299> tap<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.109> a<00:04:01.380> perfect<00:04:01.829> condition

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
tension in tap and a perfect condition

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.960 
tension in tap and a perfect condition
because<00:04:02.810> that's<00:04:03.810> how<00:04:04.290> people<00:04:05.250> end<00:04:05.730> up

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
because that's how people end up

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.970 
because that's how people end up
breaking<00:04:06.180> their<00:04:06.600> lines<00:04:06.870> or<00:04:07.200> people<00:04:07.560> saying

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
breaking their lines or people saying

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.220 
breaking their lines or people saying
that<00:04:08.250> they're<00:04:08.459> they're<00:04:09.299> streaming<00:04:10.019> our

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
that they're they're streaming our

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.229 
that they're they're streaming our
threads<00:04:10.590> keeps<00:04:10.950> breaking<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:11.700> them<00:04:11.940> when

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
threads keeps breaking on them when

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.960 
threads keeps breaking on them when
they're<00:04:12.389> threading<00:04:12.989> through<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.590> brim<00:04:13.970> so

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
they're threading through the brim so

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.340 
they're threading through the brim so
that's<00:04:15.180> one<00:04:15.389> thing<00:04:15.569> you<00:04:15.630> guys<00:04:15.750> need<00:04:15.810> acumen

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
that's one thing you guys need acumen

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.800 
that's one thing you guys need acumen
consideration<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.850> way<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.090> set<00:04:18.450> up<00:04:18.479> your

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
consideration and a way to set up your

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.039 
consideration and a way to set up your
your<00:04:19.289> attention<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:19.950> just<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.090> just<00:04:21.720> sew<00:04:22.019> a

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
your attention is just so just sew a

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.480 
your attention is just so just sew a
line<00:04:23.180> through<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.659> see<00:04:25.260> if<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.800> which

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
line through this and see if the which

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.580 
line through this and see if the which
part<00:04:26.909> of<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.300> too

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
part of it is too

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.840 
part of it is too
tire<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:28.930> loose<00:04:29.930> because<00:04:30.889> it's<00:04:31.220> too<00:04:31.490> tight

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
tire to loose because it's too tight

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.750 
tire to loose because it's too tight
that<00:04:31.880> means<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:32.600> tension<00:04:32.990> up<00:04:33.110> here<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:33.830> too

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
that means this tension up here is too

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.310 
that means this tension up here is too
tight<00:04:35.060> meaning<00:04:35.600> you<00:04:35.690> get<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.900> lower<00:04:36.110> the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
tight meaning you get to lower the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.580 
tight meaning you get to lower the
tension<00:04:36.500> but<00:04:37.280> if<00:04:37.400> it's<00:04:37.550> loose<00:04:37.850> then<00:04:38.180> you<00:04:38.270> got<00:04:38.389> a

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
tension but if it's loose then you got a

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.390 
tension but if it's loose then you got a
load<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:39.800> gotta<00:04:40.010> up<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.550> tension<00:04:41.360> so<00:04:42.400> that's

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
load you gotta up the tension so that's

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.580 
load you gotta up the tension so that's
for<00:04:43.699> the<00:04:43.729> top<00:04:44.030> part<00:04:44.300> before<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.990> bottom<00:04:45.320> part

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
for the top part before the bottom part

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.310 
for the top part before the bottom part
it's<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.130> same<00:04:46.400> thing<00:04:46.729> you<00:04:47.300> have<00:04:47.389> to<00:04:47.479> go<00:04:47.660> in<00:04:47.870> to

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
it's the same thing you have to go in to

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.400 
it's the same thing you have to go in to
your<00:04:48.440> bobbin<00:04:48.979> inside<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.850> take<00:04:50.690> a<00:04:50.720> screw<00:04:51.139> and

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
your bobbin inside and take a screw and

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.370 
your bobbin inside and take a screw and
increase<00:04:51.919> or<00:04:52.190> decrease<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.820> tension<00:04:53.479> this

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
increase or decrease the tension this

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.320 
increase or decrease the tension this
might<00:04:54.620> take<00:04:54.830> some<00:04:55.040> time<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.460> do<00:04:55.699> but<00:04:56.000> once<00:04:56.240> you

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
might take some time to do but once you

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.540 
might take some time to do but once you
get<00:04:56.479> the<00:04:56.630> tension<00:04:56.870> ready<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:57.830> set

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
get the tension ready and set

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.070 
get the tension ready and set
that's<00:04:59.000> all<00:04:59.180> you<00:04:59.300> that's<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.720> last<00:04:59.750> time

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
you're holding on to your magnetic guide

00:05:24.139 --> 00:06:12.390 
you're holding on to your magnetic guide
and<00:05:24.590> you<00:05:24.680> just

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.779 

and<00:06:13.400> there<00:06:13.729> you<00:06:13.879> have<00:06:13.910> it<00:06:15.310> obviously<00:06:16.310> my<00:06:16.550> lines

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
and there you have it obviously my lines

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.570 
and there you have it obviously my lines
not<00:06:17.030> that<00:06:17.240> straight<00:06:18.400> obviously<00:06:19.400> there's

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
not that straight obviously there's

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.100 
not that straight obviously there's
still<00:06:19.759> a<00:06:19.940> lot<00:06:20.150> of<00:06:20.180> things<00:06:20.360> wrong<00:06:20.599> with<00:06:20.750> it<00:06:20.900> but

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
still a lot of things wrong with it but

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.629 
still a lot of things wrong with it but
I<00:06:21.199> got<00:06:21.349> fixed<00:06:21.590> my<00:06:21.710> attention<00:06:22.190> and<00:06:22.310> all<00:06:22.370> that

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 
I got fixed my attention and all that

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.640 
I got fixed my attention and all that
but<00:06:23.300> generally<00:06:23.479> that's<00:06:23.960> how<00:06:24.229> you<00:06:24.289> do<00:06:24.620> it

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
but generally that's how you do it

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.499 
but generally that's how you do it
that's<00:06:25.129> how<00:06:25.220> you<00:06:25.340> get<00:06:25.490> your<00:06:25.699> lines<00:06:26.030> to<00:06:26.330> be<00:06:26.479> a

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:26.509 
that's how you get your lines to be a

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.899 
that's how you get your lines to be a
pretty<00:06:26.930> straight<00:06:27.409> I<00:06:27.710> might<00:06:28.370> need<00:06:28.520> to<00:06:28.580> do<00:06:28.879> some

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:28.909 
pretty straight I might need to do some

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.779 
pretty straight I might need to do some
rework<00:06:29.599> on<00:06:29.810> my<00:06:29.960> tension<00:06:30.500> it<00:06:30.680> looks<00:06:30.889> like<00:06:31.129> but

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
rework on my tension it looks like but

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.180 
rework on my tension it looks like but
as<00:06:31.909> you<00:06:32.060> guys<00:06:32.240> can<00:06:32.449> see<00:06:32.509> it's<00:06:32.930> pretty<00:06:33.440> very

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
as you guys can see it's pretty very

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.899 
as you guys can see it's pretty very
long<00:06:34.340> time<00:06:34.610> zoom<00:06:34.879> in<00:06:39.039> yeah<00:06:40.039> it's<00:06:40.340> pretty<00:06:40.639> much

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909 
long time zoom in yeah it's pretty much

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:43.659 
long time zoom in yeah it's pretty much
straight<00:06:41.360> I<00:06:41.780> just<00:06:42.530> need<00:06:42.710> to<00:06:42.770> fix<00:06:42.979> this<00:06:43.250> part

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
straight I just need to fix this part

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.010 
straight I just need to fix this part
and<00:06:43.909> but<00:06:44.060> everything<00:06:44.419> else<00:06:44.569> looks<00:06:44.750> pretty

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
and but everything else looks pretty

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.870
