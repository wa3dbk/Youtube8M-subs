00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.359
 hello everyone guys here site design and 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.890
 Here we are, back with a new video 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.000
 today we are going to see how to create 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.290
 the film effect on an image to make you 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.650
 understand what I'm talking about 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.029
 I'll show you the image we 're going to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.769
 to use it, here it is finished 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.039
 all I have to say something about 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.109
 genre is a disc you see better 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.990
 the image 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.719
 here it is to say that it really is an effect 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.520
 very nice ok 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.890
 having said that we can start with the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.559
 tutorial so we will have photoshop 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.079
 i image day loaded ok then 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.000
 first what we have to do 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.160
 let's duplicate the layer then 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.780
 we do right-click duplicate layer 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.510
 or convenient handy dj and command for 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.340
 windows obviously would therefore be a 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.260
 once duplicate level we make command 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:09.020
 and on saturation we go to put a 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.820
 nice minus 60 and we give ok 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.509
 once done that we go to image 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.439
 settings display exposure 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.970
 let's put one of his moves and 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.350
 gamma correction let's say it's a lot 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.930
 personal because it depends on the photo that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.270
 you were using then adjust 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:42.590
 a little then i go to put we take a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:42.590
 as it is rose 73 ok 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.180
 once we have done what we must do 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.780
 we must reduce the level then como 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:59.130
 angels and let's go to the blur filter 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.460
 radius blur control we put 9.1 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.219
 pixel we see ok when done we go there 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.729
 on the rubber and setting the rubber 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.660
 while this is zero percent hardness e 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.820
 dimensions 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.490
 obviously it depends on the size of the 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.710
 your image here at 1211 then 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.020
 let's highlight the part that 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:27.350
 let's see what is displayed 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.350
 let's say a little like that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.830
 ok once you think about what 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.500
 we must do 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.270
 let's create a new level 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.900
 we only have bucket tool e 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.220
 let's go and place it then here we go up 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.360
 opacity and we put 42 percent 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.580
 once done what we go to 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.760
 take the rubber back with them 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.510
 settings before and let's go to 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:04.820
 highlight the part we want that 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.820
 let this be displayed this we say 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:14.610
 this ok once done that for 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.230
 to conclude we must recreate a new one 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.290
 level go to the selection tool 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.270
 rectangular let's create a 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.980
 rectangle at the top more or less than these 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.930
 dimensions 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:33.060
 let's go to the bucket tool e 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:36.270
 let's color it black and then lose 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.870
 select it let's command one 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.300
 once done that we do common j 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.090
 duplicate the level and with the tool 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:51.020
 move we advise against it below and here it is 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.340
 the image is then completed on file 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:04:01.170
 save with name 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:05.239
 we put image film effect e 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.989
 we know informed i recommend png 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.260
 let's save 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.260
 ok 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.290
 and here is the saved image 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.930
 here it is guys no hope 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.250
 you enjoyed this video and me

 I also recommend you try 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.840
 use this effect on yours 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.430
 images and nothing almost a greeting 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.910
