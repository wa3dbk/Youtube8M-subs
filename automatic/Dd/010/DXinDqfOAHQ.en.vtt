 is almost all invented then I do not know 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.110
 can invent if suddenly everything 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.570
 little things well guys we are going to place 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.530
 seven blocks for six is worth seven they go to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.810
 go 3 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.729

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.770
 what guys he says well followed 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.990
 tutorials I will continue doing 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.369
 what is survival of all a little but 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.200
 you have to go changing guys you can not 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.670
 pretend that there are many people 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.170
 what he likes is bad form now I want 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.550
 to always make your vaginas clear and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.290
 something that you like pistons that you do 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.390
 always you have pistons since they 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.979
 you like that there you have to go combining 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.470
 a little then by guys we do not put 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.540
 two blocks and two blocks leaving one in 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.460
 separation medium and one to the edges 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.830
 It means space two blocks 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.299
 spaces two blocks spaces ok yo 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.860
 I use green wool you can use it 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.690
 that you want and also use 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.610
 white wool to go combining different 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.470
 heights and that we are not worth 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.240
 then in stature I will place wool 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.520
 white I will place in the spaces 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.380
 just where you do not have this front 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.110
 I'm just going to place the white wool already 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.480
 you see that it has a small form of w the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.850
 true that what 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.530
 this moment so far simple and I'm going 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.350
 to put this in what are the blocks 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.750
 of green wool at the first height is worth 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.990
 you see perfect ok and now I'm going to place 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.470
 here and the 3 by 3 that is 3 wide 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.750
 for three long here are three more here 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.150
 three more and then two on the sides 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:33.180
 just fine up here perfectly fine vale 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.280
 I will continue with the right thing here rest 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.290
 here and in the middle a pressure plate 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.900
 that I do not have in the crazy crazy madman 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.790
 nothing happens then I will continue to place 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.530
 here in this area here another block 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.480
 more and in this area here another block 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.860
 more put it back green because if 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.660
 without so much a first green height 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.800
 second white third green follows 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.460
 being that the color that you want 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.470
 and here up there is the green one 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.830
 again another block and placed one 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.450
 let's say small elongation to place 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.130
 what are the dispensers 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.990
 dispensers worth in these are 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.140
 dispensers expected a title that is 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.870
 what I'm missing here because I think if 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.840
 I'm not mistaken that they are three tall 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.790
 3 long 1 if not there then to 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.739
 principle yes five are three let's see 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.360
 which will ratify are three long and 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.549
 here another three long in the 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.650
 perfect laterals exempts me manned 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.010
 on the other absolutely equal ok 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.110
 well dispensers I will place one two 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.799
 three and on the other side absolutely 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.489
 equal 123 dispensers I'll remind you guys 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.920
 dispensers alright now what I have 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.920
 what to do is fine I will place here 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.450
 block there in that area there there you see 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.859
 you can not give the dispenser with if not 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.379
 leaves us in three the thought that 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:50.430
 place it on the right side I'll place 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.840
 there another there is another and in the middle too 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.069
 block is worth 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.930
 I'm saying same I put green 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.329
 you can put with likes you want and placed 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.140
 what is a dispenser right in the 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.909
 we're going to see there you see guys 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.950
 first floor almost finished I'm missing 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.440
 place the water vale place water in that 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.180
 corner water in that corner and I forgot 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.319
 from the dispenser the dispenser 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.359
 hit another pressure you have to put a 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.519
 pressure dish there are guys in the middle already 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.079
 I said when I said before no no what 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.280
 I have placed it then forget me 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.669
 then nothing happens that fixes it 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.049
 doing like this I remove here this placed 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.759
 a pressure plate that I have to go to 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.590
 look for it where is the potassium profession 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:29.020
 of tension silver pressure 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.330
 where is where are you where is where 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.980
 where is the silver there 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.110
 pressure is perfect as an example of 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.910
 stone is worth to me and the water that the water already 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.040
 I will not take better then silver 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.590
 press and I take off is the block and no longer 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.100
 you dance does not go out the water is easy 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.410
 guys facilitate well we continue to place 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.080
 block and block up there in this case 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.380
 already placed it in white different height and 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.460
 I put what block block is 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.830
 these are provisional this white in 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.690
 the one that guys and vice now because to 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.240
 can place the dispensers then 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.830
 placed dispenser dispenser 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.660
 Dispenser dispenser and turn those 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.889
 blocks because if I can not I can get to 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.450
 place the dispenser guys 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.240
 heavy dispensers and remove the 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.610
 blocks and dispensers and I remove the 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.979
 perfect blocks I already have the second 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.740
 row of dispensers done now that what 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.680
 I have to place the redstone 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.509
 the redstone is then worth the rest 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.940
 no problem if you focus with the rest 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.220
 towards what is the dispenser is not going 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.250
 Ok, it does not leave you then you have to 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:36.099
 focus what is everything then everything 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:37.360
 here everything here is worth waiting for 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.580
 you see perfectly how it has to go 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.780
 we're also going to this area here with 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.199
 this area here and this area here 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.840
 well so what is the line below and 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.090
 It really has what electricity is 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.710
 it's worth what I'm going to do next 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.440
 guys and attention that we are finishing 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.780
 I will place one to season here a 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.360
 block and I'm going to place all the part of 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.889
 up covering the lid on this can 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.060
 per can per can it is broken then 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.039
 I already have the vibration done now 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.630
 the rest towards the top as 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.770
 I have to do focusing on the blocks 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.750
 that are up because if you fire the 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.759
 dispenser does not leave the rest does not leave 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.919
 apply it then it focused on those of 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.539
 up and we have it already guys 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.880
 Indeed there is nothing else to do 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.500
 you just have to put inside the 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.750
 dispenser all the objects that 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.120
 you want me to give you once I step on the 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.159
 pressure plate would work already guys 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.800
 you wanted a tutorial here you have 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:28.860
 new tutorial a magical re the 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.469
 walk-in closet 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.300
 in the dressing room of the second as you want 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:34.680
 call it does not have any science or just 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.879
 you have to cover the casing like 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.110
 You want to see how I had it 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.849
 I recommend in principle I made a 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.430
 pasillito is look now floor here to see 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.319
 you see and the dispensers already sound 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.520
 they would really give all the material nothing 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.319
 more guys I'm going to ask for a like 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.139
 subscribe to share social networks 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:51.139
 and see you in minecraft
