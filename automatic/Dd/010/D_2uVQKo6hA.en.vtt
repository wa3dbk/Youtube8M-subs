00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:22.429
 new episode on telebelluno di 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.769
 know the mushrooms today of what fungus 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.839
 let's talk today let's talk about a good one 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.179
 Edible and sought after species of the 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.460
 our territory a growing species 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.910
 right in the deciduous forests yes 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.340
 treats of cortinarius lend called 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.980
 also vulgarly kaolack here with us 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.830
 or koch are dialectal names but in 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.960
 use among researchers defends these 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.210
 specimens are still very present 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.550
 young but it is obvious they suffered the 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.100
 their rather compact structure e 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.400
 robust 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.700
 how you see the young specimens and vi 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.790
 they have a hat that is reduced compared 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:06.009
 at the base of the stem which is strongly 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:08.260
 enlarged to form a giant bulb 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.960
 the mushroom 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.820
 it is initially covered with a veil 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.740
 very abundant whitish color 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.690
 white as soon as they leave this veil that 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.420
 here the superficial part is clearly visible 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.320
 of the hat with the maturation of the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.930
 mushroom with magnification of the diameter 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.920
 of the hat tends to tear of a 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:38.170
 be distributed and is often no longer visible 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.229
 in the ripe mushroom these mushrooms yes 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.760
 initially present with the hat 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:50.680
 hemispherical like small porcini mushrooms 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.200
 just meet but growing 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.180
 they become conversants then they spy 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.420
 completely and sometimes they become 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.590
 the surface that is depressed in the center 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.410
 it has a pretty purple brown 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.709
 regular at maturity presents some 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.020
 wrinkles enough or vein veins 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.930
 on the hat I'm pretty 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.560
 characteristics of the species 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.920
 the meat is just whitish with 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.420
 penal the cine or hazelnut tones 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.440
 pale emanates a 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.780
 pleasant fungal odor and is compact and 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.190
 keeps the compact structure also 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.739
 after cooking 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.590
 it is indeed a species is 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.720
 edible also marketed 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.750
 fabio with her is preferable to consume 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.239
 this type of mushroom at the table 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.080
 here this mushroom should not be consumed like 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.319
 the others are sautÃ©ed like many others 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.150
 other mushrooms the best yield of this 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.940
 species is certainly conservation 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.950
 in fact this oil keeps in oil 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.489
 the firmness of the meat even after the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.640
 of the precooking and remains excellent below 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.959
 the palate observed in this way 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.319
 ordinary surprises teheran you can 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.209
 to reach even considerable dimensions 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.060
 some specimens can easily 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.730
 reach 20 centimeters in diameter 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.239
 of the hat and exceed 20 25 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.959
 inches tall is a tied mushroom 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.859
 hardwood so it can hardly 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.260
 be in different woods 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:34.310
 you may come across this species 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.440
 near some conifer but not 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.010
 it is with the conifers that this species does 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.380
 read but his spawn tends and yes 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.120
 normally read with the roots of 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.920
 hardwoods and also for today really 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.720
 I remember all that I know about mushrooms 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.640
 to a program broadcast on belluno canvases 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.290
 but you can find it in the replica also on 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.070
 our youtube channel 10 and praise 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.070
 productions 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.440
