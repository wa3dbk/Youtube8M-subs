00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
clean here see if i can get this as best

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.219 
clean here see if i can get this as best
as<00:02:07.829> i<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.009> again<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.149> zoom<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.810> too<00:02:09.989> close

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.940 
before number 91 can bat this down but
just<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.500> great<00:02:26.740> play<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:28.470> great<00:02:29.470> touchdown

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
just a great play a great touchdown

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.370 
just a great play a great touchdown
first<00:02:30.760> score<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.390> think<00:02:31.690> it's<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.930> first<00:02:32.140> score

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
first score I think it's the first score

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.190 
first score I think it's the first score
of<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> game<00:02:32.590> but<00:02:33.480> I'm<00:02:34.480> impressed<00:02:34.660> with<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
of the game but I'm impressed with the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.110 
of the game but I'm impressed with the
quarterback<00:02:35.680> animations<00:02:36.370> I'm<00:02:36.550> impressed<00:02:36.910> at

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
quarterback animations I'm impressed at

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.470 
quarterback animations I'm impressed at
the<00:02:37.150> tight<00:02:37.450> end<00:02:37.660> actually<00:02:38.140> sales<00:02:39.150> on<00:02:40.150> this

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
the tight end actually sales on this

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.640 
the tight end actually sales on this
play<00:02:40.780> like<00:02:41.500> he<00:02:41.650> should<00:02:42.690> he<00:02:43.690> actually<00:02:43.900> makes<00:02:44.410> it

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
play like he should he actually makes it

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.260 
play like he should he actually makes it
seem<00:02:44.890> like<00:02:45.070> he's<00:02:45.310> going<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.700> stay<00:02:46.000> back<00:02:46.240> in

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
seem like he's going to stay back in

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.740 
seem like he's going to stay back in
block<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.110> then<00:02:47.560> once<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.220> defense<00:02:49.030> opens<00:02:49.540> up

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
block and then once the defense opens up

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.400 
block and then once the defense opens up
the<00:02:49.930> middle<00:02:50.080> of<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.380> field<00:02:50.560> he<00:02:51.220> streaks<00:02:51.610> down

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
the middle of the field he streaks down

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.430 
the middle of the field he streaks down
gets<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.590> catch<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:55.120> gets<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.750> touchdown<00:02:55.930> I

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
gets the catch and gets the touchdown I

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.320 
gets the catch and gets the touchdown I
mean<00:02:57.190> he<00:02:57.340> sells<00:02:57.610> that<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.230> point<00:02:59.470> where<00:03:00.330> no

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
mean he sells that to the point where no

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.270 
mean he sells that to the point where no
defensive<00:03:01.900> player<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.709> middle<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.130> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
defensive player is in the middle of the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.360 
defensive player is in the middle of the
field<00:03:03.490> let's<00:03:03.880> watch<00:03:04.090> this<00:03:04.390> one<00:03:04.690> more<00:03:04.840> time

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.190 

he's<00:03:12.370> blocking<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:13.150> blocking<00:03:13.720> he's<00:03:13.900> blocking

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
he's blocking is blocking he's blocking

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.250 
he's blocking is blocking he's blocking
usually<00:03:17.200> he<00:03:18.130> would<00:03:18.280> put<00:03:18.459> his<00:03:18.489> hands<00:03:18.940> up<00:03:19.230> give<00:03:20.230> a

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
usually he would put his hands up give a

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.520 
usually he would put his hands up give a
push<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.830> then<00:03:21.010> head<00:03:21.340> straight<00:03:21.670> up<00:03:22.060> field<00:03:22.530> to

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
push and then head straight up field to

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.900 
push and then head straight up field to
where<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.800> defense<00:03:24.220> would<00:03:24.489> know<00:03:24.700> exactly

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
where the defense would know exactly

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.720 
where the defense would know exactly
what's<00:03:25.720> going<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:26.200> but<00:03:26.500> he<00:03:26.680> selasis<00:03:27.220> them<00:03:27.550> I

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
what's going on but he selasis them I

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.940 
what's going on but he selasis them I
think<00:03:28.090> it's<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.300> middle<00:03:28.510> linebacker<00:03:29.080> or<00:03:29.590> one

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
think it's the middle linebacker or one

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.990 
think it's the middle linebacker or one
of<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.130> linebackers<00:03:31.680> opens<00:03:32.680> up<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.950> field

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
of the linebackers opens up the field

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.720 
of the linebackers opens up the field
and<00:03:34.000> again<00:03:34.300> this<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.830> was<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.040> great<00:03:36.340> play

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730
