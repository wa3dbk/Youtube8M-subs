 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.340
 hardware deals today with the update of 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.900
 1000 euro gaming pc in august 2015 with 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.580
 This pc should be all possible 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.740
 current title in very high 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.570
 Settings with full hd resolutions 60 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.049
 to play liquid pictures per second 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.420
 can 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.100
 as cpu we rely on an intel 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.050
 xeon e3 1200 31 43 with 43 4 gigahertz 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.880
 this process is more or less up-to-date 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.519
 core i7 processor without integrated 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.529
 graphics unit he also has 8 mb l3 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.759
 cache and support hyperthreading like that 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.870
 that a multi core optimized 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.300
 applications a clear 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.590
 Speed ​​advantage has its games 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.460
 performance is at about the same level 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.989
 an intel core i7 4790 at even 50 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.550
 euro cheaper price with the in 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.860
 things price can barely be beaten 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.570
 That is our system even at last 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.760
 pleasantly quiet and cool stays in 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.629
 CEO 02 macho processor cooler 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.090
 for use 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.640
 the mainboard is an affront k 97 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.609
 anniversary edition it offers with pci 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.190
 express 3.0 six sata 3 ports usb 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.559
 3.0 gigabit lan four ram benches and five 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.990
 more pci slots a very good one 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.200
 equipment versatile 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.990
 extension possibilities 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.170
 as graphics card put on a dr 9 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.750
 390 micro from sapphire with rich 8 gb 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.659
 gddr5 memory This graphics card is a 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.100
 rebreak the old r 9 290 of amd offers 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.750
 due to the raised day rates 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.330
 However, significantly more power and lies 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.330
 you at the level of r 9 290 6 resp 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.920
 energie.de x900 70 also we are with 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.600
 the eight gigabyte graphics memory very much 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.909
 well prepared for the future 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.070
 as an alternative of nvidia would be mine 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.049
 Recommendation a geforce gtx 970 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.570
 jetstream of khalid this card is only 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.220
 slower than the a 9 390 offers 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.869
 but only 3 5 gigabytes 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.000
 graphics memory which is why I personally 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.680
 which would prefer 1 9 390 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.119
 the working memory is eight 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.740
 gigabyte and comes from the crucial 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.590
 hard disk a therapist comes from 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.409
 Seagate also we install a 250gb 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.020
 cuddly mx 200 ssd to applications and 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.969
 Charging time to accelerate sufficiently 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.579
 energy for our system represents the 500th 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.259
 watt peak oil series to dispose the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.430
 gold here is a very high quality 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.110
 Power supply with all necessary 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.209
 Protective circuits come and things 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.069
 efficiency partly platinum certified 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.400
 power supplies in the shade increases 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.019
 Good last, everyone will come 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.299
 with little shinobi midi-tower 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.650
 housed the links to both were 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.390
 Believe, as always, you can find it in the bottom 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.010
 the description if you like the video 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.180
 liked and that support me 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.620
 I would like to go over my thumb 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.239
 Looking up or an abo 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.739
 In any case thank you very much 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.090
 watch and see you next time 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.090
 hardware deals
