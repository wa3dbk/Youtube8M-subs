00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
and we decided hey why not and we

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.670 
and we decided hey why not and we
followed<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:19.959> runway<00:02:20.320> in<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.470> middle<00:02:20.620> of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
followed this runway in the middle of

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.920 
followed this runway in the middle of
nowhere<00:02:21.010> down<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.489> cantina<00:02:22.450> on<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.690> point

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
nowhere down to a cantina on the point

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.530 
nowhere down to a cantina on the point
and<00:02:23.310> went<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.730> they<00:02:24.970> weren't<00:02:25.120> open<00:02:25.239> but

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
and went in and they weren't open but

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.330 
and went in and they weren't open but
when<00:02:25.600> they<00:02:25.750> saw<00:02:25.930> us<00:02:26.109> they<00:02:26.320> said<00:02:26.560> we'll<00:02:26.920> open<00:02:27.070> up

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
when they saw us they said we'll open up

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.069 
when they saw us they said we'll open up
it<00:02:27.730> wasn't<00:02:27.970> very<00:02:28.060> long<00:02:28.299> before<00:02:28.359> we<00:02:28.780> sat<00:02:29.049> down

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
it wasn't very long before we sat down

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.330 
it wasn't very long before we sat down

we're eating some good food and heard
helicopter<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.180> we<00:02:31.720> ran<00:02:31.870> outside<00:02:32.079> saw<00:02:32.799> the

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
helicopter so we ran outside saw the

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.830 
helicopter so we ran outside saw the
helicopters<00:02:33.430> coming<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.850> got<00:02:34.120> pumped<00:02:34.510> up<00:02:34.660> and

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
helicopters coming in got pumped up and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.630 
helicopters coming in got pumped up and
it<00:02:35.290> was<00:02:35.350> funny<00:02:35.650> cuz<00:02:35.799> we<00:02:35.859> were<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:36.220> talking

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
it was funny cuz we were just talking

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.099 
it was funny cuz we were just talking
about<00:02:36.700> how<00:02:36.850> we're<00:02:37.180> gonna<00:02:37.239> drive<00:02:37.540> back<00:02:37.780> with

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
about how we're gonna drive back with

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.599 
about how we're gonna drive back with
four<00:02:38.410> people<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:38.890> truck<00:02:39.070> now<00:02:39.100> instead<00:02:39.549> of

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
four people in the truck now instead of

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.849 
four people in the truck now instead of
three<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.570> was<00:02:40.690> gonna<00:02:40.780> be<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.959> lot<00:02:41.170> tighter<00:02:41.530> and

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
three it was gonna be a lot tighter and

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:42.750 
three it was gonna be a lot tighter and
we<00:02:41.950> just<00:02:42.130> didn't<00:02:42.280> know<00:02:42.310> how<00:02:42.459> we're<00:02:42.549> gonna<00:02:42.609> get

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
we just didn't know how we're gonna get

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.810 
we just didn't know how we're gonna get
Travis<00:02:43.120> back<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.600> San<00:02:43.780> Diego<00:02:44.579> before<00:02:45.579> we<00:02:45.670> knew

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
Travis back to San Diego before we knew

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.610 
Travis back to San Diego before we knew
he<00:02:46.030> was<00:02:46.060> dusting<00:02:46.630> off<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.049> I<00:02:47.079> was<00:02:47.109> way<00:02:47.290> back<00:02:47.500> to

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
he was dusting off and I was way back to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.130 
he was dusting off and I was way back to
San<00:02:47.799> Diego<00:02:48.250> told<00:02:48.940> me<00:02:49.000> they<00:02:49.090> flew<00:02:49.299> bag<00:02:49.480> like<00:02:49.750> 300

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
San Diego told me they flew bag like 300

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.720 
San Diego told me they flew bag like 300
feet<00:02:50.260> off<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.410> deck<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.799> entire<00:02:51.040> way<00:02:51.250> must

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
feet off the deck the entire way must

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.510 
feet off the deck the entire way must
have<00:02:51.819> been<00:02:51.910> beautiful

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.339 

so<00:02:55.520> when<00:02:55.760> we<00:02:55.849> came<00:02:56.000> out<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.270> cantina<00:02:57.050> and

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
so when we came out of the cantina and

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.920 
so when we came out of the cantina and
we<00:02:57.530> realized<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.569> driver's<00:02:59.569> side<00:02:59.690> wheel

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
we realized that the driver's side wheel

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.809 
we realized that the driver's side wheel
was<00:03:00.200> laying<00:03:00.500> on<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.830> coil<00:03:01.069> spring<00:03:01.489> we

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
was laying on the coil spring we

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.220 
was laying on the coil spring we
realized<00:03:02.150> why<00:03:02.300> Travis<00:03:02.660> might<00:03:02.840> have<00:03:02.959> tried<00:03:03.080> to

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
realized why Travis might have tried to

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.170 
realized why Travis might have tried to
escape<00:03:03.440> so<00:03:03.739> quickly<00:03:04.099> so<00:03:04.489> what<00:03:04.879> we<00:03:05.000> think

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
escape so quickly so what we think

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.970 
escape so quickly so what we think
happened<00:03:05.239> basically<00:03:05.690> was<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.410> bounced<00:03:06.680> up<00:03:06.860> and

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
happened basically was it bounced up and

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.770 
happened basically was it bounced up and
down<00:03:07.069> and<00:03:07.580> like<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.760> jackhammer<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.569> just

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
down and like a jackhammer it just

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.080 
down and like a jackhammer it just
nailed<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.680> upper<00:03:09.920> control<00:03:10.069> arm<00:03:10.430> several

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
nailed that upper control arm several

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.759 
nailed that upper control arm several
times<00:03:11.330> really<00:03:11.750> rapidly<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.380> finally

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
times really rapidly and finally

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.620 
times really rapidly and finally
fractured<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.610> while<00:03:14.120> we<00:03:14.209> didn't<00:03:14.450> find

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
fractured it and while we didn't find

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.940 
fractured it and while we didn't find
the<00:03:14.750> exact<00:03:14.959> bolt<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.380> would<00:03:15.500> work<00:03:15.650> we<00:03:15.860> were

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
the exact bolt that would work we were

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.949 
the exact bolt that would work we were
able<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.280> use<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.640> couple<00:03:16.910> nuts<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.690> random

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
able to use a couple nuts and a random

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.930 
able to use a couple nuts and a random
spacer<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.739> create<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.370> splint<00:03:19.760> for<00:03:19.819> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
spacer and create a splint for the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.550 
spacer and create a splint for the
situation<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.599> we<00:03:20.720> knew<00:03:20.900> would<00:03:21.080> would

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
situation that we knew would would

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:31.890 
situation that we knew would would
probably<00:03:22.040> get<00:03:22.190> us<00:03:22.340> out<00:03:22.519> of<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.730> country

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.360 

I'm<00:03:32.290> really<00:03:32.560> starting<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:32.860> understand<00:03:33.280> it

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
I'm really starting to understand it

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.649 
I'm really starting to understand it
better<00:03:33.459> now<00:03:33.610> there's<00:03:34.000> there's<00:03:34.450> all<00:03:34.540> these

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
better now there's there's all these

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.119 
better now there's there's all these
families<00:03:35.170> I've<00:03:35.290> been<00:03:35.409> doing<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.709> for<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:35.980> many

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
families I've been doing it for so many

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.970 
families I've been doing it for so many
years<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.700> it's<00:03:37.120> not<00:03:37.329> because<00:03:37.510> it's<00:03:38.379> become<00:03:38.799> a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
years and it's not because it's become a

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.350 
years and it's not because it's become a
ritual<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.519> don't<00:03:39.670> think<00:03:39.909> I<00:03:40.030> think<00:03:40.239> it's

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
ritual I don't think I think it's

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.460 
ritual I don't think I think it's
because<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.720> first<00:03:40.930> time<00:03:41.110> they<00:03:41.230> came<00:03:41.409> out

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
because the first time they came out

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.380 
because the first time they came out
they<00:03:41.860> broke<00:03:42.459> everything<00:03:42.730> they<00:03:43.000> get<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.180> chance

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
they broke everything they get a chance

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.149 
they broke everything they get a chance
to<00:03:43.510> see<00:03:43.689> it<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.200> second<00:03:44.590> time<00:03:44.620> they<00:03:44.950> came<00:03:45.099> out

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
to see it the second time they came out

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.800 
to see it the second time they came out
they<00:03:45.340> probably<00:03:45.670> got<00:03:45.909> to<00:03:46.030> see<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> lot<00:03:46.360> more<00:03:46.420> and

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
they probably got to see a lot more and

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.630 
they probably got to see a lot more and
still<00:03:47.049> broke<00:03:47.319> the<00:03:47.829> third<00:03:48.069> time<00:03:48.280> they<00:03:48.400> came<00:03:48.579> out

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
still broke the third time they came out

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.069 
still broke the third time they came out
they<00:03:49.030> probably<00:03:49.329> had<00:03:49.599> their<00:03:49.720> stuff<00:03:49.900> together

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
they probably had their stuff together
