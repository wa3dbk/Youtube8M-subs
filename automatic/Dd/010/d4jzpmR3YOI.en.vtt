00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.550
 Friends of mundo finally blackberry.com 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.270
 we are there and we are ready with the new one 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.560
 review of the blackberry passport 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.259
 very particular review why 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.990
 we will be three editors to perform 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:32.250
 this review or lorenzo 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.949
 massimiliano and riccardo we had 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.440
 way to try this passport for one 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.720
 week and beyond and we preferred 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.720
 investigate every aspect of this by 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.829
 this new device rather than 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.989
 review in a hurry 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.289
 this is because the passport is a device 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.420
 really particular that introduces 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.320
 of the innovative and blackberry functions 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.190
 precisely in a market dominated by devices 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.100
 with touch 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.890
 do you still want to propose what in the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.649
 his smartphone reading key 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.350
 for business ie a smartphone that 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.410
 contains a qwerty keyboard but one 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.940
 magazine and innovative keyboard and indeed 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:24.240
 there will be a separate focus precisely for the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.580
 passport keyboard that shows up with 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.110
 generous dimensions indeed we have a 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:37.910
 128 mm long and 93 wide 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:43.849
 and a 9.3 mm depth thickness 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:47.729
 for the weight is 100 96 grams which weight 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:49.770
 creates many conflicting opinions 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.069
 the point is that this really needs to be proven 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.390
 passport because the weight is so important 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:02:00.390
 but during daily use it is not 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.670
 also hears why the pas sport is a 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.910
 device to be used with the hands 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.899
 in fact it is not allowed to use in 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.430
 facilitated way with a hand as well as yes 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.800
 runs the risk of dropping it 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.520
 just a little comparison with others 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.410
 device 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.150
 just to get an idea of ​​his 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:25.140
 actual dimensions 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:30.599
 here we find the blackberry z trento lo 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:34.769
 thickness is not similar however in width 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.989
 and we can do another little bigger 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.599
 exhibition with us we are a comparison 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.510
 with another device is the flex of 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:46.019
 lg which is a 6 inch device then 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.340
 already considered a fa black indeed if 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:52.889
 we superimpose it we can see how the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.159
 passport is slightly wider but 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:03:00.750
 obviously much smaller in height 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.329
 in front we find the qwerty keyboard 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.709
 magazine 3 end of keys with sensor 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:09.510
 gorilla glass touch and lcd screen 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:14.519
 really well defined with a diagonal 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:19.739
 of 4.5 inches ratio 1 1 and one of 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:26.910
 they are a resolution of 1440 x 1440 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:32.180
 pixel at 453 ppi of density over it 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:35.129
 speaker the speaker for calls 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.389
 brightness sensor proximity led of 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:41.129
 notification and 2 megapixel camera 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:44.120
 in the back it remembers 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.709
 vaguely the q 10 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.389
 if in fact it is divided into two parts 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.629
 via a metal band la 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:58.290
 upper part is a removable part 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:02.760
 in fact inside we find the micro sd 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.790
 expandable up to 128gb and accommodation for 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.639
 the hand up will be sim format that is 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.019
 been adopted by blackberry but already 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.889
 used for some years by others 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:16.709
 always competing behind camera from 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:20.299
 13 megapixel LED flash and two 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.720
 system speakers 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.599
 along the side band in the passport one 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.110
 stainless steel band we find 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.690
 the top is the jack for le 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.860
 headphones and taxation lock release 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.169
 turning the device off 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.139
 the side keys are the volume keys 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.909
 the pause button in the event of a pause e 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.699
 resumes when playing 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:49.009
 musical or to call that 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:52.310
 the voice assistant that has been revised 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.639
 in this version of should 10.3 in the 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:05:00.560
 lower part we find two speakers 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:02.180
 stereo microphone and USB 2.0 port which 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.870
 serves to recharge and synchronize 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.050
 the display with the computer and also 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.590
 to view the contents on 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.650
 televisions or cleaners with technology 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.190
 hdmi, however, will need to use a 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.479
 cable in fact imports him up 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.270
 this device has been abandoned 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:27.740
 definitively the hdmi output as 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:31.099
 it happened on old 10 old blackberries 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.219
 in quotes of course it was all 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.710
 unified finally in this one door 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:40.509
 USB port has been placed at the bottom 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:45.289
 the device does not get in the way 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:47.719
 disk usage usage when the 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.279
 device is charging 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:53.060
 obviously the left side instead is 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:56.389
 all clean the beating heart of this 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:01.520
 this sport's device is a 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:08.669
 qualcomm snapdragon 801 processor with 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:13.780
 adreno 303 adreno 330 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:17.229
 quad core 2.2 gb of 3GB of RAM frequency 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.479
 32 gigabytes of expandable memory 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:24.789
 via microsd like never seen before 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:28.000
 up to 128 and battery from 3,000 to 450,000 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:29.979
 ampere even if it is a toll is high 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.009
 we did a little trouble getting to 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:36.159
 end of the day with one or better who it is 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:38.500
 expected a longer use of 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:40.449
 this battery with more autonomy 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.930
 long of this battery 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:46.389
 so we assume that this firmware 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.889
 have something wrong anyway 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:50.740
 on the battery 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:56.349
 we will focus separately in the 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:07:00.250
 conclusions lte radio technology with and 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:03.819

 then low energy nfc radio fm gps 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.300
 these are the characteristics of this 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:28.930
 new top of the house blackberry range 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:32.289
 now we're going to see how the 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:36.089
 blackberry passport function behaves 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:36.089
 with s 10.3
