this<00:00:20.130> was<00:00:20.279> one<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.460> our<00:00:20.640> earliest<00:00:20.880> designs

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this was one of our earliest designs

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.380 
this was one of our earliest designs
which<00:00:21.900> gave<00:00:22.410> amazing<00:00:23.160> functionality<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.360> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
which gave amazing functionality to a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.300 
which gave amazing functionality to a
portable<00:00:25.080> monitor<00:00:25.259> in<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> earliest<00:00:26.130> days

portable monitor in the earliest days

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.220 
portable monitor in the earliest days
this<00:00:26.730> was<00:00:26.880> before<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.390> smaller<00:00:27.930> more

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
this was before the smaller more

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.109 
this was before the smaller more
personal<00:00:28.680> portable<00:00:29.160> monitors<00:00:29.610> came<00:00:29.849> about

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
personal portable monitors came about

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.780 
personal portable monitors came about
the<00:00:30.899> idea<00:00:31.169> of<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.439> type<00:00:31.770> monitor<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> top

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the idea of this type monitor was a top

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.150 
the idea of this type monitor was a top
unit<00:00:33.210> would<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.809> put<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.290> top<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.739> truck<00:00:35.010> in

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
unit would be put on top of the truck in

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.950 
unit would be put on top of the truck in
some<00:00:35.399> manner<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.730> some<00:00:36.059> pre<00:00:36.270> pipe<00:00:36.480> water<00:00:36.720> way

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
some manner and some pre pipe water way

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.410 
some manner and some pre pipe water way
down<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> town<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> pump<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.579> then

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
down to the town to the pump and then

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
down to the town to the pump and then
when<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> application<00:00:40.380> presented<00:00:40.829> itself

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
when the application presented itself

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
when the application presented itself
from<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.430> firefighting<00:00:41.880> standpoint<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.990> top

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
from a firefighting standpoint the top

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.690 
from a firefighting standpoint the top
would<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.470> taken<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.070> would<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.310> handed

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
would be taken off it would be handed

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.370 
would be taken off it would be handed
down<00:00:44.730> then<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.570> would<00:00:45.660> be<00:00:45.780> attached<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.290> a

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
down then it would be attached to a

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.110 
down then it would be attached to a
portable<00:00:46.830> base<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.280> was<00:00:47.400> probably<00:00:47.610> deployed

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
portable base that was probably deployed

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.600 
portable base that was probably deployed
up<00:00:48.330> towards<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> fire<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.260> some<00:00:49.500> point<00:00:49.770> so

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
up towards the fire at some point so

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.730 
up towards the fire at some point so
this<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> case<00:00:51.390> where<00:00:51.660> probably<00:00:52.650> the

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
this is a case where probably the

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.280 
this is a case where probably the
biggest<00:00:52.920> innovation<00:00:53.580> here<00:00:54.060> was<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.900> lighten

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
biggest innovation here was to lighten

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.020 
biggest innovation here was to lighten
the<00:00:55.410> load<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> firefighter<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.790> lot<00:00:56.910> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the load of the firefighter in a lot of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.290 
the load of the firefighter in a lot of
cases<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:58.470> older<00:00:59.010> models<00:00:59.430> wear<00:00:59.640> heavy<00:00:59.880> brass

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
cases the older models wear heavy brass

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.510 
cases the older models wear heavy brass
often<00:01:00.840> had<00:01:00.990> three<00:01:01.320> inlets<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.280> term

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
often had three inlets the term

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.450 
often had three inlets the term
multiversal<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:04.229> term<00:01:04.439> portable<00:01:05.040> was<00:01:05.189> pretty

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
multiversal the term portable was pretty

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.389 
multiversal the term portable was pretty
relative<00:01:06.000> until<00:01:06.840> TFT<00:01:07.229> came<00:01:07.439> along<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> with

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
relative until TFT came along and with

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.889 
relative until TFT came along and with
the<00:01:08.490> use<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.670> really<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.450> high-strength

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
of the other component tree we did we

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.810 
of the other component tree we did we
knocked<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.009> huge<00:01:14.280> amount<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.640> weight<00:01:14.790> out

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
knocked a huge amount of the weight out

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.910 
knocked a huge amount of the weight out
of<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.990> made<00:01:16.200> these<00:01:16.440> a<00:01:16.470> more

of it and really made these a more
portable<00:01:17.490> type<00:01:17.909> monitor<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.290> all

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
portable type monitor now you see all

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.510 
portable type monitor now you see all
the<00:01:19.500> different<00:01:19.770> components<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.370> we<00:01:20.490> have

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the different components that we have

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.660 
the different components that we have
here<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.330> cross<00:01:21.570> fire<00:01:21.860> monitor<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.130> I

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
here in the cross fire monitor and I

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.980 
here in the cross fire monitor and I
kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.090> want<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.390> through<00:01:24.659> them<00:01:24.810> very

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
kind of want to go through them very

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.350 
kind of want to go through them very
quickly<00:01:25.580> one<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.729> key<00:01:26.909> things<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.240> we

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
quickly one of the key things that we

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120 
quickly one of the key things that we
identified<00:01:27.900> early<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> design<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
identified early on in the design and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.590 
identified early on in the design and
development<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:30.030> some<00:01:30.270> sort<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.510> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
development was to have some sort of a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.080 
development was to have some sort of a
safety<00:01:31.049> valve<00:01:31.340> integrated<00:01:32.340> into<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> unit

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
safety valve integrated into the unit

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.210 
safety valve integrated into the unit
itself<00:01:33.420> when<00:01:34.350> you're<00:01:34.500> dealing<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.830> flows

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
itself when you're dealing with flows

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.580 
itself when you're dealing with flows
again<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.120> case<00:01:36.330> rated<00:01:36.690> up<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.810> 1250

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
again in this case rated up to 1250

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.620 
again in this case rated up to 1250
gallons<00:01:37.890> per<00:01:38.280> minute<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> ground<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.600> can

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
gallons per minute on the ground you can

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.570 
gallons per minute on the ground you can
have<00:01:39.930> reaction<00:01:40.470> forces<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
have reaction forces that it

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.880 
have reaction forces that it
well<00:01:41.970> exceeds<00:01:42.390> 600<00:01:42.990> pounds<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.500> nozzle

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
well exceeds 600 pounds of nozzle

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.250 
well exceeds 600 pounds of nozzle
reactions<00:01:44.400> so<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.299> have<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.960> some<00:01:46.229> level

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
reactions so you have to have some level

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.350 
reactions so you have to have some level
of<00:01:46.590> safety<00:01:46.860> including<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:48.030> sort<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
of safety including some sort of a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.210 
of safety including some sort of a
tie-down<00:01:48.780> strap<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.320> service<00:01:49.950> during

that TFT

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.179 
that TFT
we<00:02:24.569> also<00:02:24.720> make<00:02:25.019> this<00:02:25.170> model<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.709> what<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.010> call

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
we also make this model in what we call

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.580 
we also make this model in what we call
a<00:02:26.220> stowaway<00:02:26.700> base<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.750> does<00:02:27.959> not<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.379> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
a stowaway base that does not have the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.710 
a stowaway base that does not have the
safety<00:02:28.829> valve<00:02:29.099> image<00:02:29.489> so<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:30.180> offered<00:02:30.569> both

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
safety valve image so it's offered both

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.780 
safety valve image so it's offered both
ways<00:02:31.049> now<00:02:31.349> again<00:02:32.159> it's<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.400> two-piece

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
ways now again it's a two-piece

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.339 
ways now again it's a two-piece
configuration<00:02:33.689> and<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.019> bottom

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
configuration and on the bottom

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.170 
configuration and on the bottom
component<00:02:34.890> here<00:02:35.069> you'll<00:02:35.250> see<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:35.610> has<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.819> set

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
component here you'll see it has a set

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.640 
component here you'll see it has a set
of<00:02:36.209> folding<00:02:36.659> legs<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.140> are<00:02:37.200> made<00:02:37.439> from

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
of folding legs that are made from

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.520 
of folding legs that are made from
spring<00:02:38.099> steel<00:02:38.640> stainless<00:02:39.269> steel<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.810> we<00:02:40.500> have

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
spring steel stainless steel and we have

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.490 
spring steel stainless steel and we have
five<00:02:40.980> very<00:02:41.489> very<00:02:41.790> sharp<00:02:42.090> carbide<00:02:42.599> tips<00:02:42.959> that

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
five very very sharp carbide tips that

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.349 
five very very sharp carbide tips that
provide<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.370> necessary<00:02:44.849> friction<00:02:45.060> with

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
provide the the necessary friction with

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.330 
provide the the necessary friction with
the<00:02:45.390> ground<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.959> add<00:02:46.109> to<00:02:46.379> stability<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.099> this

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
the ground to add to stability on this

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.030 
the ground to add to stability on this
so<00:02:48.030> typically<00:02:48.480> what<00:02:48.659> we<00:02:48.750> would<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:49.109> the<00:02:49.739> unit

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
so typically what we would do the unit

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.349 
so typically what we would do the unit
would<00:02:50.129> come<00:02:50.310> off<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.609> top<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.909> the<00:02:50.970> truck<00:02:51.209> in

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
would come off the top of the truck in

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.270 
would come off the top of the truck in
this<00:02:51.480> case<00:02:51.689> we<00:02:51.900> see<00:02:52.049> an<00:02:52.140> extended<00:02:52.470> gun<00:02:52.739> up<00:02:52.920> here

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
this case we see an extended gun up here

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.130 
this case we see an extended gun up here
it<00:02:53.670> would<00:02:53.790> be<00:02:53.909> taken<00:02:54.269> down<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.599> handed<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:54.989> the

it would be taken down and handed to the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.960 
it would be taken down and handed to the
person<00:02:55.500> on<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.680> ground<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.280> then<00:02:56.819> this

person on the ground and then this

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.640 
person on the ground and then this
component<00:02:57.209> would<00:02:57.629> be<00:02:57.690> added<00:02:58.139> to<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.349> bottom

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650

from<00:03:26.819> maybe<00:03:27.450> inadvertently<00:03:28.139> having<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
from maybe inadvertently having the the

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.430 
from maybe inadvertently having the the
gun<00:03:29.250> come<00:03:29.519> off<00:03:29.669> the<00:03:29.849> top<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.389> unit<00:03:30.690> also

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
gun come off the top of the unit also

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.009 
gun come off the top of the unit also
back<00:03:31.650> here<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:32.069> can<00:03:32.250> see<00:03:32.519> we<00:03:33.180> have<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:33.359> friction

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
back here you can see we have a friction

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.099 
back here you can see we have a friction
style<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.859> lock<00:03:35.129> okay<00:03:35.849> so<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.510> rotational

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
style of lock okay so that rotational

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.649 
style of lock okay so that rotational
lock<00:03:37.349> would<00:03:37.590> be<00:03:37.709> pressed<00:03:38.010> down<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.609> now<00:03:39.510> it's

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
lock would be pressed down and now it's

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.930 
lock would be pressed down and now it's
locked<00:03:39.959> in<00:03:40.169> place<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.489> little<00:03:41.699> unique

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
locked in place this is a little unique

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.149 
locked in place this is a little unique
as<00:03:42.180> well<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.629> instead<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:43.019> some<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.889> what

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
as well that instead of some of the what

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.189 
as well that instead of some of the what
other<00:03:44.340> competitive<00:03:44.909> models<00:03:45.269> do<00:03:45.480> we've<00:03:45.810> chosen

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
other competitive models do we've chosen

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.550 
other competitive models do we've chosen
to<00:03:46.409> use<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.560> small<00:03:47.069> nylon<00:03:48.109> serrated<00:03:49.109> friction

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
to use a small nylon serrated friction

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.349 
to use a small nylon serrated friction
component<00:03:50.159> that<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:50.489> fits<00:03:50.699> right<00:03:50.909> in<00:03:51.090> here

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
component that just fits right in here

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.089 
component that just fits right in here
so<00:03:51.540> if<00:03:51.659> it<00:03:51.750> ever<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.109> damaged<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.739> can<00:03:52.769> kind<00:03:53.040> of

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
so if it ever is damaged you can kind of

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.149 
so if it ever is damaged you can kind of
hear<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.459> as<00:03:53.579> I<00:03:54.030> turn<00:03:54.329> this<00:03:54.540> I'll<00:03:54.750> present<00:03:55.159> you

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
hear it as I turn this I'll present you

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.000 
hear it as I turn this I'll present you
can<00:03:56.310> hear<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.639> serrations<00:03:57.090> in<00:03:57.599> there<00:03:57.810> if<00:03:58.739> it

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
can hear the serrations in there if it

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.890 
can hear the serrations in there if it
is<00:03:59.190> damaged<00:03:59.760> it's<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.090> very<00:04:00.479> inexpensive

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
is damaged it's a very inexpensive

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.930 
is damaged it's a very inexpensive
replacement<00:04:01.769> or<00:04:01.859> repair<00:04:01.949> can<00:04:02.400> be<00:04:02.489> done<00:04:02.639> very

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
replacement or repair can be done very

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.030 
replacement or repair can be done very
very<00:04:03.030> quickly<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.199> was<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.829> other<00:04:04.919> thing

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
very quickly so that was the other thing

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.119 
very quickly so that was the other thing
some<00:04:05.430> other<00:04:05.549> key<00:04:05.760> features<00:04:06.209> we<00:04:06.959> identified<00:04:07.829> a

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
some other key features we identified a

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.979 
some other key features we identified a
lot<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.549> competitive<00:04:09.060> models<00:04:09.449> this<00:04:09.659> worm

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
lot of the competitive models this worm

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.379 
lot of the competitive models this worm
gear<00:04:10.319> assembly<00:04:10.680> right<00:04:11.519> in<00:04:11.639> this<00:04:11.760> area<00:04:11.940> takes<00:04:12.269> a

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
gear assembly right in this area takes a

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.909 
gear assembly right in this area takes a
lot<00:04:12.569> of<00:04:12.690> abuse<00:04:12.959> because<00:04:13.379> of<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.590> weight<00:04:13.769> of

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
lot of abuse because of the weight of

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.409 
lot of abuse because of the weight of
the<00:04:14.010> nozzle<00:04:14.400> on<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.609> end<00:04:14.729> and<00:04:14.909> bouncing<00:04:15.329> on

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
the nozzle on the end and bouncing on

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.390 
the nozzle on the end and bouncing on
the<00:04:15.479> truck<00:04:15.780> going<00:04:15.989> down<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.380> street<00:04:16.709> so<00:04:17.280> we

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
the truck going down the street so we

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.399 
the truck going down the street so we
had<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.729> really<00:04:18.030> beefed<00:04:18.449> this<00:04:18.750> area<00:04:19.109> up<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.320> we

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
had to really beefed this area up and we

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.170 
had to really beefed this area up and we
came<00:04:19.620> up<00:04:19.769> with<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.949> very<00:04:20.220> unique<00:04:20.400> stainless

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
came up with a very unique stainless

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.270 
came up with a very unique stainless
steel<00:04:21.449> worm<00:04:22.139> gear<00:04:22.500> that's<00:04:22.770> designed<00:04:23.130> to

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
steel worm gear that's designed to

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.520 
steel worm gear that's designed to
handle<00:04:23.789> this<00:04:23.880> sort<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.210> load<00:04:24.419> that<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> bouncing

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
handle this sort of load that a bouncing

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.260 
handle this sort of load that a bouncing
nozzle<00:04:25.949> will<00:04:26.070> have<00:04:26.250> as<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.639> heads<00:04:26.880> down<00:04:27.090> the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
nozzle will have as it heads down the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.029 
nozzle will have as it heads down the
road<00:04:27.419> so<00:04:27.630> that's<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.960> very<00:04:28.169> unique<00:04:28.470> feature<00:04:28.680> as

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
road so that's a very unique feature as

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.430 
road so that's a very unique feature as
well<00:04:29.250> we<00:04:30.030> also<00:04:30.210> put<00:04:30.479> a<00:04:30.510> pressure<00:04:30.780> gauge<00:04:31.110> in<00:04:31.349> the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
well we also put a pressure gauge in the

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.980 
well we also put a pressure gauge in the
top<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.800> every<00:04:32.039> crossfire<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:33.120> faces<00:04:33.719> back

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
top of every crossfire that faces back

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.659 
top of every crossfire that faces back
to<00:04:34.229> the<00:04:34.320> operator<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:35.039> you<00:04:35.130> don't<00:04:35.279> have<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.550> get

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
to the operator so you don't have to get

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.159 
to the operator so you don't have to get
up<00:04:35.789> over<00:04:36.029> the<00:04:36.060> top<00:04:36.150> of<00:04:36.389> the<00:04:36.599> gun<00:04:36.779> to

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
up over the top of the gun to

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.739 
up over the top of the gun to
what<00:04:37.379> your<00:04:37.560> operational<00:04:38.159> pressure<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.819> so

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:39.749 
what your operational pressure is so

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:42.050 
what your operational pressure is so
between<00:04:40.139> that<00:04:40.379> the<00:04:41.340> different<00:04:41.669> types<00:04:41.909> of

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
between that the different types of

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.939 
between that the different types of
nozzles<00:04:42.539> that<00:04:42.599> we<00:04:42.779> have<00:04:42.990> either<00:04:43.199> stack<00:04:43.620> tips

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
nozzles that we have either stack tips

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.219 
nozzles that we have either stack tips
with<00:04:44.249> straight<00:04:44.580> streams<00:04:44.969> or<00:04:45.360> our<00:04:45.810> regular

with straight streams or our regular
automatic<00:04:46.379> master<00:04:47.159> stream<00:04:47.490> that<00:04:47.759> can<00:04:47.909> be

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:48.029 
automatic master stream that can be

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.689 
automatic master stream that can be
adjusted<00:04:48.539> in<00:04:48.659> pressure<00:04:49.430> tremendous<00:04:50.430> amount

of configuration can take place with the

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:54.769 
of configuration can take place with the
crossfire<00:04:53.039> the<00:04:53.819> other<00:04:53.969> thing<00:04:54.210> that<00:04:54.240> we<00:04:54.419> did<00:04:54.569> is

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:54.779 
crossfire the other thing that we did is

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:56.300 
crossfire the other thing that we did is
a<00:04:54.810> lot<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.080> departments<00:04:55.319> may<00:04:55.650> start<00:04:55.949> off<00:04:56.099> with

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
a lot of departments may start off with

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.300 
a lot of departments may start off with
a<00:04:56.340> twin<00:04:56.729> two-and-a-half<00:04:57.569> inch<00:04:57.749> Inlet<00:04:58.310> to

a twin two-and-a-half inch Inlet to

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.070 
a twin two-and-a-half inch Inlet to
basically<00:05:00.120> feed<00:05:00.360> it<00:05:00.449> with<00:05:00.539> two<00:05:00.719> two<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:00.990> a

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
basically feed it with two two and a

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.010 
basically feed it with two two and a
half<00:05:01.199> or<00:05:01.409> two<00:05:01.439> three<00:05:01.860> inch<00:05:02.009> supply<00:05:02.370> lines

half or two three inch supply lines

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.939 
half or two three inch supply lines
someday<00:05:04.020> they<00:05:04.169> may<00:05:04.289> change<00:05:04.529> to<00:05:04.770> large

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
someday they may change to large

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
hose with storts couplings well instead

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.550 
hose with storts couplings well instead
of<00:05:08.460> having<00:05:08.639> to<00:05:08.789> buy<00:05:08.969> a<00:05:08.999> whole<00:05:09.210> new<00:05:09.419> base<00:05:09.839> you

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
of having to buy a whole new base you

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.890 
of having to buy a whole new base you
can<00:05:10.740> see<00:05:10.770> this<00:05:11.099> rear<00:05:11.370> piece<00:05:11.699> basically<00:05:12.389> comes

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
can see this rear piece basically comes

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.510 
can see this rear piece basically comes
off<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.409> then<00:05:13.589> we<00:05:13.740> can<00:05:13.919> put<00:05:14.129> a<00:05:14.159> brand<00:05:14.460> new

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
off and then we can put a brand new

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.070 
off and then we can put a brand new
coupling<00:05:14.999> on<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:15.389> instead<00:05:15.659> of<00:05:15.719> having<00:05:15.870> to

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
coupling on it so instead of having to

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.019 
coupling on it so instead of having to
buy<00:05:16.199> the<00:05:16.259> whole<00:05:16.560> base<00:05:16.770> you<00:05:17.279> just<00:05:17.520> add<00:05:17.699> a<00:05:17.729> new

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:18.029 
buy the whole base you just add a new

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:19.879 
buy the whole base you just add a new
brand<00:05:18.330> new<00:05:18.599> back<00:05:18.990> end<00:05:19.020> of<00:05:19.319> the<00:05:19.409> thing<00:05:19.589> and<00:05:19.770> you

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
brand new back end of the thing and you

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.320 
brand new back end of the thing and you
have<00:05:20.039> the<00:05:20.189> appropriate<00:05:20.400> coupling<00:05:21.060> for<00:05:21.240> the
