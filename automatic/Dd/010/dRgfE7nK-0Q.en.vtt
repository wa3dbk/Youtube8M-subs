and<00:01:46.710> while<00:01:47.189> I'm<00:01:47.340> letting<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> sizzle<00:01:48.180> I'm

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and while I'm letting it sizzle I'm

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.810 
and while I'm letting it sizzle I'm
going<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> bring<00:01:48.689> my<00:01:49.040> service<00:01:50.040> ball<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
going to bring my service ball in and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.810 
going to bring my service ball in and
I'm<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.840> plate<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.470> noodles<00:01:52.890> by

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
I'm going to plate the noodles by

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.749 
I'm going to plate the noodles by
twisting<00:01:54.450> them<00:01:54.600> up<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.930> bit<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.310> idea<00:01:56.700> is

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
twisting them up a bit and the idea is

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.840 
twisting them up a bit and the idea is
to<00:01:56.850> stack<00:01:57.390> them<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:58.979> they<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> little

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
to stack them so that they have a little

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.319 
to stack them so that they have a little
bit<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.000> height<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.500> dimension<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:03.119> I'm

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
bit of height and dimension and then I'm

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.260 
bit of height and dimension and then I'm
going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.750> drizzle<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.350> dressing<00:02:05.119> around<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
going to drizzle the dressing around the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.380 
going to drizzle the dressing around the
plate<00:02:07.099> and<00:02:08.099> now<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.280> chicken<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.910> nice<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
plate and now the chicken is nice and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.210 
plate and now the chicken is nice and
hot<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.780> even<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> little<00:02:10.379> bit<00:02:10.500> crispy<00:02:11.009> from

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
hot and even a little bit crispy from

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.360 
hot and even a little bit crispy from
the<00:02:11.340> oil

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.040 

and<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.460> put<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.760> around<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.180> edges<00:02:18.390> almost

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
and I put it around the edges almost

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.730 
and I put it around the edges almost
