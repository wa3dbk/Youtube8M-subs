00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
this little infrared device we plug into

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.990 
this little infrared device we plug into
the<00:01:42.950> jack<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.980> then<00:01:45.980> we<00:01:46.130> have<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.520> put<00:01:46.850> the

the jack and then we have to put the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.330 
the jack and then we have to put the
volume<00:01:47.180> up<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:50.440> having<00:01:51.440> done<00:01:51.620> that<00:01:51.650> we<00:01:52.160> can

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
volume up and having done that we can

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.980 
volume up and having done that we can
just<00:01:52.610> make<00:01:53.450> sure<00:01:54.790> that<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.120> I<00:01:56.240> helicopter<00:01:56.540> is

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
just make sure that the I helicopter is

just make sure that the I helicopter is
on<00:01:57.730> okay<00:01:58.960> then<00:01:59.960> we<00:02:00.110> turn<00:02:00.320> on<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:01.750> our<00:02:02.750> device

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
on okay then we turn on to our device

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.790 
on okay then we turn on to our device
and<00:02:04.360> just<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.450> check<00:02:05.720> if<00:02:05.960> they<00:02:06.230> are<00:02:06.260> connected

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
and just to check if they are connected

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.430 
and just to check if they are connected
we<00:02:07.400> can<00:02:07.430> try<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:07.790> turn<00:02:08.060> on<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.570> light<00:02:08.750> okay

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.620 
we have a few controls we have three
channels<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.070> want<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.790> use<00:02:19.970> three<00:02:20.240> aleko

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
channels so we want to use three aleko

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.530 
channels so we want to use three aleko
at<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> same<00:02:21.110> time<00:02:21.350> with<00:02:21.560> three<00:02:21.770> other<00:02:21.980> people

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
one we want to use we can turn around if

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.699 
one we want to use we can turn around if
we<00:02:30.950> are<00:02:33.190> better<00:02:34.750> with<00:02:35.750> these<00:02:35.989> on<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.320> right<00:02:36.500> or

another<00:02:57.840> really<00:02:58.260> cool<00:02:58.530> feature<00:02:58.590> we<00:02:59.040> have<00:02:59.220> here

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
another really cool feature we have here

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.479 
another really cool feature we have here
is<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.209> gyroscope<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.159> seeing<00:03:04.489> depending

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
is the gyroscope it is seeing depending

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.770 
is the gyroscope it is seeing depending
on<00:03:06.379> how<00:03:09.049> we<00:03:10.049> have<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.590> iPhone<00:03:11.450> we'll<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.690> able

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
on how we have the iPhone we'll be able

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.710 
on how we have the iPhone we'll be able
to<00:03:13.140> make<00:03:14.129> it<00:03:14.280> go<00:03:14.430> left<00:03:14.790> right<00:03:15.650> back<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.980> forth

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
to make it go left right back and forth

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.440 
to make it go left right back and forth
so<00:03:18.720> we'll<00:03:19.530> try<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:19.950> first<00:03:20.269> without<00:03:21.269> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
so we'll try it first without the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:47.890 
so we'll try it first without the
gyroscope<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.260> then<00:03:22.349> after<00:03:22.620> with<00:03:23.359> okay<00:03:25.730> ready

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:04:19.200 

okay<00:03:48.620> ready<00:03:48.970> go

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.680 

now<00:04:20.210> we'll<00:04:20.450> turn<00:04:20.720> on<00:04:20.990> the<00:04:21.170> gyroscope<00:04:22.420> okay<00:04:23.420> and

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
now we'll turn on the gyroscope okay and

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.180 
now we'll turn on the gyroscope okay and
then<00:04:24.680> we<00:04:24.830> we<00:04:25.220> have<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.520> try<00:04:25.730> to<00:04:26.080> be<00:04:27.080> more<00:04:27.880> plane

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
then we we have to try to be more plane

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:45.520 
then we we have to try to be more plane
so<00:04:31.190> let's<00:04:31.940> ride

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.729 

many's<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.560> time<00:04:46.800> around
