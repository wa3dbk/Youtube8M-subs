script<00:05:41.410> being<00:05:42.250> turned<00:05:42.520> on<00:05:42.670> and<00:05:42.730> stripping

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
script being turned on and stripping

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.050 
script being turned on and stripping
turned<00:05:43.660> off<00:05:43.840> so<00:05:44.740> right<00:05:44.920> now<00:05:45.070> it<00:05:45.310> is<00:05:45.340> off<00:05:45.700> and

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
turned off so right now it is off and

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.540 
turned off so right now it is off and
I'm<00:05:47.020> just<00:05:47.080> going<00:05:47.320> to<00:05:47.410> set<00:05:47.590> these<00:05:47.770> speed<00:05:48.220> at

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
I'm just going to set these speed at

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.890 
I'm just going to set these speed at
around<00:05:49.830> 9<00:05:50.830> o'clock<00:05:50.860> and<00:05:51.400> this<00:05:52.330> is<00:05:52.480> on<00:05:52.600> a<00:05:52.630> clean

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
around 9 o'clock and this is on a clean

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.510 
around 9 o'clock and this is on a clean
sound<00:05:53.110> then<00:05:53.470> I'll<00:05:53.590> switch<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.830> distorted

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
sound then I'll switch to distorted

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:13.860 
sound then I'll switch to distorted
sound<00:05:54.730> so<00:05:55.510> here's<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.870> face<00:05:56.080> 19<00:06:12.600> now<00:06:13.600> with<00:06:13.780> the

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
sound so here's the face 19 now with the

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:31.370 
sound so here's the face 19 now with the
script<00:06:14.200> activated

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:48.830 

so<00:06:32.380> script<00:06:32.950> turned<00:06:33.190> off<00:06:33.310> now

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.389 

now<00:06:49.840> the<00:06:49.900> descript<00:06:50.530> activated<00:06:51.189> the<00:06:52.120> story
