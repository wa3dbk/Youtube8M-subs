 the cities of gold as many 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.670
 what we did with bernard on 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.920
 was passionate being a kid we were 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.650
 very passionate about cinema theater and 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.350
 cinema painting in every way that 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.910
 goes back very far so our dream 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.580
 it's always been to make a movie a 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.840
 feature film and today we're going 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.450
 welcome in a few minutes you can 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.610
 just not if they are there with the spoon 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.680
 so the producer raphael benoliel the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:51.289
 so here is so raphael can join to 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:53.809

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.559
 okay with us now so it goes 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.300
 develop 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.859
 we worked becomes a certain time 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.300
 it's not today but we are 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.030
 decided not to announce it as long as it was 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.489
 not sure therefore to develop a long 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.230
 footage in real view of the cities of gold and 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.760
 in fact when I say a feature film I 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.950
 am a bit restrictive here because his 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.930
 project is to a series of feature films 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:19.480
 this is raphael hello excuse me I 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.480
 a little lost my voice but yes 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.789
 I'm pretty happy with the announced 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.299
 officially here to nice because I 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.259
 am Nice 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:35.860
 so I'm certain number of elements 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.189
 and that's good and that's it's true 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.920
 that a few months ago a year and a half ago 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.479
 now two years maybe we have to jean 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.710
 will entrust the rights of adaptation and I 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.170
 am very happy and so we work 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.189
 eagerly on it and I met 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.100
 other people 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.020
 over time whose virgin to the money is 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.860
 with me and who as such camacho 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.700
 that they stop filming a moment 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.020
 anyway and who is a fan like you 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.179
 mysterious cities of gold and who will 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.319
 follow a little by my side 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.610
 evolution is shared all this on 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.709
 internet so that you can 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.630
 participate in the adventure also but 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:22.269
 I may be able to say hello 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:25.329
 the world am I am very happy 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.880
 to be there with you all today if 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.560
 one day I told myself that I 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.510
 will share the same scene as bernard 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.810
 deyriès and jean chalopin I would not have it 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.549
 vintage 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.769
 even though I hope it is very very strong 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.880
 well, we must always believe in 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.730
 his dreams because the dream becomes 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.620
 reality today I have a chance 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.389
 exceptional is to have met 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.819
 to burst through a small work 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.370
 I realized who will be projected 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.639
 in a few moments 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.310
 a small gift to advertise on 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.650
 internet precisely the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.870
 the construction of the film for 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.860
 also announce the launch of the site on 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.170
 which you can follow 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.709
 the evolution of the project behind the scenes 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.590
 behind the scenes the making-of with 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:21.030
 also can I talk about 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:23.910
 funding is too late in fact the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.700
 site will have a participatory dimension 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.569
 because you will also be able to 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.069
 fans who wish to participate in 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.799
 film financing 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.120
 I will have to let Raphael talk about this 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.140
 aspect there is still a nice challenge that 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.610
 is very expensive to produce and and if 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.500
 fans can participate it's a 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.209
 series that is worship around the world 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.980
 whole is a super diffusion of 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.069
 millions of names of millions of fans 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.660
 we hope and here you can follow 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.760
 soon all this on the internet on 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.010
 the site address that is going to be 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.010
 projected with the teaser thank you 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.830
 raphaël except the fact you're Nice 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.930
 and I see that the reactions are rather 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.010
 favorable 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.990
 it would be good because we know well 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.850
 jean and bernard but maybe you 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.170
 present a little bit and know 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.760
 it's a little bit your curriculum 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.560
 cinematic before getting into 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.190
 in quotation marks the quick of the subject well 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.080
 sure then I do I did a lot 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.630
 and still today costs of 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.970
 executive production for 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.160
 foreign productions in France and 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.300
 This is how so all that I 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.250
 works a lot internationally 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.570
 and it's true that even if the dishes 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.970
 served what was announced a project 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.980
 already in the room initially but it's 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.860
 not a film that can be separated 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.360
 french film by means that go 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.860
 having to be gone and so it was for that 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.870
 that it is also a subject that has 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.940
 interested beyond when I was 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.410
 child obviously and dreams and 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.180
 I had the chance to speak a 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.890
 little bit of what I did so from 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.510
 participate in foreign productions 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.880
 which are shot in France or even in 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.500
 abroad especially many with 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.820
 starting working title of a company 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.210
 English so I worked on love 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.120
 actually or paris dow jones the movie that 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.190
 has a little changed my life that I have co 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.550
 produces the film of woody allen midnight at 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.350
 Paris is with the Oscars and others 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.410
 inevitably it changes a little bit my 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.270
 career and since then I have participated in 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.120
 Smurfs 2 who will be coming out this summer 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.870
 rhett de and many other productions 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.090
 international 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.450
 for the movie cities of gold 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.950
 he was arrested that it's necessarily a 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.600
 movie the shore is what it was all about 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.890
 following the decision of departure because he 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.720
 have been so many rumors for a few 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.950
 years because during animations to be 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.150
 product then we are a little lost 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.290
 finally it was my basic desire 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:47.270
 but it's true that a year ago we 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:48.380
 launched a little poll on facebook that 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.550
 is for fans and that's why 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.790
 it's important with the presence of 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.430
 virgile and you participate all the 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.160
 time that and the result this poll has been 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.240
 that more than 60% I believe 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.490
 of all the people who have kindly 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.650
 answer wanted more than 90% 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.360
 a film adaptation and 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.630
 more than 60% live adaptation 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.360
 so that's so if I understand correctly 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.650
 today since jean said it so 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.930
 well just now the fans have 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.880
 so much helped bring back 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.460
 cities of gold by the great gate to the 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.780
 television there is possibility that the 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.760
 fans is therefore participating in the great adventure 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.930
 to build maybe a golden city 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.930
 with you cc it's the goal
