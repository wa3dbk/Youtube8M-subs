00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 I will go 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.610
 very good everyone I am area efe of lethal 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.070
 progress and I'm here again for 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.259
 bring this video in the world a map that 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.140
 I really wanted to play and I'm here 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.939
 to bring you this time not the record itself 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.500
 but a starting situation one 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.529
 pretty funny situation that we will see 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.079
 that generated quite a few doubts about 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.779
 if in the end I could get to spend 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.980
 of this round of round 82 and they come 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.079
 followed poses the situation in 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.480
 screen as you have seen I have fallen in 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.960
 round 81 right with the last zombie of 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.850
 round and great mistake on my part already 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.010
 you know that before moving to 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.500
 constancy commit something very bad a 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.270
 pretty serious error in this case what 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.520
 I did without wanting it was because of the stress 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.739
 I shot the zombie right at the moment 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.670
 to knock me down on the floor with what he 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.890
 I killed him and round 82 was just beginning and 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.130
 I kept reviving on the floor like 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.130
 you see 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.320
 as you can understand the next thing 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.540
 I must do is try to go to the land 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.030
 man's land to try to buy the titan 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.860
 that was the initial intention especially 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.440
 when you find yourself in a situation 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.990
 so I guess the people that you want 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.850
 try in the world as record os 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.190
 I recommend that you be very careful 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.720
 big labs was my surprise for 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.750
 those guys when it comes to earth and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.180
 for me it took the displeasure of my life with 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.610
 the fit line was the first time he 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.000
 he threw big rounds to money and thought 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.360
 I already had everything 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.350
 everything broken everything had gone to hell 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.950
 but hey do not discourage me I took 5 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.900
 minutes of rest take a deep breath and that 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.479
 Well, maybe if I do the first 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.630
 I can make all sunny waves 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.340
 the one that I put to work 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.050
 immediately you will see the type of movements 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.270
 what do I do that I do not know exactly lima 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.730
 the route that I've seen most usual to the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.260
 people do other people 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.150
 what happens that I felt pretty 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.160
 like in this so there are a couple of 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.070
 moments when it turns out slightly 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.440
 more complicated but as the end and the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.270
 out in the zombies once 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.000
 accustom strategy is you 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.710
 same the one who is discovering how 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.750
 he feels more comfortable because well this was 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.580
 the most habitual movement that is made 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.080
 in this room and immediately you will see the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.080
 movement that I usually 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.249
 the truth that I had not yet found 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:32.069
 never in a situation of this kind in 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.659
 you're making a record and you have 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.400
 to spend so much time if in 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.019
 titan yes it is true that in some car 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.849
 gÃ¼ero in one or two hours 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.870
 completely careless we are 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.870
 very different and as you can appreciate me 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.870
 I played it I played the guy I preferred not 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.439
 buy men and the quick revive thinking 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.810
 if I get past the 82nd round then 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:57.569
 already find the time to buy with 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.459
 the game but the passage of this round a 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.379
 little as punishment for the error that had 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.219
 done a little bit of self punishment myself 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.900
 I did not impose not buying well the 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.879
 I really would have loved it 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.690
 bring all that is the whole round 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.850
 why 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.550
 had moments for all the truth is 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.730
 which is very like all the great rounds 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.830
 it's very mechanical but the fact of not 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.390
 have titan makes any little 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.150
 detail that you are not used then 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.070
 I can stagger the entire game 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.530
 because you already know that the touches do not 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.140
 they say goodbye for many hours that they 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.760
 we have dedicated to the map and well for 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.960
 example when I'm going to throw a hole in 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.610
 the group is not the case and that's why 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.350
 I put a little fast it's closed 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.850
 perfectly the windows accustom him 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.980
 he's going to do what he's used to 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.410
 close one of them and the other always the 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.370
 it left open imagine your nerves 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.370
 for this to happen to me 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.490
 yes 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.010
 yes 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.270
 Well you 've seen the truth is that 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.390
 I got so nervous that at the time of 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.450
 pirate the skull, if you look 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.670
 was fair and maximum ammo and fail not 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.070
 However I was quite lucky because without 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.650
 spend many bullets from the wonder wave to 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.690
 a pair of hands immediately finished the 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.340
 round and was already in round 83 and already 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.889
 could go to buy throw perfect pp 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.040
 although it is very clear to all 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.870
 those who want to play good when 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.460
 we are ready to go down to earth 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.310
 we have to take into account if we have 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.810
 lowered in that same round me in the round 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.510
 82 I have gone down and found the 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.490
 prestidigitation and the fact of 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.810
 find me the prestidigitation 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.260
 it means that I can not go back down 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.410
 in round 82 then now is the 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.470
 round 83 and as you can see I do not 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.150
 I went straight to the titan 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.740
 because I would find myself with a bad 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.320
 surprise in getting to the top and it's 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.710
 that during the two minutes or three 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.700
 I do not know the exact time either but 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.410
 about two minutes or three 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.410
 the teleportation to the earth 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.120
 it stays closed then you never have 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.360
 excessive hurry in returning to earth we 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.980
 we have already done a round 82 whole 100 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.050
 Titan with what I did not cost anything 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.790
 hold the first wave of the 83 a 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.180
 little by giving him two or three laps of 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.490
 more and once it was assured that the 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.300
 teleportation is open and with 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.990
 pretty wins 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.610
 I took my five minutes of 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.990
 and spinning and you can lower the earth 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.330
 I found the most precious thing in the world 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.870
 after so much suffering the 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.000
 titan and well tell you that this game 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.930
 finished in round 95 and not because 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.310
 died but because the play got hooked 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.020
 rare in black ops 1 , but so well 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.540
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.850
 round and if more you worry and you command 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.800
 your support as always a hug 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.800
 huge from lethal brothers and chao chao
