prematurity<00:00:27.730> I've<00:00:28.730> been<00:00:29.029> doing<00:00:29.480> this<00:00:29.599> for<00:00:29.810> 35

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
prematurity I've been doing this for 35

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.470 
prematurity I've been doing this for 35
years<00:00:30.259> and<00:00:30.770> I<00:00:30.829> remember<00:00:31.130> 30<00:00:31.880> weak<00:00:32.090> babies

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
years and I remember 30 weak babies

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.290 
years and I remember 30 weak babies
being<00:00:32.689> very<00:00:32.960> difficult<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:34.280> keep<00:00:34.760> alive<00:00:35.090> and

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
being very difficult to keep alive and

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.750 
being very difficult to keep alive and
resuscitate<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.320> now<00:00:36.710> we're<00:00:36.890> down<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.070> 23

weeks<00:00:38.079> Greyson<00:00:39.079> survived<00:00:39.470> for<00:00:39.680> about<00:00:39.860> an<00:00:40.010> hour

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
weeks Greyson survived for about an hour

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.650 
weeks Greyson survived for about an hour
but<00:00:40.460> she<00:00:40.640> was<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:40.940> small<00:00:41.210> they<00:00:41.360> couldn't

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
but she was so small they couldn't

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.069 
but she was so small they couldn't
intubate<00:00:41.899> her<00:00:42.280> so<00:00:43.280> she<00:00:43.340> passed<00:00:43.730> away<00:00:43.879> at<00:00:44.269> one

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
intubate her so she passed away at one

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.560 
intubate her so she passed away at one
hour<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:45.469> four<00:00:45.620> minutes<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:46.359> Amy's<00:00:47.359> been

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
hour and four minutes and Amy's been

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.549 
hour and four minutes and Amy's been
just<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.350> rock<00:00:48.649> star<00:00:49.010> since<00:00:49.309> then<00:00:53.559> initially

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
just a rock star since then initially

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.410 
just a rock star since then initially
when<00:00:54.769> parents<00:00:55.039> come<00:00:55.250> into<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.640> neonatal<00:00:56.239> ICU

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
when parents come into the neonatal ICU

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.299 
when parents come into the neonatal ICU
and<00:00:57.140> see<00:00:57.289> their<00:00:57.440> baby<00:00:57.620> hooked<00:00:57.920> up<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.190> monitors

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
and see their baby hooked up to monitors

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.759 
and see their baby hooked up to monitors
I<00:00:58.850> feel<00:00:59.089> like<00:00:59.420> they<00:00:59.719> had<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.019> sense<00:01:00.289> of<00:01:00.440> fear

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
I feel like they had the sense of fear

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.340 
I feel like they had the sense of fear
because<00:01:01.309> I<00:01:01.670> think<00:01:02.210> ideally<00:01:02.629> they<00:01:02.929> wanted<00:01:03.230> to

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
because I think ideally they wanted to

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.259 
because I think ideally they wanted to
take<00:01:03.469> their<00:01:03.649> babies<00:01:03.949> home

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
take their babies home

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.109 
take their babies home
we<00:01:06.259> try<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.500> mimic<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.520> environment<00:01:07.970> of<00:01:08.030> the

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
we try to mimic the environment of the

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.050 
we try to mimic the environment of the
uterus<00:01:08.479> because<00:01:09.110> many<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.649> these<00:01:09.770> patients

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
uterus because many of these patients

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.910 
uterus because many of these patients
have<00:01:11.060> come<00:01:11.299> out<00:01:11.450> of<00:01:11.479> that<00:01:11.840> environment<00:01:12.290> much

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
have come out of that environment much

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.789 
have come out of that environment much
too<00:01:13.159> early<00:01:13.270> so<00:01:14.270> we<00:01:14.299> try<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.689> keep<00:01:14.899> it<00:01:15.080> quiet<00:01:15.350> and

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
too early so we try to keep it quiet and

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.600 
too early so we try to keep it quiet and
dark<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.020> covering<00:01:18.500> over<00:01:18.710> the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
dark and so the covering over the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.529 
dark and so the covering over the
environment<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.149> they're<00:01:20.360> in

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
environment that they're in

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.200 
environment that they're in
obviously<00:01:21.500> limits<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.280> parents<00:01:22.759> as<00:01:22.880> well<00:01:23.030> as

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
obviously limits the parents as well as

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.320 
obviously limits the parents as well as
the<00:01:23.390> caretakers<00:01:23.960> ability<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.740> be<00:01:24.830> able<00:01:25.009> to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
the caretakers ability to be able to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.429 
the caretakers ability to be able to
visually<00:01:26.330> watch<00:01:26.570> them<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.020> see<00:01:27.200> what<00:01:27.320> they're

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
visually watch them and see what they're

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.219 
visually watch them and see what they're
doing<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.060> monitors<00:01:29.479> are<00:01:29.659> really<00:01:29.869> helpful

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
doing so the monitors are really helpful

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.020 
doing so the monitors are really helpful
especially<00:01:30.350> for<00:01:30.710> parents<00:01:31.039> and<00:01:31.520> then<00:01:31.610> for

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
especially for parents and then for

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.600 
especially for parents and then for
nurses<00:01:32.360> of<00:01:32.509> course<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:33.140> always<00:01:33.470> be<00:01:34.130> able<00:01:34.399> to

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
nurses of course to always be able to

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.449 
nurses of course to always be able to
know<00:01:34.850> what<00:01:35.060> their<00:01:35.210> patient<00:01:35.600> is<00:01:35.689> doing<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:37.340> was

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
know what their patient is doing it was

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.370 
know what their patient is doing it was
definitely<00:01:37.789> nice<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.209> have<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.200> education

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
definitely nice to have that education

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.289 
definitely nice to have that education
early<00:01:40.039> on<00:01:40.190> about<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.610> monitors<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.030> the

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
early on about the monitors and the

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.050 
early on about the monitors and the
importance<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.929> all<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.770> different<00:01:43.130> numbers

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
importance of all the different numbers

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.449 
importance of all the different numbers
and<00:01:44.450> what<00:01:44.569> they<00:01:44.690> meant<00:01:44.869> yeah<00:01:45.440> I<00:01:45.740> think<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.340> was

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
and what they meant yeah I think it was

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.059 
and what they meant yeah I think it was
our<00:01:46.580> first<00:01:46.759> look<00:01:47.060> into<00:01:47.299> her<00:01:47.600> world<00:01:47.899> her<00:01:48.830> main

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
our first look into her world her main

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.359 
our first look into her world her main
issue<00:01:49.280> was<00:01:49.990> she<00:01:50.990> had<00:01:51.140> APNIC<00:01:51.679> moments<00:01:52.190> where

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
issue was she had APNIC moments where

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.699 
issue was she had APNIC moments where
she<00:01:52.399> would<00:01:52.700> hold<00:01:52.940> her<00:01:53.030> breath<00:01:53.470> bradycardia<00:01:54.470> is

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
she would hold her breath bradycardia is

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.529 
she would hold her breath bradycardia is
a<00:01:54.740> common<00:01:55.250> finding<00:01:55.580> and<00:01:55.909> in<00:01:56.209> premature

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
a common finding and in premature

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.350 
a common finding and in premature
infants<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.289> many<00:01:57.590> times<00:01:57.920> not<00:01:58.369> always<00:01:58.610> it's<00:01:59.119> a

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
infants and many times not always it's a

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.630 
infants and many times not always it's a
result<00:01:59.929> of<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.200> baby<00:02:00.640> essentially

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
result of the baby essentially

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.980 
result of the baby essentially
forgetting<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.179> breathe<00:02:02.360> because<00:02:02.630> of<00:02:02.929> the

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
forgetting to breathe because of the
