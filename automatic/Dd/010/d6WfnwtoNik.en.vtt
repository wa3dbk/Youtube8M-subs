himself<00:00:43.770> really<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:44.880> home<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> key<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.750> E

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
himself really at home in the key of E

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.630 
himself really at home in the key of E
but<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.470> his<00:00:46.620> friends<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.100> jamming<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.580> they

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
but if his friends are jamming and they

a<00:00:49.650> little<00:00:49.770> got<00:00:50.280> me<00:00:50.430> really<00:00:50.700> thinking<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.330> can

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
a little got me really thinking what can

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.800 
a little got me really thinking what can
I<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.630> in<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.470> different<00:00:52.620> key<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.210> dropped

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
I do in a different key and so I dropped

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.410 
I do in a different key and so I dropped
my<00:00:55.140> East<00:00:55.530> ring<00:00:55.890> down<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.370> D<00:00:56.580> and<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.120> started

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
my East ring down to D and I started

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360 
my East ring down to D and I started
thinking<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> key<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.320> D<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.190> little

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
thinking in the key of D and that little

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.270 
thinking in the key of D and that little
Jam<00:00:59.730> sort<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.360> came<00:01:00.540> out<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.040> that<00:01:02.040> little

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
Jam sort of came out of that that little

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.430 
Jam sort of came out of that that little
practice<00:01:02.670> session<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.150> mine<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.260> want

practice session of mine so what I want
you<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.800> is<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.940> know<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.360> about

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you to do is to you know think about

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.260 
you to do is to you know think about
this<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.050> way<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.880> kind<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.030> springboard

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
this as a way to kind of springboard

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
this as a way to kind of springboard
yourself<00:01:09.900> into<00:01:10.229> different<00:01:10.530> keys<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:11.009> you're

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
yourself into different keys if you're

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.290 
yourself into different keys if you're
stuck<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.000> E<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:12.479> stuck<00:01:13.020> into<00:01:13.170> any<00:01:13.380> other<00:01:13.590> key

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
stuck in E or stuck into any other key

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.490 
stuck in E or stuck into any other key
hopefully<00:01:15.300> you're<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.509> stuck<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.780> D<00:01:16.080> because

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
hopefully you're not stuck in D because

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.140 
hopefully you're not stuck in D because
this<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.860> more<00:01:17.040> deep<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.520> anyway<00:01:17.880> if

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
this will be more deep but anyway if

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.330 
this will be more deep but anyway if
you're<00:01:18.300> stuck<00:01:18.690> in<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.930> key<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:20.040> ways

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you're stuck in a key think about ways

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.910 
you're stuck in a key think about ways
to<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:20.850> out<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.619> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.770> what

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
to get out of it and this is what

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
to get out of it and this is what
happened<00:01:23.250> when<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.369> was<00:01:23.550> really<00:01:23.790> thinking

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
happened when I was really thinking

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.430 
happened when I was really thinking
about<00:01:24.240> getting<00:01:24.390> out<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> key<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.080> E<00:01:25.229> which

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
about getting out of the key of E which

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.010 
about getting out of the key of E which
I'm<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.800> quite<00:01:26.250> frequently<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.000> let's<00:01:27.869> take<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
I'm in quite frequently so let's take a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080 
I'm in quite frequently so let's take a
deeper<00:01:28.380> look<00:01:28.560> at<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.979> lick<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.490> I'll<00:01:29.910> break

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
deeper look at the lick and I'll break

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.600 
deeper look at the lick and I'll break
it<00:01:30.240> down<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.410> go<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:32.400> right<00:01:32.460> so

it down for you here we go all right so
what<00:01:33.210> I'm<00:01:33.330> doing<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.780> break<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.140> thing<00:01:34.200> down

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
what I'm doing the break this thing down

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.969 
what I'm doing the break this thing down
is<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.970> focus<00:01:36.330> in<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.410> couple<00:01:37.740> different

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
is I like to focus in a couple different

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.740 
is I like to focus in a couple different
areas<00:01:38.069> one<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.819> the<00:01:39.000> rhythm<00:01:39.300> piece

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
areas one there is the rhythm piece

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.900 
areas one there is the rhythm piece
which<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:40.890> centered<00:01:41.520> around<00:01:41.640> this

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
which is really centered around this

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.020 
which is really centered around this
decoder<00:01:42.420> which<00:01:43.080> again<00:01:43.410> I'm<00:01:43.590> tuned<00:01:43.920> down<00:01:44.580> with

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
decoder which again I'm tuned down with

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.770 
decoder which again I'm tuned down with
my<00:01:45.270> low<00:01:45.720> sixth<00:01:46.140> string<00:01:46.670> D<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.360> strum

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
my low sixth string D so you can strum

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.560 
my low sixth string D so you can strum
through

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
through

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.230 
through
and<00:01:50.690> hold<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:51.530> D<00:01:52.000> you<00:01:53.000> don't<00:01:53.120> necessarily

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
and hold this D you don't necessarily

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.970 
and hold this D you don't necessarily
want<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.750> hit<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.930> heat<00:01:54.110> in<00:01:54.290> this<00:01:54.470> case<00:01:54.710> the

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
want to hit the heat in this case the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.450 
want to hit the heat in this case the
the<00:01:55.250> first<00:01:55.490> string<00:01:55.730> but<00:01:56.020> strong<00:01:57.160> from<00:01:58.160> six

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
the first string but strong from six

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.980 
the first string but strong from six
string<00:01:58.700> all<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:58.970> way<00:01:59.090> up<00:01:59.300> to<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.600> second

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
string all the way up to the second

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.920 
string all the way up to the second
string<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.320> is<00:02:00.640> nice<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.670> cool<00:02:02.090> will<00:02:02.360> bluesy

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
string it is nice and cool will bluesy

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.740 
string it is nice and cool will bluesy
kind<00:02:03.170> of<00:02:03.320> swampy<00:02:03.740> sound<00:02:04.010> here<00:02:04.510> but<00:02:05.510> anyway

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
kind of swampy sound here but anyway

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.260 
kind of swampy sound here but anyway
that<00:02:05.960> all<00:02:06.080> works<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.650> this<00:02:07.430> is<00:02:07.700> based<00:02:08.000> on

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
that all works and this is based on

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.550 
that all works and this is based on
Holly<00:02:09.020> on<00:02:09.350> rhythm<00:02:10.010> but<00:02:10.490> then<00:02:10.670> also<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:11.810> little

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
peek at the rhythm part and then we'll

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.710 
peek at the rhythm part and then we'll
look<00:02:16.400> at<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.550> lick<00:02:16.850> that<00:02:17.060> kind<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.360> ends<00:02:17.630> it

look at the lick that kind of ends it
out<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.530> here<00:02:19.190> we<00:02:19.310> go<00:02:19.490> so<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.390> main

with<00:02:28.430> my<00:02:28.670> fingernail<00:02:29.210> here<00:02:29.480> but<00:02:29.750> sometimes

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
with my fingernail here but sometimes

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.830 
with my fingernail here but sometimes
you'll<00:02:31.070> see<00:02:31.250> me<00:02:31.280> get<00:02:31.700> into<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.210> just<00:02:32.330> got

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.430 

I'm<00:02:35.840> just<00:02:36.020> kind<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.290> slapping<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.250> strings

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
I'm just kind of slapping the strings

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.680 
I'm just kind of slapping the strings
with<00:02:39.440> these<00:02:39.800> three<00:02:40.070> fingers<00:02:40.360> some<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.570> may

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
with these three fingers some of you may

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.650 
with these three fingers some of you may
be<00:02:41.720> familiar<00:02:42.470> with<00:02:42.770> claw<00:02:43.580> hammer<00:02:43.850> as<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.120> style

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.320 
be familiar with claw hammer as a style
of<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:45.170> gone

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.880 

you<00:02:49.870> know<00:02:49.960> he's<00:02:50.110> kind<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.350> hitting<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.650> thumb

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
you know he's kind of hitting the thumb

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.800 
you know he's kind of hitting the thumb
and<00:02:51.190> then<00:02:51.280> just<00:02:51.730> letting<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.300> fingers<00:02:52.630> just

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
and then just letting the fingers just

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.750 
and then just letting the fingers just
come<00:02:52.990> and<00:02:53.140> relax<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.710> fall<00:02:54.070> that's<00:02:54.430> kind<00:02:54.700> of

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
come and relax and fall that's kind of

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.600 
come and relax and fall that's kind of
the<00:02:54.850> technique<00:02:55.300> here<00:02:55.890> but<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:56.920> did<00:02:57.130> gloss<00:02:57.400> over

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
the technique here but I did gloss over

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.160 
the technique here but I did gloss over
one<00:02:57.940> fact<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.450> that's<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.870> there<00:02:59.020> is<00:02:59.140> a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
one fact and that's that there is a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.620 
one fact and that's that there is a
super-sweet<00:02:59.980> bluesy<00:03:00.610> note<00:03:00.850> in<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.300> middle<00:03:01.540> of

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
this thing right there you do a little

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.440 
this thing right there you do a little
strong<00:03:06.010> vamp<00:03:06.610> here<00:03:08.490> then<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.610> hit<00:03:09.850> this<00:03:10.090> note

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
strong vamp here then you hit this note

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.660 
strong vamp here then you hit this note
which<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.960> third<00:03:11.920> fret<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.340> fifth

string and it's a really really bluesy
note<00:03:15.910> in<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.150> case<00:03:16.420> because<00:03:16.750> it's<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.140> flat

really<00:04:25.490> focus<00:04:26.490> on<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:27.060> like<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.330> think<00:04:27.480> of

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
really focus on that I like to think of

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.450 
really focus on that I like to think of
it<00:04:27.630> as<00:04:27.690> just<00:04:27.720> like<00:04:28.140> a<00:04:28.169> little<00:04:28.380> cry<00:04:28.740> on<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.250> note

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
it as just like a little cry on the note

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.580 
it as just like a little cry on the note
just<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.760> little<00:04:31.400> something<00:04:32.400> extra<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:34.410> that's

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
just a little something extra so that's

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.159 
just a little something extra so that's
the<00:04:34.740> first<00:04:34.980> part<00:04:36.919> so<00:04:37.919> then<00:04:38.070> we<00:04:38.160> do<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.990> pull<00:04:39.990> off

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
the first part so then we do a pull off

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.290 
the first part so then we do a pull off
from<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.470> third<00:04:40.620> fret<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.580> open<00:04:42.060> fifth

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.360 
from the third fret to the open fifth
string<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:43.590> then<00:04:44.250> we<00:04:44.400> do<00:04:44.610> another<00:04:46.370> bluesy

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
string and then we do another bluesy

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.670 
string and then we do another bluesy
quarter<00:04:47.970> step<00:04:48.210> Bend<00:04:48.510> on<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.810> third<00:04:49.110> fret<00:04:49.440> of

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
quarter step Bend on the third fret of

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.589 
quarter step Bend on the third fret of
