00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 the indigenous not the Inca past the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.240
 American mentality and I think it's a 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.849
 book that does not go out of style nor is it a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.860
 vintage book only was not read 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.330
 an era intensely but it's not just 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.400
 book that one says can not be read 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.650
 now or modern except for those 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.449
 I say this because modern but 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.160
 ultramodern that is going to make these 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.869
 budgets 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.119
 then also what would not have been 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.750
 Real did not continue doing it because 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.210
 if there was that if not me 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.210
 love this but good are tastes 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.410
 I was surprised and I was talking 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.250
 a lot with eugenia that so far 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.250
 none of the guests 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.780
 brought short to the full story is that 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:58.220
 there's just not if I did the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.660
 secondary in 83 I started also my 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.170
 secondary distance but in another era 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.900
 friendlier and we tell you this if 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.050
 this let us say there in 83 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.300
 you will not know that the board is so lost 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.740
 because what is lost and lost to a 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.360
 esteemed an extraordinary man a 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.300
 extraordinary storyteller a guy that you 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.470
 permanently proposes complicity 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.220
 that seems to be talking to you 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.200
 you that there are children all the time 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.060
 complicities and from other looks 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.270
 looks so smart looks are 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.850
 so humorous and they are ironic they are 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.460
 in so great from the reality so much 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:42.500
 fiction a very delirious hobby with 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:44.270
 moments a story of those that contained 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.220
 of the parks is considered one of 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.350
 the master stories that are studied 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.850
 universities for its brevity and its 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.680
 forcefulness 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.560
 but so many casatomada and all 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.619
 tales read it if you go back to me 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.850
 it happens to me that I read them thousands of times and 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.970
 still like it and you've been hooking me 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.100
 in a person so lovable also not 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.289
 because July was a guy there's nobody 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.540
 I speak ill of him I do not think that now 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.760
 there are certain intellectual currents 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.359
 that came in that you can not talk 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.040
 well of cuts because if there is in the 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:23.400
 faculty of a certain certain 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.540
 concealment of cortázar like no 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.459
 It seems to be very correct to talk about 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.650
 heart out there why I do not talk 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:44.340
 including some pose both the 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:47.470
 Cortazar problem that pretends to write 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.209
 has greatly influenced me in that 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.680
 tells how it starts on the one hand and you 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.709
 Surprise for the other as it comes 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.760
 counting there and then and masterful change 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.209
 of perspective 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.510
 a better chronicle although it is not going to 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.739
 to come out like that I do not think that cuts out salts and 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.419
 have those extraordinary things and there are 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.579
 with wonderful in the prologue that makes 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.889
 the complete areas roberto bar to whom 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.439
 greatly admires another great forgotten 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.480
 condemned to literary marginality 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.750
 one of the most extraordinary types that 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.610
 gave Argentina that it linked what 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.260
 popular with a way of writing 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.880
 we water strong but not only 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.770
 let's be strong not 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.620
 and the action by the extraordinary ego 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.900
 but afternoon of art revitalizing it 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.670
 realizing it and I believe that this gentleman does not 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.620
 essential I believe that the best and the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.330
 best Spanish-speaking writer without 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.050
 no doubt I have no doubt the 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.420
 infinite I think it's a man 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.670
 infinite I was not lucky enough to meet him 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.530
 of treating him because my old man 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:54.970
 I organized talks 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:57.220
 I accompanied him sometimes to the talk 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.380
 that coordinated roberto alifano that is a 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.030
 great borgiano and friend of he told me 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.580
 armed to talks in different parts of the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.620
 country and I am accompanied him and had 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.640
 dialogues that were wonderful to be apart 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.350
 of course what I wanted 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.330
 basically listening to him not with 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.680
 new larsson and he was a man of a 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.230
 enormous generosity of a huge 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.940
 humility a huge generosity and a 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.459
 great hardness with the proud 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.750
 those who flaunted what 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.790
 they had read instead of enjoying what 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.030
 this walk gave him showing what 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.730
 they read relentlessly absolutely 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.680
 relentless 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.340
 program of the cycle came maría kodama 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.640
 just in parallel way bolivia maría 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.250
 as a kiss and then that one of the 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.000
 of the biggest debt that I brought for 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.400
 to raise them was if it makes sense in the 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.190
 borges when you do not understand half of 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.919
 the literary videos that the guy goes 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:56.860
 leaving that as you go and you get 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.410
 happens where to start now out of 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.780
 the commented work is wonderful because 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.030
 you have an appointment every three lines more 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.580
 or less where those kinds of things like 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.050
 literary winks the characters and they are 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.610
 of fiction or if they are real 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.080
 historical characters that is that the 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.990
 name is permanently many of the 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.640
 which are invented are not 12 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.960
 librarians yes exactly two types 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.600
 who has done a laburo I remember the 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.539
 claw long now if they were and doing 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.120
 an exact edit mark on each wink 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.729
 here refers to leaving is and 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.280
 then a goal is enabled that 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.590
 another way if you do not have that clear that there 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.510
 one half with reading difficulty 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.120
 of borges that is not for me 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.950
 for me because it reads in general it reads 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.570
 very well at different levels by 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.130
 supposed to deepen and be able to do 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.070
 courses about borges that's worth it 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.160
 but because he's a guy who lets himself be read 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.800
 but this edition is great 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.320
 commented that also has this to go 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.760
 adding information is a work 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.590
 very good because it is not health and is in 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.570
 the pedantic meaning of the word but 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.400
 that really helps you a lot 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.890
 understand many things and characters that 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.990
 well they are interesting this does not see how 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.720
 how he at times mocked 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.510
 also the reader giving for certain 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.340
 characters invented by him good me 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.650
 I think that 's great and it also has 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.720
 this about the final surprise from the 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.810
 wonder of the narration of the 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.249
 depth is not an icon really 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.049
 only 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:26.489
 I support the three a little bit because I do not 

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:29.619
 I wanted to stop talking about this book that 

00:06:26.489 --> 00:06:34.659
 you are directing the connection with a 

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:37.479
 Friend to invite Alberto Díaz Gran 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:40.779
 nc editor good with him we are not 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:44.019
 doing is this idea of ​​editing many 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:45.759
 books exhausted from history and see that 

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:47.229
 It's been a long time since they were published together 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.939
 the letters that I so sorry and 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:50.710
 one that the great controversy of alberdi 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:54.280
 shoot 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.870
 to the 50's of the 19th century about 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.460
 urquiza and on the models 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.710
 organizational what we are going to do with 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.960
 the country after home a controversy 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.880
 of an extraordinary level by two types 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.060
 great with everything that can not 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.310
 criticize each one but a controversy in 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.990
 the time that was debated with books that 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.760
 to discuss how I made a book and 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.730
 good when I was with a book to the 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.560
 strange town because I do not marvel 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.110
 soriano and then the contame 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.760
 in this book or collect these letters 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.170
 the two number of the debate are now 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.720
 the two complete books opens on 

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:28.150
 preliminary study to help a little to 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.980
 understand the context and this is part 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.660
 this bicentennial collection that we 

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.790
 we give with many tastes to publish 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.480
 Exhausted works that are almost gone 

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.480
 they get
