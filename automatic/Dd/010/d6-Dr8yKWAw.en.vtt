birds flying past the main thing when

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.390 
birds flying past the main thing when
you're<00:00:33.320> trying<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:33.559> spot<00:00:33.710> a<00:00:33.739> peregrine<00:00:34.129> is<00:00:34.250> to

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
you're trying to spot a peregrine is to

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.549 
you're trying to spot a peregrine is to
look<00:00:34.519> at<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.760> scale<00:00:35.059> so<00:00:35.720> use<00:00:35.900> the<00:00:36.080> gulls<00:00:36.350> and

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
look at the scale so use the gulls and

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.140 
look at the scale so use the gulls and
things<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:36.980> give<00:00:37.129> you<00:00:37.250> some<00:00:37.460> scale<00:00:37.760> because

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
things to give you some scale because

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.549 
things to give you some scale because
when<00:00:38.269> you<00:00:38.390> look<00:00:38.510> at<00:00:38.660> that<00:00:38.780> cliff<00:00:39.110> which<00:00:39.350> is

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
when you look at that cliff which is

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.619 
when you look at that cliff which is
actually<00:00:39.949> huge<00:00:40.280> it<00:00:40.910> can<00:00:41.089> be<00:00:41.180> very<00:00:41.360> difficult

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
actually huge it can be very difficult

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.450 
actually huge it can be very difficult
to<00:00:42.140> look<00:00:42.320> at<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.620> right<00:00:42.800> scale

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
to look at the right scale

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.030 
to look at the right scale
well<00:00:44.210> these<00:00:44.360> binoculars<00:00:44.629> allow<00:00:45.229> me<00:00:45.470> with<00:00:45.710> 10

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
well these binoculars allow me with 10

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.130 
well these binoculars allow me with 10
times<00:00:46.190> magnification<00:00:46.760> we've<00:00:47.659> got<00:00:47.750> good<00:00:47.930> light

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
times magnification we've got good light

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.229 
times magnification we've got good light
gathering<00:00:48.440> capacity<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:49.640> you<00:00:49.699> just<00:00:49.909> get<00:00:50.089> them

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
gathering capacity so you just get them

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.810 
gathering capacity so you just get them
well<00:00:50.420> in<00:00:50.540> focus<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.199> then<00:00:51.470> slowly<00:00:51.920> pan<00:00:52.460> across

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
well in focus and then slowly pan across

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.840 
well in focus and then slowly pan across
the<00:00:53.000> cliff<00:00:53.180> looking<00:00:54.110> in<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.739> key<00:00:55.220> area<00:00:55.610> of<00:00:55.760> the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
the cliff looking in the key area of the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.840 
the cliff looking in the key area of the
binoculars<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.600> just<00:00:57.589> just<00:00:58.159> systematically

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
binoculars and just just systematically

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.149 
binoculars and just just systematically
checking<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.629> cliff<00:00:59.839> looking<00:01:00.140> for<00:01:00.350> it<00:01:00.439> yeah

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
checking the cliff looking for it yeah

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:02.109 
checking the cliff looking for it yeah
the<00:01:01.309> first<00:01:01.519> thing<00:01:01.549> I<00:01:01.670> noticed<00:01:01.939> they're

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
the first thing I noticed they're

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.359 
the first thing I noticed they're
incredibly<00:01:02.930> light<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:03.979> other<00:01:04.100> thing

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
incredibly light and the other thing

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.490 
incredibly light and the other thing
I've<00:01:04.549> noticed<00:01:04.699> is<00:01:05.030> that<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.900> balance<00:01:06.290> of

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
I've noticed is that the the balance of

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.250 
I've noticed is that the the balance of
them<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:06.890> way<00:01:07.850> back<00:01:08.090> at<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.360> focus<00:01:08.750> wheel<00:01:08.990> and

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
them is way back at the focus wheel and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.230 
them is way back at the focus wheel and
actually<00:01:09.619> slightly<00:01:09.860> behind<00:01:10.310> it's<00:01:10.970> up<00:01:11.060> near

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
actually slightly behind it's up near

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.080 
actually slightly behind it's up near
the<00:01:11.420> ocular<00:01:11.840> lens<00:01:12.189> in<00:01:13.189> most<00:01:13.400> binoculars<00:01:13.970> it

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
the ocular lens in most binoculars it

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.550 
the ocular lens in most binoculars it
tends<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.330> be<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.450> heaviest<00:01:14.810> glasses<00:01:15.409> down

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
tends to be the heaviest glasses down

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.350 
tends to be the heaviest glasses down
near<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.799> objective<00:01:15.980> and<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.000> your<00:01:17.150> balance

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
near the objective and so your balance

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.420 
near the objective and so your balance
is<00:01:17.690> slightly<00:01:17.990> pulling<00:01:18.410> you<00:01:18.530> down<00:01:18.770> whereas

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
is slightly pulling you down whereas

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.650 
is slightly pulling you down whereas
when<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.640> got<00:01:19.790> these<00:01:19.910> up<00:01:20.090> against<00:01:20.480> your<00:01:20.630> eye

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
when you got these up against your eye

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.960 
when you got these up against your eye
they<00:01:21.530> sort<00:01:21.710> of<00:01:21.770> pushing<00:01:22.160> back<00:01:22.310> into<00:01:22.370> your<00:01:22.760> face

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
they sort of pushing back into your face

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.030 
they sort of pushing back into your face
slightly<00:01:23.300> and<00:01:23.720> they're<00:01:23.960> very<00:01:24.200> comfortable<00:01:24.560> to

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
slightly and they're very comfortable to

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.200 
slightly and they're very comfortable to
hold<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.550> for<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.210> long<00:01:26.390> period<00:01:26.840> very<00:01:27.170> still<00:01:28.210> in

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
hold and for a long period very still in

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.930 
hold and for a long period very still in
the<00:01:29.480> nature<00:01:29.810> observation<00:01:29.930> market<00:01:30.940> people

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
the nature observation market people

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.990 
the nature observation market people
want<00:01:32.540> lightweight<00:01:33.230> binoculars<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.700> deliver

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
want lightweight binoculars to deliver

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.050 
want lightweight binoculars to deliver
top<00:01:35.420> optical<00:01:35.870> quality<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:37.460> need<00:01:37.640> quite<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:37.940> few

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
top optical quality you need quite a few

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.660 
top optical quality you need quite a few
lenses<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:38.750> that<00:01:39.620> makes<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.100> product<00:01:40.370> heavy

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
lenses and that makes the product heavy

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.520 
lenses and that makes the product heavy
but<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.510> idea<00:01:41.870> was<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:44.030> use<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.510> new<00:01:44.780> objective

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
but the idea was to use a new objective

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.160 
but the idea was to use a new objective
lens<00:01:46.220> system<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:48.550> quite<00:01:49.550> complicated<00:01:50.170> ocular

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
lens system and quite complicated ocular

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.219 
lens system and quite complicated ocular
lens<00:01:51.380> system

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
lens system

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.850 
lens system
we<00:01:53.799> pushed<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.520> balance<00:01:54.850> point<00:01:55.149> towards<00:01:55.990> the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
we pushed a balance point towards the

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.999 
we pushed a balance point towards the
eye

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
eye

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.620 
eye
that<00:01:57.579> means<00:01:57.850> into<00:01:58.719> the<00:01:59.020> ocular<00:01:59.560> area<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:01.240> flips

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
that means into the ocular area it flips

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.679 
that means into the ocular area it flips
towards<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.530> eye<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.850> stays<00:02:04.119> there<00:02:04.149> and

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
towards the eye and it stays there and

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.380 
towards the eye and it stays there and
now<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.799> balance<00:02:06.100> point<00:02:06.399> is<00:02:06.549> very<00:02:06.880> far<00:02:07.179> back

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
now the balance point is very far back

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.300 
now the balance point is very far back
so<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:09.009> felt<00:02:09.340> weight<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:10.000> lower<00:02:11.310> actually

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
so the felt weight is lower actually

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.370 
so the felt weight is lower actually
then<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.239> reality<00:02:15.390> what<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.420> do<00:02:16.569> notice<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.349> that

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
then in reality what I do notice is that

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.979 
then in reality what I do notice is that
they<00:02:17.800> just<00:02:17.950> fit<00:02:18.310> very<00:02:18.760> well<00:02:18.880> in<00:02:19.299> the<00:02:19.420> hand<00:02:19.599> it's

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
they just fit very well in the hand it's

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.170 
they just fit very well in the hand it's
it's<00:02:20.349> instinctive<00:02:21.160> using<00:02:21.610> them<00:02:21.760> there's<00:02:21.970> no

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
it's instinctive using them there's no

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.110 
it's instinctive using them there's no
doubt<00:02:22.720> about<00:02:22.750> where<00:02:23.290> they<00:02:23.410> are<00:02:23.440> very

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
doubt about where they are very

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.970 
doubt about where they are very
comfortable<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.360> hold<00:02:25.630> on<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:28.299> armory<00:02:28.660> is

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
comfortable to hold on to the armory is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.530 
comfortable to hold on to the armory is
extremely<00:02:29.980> soft<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.790> feels<00:02:31.000> much<00:02:31.269> better

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
extremely soft so it feels much better

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.509 
extremely soft so it feels much better
in<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.930> hand<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.799> also<00:02:33.040> absorbs<00:02:33.400> shock

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
in the hand and it also absorbs shock

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.670 
in the hand and it also absorbs shock
much<00:02:36.519> better<00:02:36.849> than<00:02:37.269> other<00:02:37.480> armorings<00:02:37.989> it's<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
much better than other armorings it's a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.770 
much better than other armorings it's a
little<00:02:38.980> bit<00:02:39.130> longer<00:02:39.340> here<00:02:39.760> in<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.239> objective

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
little bit longer here in the objective

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.370 
little bit longer here in the objective
area<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.250> adds<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.970> few<00:02:43.150> millimeters<00:02:43.930> but

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
area so that adds a few millimeters but

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.819 
area so that adds a few millimeters but
gives<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:45.690> lot<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.840> protection<00:02:47.500> for<00:02:47.769> the

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
gives a lot of protection for the

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.069 
gives a lot of protection for the
objective<00:02:48.280> lens<00:02:48.670> system<00:02:49.120> if<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:49.660> put<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.989> on

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
objective lens system if you put it on

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:56.120 
objective lens system if you put it on
the<00:02:50.260> table<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.829> know<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.489> dampens<00:02:51.880> perfectly

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.530 

these<00:02:57.130> binoculars<00:02:57.609> have<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.819> very<00:02:58.060> good<00:02:58.299> light

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
these binoculars have a very good light

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.949 
these binoculars have a very good light
transmission<00:02:59.579> percentage<00:03:00.579> and<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:01.239> that's

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
transmission percentage and so that's

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.629 
transmission percentage and so that's
allowing<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.590> use<00:03:02.620> them<00:03:02.950> earlier<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.579> a

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
allowing you to use them earlier and a

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.309 
allowing you to use them earlier and a
bit<00:03:03.790> later<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.389> especially<00:03:04.720> in<00:03:04.930> darker

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
bit later and especially in darker

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.910 
bit later and especially in darker
habitats

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
habitats

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.129 
habitats
you<00:03:06.010> know<00:03:06.100> normally<00:03:06.670> ten<00:03:07.299> forty<00:03:07.600> twos<00:03:07.840> I

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
you know normally ten forty twos I

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.199 
you know normally ten forty twos I
wouldn't<00:03:08.739> be<00:03:08.799> tempted<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.220> use<00:03:09.340> in<00:03:09.700> dense

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
wouldn't be tempted to use in dense

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.390 
wouldn't be tempted to use in dense
rainforest<00:03:10.840> habitats<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.470> these<00:03:11.680> may<00:03:12.220> well

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
rainforest habitats but these may well

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.809 
rainforest habitats but these may well
work<00:03:12.609> well<00:03:13.389> in<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.690> closed<00:03:13.989> conditions<00:03:14.819> we

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
work well in that closed conditions we

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.580 
work well in that closed conditions we
have<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.060> remaining<00:03:16.569> of<00:03:16.840> ninety<00:03:17.230> two<00:03:17.410> percent

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
have a remaining of ninety two percent

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.379 
have a remaining of ninety two percent
transmission<00:03:18.340> guaranteed<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.209> that

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
transmission guaranteed in that

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.920 
transmission guaranteed in that
binocular<00:03:20.049> she's<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:20.769> lot<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:22.209> comparison

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
binocular she's a lot and in comparison

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.720 
binocular she's a lot and in comparison
to<00:03:23.109> other<00:03:23.950> nature<00:03:24.819> observation<00:03:25.170> binoculars

to other nature observation binoculars

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.349 
to other nature observation binoculars
we<00:03:27.730> are<00:03:27.880> far<00:03:28.180> ahead<00:03:28.380> with<00:03:29.380> 92%<00:03:30.090> yeah<00:03:31.090> yesterday

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
we are far ahead with 92% yeah yesterday

we are far ahead with 92% yeah yesterday
morning<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:31.930> went<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.200> see<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.799> third<00:03:33.220> short

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
morning I went to see the third short

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.059 
morning I went to see the third short
tailed<00:03:33.910> eagle<00:03:34.239> recorded<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:34.930> Britain<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.920> we

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
tailed eagle recorded in Britain and we

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.849 
tailed eagle recorded in Britain and we
were<00:03:36.190> there<00:03:36.459> at<00:03:37.019> five<00:03:38.019> o'clock<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:38.709> the

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
were there at five o'clock in the

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.089 
were there at five o'clock in the
morning<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.549> it<00:03:39.639> was<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.790> misty<00:03:40.389> dull<00:03:40.720> morning

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
morning and it was a misty dull morning

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.319 
morning and it was a misty dull morning
and<00:03:42.099> we<00:03:42.280> were<00:03:42.370> watching<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.819> eagle<00:03:43.060> about<00:03:43.299> a

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
and we were watching the eagle about a

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.210 
and we were watching the eagle about a
mile<00:03:43.660> away<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.349> you<00:03:44.530> could<00:03:44.680> tell<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:45.069> people

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
mile away and you could tell the people

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.979 
mile away and you could tell the people
with<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.670> better<00:03:45.880> quality<00:03:46.090> optics<00:03:46.690> they're

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
with the better quality optics they're

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.420 
with the better quality optics they're
going<00:03:47.139> oh<00:03:47.260> it's<00:03:47.410> turning<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.859> head<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
going oh it's turning the head and the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.430 
going oh it's turning the head and the
other<00:03:48.459> people<00:03:48.970> were<00:03:49.090> going<00:03:49.239> I<00:03:49.450> can't<00:03:50.109> see<00:03:50.319> it

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
other people were going I can't see it

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.979 
other people were going I can't see it
still<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.709> can't<00:03:51.069> see<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.430> still<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.150> that

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
still I can't see it still and so that

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.990 
still I can't see it still and so that
was<00:03:53.169> a<00:03:53.200> situation<00:03:53.769> where<00:03:53.919> really<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.819> light

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
was a situation where really the light

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.490 
was a situation where really the light
transmission<00:03:55.569> your<00:03:55.720> telescope<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.380> your

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
transmission your telescope to your

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.390 
transmission your telescope to your
binoculars<00:03:56.980> was<00:03:57.280> making<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.819> difference

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
binoculars was making a difference

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.950 
binoculars was making a difference
the<00:04:00.400> binoculars<00:04:00.820> have<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:00.970> nice<00:04:01.180> wide<00:04:01.480> field<00:04:01.840> of

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
the binoculars have a nice wide field of

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.250 
the binoculars have a nice wide field of
view<00:04:03.150> which<00:04:04.150> allows<00:04:04.300> you<00:04:04.600> obviously<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.050> see

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
view which allows you obviously to see

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.130 
view which allows you obviously to see
more<00:04:05.530> again<00:04:06.490> very<00:04:06.730> good<00:04:06.820> in<00:04:07.270> their<00:04:07.900> class

use eight-and-a-half personally before
now<00:04:13.980> because<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.070> work<00:04:15.250> a<00:04:15.370> lot<00:04:15.520> in<00:04:15.550> rain<00:04:15.850> forest

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
now because I work a lot in rain forest

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.120 
now because I work a lot in rain forest
environments<00:04:16.720> whereas<00:04:17.500> with<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:17.859> binocular

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
movement in the undergrowth and I've got

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
to try and hit that bird this is giving

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.880 
to try and hit that bird this is giving
you<00:04:26.470> an<00:04:26.590> advantage<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:28.260> we<00:04:29.260> have<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.530> consider

you an advantage and we have to consider
that<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:31.600> edge<00:04:31.780> is<00:04:32.110> completely<00:04:32.860> sharp<00:04:33.210> and

that the edge is completely sharp and

that the edge is completely sharp and
also<00:04:34.540> we<00:04:34.750> open<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.290> field<00:04:35.730> extremely<00:04:36.730> end<00:04:37.260> but

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
also we open the field extremely end but

also we open the field extremely end but
not<00:04:38.470> jeopardizing<00:04:39.190> you<00:04:39.880> know<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.210> stage
