00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.380
 with the girls I took they are well come 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.350
 from america corner and today I bring you a 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.480
 super fast video and I affect for 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.369
 when you do not have time to fix yourself 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.680
 now in the summer sometimes that 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.040
 we prefer to open a little more we want 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.710
 three minutes these five minutes 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.140
 time 20 and we do not want to waste what's 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.600
 our makeup then all this is 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.280
 depending on the situation in which 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.900
 are in your skin for example I in three 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.700
 minutes right now it's very difficult for me 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.260
 fix because of these infections that 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.030
 I have no feet but depending on all 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.040
 the afternoon is you do not need to put on 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.980
 makeup then all this is going to 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.570
 depend on you ok because you can go 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.830
 adapting however right now 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.990
 example that I will bring my base of 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.970
 makeup and I'm going to have rule of the 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.530
 eyebrows I can not do one more site 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.180
 fast then there you can give him 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.970
 priority to the things that you most 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.350
 they like so that you can fix what 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.479
 first thing we're going to do is we're going to 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.939
 start making the tabs that already 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.860
 I bring them rosaditos because the rival is 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.560
 important medium when you want to make a 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.649
 Quick look and simply to highlight 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.920
 this your face let's start with the 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.280
 mascara and this is the mascara to evade me that 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.930
 I love what leaves a lashes 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.440
 very good no more 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.470
 the difference in 12 is that here the the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.030
 shadow that I have when applying this as I 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.100
 I have a fallen eye I like that the 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.610
 eyelash looks longer and I go 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.160
 to put the extend them because this one 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.770
 opens much more the eye does not lift it 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.979
 and this is because I'm not going to use a 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.500
 This is how a delineator is called the day 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.360
 of today then I want the eye to be 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.330
 It looks bigger to the cut than you can 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.100
 apply up or down and put this 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.570
 video last a little longer than the three 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.810
 minutes of look because apart I am 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.940
 talking about where the son stands out 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.680
 but then if I make them those and 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.930
 Calladitos do not like it because there 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.030
 I am speaking not as good then but 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.540
 are seeing how I'm applying already 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.810
 there were very beautiful eyelashes or 500 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.790
 after the eyelashes you have to take a 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.550
 blush that is as well as a carnitas color 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.489
 little coffee to give you a 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.170
 touch to our face 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.819
 and I can choose the lipstick that you 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.769
 you want because that's why you know him in 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.560
 three minutes because we're going to highlight the 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.450
 lips I really want to use this 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.709
 color that I like right now the colors 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.379
 dark this is the uruguay of chic that 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.040
 you get it out and your try and this one 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.650
 It's super nice and for when you want 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.420
 using tones has been dark the truth for 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.670
 do not see you late unless you 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.519
 you want to do something like that half Gothic 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.709
 you combine it with black clothes ok if not that 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.299
 look for colors to highlight 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.430
 as well as what I bring that I finish 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.940
 yellow and they are going to jump they will highlight 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.940
 my lips 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.590
 another combination that you can do is 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.690
 this to eat mint and so you can go 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.610
 combining so that rennes art that does not 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.610
 be so super super dark 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.170
 so quickly you can get your 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.790
 look in three minutes if you wanted 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.700
 add the question part of I have something 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.430
 of time and nothing else if he stopped talking this 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.120
 we can put something eliminator to 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.239
 our look 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.330

 the time you want for this 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.489
 season so it's something more cherry 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.350
 you want something more natural like rosita 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:11.080
 you can go darker like this one 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.360
 and how it's being used or if you can not 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.490
