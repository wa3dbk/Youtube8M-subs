okay<00:00:00.780> one<00:00:00.989> more<00:00:01.170> experiment<00:00:01.610> continuation

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay one more experiment continuation

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.110 
okay one more experiment continuation
from<00:00:02.879> yesterday<00:00:03.510> I<00:00:04.460> left<00:00:05.460> this<00:00:05.700> running

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
from yesterday I left this running

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.740 
from yesterday I left this running
overnight<00:00:06.390> whole<00:00:07.109> day<00:00:07.580> it's<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.389> connect

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
overnight whole day it's I to connect

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.400 
overnight whole day it's I to connect
the<00:00:09.900> other<00:00:09.990> LEDs<00:00:10.820> just<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.910> simplify<00:00:12.410> remove

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the other LEDs just to simplify remove

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.599 
the other LEDs just to simplify remove
the<00:00:13.590> part<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.070> put<00:00:14.250> our<00:00:14.370> 82<00:00:14.910> almost<00:00:15.690> resistor

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
the part and put our 82 almost resistor

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.000 
the part and put our 82 almost resistor
just<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.730> don't<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:18.090> too<00:00:18.210> much<00:00:18.359> current<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.439> I

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
just I don't have too much current and I

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.019 
just I don't have too much current and I
would<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:21.060> will<00:00:21.180> stop<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.140> meter<00:00:23.029> halfway

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
would you will stop the meter halfway

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.730 
would you will stop the meter halfway
through<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.570> i<00:00:24.630> could<00:00:24.810> see<00:00:27.260> really<00:00:28.260> how<00:00:28.439> much

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
through so i could see really how much

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.150 
through so i could see really how much
current<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.460> plus<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.630> real<00:00:30.840> load

let it short it's all night long and
slowly<00:02:19.170> over<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.320> LED<00:02:22.650> ask<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:24.010> on<00:02:24.220> phone

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
slowly over the LED ask you on phone

slowly over the LED ask you on phone
side<00:02:27.180> anyway<00:02:28.180> look<00:02:28.870> at<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.050> voltage<00:02:30.660> steady

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
I could turn off this if people think

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.490 
I could turn off this if people think
this<00:02:40.670> is<00:02:40.730> one<00:02:41.120> feeding<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.870> thing<00:02:42.170> it's<00:02:42.379> not

oh<00:02:51.909> look<00:02:52.909> at<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.090> baby<00:02:53.569> it's<00:02:54.230> coming<00:02:54.620> back

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
oh look at that baby it's coming back

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.849 
oh look at that baby it's coming back
and<00:02:56.889> average<00:02:58.599> slowly<00:02:59.599> but<00:02:59.840> surely<00:03:00.590> coming

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
and average slowly but surely coming

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.729 
and average slowly but surely coming
back<00:03:01.159> look<00:03:01.400> at<00:03:01.519> that<00:03:01.670> needle<00:03:02.420> if<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.469> leave<00:03:03.680> it

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
back look at that needle if I leave it
