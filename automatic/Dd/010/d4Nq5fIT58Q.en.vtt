crocodiles - the Bengal tigers and put
in<00:00:27.420> some<00:00:27.630> guns<00:00:27.869> that's<00:00:28.140> that's<00:00:28.410> what<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.680> got

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
in some guns that's that's what we got

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.939 
in some guns that's that's what we got
today<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.550> today<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.000> got<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.480> own<00:00:30.990> Restless

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
today so today we got the own Restless

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.729 
today so today we got the own Restless
versus<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> ohm<00:00:33.149> unending<00:00:34.020> now<00:00:34.140> these<00:00:34.350> two

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
versus the ohm unending now these two

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.650 
versus the ohm unending now these two
are<00:00:34.980> very<00:00:35.430> very<00:00:35.730> different<00:00:36.059> when<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.420> really

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
are very very different when you really

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.569 
are very very different when you really
look<00:00:36.809> at<00:00:36.960> them<00:00:37.110> well<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> main<00:00:37.980> reason<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
look at them well the main reason is the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.459 
look at them well the main reason is the
one<00:00:38.730> has<00:00:38.879> really<00:00:39.480> good<00:00:39.570> accuracy<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> one

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
one has really good accuracy and the one

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.650 
one has really good accuracy and the one
has<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> really<00:00:40.890> good<00:00:41.129> clip<00:00:41.430> size<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.969> that

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
has a really good clip size so that

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.360 
has a really good clip size so that
these<00:00:43.110> stats<00:00:43.290> mean<00:00:43.590> absolutely<00:00:44.040> nothing<00:00:44.340> that

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
these stats mean absolutely nothing that

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.650 
these stats mean absolutely nothing that
we're<00:00:44.579> looking<00:00:44.670> at<00:00:44.850> right<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.360> let's<00:00:45.539> get

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
we're looking at right here so let's get

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.880 
we're looking at right here so let's get
into<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> real<00:00:46.110> game<00:00:46.320> stats<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.770> can

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
into the real game stats so we can

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.319 
into the real game stats so we can
decide<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> these<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.820> better<00:00:48.149> so

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
decide which one of these is better so

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.970 
decide which one of these is better so
the<00:00:48.450> first<00:00:48.719> thing<00:00:48.989> we're<00:00:49.140> looking<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the first thing we're looking at here is

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.100 
the first thing we're looking at here is
damage<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> damage<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.629> actually<00:00:51.899> really

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
damage so the damage is actually really

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.689 
damage so the damage is actually really
interesting<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
interesting on this one so for the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.330 
interesting on this one so for the
unending<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.390> got<00:00:54.539> 35<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.199> close<00:00:55.440> 35<00:00:56.160> at

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
unending we got 35 up close 35 at

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.610 
unending we got 35 up close 35 at
mid-range<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.910> 33<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:57.930> long-range<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.500> we're

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
mid-range and 33 at long-range but we're

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
mid-range and 33 at long-range but we're
just<00:00:58.649> gonna<00:00:58.859> discount<00:00:59.340> long<00:00:59.670> range<00:00:59.910> because

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
just gonna discount long range because

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.970 
just gonna discount long range because
the<00:01:00.239> long<00:01:00.600> range<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.079> gun<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.379> long

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the long range on this gun is so long

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
the long range on this gun is so long
you<00:01:02.190> will<00:01:02.309> never<00:01:02.640> ever<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.510> into<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> gunfight

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you will never ever get into a gunfight

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.250 
you will never ever get into a gunfight
that<00:01:04.260> far<00:01:04.739> away<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.510> 235<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.659> making<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
that far away so just 235 is making it a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.429 
that far away so just 235 is making it a
three<00:01:07.740> bullet<00:01:08.010> kill<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.310> around<00:01:08.640> whereas<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
three bullet kill all around whereas the

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.109 
three bullet kill all around whereas the
Restless<00:01:10.439> we're<00:01:10.920> looking<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.220> 35<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:11.850> close

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
Restless we're looking at 35 up close

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.289 
Restless we're looking at 35 up close
and<00:01:12.420> 33<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.439> mid<00:01:13.619> range<00:01:13.890> which<00:01:14.100> makes<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.760> 4

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
and 33 at mid range which makes it a 4

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.789 
and 33 at mid range which makes it a 4
bullet<00:01:15.750> kill<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.110> mid<00:01:16.259> range<00:01:16.500> which<00:01:16.650> isn't

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
bullet kill at mid range which isn't

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.520 
bullet kill at mid range which isn't
good<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.220> that's<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:18.240> worst<00:01:18.450> part<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
good that that's the worst part of the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.620 
good that that's the worst part of the
Restless<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.549> four<00:01:20.909> bullet<00:01:21.210> kill<00:01:21.360> at<00:01:21.450> mid

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
Restless is that four bullet kill at mid

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.499 
Restless is that four bullet kill at mid
range<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.080> because<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.090> we<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.119> going

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
range and because of that we are going

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.380 
range and because of that we are going
to<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.110> give<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.680> unending<00:01:26.130> +10<00:01:26.970> points

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to have to give the unending +10 points

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.850 
to have to give the unending +10 points
now<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> next<00:01:28.290> thing<00:01:28.350> we're<00:01:28.470> gonna<00:01:28.590> look<00:01:28.680> at

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
now the next thing we're gonna look at

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.499 
now the next thing we're gonna look at
is<00:01:29.009> fire<00:01:29.369> rate<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:29.759> fire<00:01:29.970> rate<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.180> really

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
is fire rate now fire rate is really

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.350 
is fire rate now fire rate is really
really<00:01:30.689> big<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.130> far<00:01:32.579> as<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.909> restless'

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
really big and as far as the restless'

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
really big and as far as the restless'
goes<00:01:33.540> we're<00:01:33.780> looking<00:01:34.020> at<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> devil<00:01:34.590> number

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
goes we're looking at the devil number

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.179 
goes we're looking at the devil number
here<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.310> fire<00:01:35.520> rate<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.020> 666<00:01:37.020> rpm<00:01:37.590> whereas

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
here if the fire rate is 666 rpm whereas

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.149 
here if the fire rate is 666 rpm whereas
the<00:01:38.310> unending<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.090> 600<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> 66

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the unending is at 600 so a 66

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.710 
the unending is at 600 so a 66
difference<00:01:41.579> which<00:01:41.729> doesn't<00:01:42.030> seem<00:01:42.210> big<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
difference which doesn't seem big but it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
difference which doesn't seem big but it
actually<00:01:42.930> makes<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.439> pretty<00:01:43.680> big<00:01:43.920> difference

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
actually makes a pretty big difference

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.980 
actually makes a pretty big difference
as<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.610> come<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> find<00:01:45.060> out<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.450> because

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
as we can come to find out and because

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.450 
as we can come to find out and because
of<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> Restless<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.920> gonna<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
of that the Restless is gonna have to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.859 
of that the Restless is gonna have to
get<00:01:47.579> +10<00:01:48.360> points

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
get +10 points

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.170 
get +10 points
bring<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> tie<00:01:49.680> 10/10<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.939> now<00:01:51.060> we're

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
bring it to a tie 10/10 so now we're

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.340 
bring it to a tie 10/10 so now we're
gonna<00:01:51.270> get<00:01:51.420> into<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> nitty-gritty<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
gonna get into the nitty-gritty the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.020 
gonna get into the nitty-gritty the
smaller<00:01:52.619> things<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.189> things<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.579> kind<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
smaller things the things that kind of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.639 
smaller things the things that kind of
just<00:01:54.090> tweak<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> gun<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> little<00:01:54.869> bit<00:01:55.110> first<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
just tweak the gun a little bit first of

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.840 
just tweak the gun a little bit first of
all<00:01:55.740> we're<00:01:55.860> gonna<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:56.130> looking<00:01:56.280> at<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> clip

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
all we're gonna be looking at the clip

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.160 
all we're gonna be looking at the clip
size<00:01:57.030> because<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.810> big<00:01:57.930> thing

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
size because that's the really big thing

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.260 
size because that's the really big thing
for<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> unending<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.579> unending<00:01:59.939> is

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
for the unending the unending is

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.780 
for the unending the unending is
actually<00:02:00.930> buffed<00:02:01.229> up<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> 60<00:02:02.369> clip<00:02:02.579> size

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
actually buffed up to a 60 clip size

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.330 
actually buffed up to a 60 clip size
which<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.060> absolutely<00:02:03.719> huge<00:02:03.869> 20<00:02:04.290> larger<00:02:04.680> than

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
which is absolutely huge 20 larger than

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.370 
which is absolutely huge 20 larger than
the<00:02:05.549> base<00:02:05.729> version<00:02:06.030> whereas<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.899> restless'

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the base version whereas the restless'

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
the base version whereas the restless'
is<00:02:07.500> actually<00:02:07.890> made<00:02:08.039> smaller<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.910> brought

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
is actually made smaller and is brought

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.780 
is actually made smaller and is brought
down<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.629> 30<00:02:10.170> clip<00:02:10.590> size<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:11.670> of

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
down to a 30 clip size so because of

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.980 
down to a 30 clip size so because of
that<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.569> unending<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:13.080> going<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.290> get<00:02:13.440> tough

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
that the unending is going to get tough

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.440 
that the unending is going to get tough
plus<00:02:14.140> 10<00:02:14.410> points<00:02:14.800> again<00:02:15.340> bringing<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
plus 10 points again bringing it to the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.480 
plus 10 points again bringing it to the
lead<00:02:16.630> at<00:02:16.870> 20<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.380> 10<00:02:17.590> for<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> unending<00:02:18.340> and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
lead at 20 to 10 for the unending and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.010 
lead at 20 to 10 for the unending and
the<00:02:18.730> final<00:02:19.150> thing<00:02:19.300> we're<00:02:19.420> gonna<00:02:19.540> look<00:02:19.720> at<00:02:19.870> as

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
the final thing we're gonna look at as

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.920 
the final thing we're gonna look at as
far<00:02:20.050> as<00:02:20.260> stats<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.830> are<00:02:20.950> changed<00:02:21.490> is<00:02:21.940> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
far as stats that are changed is the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.870 
far as stats that are changed is the
view<00:02:23.260> kick<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.590> view<00:02:23.770> kick<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.070> absolutely

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
view kick the view kick is absolutely

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.180 
view kick the view kick is absolutely
huge<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:25.930> cuz<00:02:26.140> we're<00:02:26.500> gonna<00:02:26.620> see<00:02:26.920> for

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
huge here but cuz we're gonna see for

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.210 
huge here but cuz we're gonna see for
the<00:02:27.280> Restless<00:02:27.760> we<00:02:27.940> got<00:02:28.090> minus<00:02:28.630> 25%<00:02:29.290> view<00:02:30.040> kick

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
the Restless we got minus 25% view kick

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.700 
the Restless we got minus 25% view kick
yes<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:31.030> thing<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> freaking<00:02:32.230> laser<00:02:32.410> beam

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
yes this thing is a freaking laser beam

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.430 
yes this thing is a freaking laser beam
the<00:02:32.860> Restless<00:02:33.390> almost<00:02:34.390> no<00:02:34.630> recoil<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.260> is

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
the Restless almost no recoil it is

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.580 
the Restless almost no recoil it is
insane<00:02:36.070> on<00:02:36.340> top<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:38.140> are<00:02:38.170> also

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
insane on top of that we are also

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.940 
insane on top of that we are also
looking<00:02:39.040> at<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.610> unending<00:02:40.030> having<00:02:40.780> plus<00:02:41.230> 10%

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
looking at the unending having plus 10%

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.950 
looking at the unending having plus 10%
recoil<00:02:42.760> which<00:02:42.970> means<00:02:43.210> it<00:02:43.330> has<00:02:43.450> more<00:02:43.750> than<00:02:43.900> the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
recoil which means it has more than the

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.810 
recoil which means it has more than the
base<00:02:44.200> variant<00:02:44.560> because<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.520> we're<00:02:45.760> gonna

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
base variant because of that we're gonna

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.680 
base variant because of that we're gonna
have<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.420> give<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.860> Restless<00:02:48.700> plus<00:02:49.090> 10<00:02:49.330> points

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
have to give the Restless plus 10 points

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.630 
have to give the Restless plus 10 points
meaning<00:02:49.960> we<00:02:50.230> are<00:02:50.260> now<00:02:50.590> at<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.770> tie<00:02:50.980> we're<00:02:51.160> at<00:02:51.250> 20

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
meaning we are now at a tie we're at 20

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.120 
meaning we are now at a tie we're at 20
to<00:02:51.760> 20<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:52.270> we<00:02:53.140> could<00:02:53.350> look<00:02:53.500> at<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.740> shotgun

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
to 20 and we could look at the shotgun

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.160 
to 20 and we could look at the shotgun
but<00:02:54.280> as<00:02:54.520> it<00:02:54.640> turns<00:02:54.910> out<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.510> stats<00:02:55.810> for<00:02:56.080> the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
but as it turns out the stats for the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.130 
but as it turns out the stats for the
shotgun<00:02:56.440> are<00:02:56.800> actually<00:02:57.400> exactly<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.300> same<00:02:58.600> as

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
shotgun are actually exactly the same as

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.230 
shotgun are actually exactly the same as
soon<00:02:59.500> as<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.770> use<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.220> variant<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.790> switch<00:03:01.060> to

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
soon as you use a variant and switch to

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.290 
soon as you use a variant and switch to
shotgun<00:03:01.510> mode<00:03:01.870> it's<00:03:02.620> actually<00:03:03.310> made<00:03:03.940> the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
shotgun mode it's actually made the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.750 
shotgun mode it's actually made the
exact<00:03:04.900> same<00:03:05.290> for<00:03:05.590> both<00:03:05.740> guns<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.220> damage<00:03:06.670> is

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
exact same for both guns the damage is

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.640 
exact same for both guns the damage is
changed<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.240> same<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.960> fire<00:03:08.260> rate<00:03:08.530> has

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
changed to the same the fire rate has

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.080 
changed to the same the fire rate has
changed<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.100> same<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.460> recoil<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.060> the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
changed of the same the recoil is the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.580 
changed of the same the recoil is the
same<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:10.450> there's<00:03:10.630> no<00:03:10.780> point<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.170> looking<00:03:11.320> at

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
same so there's no point in looking at

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.670 
same so there's no point in looking at
the<00:03:11.770> shotgun<00:03:12.340> however<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.930> way<00:03:14.110> we<00:03:14.290> are<00:03:14.440> going

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
the shotgun however the way we are going

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.440 
the shotgun however the way we are going
to<00:03:14.800> decide<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.280> winner<00:03:15.310> today<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:15.970> by<00:03:16.150> looking

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
to decide the winner today is by looking

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.240 
to decide the winner today is by looking
at<00:03:16.540> time<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.990> kill<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.710> this<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:17.980> really

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
at time to kill so this is a really

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.710 
at time to kill so this is a really
interesting<00:03:18.460> time<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:18.910> kill<00:03:19.180> because<00:03:19.360> one<00:03:19.690> of

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
interesting time to kill because one of

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.990 
interesting time to kill because one of
them<00:03:19.900> basically<00:03:20.620> has<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:20.950> better<00:03:21.430> damage<00:03:21.730> with

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
them basically has a better damage with

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.760 
them basically has a better damage with
the<00:03:22.060> other<00:03:22.210> has<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.360> better<00:03:22.600> fire<00:03:22.900> rate<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.440> it

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
the other has a better fire rate and it

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.680 
the other has a better fire rate and it
comes<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.370> current<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.210> where<00:03:25.420> am<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.540> going

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
comes to current that where am I going

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.210 
comes to current that where am I going
with<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.020> comes<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.740> don't<00:03:26.950> know<00:03:27.070> what

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
with that it comes to I don't know what

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.770 
with that it comes to I don't know what
saying<00:03:27.460> I<00:03:27.610> was<00:03:27.730> gonna<00:03:27.820> say<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.120> comes<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.510> find

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
saying I was gonna say it comes to find

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.530 
saying I was gonna say it comes to find
out<00:03:28.990> no<00:03:29.230> that's<00:03:29.530> not<00:03:29.710> it<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:30.310> turns<00:03:30.640> out<00:03:30.910> maybe

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
out no that's not it it turns out maybe

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.180 
out no that's not it it turns out maybe
that's<00:03:31.750> what<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:31.900> was<00:03:32.020> going<00:03:32.140> for<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.320> turns<00:03:32.740> out

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
that's what I was going for it turns out

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.060 
that's what I was going for it turns out
that<00:03:34.060> having<00:03:34.240> a<00:03:34.450> better<00:03:34.690> fire<00:03:35.230> rate<00:03:35.500> actually

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
that having a better fire rate actually

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.680 
that having a better fire rate actually
