00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:07.509
 And after a long time you will find a Hello Ohori 123 also doing that apo flights Recommended 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:12.639
 But I think the Fu that want to go 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:17.320
 Sometimes theme there at'm talking about I guitar neck is've done this story Well, even before 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:20.600
 But I would like to continue talking more closely 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.900
 This is the thickness of the guitar neck 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.360
 The 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.020
 The story of how about grip type of f is suppressed is not just because good good 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.420
 Me is to 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.010
 After all I put it on choosing a guitar I think that there is a commitment to everyone really 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.610
 Each one 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.890
 I think that there are various individual differences including the size and the size of various hand 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.710
 It is not a story that can be said in general, but after all, it is above station 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:52.989
 Regardless of the guitar neck, there is a lot of fine thickness . 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:57.760
 After all that's what it's called playability How high we play 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.650
 Somehow it will be a big neck, only the neck is black in my guitar 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.910
 As the one of the criteria to choose 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.040
 In Is not that night or I and something day or 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.240
 Moreover, it is possible to use raw code because it will come 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:15.270
 I'm not You're low code often is not want to choose what is kept to a smooth low 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.680
 Among the cords, it can be said that it can be suppressed evenly in the state that grips especially El 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.060
 Is big for me 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.160
 The reason why it comes to the reference point f Speaking of meeting begins with conquering 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.030
 It's the Toka hammering pulling off 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.960
 When it comes to support me grip 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.960
 Because it is better 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.560
 It feels so good to play well, so it will be beautiful even in the gripped state 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 It is said that the neck is thin 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.119
 I want you this single god I have now this single eh model something 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:51.299
 Originally this neck is not only thin 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.780
 Well the width of the nut is too thin, but I showed it now, but the edge of the grip type is great 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.760
 Easy to hold back 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.240
 Before about six years was one where I thought also be nice when you get a guitar of Marco 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.020
 Right 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.369
 Grip school had the attraction of being able to be done easily 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:10.479
 This is already the easiest grip-type f to hold in me 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.800
 I was ze bet on guitar Well now the single head that I think the Fu say that it itself 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.390
 Most of the acoustic guitars that it has 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.870
 The temperature of wonder if those thick's neck, such as grip-type of f is suppressed in many cases 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.610
 It is feeling 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:26.320
 Harbor and what but I'm certain what the thickness of the 800 Mr. Manekku of another same ward Takamine 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.320
 After all the other if there is to say a narrow 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:34.270
 Grip cf has not become easily and cleanly 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.290
 I this I can Yappa Likes another 6 yamaha also similarly neck is thin masu roof 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:43.330
 It is very easy to suppress 4 f's 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:47.350
 Thin neck also mountains to heights but I think also that it is so so Dashiyai I domestic ones 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.450
 That or was a muff of grip-type nail or Dattari low code is very easy to festival 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.150
 I will feel that there is a tendency 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.810
 a years old 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:58.730
 Though it is 45 in Ms. Kaze 's signature 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.420
 If there is also a large harbor if the harbor is wide, the sculpted part and the specification are already a neck 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.760
 but 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.360
 But I know this is Ne once and grip type of f Gane 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.730
 Hold back 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:15.080
 I think it depends on people when it comes to here, but after all because it is a thick neck 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.400
 Though I had thought to Fu say Tsu Na or hard to hold down a grip-type nail 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.239
 There is no such thing when you try it now 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.409
 We introduced various guitars to become an example, but of course 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:29.470
 As I said earlier , I think you are big and small, respectively 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:34.090
 Some people may say that the shape of the neck does not fit their hands 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.290
 It so went to the Do you want to choose it is try to play another really I actually be everyone's 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.390
 There is something to say 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:57.230
 Well and I hope anything even habit school that I draw well 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:59.830
 It will be good tomorrow, but after all the ticker ticking below 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.830
 It is heavy to say 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.560
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.280
 me 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.280
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.380
 me
