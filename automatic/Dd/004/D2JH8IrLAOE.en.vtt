bolt head is on the back and it is a

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.239 
bolt head is on the back and it is a
funny<00:00:59.749> angle<00:01:00.019> which<00:01:00.409> means<00:01:00.620> it's<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.859> real<00:01:01.039> pain

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249

in the butt to get your hand on it's a
12<00:01:03.530> millimeter<00:01:03.769> bolt<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.610> you<00:01:05.050> simply<00:01:06.050> loosen

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
12 millimeter bolt and you simply loosen

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:07.540 
12 millimeter bolt and you simply loosen
it<00:01:07.100> up

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
it up

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.030 
it up
I'd<00:01:08.450> already<00:01:08.750> pre<00:01:08.960> loosened<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:09.380> by<00:01:09.530> hand<00:01:09.800> now

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
I'd already pre loosened it by hand now

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.430 
I'd already pre loosened it by hand now
the<00:01:10.100> fun<00:01:10.430> part<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.970> is<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:11.780> once<00:01:12.080> you<00:01:12.229> loosen

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
the fun part is is that once you loosen

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.990 
the fun part is is that once you loosen
this<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.890> bolt<00:01:13.130> will<00:01:13.280> actually<00:01:13.610> stick<00:01:13.820> out

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
this the bolt will actually stick out

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.850 
this the bolt will actually stick out
the<00:01:14.150> end<00:01:14.330> rather<00:01:14.720> than<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.200> pulley<00:01:15.440> coming

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
the end rather than the pulley coming

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.649 
the end rather than the pulley coming
forward<00:01:16.280> it's<00:01:16.760> because<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.120> power<00:01:17.300> steering

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
forward it's because the power steering

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.380 
forward it's because the power steering
tends<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.170> stick<00:01:18.440> in<00:01:18.650> place<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:20.119> got<00:01:20.270> to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
tends to stick in place so you got to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.929 
tends to stick in place so you got to
grab<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.780> power<00:01:20.960> steering<00:01:21.290> here<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:22.070> here

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
grab the power steering here and here

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.300 
grab the power steering here and here
and<00:01:23.119> pull<00:01:23.840> like<00:01:24.079> a<00:01:24.110> son<00:01:24.439> of<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.649> gun<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:25.070> get<00:01:25.159> the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
and pull like a son of a gun to get the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.910 
and pull like a son of a gun to get the
power<00:01:25.490> steering<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.939> shift<00:01:26.180> forward<00:01:26.619> now<00:01:27.619> once

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
power steering a shift forward now once

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.590 
power steering a shift forward now once
it's<00:01:28.130> shifted<00:01:28.549> forward<00:01:28.969> as<00:01:29.149> you<00:01:29.240> can<00:01:29.329> see<00:01:29.570> I

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
it's shifted forward as you can see I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.139 
it's shifted forward as you can see I
can<00:01:29.869> pull<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:30.200> belt<00:01:30.409> off<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:31.039> we've<00:01:31.850> now<00:01:32.090> got

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
can pull the belt off so we've now got

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.810 
can pull the belt off so we've now got
the<00:01:32.479> power<00:01:32.659> steering<00:01:33.020> belt<00:01:33.350> removed<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.670> what

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
the power steering belt removed so what

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.100 
the power steering belt removed so what
I'm<00:01:34.909> going<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:35.180> do<00:01:35.329> next<00:01:35.570> is<00:01:35.840> I'm<00:01:35.960> going<00:01:35.990> to

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
I'm going to do next is I'm going to

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.600 
I'm going to do next is I'm going to
finish<00:01:36.289> fishing<00:01:36.619> out<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.070> power<00:01:37.219> steering

bits<00:01:52.009> on<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.219> end<00:01:52.460> that's<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.270> tensioner

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
bits on the end that's the tensioner

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.260 
bits on the end that's the tensioner
that<00:01:53.930> works<00:01:54.109> for<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.710> main<00:01:55.280> serpentine<00:01:55.969> belt

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
that works for the main serpentine belt

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.359 
that works for the main serpentine belt
so<00:01:56.960> we're<00:01:57.109> going<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.289> get<00:01:57.409> this<00:01:57.619> old<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.100> front

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
so we're going to get this old the front

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.520 
so we're going to get this old the front
first<00:01:58.579> belt<00:01:58.909> out<00:01:59.119> come<00:01:59.570> back<00:01:59.600> loosen<00:02:00.380> things

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
first belt out come back loosen things

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.020 
first belt out come back loosen things
up<00:02:00.829> and<00:02:01.070> then<00:02:01.189> we're<00:02:01.340> going<00:02:01.429> to<00:02:01.520> pull<00:02:01.670> up<00:02:01.820> the

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
up and then we're going to pull up the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.580 
up and then we're going to pull up the
second<00:02:02.390> belt<00:02:02.859> so<00:02:03.859> I<00:02:04.250> will<00:02:04.850> get<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:05.960> going<00:02:06.409> and

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
second belt so I will get this going and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.940 
second belt so I will get this going and
I'll<00:02:06.679> talk<00:02:07.009> to<00:02:07.039> you<00:02:07.159> in<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.340> second<00:02:07.700> okay<00:02:08.950> now

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
I'll talk to you in a second okay now

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.020 
I'll talk to you in a second okay now
we're<00:02:10.100> going<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.280> focus<00:02:10.460> on<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.880> inner

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
we're going to focus on the inner

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.850 
we're going to focus on the inner
serpentine<00:02:11.690> belts

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
serpentine belts

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.050 
serpentine belts
so<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.069> fun<00:02:14.250> part<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.760> down<00:02:15.660> in<00:02:15.840> here<00:02:16.790> this<00:02:17.790> is

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
so the fun part is down in here this is

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.479 
so the fun part is down in here this is
the<00:02:18.180> tensioner<00:02:18.930> for<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.800> main<00:02:19.950> serpentine

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
the tensioner for the main serpentine

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.630 
the tensioner for the main serpentine
belt<00:02:20.700> that's<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.270> 8<00:02:21.930> millimeter<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.400> that

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
belt that's a 8 millimeter and on that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.420 
belt that's a 8 millimeter and on that
you<00:02:23.880> loosen<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.510> up<00:02:24.739> now<00:02:25.739> what<00:02:25.980> goes<00:02:26.190> in

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
you loosen that up now what goes in

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.580 
you loosen that up now what goes in
tandem<00:02:26.940> with<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.720> directly<00:02:28.260> underneath

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
tandem with that is directly underneath

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.130 
tandem with that is directly underneath
this<00:02:28.890> pulley<00:02:29.130> here<00:02:29.489> there<00:02:29.970> are<00:02:30.150> two<00:02:30.450> 14

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
this pulley here there are two 14

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.920 
this pulley here there are two 14
millimeter<00:02:31.709> bolts<00:02:32.420> here's<00:02:33.420> one<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.780> them

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
millimeter bolts here's one of them

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.809 
millimeter bolts here's one of them
right<00:02:34.080> here<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:37.590> get<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:38.040> pulley<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.610> move

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
right here so to get that pulley to move

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.210 
right here so to get that pulley to move
forward<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.780> have<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.170> break<00:02:40.560> loose

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
forward you have to break loose

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.380 
forward you have to break loose
each<00:02:41.370> bolts<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.349> then<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:44.220> one<00:02:44.970> that's<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
each bolts and then the one that's the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.590 
each bolts and then the one that's the
most<00:02:45.890> forward<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.550> one<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.910> remove<00:02:48.330> and

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
most forward is the one you remove and

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.360 
most forward is the one you remove and
that<00:02:49.050> allows<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.650> whole<00:02:49.860> pulley<00:02:50.190> assembly

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
that allows this whole pulley assembly

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.970 
that allows this whole pulley assembly
to<00:02:51.090> as<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.330> can<00:02:51.450> see<00:02:51.660> there<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.530> allows<00:02:52.799> the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
to as you can see there it allows the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.850 
to as you can see there it allows the
whole<00:02:53.130> pulley<00:02:53.400> assembly<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:54.000> rock<00:02:54.209> forward

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
whole pulley assembly to rock forward

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.740 
whole pulley assembly to rock forward
once<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.100> can<00:02:56.310> rock<00:02:56.519> forward<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.569> then

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
once that can rock forward you can then

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.930 
once that can rock forward you can then
slide<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.290> belt<00:02:58.470> out<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.489> slid<00:02:59.819> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
slide the belt out and so I slid the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.080 
slide the belt out and so I slid the
belt<00:03:00.150> ah<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.560> felt<00:03:01.920> right<00:03:02.760> out<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:02.970> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
belt ah and it felt right out of the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.270 
belt ah and it felt right out of the
bottom<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.420> car<00:03:03.769> now<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:04.860> can<00:03:04.980> see<00:03:05.160> what

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
bottom of the car now you can see what

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.759 
bottom of the car now you can see what
we're<00:03:05.400> looking<00:03:05.730> at<00:03:05.850> here<00:03:06.380> there's<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.470> lot<00:03:07.650> of

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
we're looking at here there's a lot of

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.090 
we're looking at here there's a lot of
cracking<00:03:08.340> that's<00:03:08.730> not<00:03:09.799> super<00:03:10.799> critical

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
cracking that's not super critical

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.910 
cracking that's not super critical
although<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:11.940> does<00:03:12.120> show<00:03:12.390> age<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:13.650> what<00:03:13.799> we

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
although it does show age but what we

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.789 
although it does show age but what we
didn't<00:03:14.190> like<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.610> she<00:03:14.700> says<00:03:14.880> banding<00:03:15.420> here

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
didn't like is she says banding here

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.500 
didn't like is she says banding here
that<00:03:16.799> banding<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.579> what's<00:03:17.790> going<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.150> break

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
that banding is what's going to break

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.259 
that banding is what's going to break
and<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.980> when<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.310> look<00:03:20.519> at<00:03:20.609> your<00:03:20.790> serpentine

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
and so when you look at your serpentine

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.840 
and so when you look at your serpentine
belt<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.720> look<00:03:21.900> for<00:03:22.140> cracks<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:23.549> other<00:03:23.700> thing

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
belt you look for cracks the other thing

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.520 
belt you look for cracks the other thing
you<00:03:23.940> want<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.120> look<00:03:24.299> for<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.660> literally<00:03:25.200> chunks

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
you want to look for is literally chunks

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.670 
you want to look for is literally chunks
of<00:03:25.829> it<00:03:25.950> missing<00:03:27.109> and<00:03:28.109> then<00:03:28.260> look<00:03:28.470> for<00:03:28.650> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
of it missing and then look for the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.199 
of it missing and then look for the
banding<00:03:29.070> on<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.280> back<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.700> banding<00:03:30.120> is

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
banding on the back so that banding is

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.670 
banding on the back so that banding is
what<00:03:30.359> told<00:03:30.600> us<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:30.900> we<00:03:31.019> needed<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.260> change<00:03:31.500> this

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
what told us so we needed to change this

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.110 
what told us so we needed to change this
belt<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.329> fun<00:03:33.750> part<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.400> we're<00:03:35.400> going<00:03:35.579> to

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.740 

now<00:03:39.120> seat<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.019> new<00:03:40.170> serpentine<00:03:40.920> belt<00:03:41.690> now<00:03:42.690> the

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
now seat the new serpentine belt now the

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.490 
now seat the new serpentine belt now the
way<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:43.380> little<00:03:43.590> stinker<00:03:43.980> goes<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:45.500> it

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
way that this little stinker goes is it

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.330 
way that this little stinker goes is it
goes<00:03:46.799> number<00:03:47.370> one<00:03:48.859> around<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:50.340> crank<00:03:50.820> which

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
goes number one around the crank which

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.119 
goes number one around the crank which
is<00:03:53.340> this<00:03:53.670> large<00:03:54.620> lower<00:03:55.620> pulley<00:03:56.100> down<00:03:56.400> here

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:14.650 

like<00:04:01.019> this<00:04:02.019> is<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.819> tight<00:04:03.819> space

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.680 

and<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.750> may<00:04:15.930> be<00:04:16.100> easier<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.310> sort<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.360> slip

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
and it may be easier to sort of slip

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:27.730 
and it may be easier to sort of slip
underneath<00:04:19.790> to<00:04:20.790> make<00:04:20.970> sure<00:04:22.250> it's<00:04:24.860> feeding<00:04:25.860> in

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
underneath to make sure it's feeding in

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:40.660 
underneath to make sure it's feeding in
correct<00:04:32.780> basically<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.930> goes<00:04:36.650> around<00:04:38.840> there

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
correct basically it goes around there

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.320 
correct basically it goes around there
it<00:04:41.670> goes<00:04:42.090> underneath<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.490> AC<00:04:44.490> compressor

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
it goes underneath the AC compressor

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.070 
it goes underneath the AC compressor
right<00:04:45.960> in<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.230> front<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.720> then<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:48.900> just

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
right in the front and then you just

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:57.500 
right in the front and then you just
need<00:04:49.230> to<00:04:49.350> get<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:53.690> up<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:55.110> over<00:04:56.510> the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
need to get it up and over the

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:09.040 
need to get it up and over the
alternator<00:05:03.350> and<00:05:04.350> then<00:05:05.010> finally<00:05:06.800> underneath

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
alternator and then finally underneath

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.840 
alternator and then finally underneath
the<00:05:10.050> tensioner<00:05:10.620> pulley<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:13.050> a<00:05:13.080> problem<00:05:13.560> is

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
the tensioner pulley so a problem is

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.990 
the tensioner pulley so a problem is
those<00:05:14.850> new<00:05:15.030> belt<00:05:15.300> is<00:05:15.510> particularly<00:05:16.050> rigid<00:05:17.000> so

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
those new belt is particularly rigid so

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.580 
those new belt is particularly rigid so
that's<00:05:18.450> going<00:05:18.690> to<00:05:18.750> take<00:05:18.930> me<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.110> minute<00:05:19.410> or<00:05:19.470> two

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
that's going to take me a minute or two

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.890 
that's going to take me a minute or two
to<00:05:19.620> get<00:05:19.860> this<00:05:20.100> so<00:05:20.760> I'll<00:05:20.910> get<00:05:21.090> this<00:05:21.240> reseated

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
to get this so I'll get this reseated

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.390 
to get this so I'll get this reseated
and<00:05:22.080> then<00:05:22.200> we'll<00:05:22.410> tighten<00:05:22.590> it<00:05:22.770> all<00:05:22.890> back<00:05:23.160> up

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
and then we'll tighten it all back up

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.370 
and then we'll tighten it all back up
again<00:05:23.700> so<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:26.760> real<00:05:26.910> trick<00:05:26.960> once<00:05:27.960> you've<00:05:28.169> got

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
again so the real trick once you've got

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.870 
again so the real trick once you've got
the<00:05:29.270> belt<00:05:30.270> threaded<00:05:30.840> is<00:05:31.010> down<00:05:32.010> here<00:05:32.460> and<00:05:32.669> this

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
the belt threaded is down here and this

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.780 
the belt threaded is down here and this
guy<00:05:33.120> you've<00:05:33.540> got<00:05:33.780> to<00:05:33.900> tension<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.650> belt<00:05:34.790> with

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
guy you've got to tension the belt with

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.750 
guy you've got to tension the belt with
an<00:05:35.880> eight<00:05:36.030> millimeter<00:05:36.270> socket<00:05:36.600> until<00:05:37.550> you<00:05:38.550> can

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
an eight millimeter socket until you can

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.220 
an eight millimeter socket until you can
slip<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.180> second<00:05:39.930> bolt<00:05:40.169> into<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.590> hole<00:05:40.680> now<00:05:41.310> I

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
slip the second bolt into the hole now I

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.390 
slip the second bolt into the hole now I
ended<00:05:43.230> up<00:05:43.350> cheating<00:05:43.710> a<00:05:43.950> little<00:05:43.980> bit

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
ended up cheating a little bit

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.880 
ended up cheating a little bit
I<00:05:44.550> suck<00:05:44.850> a<00:05:44.880> big<00:05:45.090> screwdriver<00:05:45.390> in<00:05:46.080> between<00:05:46.500> here

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
I suck a big screwdriver in between here

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.950 
I suck a big screwdriver in between here
pried<00:05:47.520> forward<00:05:47.970> a<00:05:48.030> little<00:05:48.150> bit<00:05:48.270> to<00:05:48.419> get<00:05:48.750> it<00:05:48.930> to

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
pried forward a little bit to get it to

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.590 
pried forward a little bit to get it to
go<00:05:49.200> down<00:05:49.470> enough<00:05:49.890> you<00:05:50.190> put<00:05:50.820> in<00:05:50.970> that<00:05:51.150> 14

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
go down enough you put in that 14

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.800 
go down enough you put in that 14
millimeter<00:05:52.050> bolt<00:05:52.760> tighten<00:05:53.760> it<00:05:53.790> up<00:05:53.970> then<00:05:54.780> you

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
millimeter bolt tighten it up then you

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.020 
millimeter bolt tighten it up then you
do<00:05:55.350> your<00:05:55.530> final<00:05:55.740> tensioning<00:05:56.550> on<00:05:56.729> the<00:05:56.910> eight

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
do your final tensioning on the eight

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.090 
do your final tensioning on the eight
millimeter<00:05:57.570> make<00:05:57.930> sure<00:05:58.140> both<00:05:58.410> of<00:05:58.650> those<00:05:58.740> bolts

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
millimeter make sure both of those bolts

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.610 
millimeter make sure both of those bolts
are<00:05:59.520> good<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:00.090> tight<00:06:00.300> and<00:06:00.600> then<00:06:01.470> the

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
are good and tight and then the

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.110 
are good and tight and then the
serpentine<00:06:02.100> belt<00:06:02.130> here<00:06:02.580> is<00:06:02.700> done

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
serpentine belt here is done

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.170 
serpentine belt here is done
now<00:06:03.390> on<00:06:03.690> this<00:06:03.960> belt<00:06:04.290> here<00:06:04.940> this<00:06:05.940> is<00:06:06.090> the

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
now on this belt here this is the

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.860 
now on this belt here this is the
power-steering<00:06:06.479> belt<00:06:08.060> it<00:06:09.060> just<00:06:09.360> fits<00:06:09.630> in<00:06:09.780> a

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
power-steering belt it just fits in a

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.080 
power-steering belt it just fits in a
loop<00:06:10.110> it's<00:06:10.410> fairly<00:06:10.680> easy<00:06:10.860> to<00:06:11.130> fit<00:06:11.550> once<00:06:11.910> you've

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
loop it's fairly easy to fit once you've

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.230 
loop it's fairly easy to fit once you've
got<00:06:12.300> it<00:06:12.330> on<00:06:12.600> here<00:06:13.169> all<00:06:13.979> you<00:06:14.520> really<00:06:14.729> need<00:06:15.030> to<00:06:15.120> do

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
got it on here all you really need to do

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.880 
got it on here all you really need to do
at<00:06:15.390> this<00:06:15.419> stage<00:06:15.600> of<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.140> game<00:06:16.169> is<00:06:16.590> start

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
at this stage of the game is start

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.380 
at this stage of the game is start
tightening<00:06:17.280> up<00:06:17.460> this<00:06:17.640> tensioning<00:06:18.180> rod

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
tightening up this tensioning rod

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:24.110 
tightening up this tensioning rod
remember<00:06:18.960> this<00:06:19.050> is<00:06:19.229> a<00:06:19.260> 10<00:06:19.500> millimeter<00:06:21.350> so<00:06:23.120> just

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
remember this is a 10 millimeter so just

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.779 
remember this is a 10 millimeter so just
start<00:06:24.360> tensioning<00:06:24.600> it<00:06:24.900> up<00:06:25.550> and<00:06:26.550> it<00:06:26.640> may

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
start tensioning it up and it may

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:28.400 
start tensioning it up and it may
actually<00:06:27.030> be<00:06:27.270> relatively<00:06:27.780> easy<00:06:27.960> to<00:06:28.140> turn<00:06:28.289> at

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
actually be relatively easy to turn at

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.610 
actually be relatively easy to turn at
the<00:06:28.470> beginning

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.340 

and<00:06:33.520> then<00:06:34.000> just<00:06:34.270> basically<00:06:34.810> what<00:06:34.960> you<00:06:35.050> do<00:06:35.200> is

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
and then just basically what you do is

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.740 
and then just basically what you do is
you<00:06:35.470> continue<00:06:35.710> to<00:06:35.950> tighten<00:06:36.250> this<00:06:36.340> down<00:06:36.750> until

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
you continue to tighten this down until

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.200 
you continue to tighten this down until
the<00:06:37.870> belt<00:06:38.080> is<00:06:38.260> at<00:06:38.380> the<00:06:38.470> correct<00:06:38.800> tension<00:06:39.210> the

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
the belt is at the correct tension the

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.720 
the belt is at the correct tension the
one<00:06:40.450> other<00:06:40.600> thing<00:06:40.720> you<00:06:41.050> want<00:06:41.230> to<00:06:41.380> do<00:06:41.710> is<00:06:42.070> there

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
one other thing you want to do is there

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.600 
one other thing you want to do is there
is<00:06:42.820> a<00:06:42.850> nut<00:06:43.210> right<00:06:43.720> behind<00:06:44.080> in<00:06:44.350> here<00:06:44.890> that

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
is a nut right behind in here that

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.370 
is a nut right behind in here that
tightens<00:06:46.090> these<00:06:46.360> two<00:06:46.600> pieces<00:06:46.990> of<00:06:47.020> metal

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
tightens these two pieces of metal

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.630 
tightens these two pieces of metal
together<00:06:47.500> to<00:06:47.770> hold<00:06:47.950> the<00:06:48.040> power<00:06:48.160> steering<00:06:48.520> pump

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
together to hold the power steering pump

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.880 
together to hold the power steering pump
in<00:06:48.970> place<00:06:49.140> you<00:06:50.140> just<00:06:50.350> want<00:06:50.530> to<00:06:50.590> double-check

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:50.890 
in place you just want to double-check

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.290 
in place you just want to double-check
that<00:06:51.100> that's<00:06:51.370> good<00:06:51.580> and<00:06:51.760> tight<00:06:51.790> when<00:06:52.180> you're

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
that that's good and tight when you're

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.890 
that that's good and tight when you're
done<00:06:52.480> but<00:06:53.410> basically<00:06:53.830> at<00:06:54.010> this<00:06:54.130> point<00:06:54.220> in<00:06:54.520> time

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 
done but basically at this point in time

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.800 
done but basically at this point in time
once<00:06:55.900> you've<00:06:56.080> got<00:06:56.290> this<00:06:56.680> the<00:06:57.490> main<00:06:58.240> belt<00:06:58.510> on

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
once you've got this the main belt on

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.290 
once you've got this the main belt on
and<00:06:59.110> you've<00:06:59.200> got<00:06:59.380> this<00:06:59.530> one<00:07:00.270> tightened<00:07:01.270> down

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
and you've got this one tightened down

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.110 
and you've got this one tightened down
to<00:07:01.540> the<00:07:01.660> correct<00:07:01.990> tension<00:07:02.610> you<00:07:03.610> are<00:07:03.790> good<00:07:04.030> to

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
to the correct tension you are good to

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.840 
to the correct tension you are good to
go<00:07:04.150> and<00:07:04.450> you<00:07:04.810> were<00:07:04.930> done<00:07:05.340> now<00:07:06.340> I<00:07:06.370> will<00:07:06.730> admit

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
go and you were done now I will admit

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.350 
go and you were done now I will admit
that<00:07:07.120> there<00:07:07.540> was<00:07:07.780> a<00:07:08.820> bunch<00:07:09.820> off-camera

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
that there was a bunch off-camera

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.500 
that there was a bunch off-camera
swearing<00:07:11.730> primarily<00:07:12.730> to<00:07:13.000> do<00:07:13.180> with<00:07:13.390> the

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.510 
swearing primarily to do with the

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.860 
swearing primarily to do with the
serpentine<00:07:14.050> belt<00:07:14.430> this<00:07:15.430> design<00:07:15.940> has<00:07:16.210> I<00:07:16.270> think

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
serpentine belt this design has I think

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.630 
serpentine belt this design has I think
I<00:07:16.990> mentioned<00:07:17.140> before<00:07:17.440> is<00:07:17.860> not<00:07:18.040> exactly<00:07:18.460> the

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.640 
I mentioned before is not exactly the

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.440 
I mentioned before is not exactly the
greatest<00:07:19.860> I'm<00:07:20.860> not<00:07:21.160> impressed<00:07:21.670> and<00:07:22.060> so<00:07:24.450> you're

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.450 
greatest I'm not impressed and so you're

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.670 
greatest I'm not impressed and so you're
going<00:07:25.660> to<00:07:25.750> want<00:07:25.930> to<00:07:26.020> have<00:07:26.200> a<00:07:26.230> little<00:07:26.410> bit<00:07:26.590> of

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 
going to want to have a little bit of

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.990 
going to want to have a little bit of
patience<00:07:27.010> when<00:07:27.160> you're<00:07:27.280> doing<00:07:27.520> this<00:07:27.640> one<00:07:27.820> this

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
patience when you're doing this one this

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.550 
patience when you're doing this one this
isn't<00:07:28.150> like<00:07:28.390> a<00:07:28.420> normal<00:07:28.810> serpentine<00:07:29.320> where<00:07:29.500> you

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 
isn't like a normal serpentine where you

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.270 
isn't like a normal serpentine where you
just<00:07:29.740> can<00:07:29.980> flip<00:07:30.340> the<00:07:30.430> lever<00:07:30.610> done<00:07:31.830> but<00:07:32.830> it<00:07:33.040> is

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 
just can flip the lever done but it is

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.150 
just can flip the lever done but it is
still<00:07:33.550> doable<00:07:33.910> it's<00:07:34.210> not<00:07:34.360> that<00:07:34.660> hard<00:07:35.160> it's

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 
still doable it's not that hard it's

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.270 
still doable it's not that hard it's
just<00:07:36.490> as<00:07:36.610> I<00:07:36.730> said<00:07:36.940> it's<00:07:37.120> a<00:07:37.180> patience<00:07:37.540> game<00:07:37.600> so

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 
just as I said it's a patience game so

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.560 
just as I said it's a patience game so
at<00:07:39.280> this<00:07:39.460> point<00:07:39.670> in<00:07:39.820> time<00:07:39.940> we're<00:07:40.210> done<00:07:40.360> with

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:40.570 
at this point in time we're done with

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.030 
at this point in time we're done with
this<00:07:40.660> car<00:07:40.990> and<00:07:41.260> we're<00:07:41.440> done<00:07:41.590> for<00:07:41.770> the<00:07:41.860> day<00:07:41.890> so
