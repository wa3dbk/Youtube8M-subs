is<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> real-time<00:01:07.470> game<00:01:08.040> whereas<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.000> previous

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
is a real-time game whereas the previous

evolved<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.399> rich<00:01:17.700> universe<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> we

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
evolved is a very rich universe and we

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.230 

the<00:01:41.830> biggest<00:01:42.130> challenge<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.700> making<00:01:42.850> front

the biggest challenge of making front
mission<00:01:43.420> evolved<00:01:44.350> an<00:01:44.440> action<00:01:44.860> shooter<00:01:45.190> was

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
mission evolved an action shooter was

trying to capture that tactical combat
nature<00:01:47.920> of<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.190> past<00:01:48.430> games<00:01:48.730> I<00:01:49.480> think<00:01:50.020> we<00:01:50.110> were

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
nature of the past games I think we were

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.020 
nature of the past games I think we were
able<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.530> achieve<00:01:50.650> that<00:01:51.100> by<00:01:51.340> treating<00:01:51.640> enemy

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
able to achieve that by treating enemy

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.940 
able to achieve that by treating enemy
types<00:01:52.300> which<00:01:52.600> had<00:01:52.810> very<00:01:53.110> sort<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.410> distinct

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
types which had very sort of distinct

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.190 
types which had very sort of distinct
advantages<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:54.790> disadvantages<00:01:55.480> and<00:01:55.690> then

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
advantages and disadvantages and then

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.140 
advantages and disadvantages and then
giving<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.650> player<00:01:56.920> some<00:01:57.460> tactical<00:01:57.940> options

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
to deal with that for example when we

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.370 
to deal with that for example when we
first<00:02:00.760> introduced<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.390> ballistic<00:02:01.930> bonzer

first introduced the ballistic bonzer
it's<00:02:03.190> sort<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.550> heavy<00:02:03.880> wander<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.540> uses

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
it's sort of a heavy wander that uses

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.960 
it's sort of a heavy wander that uses
hard-hitting<00:02:05.380> missiles<00:02:05.830> players<00:02:06.580> were<00:02:06.790> like

wow<00:02:07.180> he's<00:02:07.240> really<00:02:07.480> difficult<00:02:08.140> but<00:02:08.950> over<00:02:09.130> time

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
wow he's really difficult but over time

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.310 
wow he's really difficult but over time
some<00:02:09.670> tactical<00:02:10.060> solutions<00:02:10.240> came<00:02:10.869> up<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.140> deal
