00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
flavor how many hours since it fell off

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.550

the<00:01:04.550> tree<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.420> age<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.050> tree<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.350> fell

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
the tree the age of the tree it fell

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.040 
the tree the age of the tree it fell
from<00:01:06.740> whether<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:07.760> fell<00:01:08.000> because<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:08.660> was<00:01:08.780> ripe

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
from whether it fell because it was ripe

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.570 
from whether it fell because it was ripe
or<00:01:09.320> because<00:01:09.650> it<00:01:09.770> was<00:01:09.890> knocked<00:01:10.160> off<00:01:10.340> on

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580

right comparing to others of the same
variety<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:15.220> drain<00:02:15.460> from<00:02:15.760> an<00:02:15.970> old<00:02:16.180> tree<00:02:16.450> will

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
variety the drain from an old tree will

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:26.790 
variety the drain from an old tree will
