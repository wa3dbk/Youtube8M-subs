the smaller the cave the more control
that<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.430> because<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.120> average<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.690> can't

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that I have because if I average I can't

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
I'm not gonna go into any more detail

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.210 
I'm not gonna go into any more detail
but<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:33.720> would<00:01:33.869> hurt<00:01:34.049> them<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:35.150> I<00:01:36.170> mean<00:01:37.220> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
but it would hurt them and I mean it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.350 
but it would hurt them and I mean it
never<00:01:38.790> pops<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.689> mean<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.340> try<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.060> use

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
never pops I mean you know try to use

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.850 
never pops I mean you know try to use
really<00:01:43.170> pop<00:01:44.090> Rubik's<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.570> by<00:01:45.689> twos<00:01:45.899> are

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
really pop Rubik's to by twos are

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.330 
really pop Rubik's to by twos are
usually<00:01:47.310> known<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:49.439> falling

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
usually known for like just falling

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.530 
usually known for like just falling
apart<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:52.549> yeah<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.820> mean<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.149> cube<00:01:54.420> is

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
apart on you so yeah I mean this cube is

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.090 
apart on you so yeah I mean this cube is
amazing<00:01:55.820> durability<00:01:56.820> wise<00:01:56.990> okay<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.770> now

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
amazing durability wise okay so now

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.950 
amazing durability wise okay so now
let's<00:01:59.280> get<00:01:59.490> into<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.939> most<00:02:00.090> critical<00:02:00.509> aspect

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
let's get into the most critical aspect

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.060 
let's get into the most critical aspect
of<00:02:01.159> what<00:02:02.180> speed<00:02:03.180> cubers<00:02:03.479> one<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.200> there<00:02:04.560> cube

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
of what speed cubers one in there cube

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.969 
of what speed cubers one in there cube
now<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.180> would<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.600> turning<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.320> locking<00:02:07.829> up

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
now that would be turning and locking up

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.930 
now that would be turning and locking up
now<00:02:08.879> locking<00:02:09.479> up<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:10.200> cube

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
now locking up this cube

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:20.130 
now locking up this cube
never<00:02:11.630> ever<00:02:12.820> ever<00:02:13.870> locks<00:02:14.870> up<00:02:16.090> okay

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.050 

but<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.290> reason<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.920> doesn't<00:02:22.040> lock<00:02:22.400> up<00:02:22.610> is

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
but the reason that doesn't lock up is

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.440 
but the reason that doesn't lock up is
because<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:24.020> turning<00:02:24.650> sucks<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:26.210> have<00:02:26.330> to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
because the turning sucks you have to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.870 
because the turning sucks you have to
turn<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.980> see<00:02:27.980> it's<00:02:28.100> like<00:02:28.250> match<00:02:28.640> up

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
turn it see it's like match up

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.320 
turn it see it's like match up
everything<00:02:29.530> cuz<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.790> really<00:02:32.060> hard<00:02:32.180> to

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
everything cuz it's a really hard to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.690 
everything cuz it's a really hard to
explain<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.930> just<00:02:33.160> stinks<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:37.010> really<00:02:37.490> hard

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
explain it just stinks it's really hard

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.910 
explain it just stinks it's really hard
to<00:02:37.820> control<00:02:38.120> your<00:02:38.420> cube<00:02:38.750> but<00:02:39.350> like<00:02:39.560> never

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
to control your cube but like never

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.870 
to control your cube but like never
locks<00:02:40.220> up<00:02:40.810> because<00:02:41.810> since<00:02:42.350> it's<00:02:42.710> oh<00:02:43.040> yeah

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
locks up because since it's oh yeah

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.470 
locks up because since it's oh yeah
I<00:02:43.910> also<00:02:44.270> want<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.480> go<00:02:44.600> into<00:02:44.720> inconsistency<00:02:46.480> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
I also want to go into inconsistency the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:56.350 
I also want to go into inconsistency the
equator<00:02:48.070> turns<00:02:49.090> like<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.120> dream<00:02:55.000> whatever<00:02:56.000> this

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
equator turns like a dream whatever this

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.890 
equator turns like a dream whatever this
line<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.840> longitude<00:02:57.820> turns<00:02:58.820> like<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.330> has<00:02:59.510> sand

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
line of longitude turns like it has sand

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.050 
line of longitude turns like it has sand
in<00:03:00.080> it<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.880> due<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.600> this<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:04.310> will<00:03:04.550> walk<00:03:04.850> up

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
in it so due to this it will walk up

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.560 
in it so due to this it will walk up
sometimes<00:03:05.540> but<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.200> won't<00:03:06.350> be<00:03:06.610> doing<00:03:07.640> you

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
sometimes but you won't be doing you

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.780 
sometimes but you won't be doing you
wouldn't<00:03:08.780> be<00:03:09.530> speed<00:03:09.860> keeping<00:03:10.160> with<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.520> skip

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
wouldn't be speed keeping with that skip

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.070 
wouldn't be speed keeping with that skip
anytime<00:03:11.660> soon

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080
