over<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.759> last<00:00:05.850> decade<00:00:06.359> we've<00:00:06.569> seen

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
over the last decade we've seen

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.270 
over the last decade we've seen
stand-replacing<00:00:08.189> wildfires<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.990> are

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
stand-replacing wildfires that are

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.589 
stand-replacing wildfires that are
uncharacteristic<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.580> their<00:00:12.000> historic<00:00:12.420> fire

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
regime moving across the landscape and

regime moving across the landscape and
they<00:00:17.039> continue<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.670> get<00:00:17.940> larger<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.690> larger

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
they continue to get larger and larger

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.060 
they continue to get larger and larger
as<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.859> years<00:00:20.070> go<00:00:20.310> by<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:22.500> sky<00:00:22.710> fire<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
as the years go by the sky fire is a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.950 
as the years go by the sky fire is a
very<00:00:23.369> useful<00:00:23.609> tool<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> West

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
very useful tool and here in the West

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.509 
very useful tool and here in the West
especially<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> east<00:00:25.890> side<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
especially on the east side of the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.970 
especially on the east side of the
Cascade<00:00:26.970> Mountains<00:00:27.420> those<00:00:28.260> forests<00:00:28.890> over

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
Cascade Mountains those forests over

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.139 
Cascade Mountains those forests over
there<00:00:29.220> were<00:00:29.400> fire<00:00:29.670> adapted<00:00:30.060> forests<00:00:31.940> it's<00:00:32.940> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
there were fire adapted forests it's a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.979 
there were fire adapted forests it's a
very<00:00:34.040> visual<00:00:35.040> experience<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.180> mean<00:00:36.620> you<00:00:38.989> you

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
very visual experience I mean you you

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.310 
very visual experience I mean you you
see<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> change<00:00:40.649> instantly<00:00:41.899> we<00:00:42.899> really<00:00:43.170> need

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
see the change instantly we really need

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.979 
see the change instantly we really need
to<00:00:43.410> think<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:43.969> its<00:00:44.969> habitat<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
to think about its habitat on the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.729 
to think about its habitat on the
landscape<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.420> maybe<00:00:48.420> creating<00:00:48.989> fire<00:00:49.350> sheds

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
landscape and maybe creating fire sheds

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.250 
landscape and maybe creating fire sheds
you<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.309> are<00:00:50.520> really<00:00:51.170> creating<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
you know these are really creating a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.040 
you know these are really creating a
home<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.860> fire<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.780> mess

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
home for fire the more the more you mess

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.970 
home for fire the more the more you mess
with<00:00:58.230> fire<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:01.020> more<00:01:01.140> basis<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.649> better<00:01:01.829> have

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
with fire the more basis you better have

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.640 
with fire the more basis you better have
covered

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.410 

that<00:01:10.650> part<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.040> fascination<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:11.940> fire<00:01:12.150> is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
that part of my fascination with fire is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.060 
that part of my fascination with fire is
is<00:01:12.720> tied<00:01:13.050> to<00:01:13.410> that<00:01:13.580> scale<00:01:14.780> issue<00:01:15.780> because<00:01:16.650> at

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
is tied to that scale issue because at

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.250 
is tied to that scale issue because at
that<00:01:17.340> smallest<00:01:17.820> scale<00:01:18.060> fire<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.660> imminently

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
that smallest scale fire is imminently

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.180 
that smallest scale fire is imminently
predictable<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.910> at<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.150> largest<00:01:21.630> scale

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
predictable but at that largest scale

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.000 
predictable but at that largest scale
fire<00:01:23.190> is<00:01:23.490> ultimately<00:01:24.560> unpredictable<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.860> we

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
fire is ultimately unpredictable and we

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.500 
fire is ultimately unpredictable and we
really<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.760> no<00:01:27.000> idea<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
really have no idea and in that that

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
really have no idea and in that that
makes<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.900> magical<00:01:32.540> to<00:01:33.540> me<00:01:33.570> fire<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.350> like

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
makes it magical to me fire is like

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.530 
makes it magical to me fire is like
water<00:01:34.800> it's<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.550> oxygen

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
water it's like oxygen

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.320 
water it's like oxygen
it's<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.170> soil<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.190> like<00:01:38.400> microbes<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
it's like soil it's like microbes in the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.030 
it's like soil it's like microbes in the
soil<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:41.100> part<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:43.260> whole<00:01:43.440> picture

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
soil it's it's part of the whole picture

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.760 
soil it's it's part of the whole picture
it's<00:01:44.490> part<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.330> environment<00:01:45.660> and<00:01:46.410> I<00:01:46.530> think

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it's part of the environment and I think

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.440 
it's part of the environment and I think
that's<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> true<00:01:47.310> benefit<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.180> College

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that's the true benefit that the College

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.870 
that's the true benefit that the College
of<00:01:48.510> Forestry<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:49.080> now<00:01:49.320> offering<00:01:49.830> a<00:01:50.160> complete

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
of Forestry is now offering a complete

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.390 
of Forestry is now offering a complete
fire<00:01:51.360> science<00:01:51.870> curriculum<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:53.250> it'll

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
fire science curriculum I think it'll

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.719 
fire science curriculum I think it'll
help<00:01:53.600> guide<00:01:54.600> engage<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.680> students<00:01:56.160> and<00:01:56.520> what

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
help guide engage the students and what

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.630 
help guide engage the students and what
they<00:01:56.880> need<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:58.080> now<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.640> multiple

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
they need to know we now have multiple

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.670 
they need to know we now have multiple
perspectives<00:02:00.510> under<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:00.930> house<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.590> are

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
perspectives under one house that are

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.010 
perspectives under one house that are
very<00:02:02.160> strong<00:02:02.550> programs<00:02:03.150> that<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.780> work

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
very strong programs that can all work

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.020 
very strong programs that can all work
together<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.500> really<00:02:04.920> look<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.910> know<00:02:06.000> how

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
together to really look at you know how

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.750 
together to really look at you know how
do<00:02:06.300> we<00:02:07.040> transition<00:02:08.040> to<00:02:08.070> this<00:02:08.250> future<00:02:08.490> where

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
do we transition to this future where

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.870 
do we transition to this future where
fire<00:02:09.090> becomes<00:02:09.630> part<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.709> how<00:02:10.890> we<00:02:10.950> live<00:02:11.280> part<00:02:11.760> of

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
fire becomes part of how we live part of

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.900 
fire becomes part of how we live part of
what<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.270> do<00:02:12.480> part<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.290> our<00:02:13.410> public<00:02:14.010> acceptance

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
what we do part of our public acceptance

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.940 
what we do part of our public acceptance
I<00:02:15.150> mean<00:02:15.870> some<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> these<00:02:16.260> fires<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.830> we've

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
I mean some of these fires that we've

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.860 
I mean some of these fires that we've
been<00:02:17.130> at<00:02:17.280> are<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.209> thousands<00:02:18.750> and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
been at are you know thousands and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.949 
been at are you know thousands and
thousands<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.230> acres<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:20.540> it's<00:02:21.540> not<00:02:21.750> that

thousands of acres and it's not that

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.890 
thousands of acres and it's not that
they're<00:02:22.140> gone<00:02:22.560> they've<00:02:23.160> just<00:02:23.190> been<00:02:23.900> instantly

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
they're gone they've just been instantly

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.820 
they're gone they've just been instantly
transformed<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.880> don't<00:02:27.360> have<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.530> ability

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
transformed if we don't have the ability

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.420 
transformed if we don't have the ability
to<00:02:28.860> understand<00:02:29.959> fire<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.380> its<00:02:31.860> effects<00:02:32.220> on

to understand fire and its effects on

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
treat the landscape both an economically

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.040 
treat the landscape both an economically
feasible<00:02:38.459> way<00:02:38.880> or<00:02:39.300> an<00:02:39.600> ecologically

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
feasible way or an ecologically

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.009 
feasible way or an ecologically
appropriate<00:02:40.170> way<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.519> think<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.570> thus<00:02:42.840> far

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
appropriate way so I think it's thus far

appropriate way so I think it's thus far

can<00:02:45.870> come<00:02:46.050> out<00:02:46.080> here<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.590> years<00:02:47.459> from<00:02:47.730> now

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
can come out here and years from now

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.560 
can come out here and years from now
I'll<00:02:49.200> be<00:02:49.560> able<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.830> reference<00:02:50.790> what<00:02:51.180> I've<00:02:51.300> seen

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
I'll be able to reference what I've seen

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.650 
I'll be able to reference what I've seen

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
and learned out here we can give them

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.590 
and learned out here we can give them
concepts<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.830> classroom<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:57.090> until<00:02:57.450> you
