 what do we do escubal lad 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:13.049
 welcome to another video of oddities with 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.570
 this case of xbox and not of playstation 2 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.310
 as you can see choose 6 games of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.910
 playstation 2 that I'm going to teach you that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.820
 they look like ringleaders 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.290
 is a small opinion about some 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.260
 how many royalties of the name do not believe 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.300
 I can do more parts because it's not 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.710
 I have many more of play 2 but 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.850
 well I can do one more already 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.400
 you will see good we started torrente 3 this 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.230
 game seems to me the most crap the most 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.140
 shit that in the panorama of the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.600
 videogames this is a game crap 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.430
 huge shit shit shit I do not get tired 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.170
 to say it shit 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.320
 I do not know what to do in this 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.120
 game to advance because 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.390
 right now they do not offer me missions almost 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.510
 it was a very weird thing it's a fucking shit 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.850
 I swear to you game helmet I hate this one 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.699
 I swear it, I have it for having it 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.470
 but that gives me a asquito that you 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.890
 I swear I do not know what else to say 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.860
 I think it's a fucking shit you're there you go 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.479
 to the gym and then you do not go there because 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.960
 there are those who lift the weights this is a 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.390
 I fucking lie I swear or no shit 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.460
 of torrent 3 but good looks like a 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.470
 hairnet because good to comfort a 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.570
 torrent 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.350
 well we have here now a royalty that 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.870
 goes for two are two parts are valid and 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.720
 Two are in play. 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.480
 catch zombies that does little good 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.660
 relatively little one more modern one came out 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.050
 for for xbox 360 that is called a 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.420
 chamara would take the name and they are good 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.930
 a very repetitive games to do 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.630
 all the same time killing zombies and 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.200
 move from zone kill more zombies and such 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.800
 but better than the torrent itself 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.840
 are according to my point of view that is 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.850
 you entertain yourself for a while killing are my 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.790
 six with the girls with the katanas there are 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.920
 few puzzles but hey he just goes back to 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.100
 the girls who are also ligeritas 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.610
 light clothes 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.520
 well two more hairlines here we have 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.910
 another little head but he 's in fights 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.400
 monsters is a game quoted from fights that 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.000
 handles giant bugs since he has since 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.600
 a gorilla king kong to one eye with 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.020
 Rays I know this is robots, it's like 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.040
 you see 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.170
 it looks like mazinger z stone bugs I do not know 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.000
 it's a game type of fights in cities 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.450
 even see details like people 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.530
 run under you or in here you see 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.540
 cars that he takes and throw him 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.450
 enemy different fragments of 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.640
 building and it's a very weird game that that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.560
 not easy to see the truth and is very 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.750
 fun and pretty fun this 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.120
 Play control is not the best 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.190
 It has the truth but it seems like a 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.740
 little fun of giant fights 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.500
 and such there are in cities parks of 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.440
 attractions and other good we continue with 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.960
 kilos 7 here of seven 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.430
 another cup recipe with good brand 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.260
 capcom is a little puzzle game with 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.230
 shots what happens that this game has 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.390
 it's a little weird because you're moving 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.920
 leaving tight the X and the doll 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.600
 advance only you the only thing you have to 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.100
 to do is to decide a way to 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.500
 left to the right in case you 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.390
 bifurcate then you have different rooms 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.620
 with different puzzles for here and for 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.090
 there 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.710
 the enemies every time he is an enemy 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.350
 you hit a button it gets in first 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.150
 person as you can see there and touch 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.850
 shoot at weak point are very enemies 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.730
 strange weird are like apparitions 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.550
 it's very weird and then your graphs from 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.030
 zaidÃ­n is pretty good I like it and 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.770
 well consider it a rarity of the play 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.780
 2 are also in cue but much more 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.459
 rare to find and it's worth more expensive and such 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.830
 and well do not play it a lot sincerely 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.080
 but just enough to know what I'm 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.750
 counting kids in the afternoon more 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.240
 good and finally we have here a 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.800
 rarity road roller 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.440
 I consider this game a royalty of 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.720
 terror is a type game type follow hill 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.840
 but much more leisurely because until 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.940
 you start the game you the marinera come out 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.100
 I think children are more children 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.350
 enemies did not play it too much either 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.440
 because I was bored at first 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.660
 then I saw a half-family member play it and 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.200
 good as you go forward it seems that 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.450
 is making it more interesting 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.100
 but at the beginning you play a gadget and 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.780
 also remember the movie of 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.689
 orphanage that is not that I have seen it 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.580
 but I know what it is 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:48.689
 for the theme of children and talgo in the 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.719
 manual I even think that this game is 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:53.999
 rare that these are worthy I do not know 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:58.319
 Well I bought it a long time ago 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:05:00.689
 It cost me eleven euros a long time ago 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.999
 I bought a lot new and I did not unbox 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:06.629
 because I did not make videos at that time 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:09.889
 for nothing kids here another video 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:13.129
 little topics 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.319
 of playstation 2 part 1 we'll see 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:18.229
 see if I can do the shit part 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:21.080
 of the game I swear to you and nothing more 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.930
 kids comments likes more 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.909
 Subscriptions and care on the road 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.360
 as I always say until I take it off 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.360
 kids
