00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:02:56.479 

now<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.750> Vista

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.780 

and<00:02:58.110> attempts<00:02:59.110> for<00:02:59.349> this<00:03:00.189> was<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.489> fourth

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
and attempts for this was the fourth

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.360 
and attempts for this was the fourth
attempt<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:01.450> died<00:03:01.900> twice<00:03:03.900> at<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.140> at<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.159> first

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
attempt I died twice at the at the first

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.580 
attempt I died twice at the at the first
death<00:03:06.609> the<00:03:06.970> first<00:03:07.299> hard<00:03:07.540> jump<00:03:07.810> where<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.170> was<00:03:08.560> a

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
death the first hard jump where I was a

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.940 
death the first hard jump where I was a
little<00:03:08.950> bit<00:03:09.040> too<00:03:09.189> aggressive<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:11.650> the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
little bit too aggressive and the the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.460 
little bit too aggressive and the the
third<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:13.510> fourth<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:14.079> them<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:14.349> they

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
third and the fourth of them so they

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.229 
third and the fourth of them so they
were<00:03:14.530> essentially<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.980> fifth<00:03:15.159> of<00:03:15.310> them<00:03:16.560> were

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
were essentially the fifth of them were

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.819 
were essentially the fifth of them were
pretty<00:03:19.239> dull<00:03:19.510> mistakes<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.109> it<00:03:20.440> was<00:03:20.560> easier

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
pretty dull mistakes so it was easier

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.190 
pretty dull mistakes so it was easier
than<00:03:21.010> I<00:03:21.129> thought

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
than I thought

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.750 
than I thought
thirty<00:03:23.200> six<00:03:23.470> starts<00:03:23.739> now<00:03:23.799> galaxies<00:03:24.400> complete

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
thirty six starts now galaxies complete

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.149 
thirty six starts now galaxies complete
and<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.000> believe<00:03:25.319> I've<00:03:26.319> opened<00:03:26.590> up<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.950> new

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
and I believe I've opened up a new

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.390 
and I believe I've opened up a new
prankster<00:03:27.670> comet<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.799> it's<00:03:29.799> a<00:03:29.920> very

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
prankster comet so it's a very

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.059 
prankster comet so it's a very
challenging<00:03:30.489> level<00:03:31.120> I'll<00:03:31.269> be<00:03:32.049> uploading<00:03:32.950> that

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
challenging level I'll be uploading that

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.619 
challenging level I'll be uploading that
