set<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:15.390> protein<00:01:16.110> hair<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:17.420> flexi<00:01:18.420> rods<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
set the protein hair on flexi rods and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.480 
set the protein hair on flexi rods and
I'm<00:01:19.530> using<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.070> jumbo<00:01:20.430> size<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:22.470> green<00:01:25.490> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
I'm using the jumbo size the green and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.570 
I'm using the jumbo size the green and
basically<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.479> taking<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.369> wrapping<00:01:29.369> it

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
basically I'm just taking it wrapping it

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.109 
basically I'm just taking it wrapping it
around<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.210> bottom<00:01:31.610> hopefully<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.880> see

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
around the bottom hopefully you can see

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.480 
around the bottom hopefully you can see
that<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:37.229> taking<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.130> way<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that and taking it all the way to the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.359 
that and taking it all the way to the
top<00:01:38.929> and<00:01:39.929> folding<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.530> over<00:01:40.649> this<00:01:41.069> isn't

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
top and folding it over this isn't

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.279 
top and folding it over this isn't
anything<00:01:41.580> fancy<00:01:42.299> I'm<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.690> doing<00:01:42.929> this<00:01:43.049> so

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
anything fancy I'm just doing this so

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.559 
anything fancy I'm just doing this so
that<00:01:43.319> I<00:01:43.920> get<00:01:44.399> some<00:01:44.580> curl<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.179> hair<00:01:45.299> a

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
that I get some curl in the hair a

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.620 
that I get some curl in the hair a
little<00:01:45.929> bit<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:47.369> don't<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.360> keep

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
little bit and I don't want to keep

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.630 
little bit and I don't want to keep
curling<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.350> extensions<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
curling the extensions because it's a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.760 
curling the extensions because it's a
protein<00:01:51.090> hair<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:52.049> shortens<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> life

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
protein hair and that shortens the life

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.260 
protein hair and that shortens the life
of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.069> extensions<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.819> I'm<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.209> to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
of the extensions so I'm just going to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.620 
of the extensions so I'm just going to
go<00:01:54.420> ahead<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.229> put<00:01:55.500> maybe<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:56.390> total<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.450> eight

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
go ahead and put maybe a total of eight

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.169 
go ahead and put maybe a total of eight
rods<00:01:57.899> maybe<00:01:58.440> total<00:01:58.950> around<00:01:59.549> my<00:01:59.729> hair<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.119> if

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
rods maybe total around my hair and if

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.969 
rods maybe total around my hair and if
it<00:02:00.299> doesn't<00:02:00.509> dry<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:01.049> together<00:02:01.259> that's<00:02:01.649> fine

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
it doesn't dry all together that's fine

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.130 
it doesn't dry all together that's fine
I<00:02:02.220> just<00:02:02.250> basically<00:02:02.580> want<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.149> mold<00:02:03.420> some<00:02:03.780> curls

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
I just basically want to mold some curls

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.970 
I just basically want to mold some curls
into<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> hair

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
into the hair

00:02:04.980 --> 00:06:45.069 
into the hair
