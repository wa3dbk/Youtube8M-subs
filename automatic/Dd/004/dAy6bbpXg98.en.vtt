will send is once you quite glimmer that
two<00:00:46.980> poles<00:00:47.219> inside<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.480> pretty<00:00:48.690> much<00:00:48.780> what

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
two poles inside it so pretty much what

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.170 
two poles inside it so pretty much what
happens<00:00:49.110> when<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> press<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.129> button<00:00:50.969> at

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
happens when I press that the button at

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.299 
happens when I press that the button at
the<00:00:51.210> circle<00:00:51.809> at<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> back<00:00:52.170> there<00:00:52.469> actually

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the circle at the back there actually

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.819 
the circle at the back there actually
comes<00:00:53.579> up<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.899> would<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> MOT<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
comes up as it would on the MOT as it

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.979 
comes up as it would on the MOT as it
would<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.309> know<00:00:56.340> stay<00:00:56.820> temporarily<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
would you know stay temporarily on the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.840 
would you know stay temporarily on the
module<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.070> different<00:00:59.219> once<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
module but this is different once the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.979 
module but this is different once the
Belcher's<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.600> joined<00:01:00.809> together

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
Belcher's are actually joined together

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.250 
Belcher's are actually joined together
the<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.370> middle<00:01:02.670> two<00:01:02.820> bits<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.329> stuck<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.989> so

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the the middle two bits here stuck up so

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.899 
the the middle two bits here stuck up so
it<00:01:04.379> allows<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.860> activate<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> right<00:01:05.580> sound

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
it allows to activate the right sound

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.200 
it allows to activate the right sound
phrases<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> everything<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.760> also<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:09.090> you
