00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
because we're going to do a stem-cell

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.490 
because we're going to do a stem-cell
facelift<00:00:08.630> what's<00:00:09.630> great<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.110> we're<00:00:10.320> going<00:00:10.440> to

that'll watch this they all have a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.380 
that'll watch this they all have a
little<00:00:20.220> extra<00:00:20.520> storage<00:00:20.880> space<00:00:20.970> where<00:00:21.330> they

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
little extra storage space where they

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.540 
little extra storage space where they
have<00:00:21.539> some<00:00:21.720> stem<00:00:21.990> cells<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:23.010> sometimes<00:00:23.400> it

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
have some stem cells and sometimes it

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.150 
have some stem cells and sometimes it
can<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.789> put<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.150> good<00:00:24.269> use<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.859> whole<00:00:25.859> idea

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
can be put to good use the whole idea

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
no secret we talked about it many times

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.269 
no secret we talked about it many times
a<00:00:31.230> lot<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.560> sign<00:00:31.740> manners

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
a lot of sign manners

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.220 
a lot of sign manners
so<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> question<00:00:32.940> what<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.140> know

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
so the question what can we do you know

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.560 
so the question what can we do you know
in<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> past<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:34.800> put<00:00:34.980> makeup<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.460> wash<00:00:36.329> off

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
in the past we put makeup on wash off

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.080 
in the past we put makeup on wash off
the<00:00:36.719> makeup<00:00:37.079> more<00:00:37.829> makeup<00:00:38.190> doesn't<00:00:38.790> really

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the makeup more makeup doesn't really

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.780 
the makeup more makeup doesn't really

things like blazer and bbl all of which

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.220 
things like blazer and bbl all of which
are<00:00:44.309> good<00:00:44.550> modalities<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> new

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
are good modalities but this is a new

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.180 
are good modalities but this is a new
one<00:00:46.640> utilizing<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.760> own<00:00:47.940> tissues<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.989> heal

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
one utilizing your own tissues to heal

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.549 
one utilizing your own tissues to heal
the<00:00:50.190> sun<00:00:50.460> damage<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.090> improve<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.870> from

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the sun damage and improve it from

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.549 
the sun damage and improve it from
inside<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.160> now<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.809> results<00:00:55.260> aren't<00:00:55.410> going

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
inside out now the results aren't going

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.709 
inside out now the results aren't going
to<00:00:55.620> be<00:00:55.710> dramatic<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> do<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> today<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.629> not

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
to be dramatic and do it today it's not

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.470 
to be dramatic and do it today it's not
like<00:00:57.899> Monday<00:00:58.199> gonna<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.500> 18<00:00:59.090> it<00:01:00.090> would<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.300> nice

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
like Monday gonna be 18 it would be nice

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
like Monday gonna be 18 it would be nice
if<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.750> had<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.620> we're<00:01:01.800> still<00:01:02.039> we're

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
if we had that but we're still we're

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.460 
if we had that but we're still we're
still<00:01:02.670> working<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.229> tell<00:01:04.439> about

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
still working on and then I tell about

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620 
still working on and then I tell about
so<00:01:05.400> basically<00:01:05.700> we're<00:01:05.850> gonna<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.150> harvest

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
so basically we're gonna do is harvest

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.810 
so basically we're gonna do is harvest
your<00:01:06.780> fat<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.189> we're<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.430> mix<00:01:08.610> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
your fat and then we're going to mix it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.910 
your fat and then we're going to mix it
with<00:01:08.850> some<00:01:09.210> protein<00:01:09.420> rich<00:01:09.750> plasma<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.590> little

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
with some protein rich plasma a little

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.969 
with some protein rich plasma a little
growth<00:01:11.130> hormone<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.530> areas<00:01:13.950> that

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
growth hormone and so the areas that

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.399 
growth hormone and so the areas that
we've<00:01:14.280> marked<00:01:14.520> out<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.930> here

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
we've marked out here and here and here

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.020 
we've marked out here and here and here
are<00:01:16.590> our<00:01:16.650> areas<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> we're<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> be

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
are our areas that we're going to be

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.609 
are our areas that we're going to be
volumizing<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:18.960> other<00:01:19.110> words<00:01:19.259> we're<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
volumizing in other words we're going to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.920 
volumizing in other words we're going to
be<00:01:19.710> taking<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> fat<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.299> more<00:01:21.509> concentrated

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
be taking the fat the more concentrated

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.050 
be taking the fat the more concentrated
fat<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.560> some<00:01:22.710> stem<00:01:22.920> cells<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.520> protein

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
fat with some stem cells and protein

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.789 
fat with some stem cells and protein
rich<00:01:24.150> plasma<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.990> build<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.380> up<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
rich plasma and build that up so that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.910 
rich plasma and build that up so that
the<00:01:26.100> hollows<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.409> here<00:01:28.590> are<00:01:28.770> more

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the hollows that you have here are more

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.330 
the hollows that you have here are more
rounded<00:01:29.130> more<00:01:29.670> youthful<00:01:31.130> then<00:01:32.130> we're<00:01:32.220> going

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
rounded more youthful then we're going

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.969 
rounded more youthful then we're going
to<00:01:32.369> feel<00:01:32.579> an<00:01:32.700> increase<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.409> nasal<00:01:34.409> Jugal<00:01:34.770> pull

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
to feel an increase a nasal Jugal pull

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.649 
to feel an increase a nasal Jugal pull
that<00:01:35.159> crease<00:01:35.400> underneath<00:01:35.729> your<00:01:36.030> eyes<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
that crease underneath your eyes and

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.140 
that crease underneath your eyes and
then<00:01:37.380> we're<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> take<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.490> stem<00:01:38.790> cells

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
then we're going to take the stem cells

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.330 
then we're going to take the stem cells
and<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.869> protein<00:01:40.290> rich<00:01:40.470> plasma<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:41.040> applies

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and the protein rich plasma in applies
