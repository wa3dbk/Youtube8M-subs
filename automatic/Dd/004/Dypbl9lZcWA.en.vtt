00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:02.902
A philosophical journey… 

00:00:09.636 --> 00:00:20.410
Giordano Bruno titled some of his most important Latin works with 
 the term “Lamp”, meaning ”light of research and knowledge”.

00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:22.709
along it my Lamp will enlighten 

00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:29.466
Following the philosopher’s footsteps, my lamp enlightened the route of his pilgrimage, 

00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:42.005
starting from Nola, where he was born in 1548, and passing all its stages, 
 one by one, in search for traces and evidences of his presence.

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:52.198
a great discovery...

00:00:56.982 --> 00:01:04.180
Just in Prague, in the Klementinum library, my lamp 
 lit up the most interesting discovery. 

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:12.632
While I was working at the first Italian translation of the 
 Camoeracensis Acrotismus,  one of Bruno’s Latin works, 

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:16.974
I had the chance to identify an unreleased signature of 
 the philosopher on the right front page, 

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:24.730
still visible despite the wear of time had almost cleared it.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.813
and mysterious plots.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:40.300
In the halls of the Elgg Castle, the same lamp enlightened 
 the connection between Giordano Bruno and the Rosicrucian Brotherhood.

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:45.600
However, this lamp was for him just a tool for reaching knowledge. 

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:55.080
Follow me! I will lead you to discover some of 
 the most extraordinary aspects of the “Nolan philosophy”.

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:06.150
