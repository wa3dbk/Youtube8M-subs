(upbeat music)

00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:07.757
- Hey, guys, Complicated Mommy here

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:10.337
and we all know that I
love me some extensions.

00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:13.396
My hair is paper thin, it is pin straight.

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:15.292
I've spoken about
extensions and showed you

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:17.364
some different kinds that
I've used in the past

00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:19.140
here on YouTube and on my blog.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.345
Today, we're gonna share with you

00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:23.890
more of a temporary extension
fix by Daisy Fuentes.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.579
It's a really interesting concept,

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.591
not quite clip-ins and
they're really easy to use.

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:30.181
They're called My Secret Extensions

00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:32.537
and it's an extension headband.

00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:34.722
You can actually put multiple pieces

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.659
in your hair and wear them.

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.785
The hair itself is great quality.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:43.428
It really feels really soft and silky

00:00:43.428 --> 00:00:45.341
compared to some of the
other clip-in extensions

00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:46.752
that I've tried in the past.

00:00:46.752 --> 00:00:48.459
What's great about these extensions, too,

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:50.129
is that you can totally style them.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.910
So you can still curl
them, straighten them,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.467
and really make them
blend well into your hair

00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:57.793
as long as it's on a low heat setting.

00:00:57.793 --> 00:00:59.160
First, you're gonna take the headband

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.331
and you're going to
place it over your hair,

00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:04.164
like so.

00:01:05.553 --> 00:01:07.573
This extension is a little bit darker

00:01:07.573 --> 00:01:09.324
than most of my hair.

00:01:09.324 --> 00:01:11.097
I have some highlights in it right now.

00:01:11.097 --> 00:01:14.468
What's great about it is
you can add different colors

00:01:14.468 --> 00:01:16.845
to get more of an ombre
or highlighted look

00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:19.428
so it still blends really well.

00:01:23.192 --> 00:01:26.485
I pulled out some of my middle section

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:29.634
to cover the back of the band

00:01:29.634 --> 00:01:32.245
and then I pulled out some of the hair

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:34.982
that, kind of, frames
my face on the side here

00:01:34.982 --> 00:01:36.796
so it looks more natural and it, kind of,

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:38.512
blends it in better.

00:01:38.512 --> 00:01:41.046
Right now, I actually have on two pieces.

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:43.479
So, for my really super thin hair

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.775
this is one of the ways that I like

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:49.772
to wear My Secret Extension
is that I pull back

00:01:49.772 --> 00:01:52.257
the front top pieces and I pull it back

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:54.362
so it looks like it's half up, half down.

00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:57.223
This is the style that
I wear normally also.

00:01:57.223 --> 00:02:00.962
I wore it when I had
my other extensions in.

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:03.425
I just think it's a quick,
easy way to get my hair

00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:06.216
out of my face but, yet, have my hair down

00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:09.077
and it works great with these extensions.

00:02:09.077 --> 00:02:12.309
As you can see, I just have two bobby pins

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:16.065
and you have fuller hair that
looks like you styled it.

00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:18.732
It looks nice, it looks healthy.

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.108
I've tried clip-on extensions.

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.636
I used them for my wedding.

00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:25.931
While the stylist was able to
put the clip-ons in for me,

00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:29.626
no problem, I was never
able to really do it myself.

00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:31.941
The Secret Extensions are super simple

00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:33.651
and just totally foolproof.

00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:37.818
Like, you can't mess these
up, you guys, I'm serious.

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.563
Secret Extension packs
are available for $39.99.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.276
I'll list the links
below as well as a link

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:46.758
to my full blog post.

00:02:46.758 --> 00:02:48.442
I'm thinking I'm totally
bringing these with me

00:02:48.442 --> 00:02:50.525
on my road trip next week
