00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
sling mounts which you can't help so ok

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.540 
sling mounts which you can't help so ok
so<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:10.410> have<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.830> trigger<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.810> trigger<00:03:12.960> guard

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
so we have the trigger and trigger guard

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.640 
so we have the trigger and trigger guard
right<00:03:14.550> here<00:03:14.580> if<00:03:15.330> there<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.660> micro<00:03:15.990> switch<00:03:16.230> so

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
right here if there is a micro switch so

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.170 
right here if there is a micro switch so
semi-automatic<00:03:17.370> great

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
semi-automatic great

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.590 
semi-automatic great
you<00:03:18.630> can<00:03:18.870> fire<00:03:19.440> extremely<00:03:20.100> fast<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:21.330> then<00:03:21.450> to

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
you can fire extremely fast and then to

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.770 
you can fire extremely fast and then to
the<00:03:21.690> right<00:03:21.840> we<00:03:22.110> have<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:23.510> selector<00:03:24.510> switch

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the right we have the selector switch

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.370 
the right we have the selector switch
I'm<00:03:25.560> dexterous<00:03:26.340> as<00:03:26.580> well<00:03:26.930> hold<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.170> first

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
I'm dexterous as well hold on the first

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.120 
I'm dexterous as well hold on the first
move<00:03:29.060> there<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.120> go

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
move there you go

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.850 
move there you go
so<00:03:32.130> let's<00:03:32.310> switch<00:03:33.860> little<00:03:34.860> focus<00:03:36.860> okay

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
so let's switch little focus okay

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.520 
so let's switch little focus okay
whatever

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
whatever

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.860 
whatever
okay<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:40.590> we<00:03:40.770> have<00:03:40.860> safe<00:03:41.750> semi<00:03:42.770> full<00:03:43.770> automatic

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
okay so we have safe semi full automatic

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.830 
okay so we have safe semi full automatic
verifier<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:46.050> great<00:03:46.350> with<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.680> 9.6<00:03:47.280> volt<00:03:47.840> but

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
verifier is great with the 9.6 volt but

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.470 
verifier is great with the 9.6 volt but
if<00:03:49.560> we<00:03:49.740> see<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.040> hang<00:03:50.250> guard<00:03:51.350> there<00:03:52.350> is<00:03:53.480> you

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
if we see the hang guard there is you

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.270 
if we see the hang guard there is you
access<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.560> by<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.070> pin<00:03:56.550> over<00:03:57.030> here<00:03:57.240> and<00:03:58.280> there

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
access it by a pin over here and there

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.040 
access it by a pin over here and there
is<00:03:59.430> smaller<00:04:00.180> small<00:04:00.630> amount<00:04:00.900> of<00:04:01.020> space<00:04:01.260> for<00:04:01.620> a

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
is smaller small amount of space for a

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.460 
is smaller small amount of space for a
non<00:04:04.050> point<00:04:04.200> photo<00:04:04.440> just<00:04:04.680> about<00:04:04.980> fit<00:04:05.340> but<00:04:06.470> it

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
non point photo just about fit but it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.650 
non point photo just about fit but it
will<00:04:07.680> if<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.460> want<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:08.730> make<00:04:08.820> life<00:04:09.030> easier<00:04:09.390> go

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
will if you want to make life easier go

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.770 
will if you want to make life easier go
for<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.990> 0.4<00:04:10.920> volt<00:04:11.160> but<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.270> rate<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.480> fire<00:04:12.570> is

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
for a 0.4 volt but the rate of fire is

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.120 
for a 0.4 volt but the rate of fire is
insane<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.220> it's<00:04:14.670> pretty<00:04:15.030> good<00:04:15.210> on<00:04:15.330> the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
insane it's a it's pretty good on the

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.610 
insane it's a it's pretty good on the
9.4<00:04:17.480> accuracy<00:04:18.480> is<00:04:18.720> great<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.440> really

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
9.4 accuracy is great it's really

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.610 
9.4 accuracy is great it's really
accurate<00:04:20.190> much<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.510> don't<00:04:21.900> see<00:04:22.049> much<00:04:22.229> more<00:04:22.470> but

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
accurate much I don't see much more but

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.170 
accurate much I don't see much more but
it's<00:04:22.770> definitely<00:04:22.979> more<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.760> cure<00:04:23.940> than<00:04:24.060> my

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
it's definitely more a cure than my

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.110 
it's definitely more a cure than my
tar21<00:04:25.040> I'm<00:04:26.040> not<00:04:26.220> sure<00:04:26.400> why<00:04:26.610> I<00:04:26.640> just<00:04:26.910> put

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
tar21 I'm not sure why I just put

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.770 
tar21 I'm not sure why I just put
along<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.600> barrel<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:29.100> be<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.430> bolt<00:04:29.790> is<00:04:30.060> located

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
along the barrel so be a bolt is located

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.620 
along the barrel so be a bolt is located
on<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:30.960> left<00:04:31.139> side<00:04:31.290> of<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.440> gun<00:04:31.590> right<00:04:32.370> there

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
on the left side of the gun right there

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.570 
on the left side of the gun right there
you<00:04:33.630> pull<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.169> there<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.560> locking<00:04:35.190> bolt

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
you pull it and there is a locking bolt

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.800 
you pull it and there is a locking bolt
catch<00:04:35.820> then<00:04:36.750> on<00:04:37.199> the<00:04:37.590> right<00:04:37.889> side<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:39.300> can<00:04:39.780> see

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
catch then on the right side you can see

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.480 
catch then on the right side you can see
the<00:04:40.320> hop-up<00:04:40.970> right<00:04:41.970> there<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:44.310> it's

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
the hop-up right there and it's

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.850 
the hop-up right there and it's
adjustable<00:04:44.910> great<00:04:45.570> hop-up<00:04:45.870> how<00:04:46.620> does<00:04:46.740> it<00:04:46.800> go

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
adjustable great hop-up how does it go
