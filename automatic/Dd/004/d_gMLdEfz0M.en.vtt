glowing<00:02:29.810> bottles<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.439> there<00:02:30.560> what<00:02:30.799> are<00:02:30.920> they

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
glowing bottles in there what are they

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.699 
glowing bottles in there what are they
12<00:02:31.459> 8712<00:02:32.209> ax<00:02:32.450> Evans<00:02:32.750> what<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.349> got<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.530> couple

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
12 8712 ax Evans what you got a couple

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.979 
12 8712 ax Evans what you got a couple
of<00:02:33.950> 12ax7<00:02:34.430> running<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.299> we<00:02:35.599> run<00:02:35.750> in<00:02:35.870> the

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
of 12ax7 running the we run in the

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.770 
of 12ax7 running the we run in the
tremolo<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:37.069> gotta<00:02:37.280> 1287<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.420> 12ax7

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
tremolo and you gotta 1287 and a 12ax7

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.339 
tremolo and you gotta 1287 and a 12ax7
running<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.560> reverb<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.549> then<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.849> gotta<00:02:41.060> a

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
running the reverb and then you gotta a

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.020 
running the reverb and then you gotta a
6<00:02:42.349> k<00:02:42.560> 6<00:02:42.920> running<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.400> power<00:02:43.579> actually

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
6 k 6 running the power actually

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.920 
6 k 6 running the power actually
powering<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.659> whole<00:02:44.810> unit<00:02:45.459> 6<00:02:46.459> k<00:02:46.730> 6<00:02:47.150> honey<00:02:47.420> I'm

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
powering the whole unit 6 k 6 honey I'm

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.410 
powering the whole unit 6 k 6 honey I'm
never<00:02:48.200> even<00:02:48.290> heard<00:02:48.470> of<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:49.340> an<00:02:49.459> RCA<00:02:49.849> new

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
never even heard of that it's an RCA new

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.170 
never even heard of that it's an RCA new
old<00:02:50.569> stock<00:02:50.690> RCA<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:51.920> it's<00:02:52.069> old<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.760> it's<00:02:52.909> sweet

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
old stock RCA so it's old and it's sweet

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.009 
old stock RCA so it's old and it's sweet
now<00:02:53.930> are<00:02:54.170> those<00:02:54.379> being<00:02:54.680> made<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.849> look<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.569> you

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
now are those being made that look I you

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.180 
now are those being made that look I you
know<00:02:57.109> is<00:02:57.349> electro<00:02:58.099> harmonix<00:02:58.670> or<00:02:59.440> JJ<00:03:00.440> making

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
know is electro harmonix or JJ making

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.069 
know is electro harmonix or JJ making
those<00:03:01.370> these<00:03:01.670> days<00:03:01.730> or<00:03:02.090> anything<00:03:02.389> on<00:03:02.629> well

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
those these days or anything on well

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.780 
those these days or anything on well
everybody's<00:03:03.739> got<00:03:03.769> their<00:03:04.129> own<00:03:04.159> versions<00:03:04.639> of

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
everybody's got their own versions of

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.520 
everybody's got their own versions of
the<00:03:04.909> tubes<00:03:05.180> well<00:03:05.480> we<00:03:05.599> find<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.200> new<00:03:06.349> old

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
the tubes well we find that the new old

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.530 
the tubes well we find that the new old
stock<00:03:06.650> troops<00:03:07.010> are<00:03:07.190> just<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.370> lot<00:03:07.489> sweeter<00:03:07.849> they

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
stock troops are just a lot sweeter they

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.210 
stock troops are just a lot sweeter they
bloom<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.959> lot<00:03:09.139> more<00:03:09.319> they<00:03:09.620> just<00:03:09.799> sound<00:03:09.950> better

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
bloom a lot more they just sound better

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.940 
bloom a lot more they just sound better
all<00:03:10.549> around<00:03:10.579> give<00:03:11.389> you<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.629> real<00:03:11.900> deep<00:03:12.500> sound

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
all around give you that real deep sound

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.280 
all around give you that real deep sound
in<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.280> reverb<00:03:13.609> I<00:03:13.879> just<00:03:14.450> hadn't<00:03:14.690> heard<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:14.989> six

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
in a reverb I just hadn't heard of six

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.559 
in a reverb I just hadn't heard of six
cases<00:03:15.920> before<00:03:16.099> so<00:03:16.430> if<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.239> go<00:03:17.389> out<00:03:17.540> there

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
cases before so if you go out there

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.149 
cases before so if you go out there
probably<00:03:17.989> want<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.290> know<00:03:18.379> if<00:03:18.470> they<00:03:18.590> like<00:03:18.859> they

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
probably want to know if they like they

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.890 
probably want to know if they like they
have<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.370> buy<00:03:19.639> a<00:03:19.670> new<00:03:19.790> old<00:03:20.090> stock<00:03:20.209> one<00:03:20.569> to<00:03:20.720> have

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
have to buy a new old stock one to have

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.140 
have to buy a new old stock one to have
it<00:03:21.019> work<00:03:21.200> or<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.829> know<00:03:22.609> you<00:03:22.639> could<00:03:22.849> actually

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
it work or you know you could actually

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.390 
it work or you know you could actually
put<00:03:23.510> at<00:03:23.599> 6v6<00:03:23.930> in<00:03:24.379> that<00:03:24.530> spot<00:03:24.829> and<00:03:25.069> we'll<00:03:25.159> just

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
put at 6v6 in that spot and we'll just

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.520 
put at 6v6 in that spot and we'll just
run<00:03:25.549> it<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.730> little<00:03:25.909> bit<00:03:26.120> hotter<00:03:26.359> the<00:03:26.780> 6k<00:03:27.139> six<00:03:27.410> is

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
run it a little bit hotter the 6k six is

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.300 
run it a little bit hotter the 6k six is
the<00:03:27.560> low<00:03:27.769> lower<00:03:28.040> power<00:03:28.340> okay<00:03:28.940> now<00:03:30.190> tell<00:03:31.190> us

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
the low lower power okay now tell us

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.680 
the low lower power okay now tell us
about<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.639> circuit<00:03:32.000> inside<00:03:32.209> because<00:03:32.540> there

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
about the circuit inside because there

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.360 
about the circuit inside because there
are<00:03:32.840> companies<00:03:33.230> these<00:03:33.500> days<00:03:33.560> who<00:03:34.010> are<00:03:34.129> doing

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
are companies these days who are doing

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.740 
are companies these days who are doing
like<00:03:34.849> you<00:03:35.180> know<00:03:35.569> DIY<00:03:36.199> kids<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.010> sort<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.370> a

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
like you know DIY kids and sort of a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.599 
like you know DIY kids and sort of a
standard<00:03:38.889> circuit<00:03:39.889> I<00:03:39.980> mean<00:03:40.129> nothing<00:03:40.340> wrong

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
standard circuit I mean nothing wrong

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.069 
standard circuit I mean nothing wrong
with<00:03:40.790> standard<00:03:41.150> but<00:03:41.269> some<00:03:41.389> of<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.599> sort<00:03:41.959> of

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
with standard but some of the sort of

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.039 
with standard but some of the sort of
based<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:42.470> an<00:03:42.590> old<00:03:42.799> say<00:03:43.639> a<00:03:43.669> 63<00:03:44.329> fender<00:03:44.780> or

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
based on an old say a 63 fender or

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.780 
based on an old say a 63 fender or
whatever<00:03:45.379> so<00:03:45.919> I'm<00:03:46.040> not<00:03:46.190> going<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.400> lie<00:03:46.519> this<00:03:46.549> is

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
whatever so I'm not going to lie this is

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.970 
whatever so I'm not going to lie this is
a<00:03:46.970> based<00:03:47.299> off<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.780> brown<00:03:48.079> fender<00:03:48.620> reverb

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
a based off the brown fender reverb

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.520 
a based off the brown fender reverb
circuit<00:03:49.609> what<00:03:49.849> I<00:03:49.879> did<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:50.299> I<00:03:50.449> took<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:51.019> made<00:03:51.319> my

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
circuit what I did is I took and made my

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.339 
circuit what I did is I took and made my
own<00:03:51.560> twist<00:03:51.919> on<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.910> took<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:53.870> kind<00:03:54.260> of

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
own twist on it I took and kind of

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.110 
own twist on it I took and kind of
changed<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:54.799> few<00:03:54.919> of<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.099> parameters<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.819> then

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
changed a few of the parameters and then

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.199 
changed a few of the parameters and then
I<00:03:56.389> use<00:03:57.079> a<00:03:57.109> whole<00:03:57.590> different<00:03:58.069> set<00:03:58.370> of<00:03:58.669> resistors

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
I use a whole different set of resistors

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.420 
I use a whole different set of resistors
and<00:03:59.239> capacitors<00:03:59.480> to<00:04:00.290> make<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.620> sound<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.310> lot

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
and capacitors to make it sound a lot

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.509 
and capacitors to make it sound a lot
sweeter<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:02.180> lot<00:04:02.629> deeper<00:04:03.190> just<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.250> way<00:04:04.370> we

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
sweeter a lot deeper just the way we

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.010 
sweeter a lot deeper just the way we
like<00:04:04.549> it<00:04:04.730> so

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
like it so

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.550 
like it so
no<00:04:06.590> Michael<00:04:07.580> should<00:04:07.730> we<00:04:07.850> have<00:04:08.200> try<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.230> couple

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
no Michael should we have try a couple

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.790 
no Michael should we have try a couple
other<00:04:09.800> settings<00:04:10.480> really<00:04:11.480> max<00:04:12.110> things<00:04:12.440> out<00:04:12.620> or

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
other settings really max things out or

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.030

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
nice warm tube games saturation to it

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.360 
nice warm tube games saturation to it
yeah<00:04:39.789> exactly<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.690> then<00:04:41.080> this<00:04:41.289> is<00:04:41.500> really<00:04:41.710> the

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
yeah exactly and then this is really the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.920 
yeah exactly and then this is really the
receiving<00:04:42.970> end<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.330> so<00:04:43.509> this<00:04:43.659> is<00:04:43.810> the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
receiving end of it so this is the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.080 
receiving end of it so this is the
spring<00:04:44.259> side<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.710> it<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:45.310> that<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:45.639> can<00:04:45.849> hear

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
spring side of it so that you can hear

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.089 
spring side of it so that you can hear
as<00:04:46.240> you<00:04:46.389> get<00:04:46.569> louder<00:04:46.810> on<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.050> spring<00:04:47.470> go<00:04:47.979> ahead

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
as you get louder on the spring go ahead

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:55.350 
as you get louder on the spring go ahead
and<00:04:48.220> play<00:04:48.370> some<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:54.310> hear<00:04:54.460> that<00:04:54.610> ping<00:04:55.000> eNOS

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
and play some you hear that ping eNOS

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.020 
and play some you hear that ping eNOS
and<00:04:55.629> that<00:04:55.780> like<00:04:56.349> deep<00:04:56.830> pool<00:04:57.220> at<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.520> end<00:04:57.789> of<00:04:57.940> a

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
and that like deep pool at the end of a

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.869 
and that like deep pool at the end of a
tunnel<00:04:58.300> kind<00:04:58.659> of<00:04:58.780> sound<00:04:59.050> that's<00:04:59.770> from<00:05:00.430> all<00:05:00.729> the

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:00.879 
tunnel kind of sound that's from all the

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.850 
tunnel kind of sound that's from all the
spring<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.509> the<00:05:01.629> tube<00:05:01.840> mixing<00:05:02.229> together<00:05:02.349> so

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
spring and the tube mixing together so

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.520 
spring and the tube mixing together so
so<00:05:03.280> it's<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.490> long<00:05:03.849> spring<00:05:04.330> accutronics<00:05:05.110> tank

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
so it's a long spring accutronics tank
