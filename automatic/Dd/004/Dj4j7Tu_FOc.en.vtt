directly<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.890> attack<00:01:11.220> enemies<00:01:11.490> around

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
directly to attack enemies around

directly to attack enemies around
corners<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.170> unlike<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.010> chippies<00:01:14.760> Luxon

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
corners so unlike the chippies Luxon

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.940 
corners so unlike the chippies Luxon
walls<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.990> can't<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.290> shoot<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> ground

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
walls you can't just shoot at the ground

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.800 
walls you can't just shoot at the ground
and<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> bounce<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.360> hopefully

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and have a bounce and then hopefully

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.260 
and have a bounce and then hopefully
they<00:01:19.470> will<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.770> some<00:01:19.950> splash<00:01:20.280> damage<00:01:20.580> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
they will have some splash damage that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.999 
they will have some splash damage that
just<00:01:21.600> won't<00:01:21.780> work<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.619> you're<00:01:22.740> trying<00:01:22.920> to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
just won't work so if you're trying to

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.280 
just won't work so if you're trying to
take<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> sentry<00:01:23.670> nest<00:01:23.909> usually<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.080> will

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
take out a sentry nest usually this will

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.510 
take out a sentry nest usually this will
be<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> very<00:01:25.500> good<00:01:25.950> weapon<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.250> choose

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
be a very good weapon to choose

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.760 
be a very good weapon to choose
obviously<00:01:27.479> sticky<00:01:27.869> launcher<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.619> use

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
obviously sticky launcher if you can use

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.440 
obviously sticky launcher if you can use
that<00:01:28.950> first<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.610> would<00:01:29.670> probably<00:01:29.909> your<00:01:30.240> best

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that first I would probably your best

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.710 
that first I would probably your best
bet<00:01:30.829> unlike<00:01:31.829> most<00:01:31.860> projectiles<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.390> grenades

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
bet unlike most projectiles the grenades

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.840 
bet unlike most projectiles the grenades
are<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:34.140> affected<00:01:34.740> by<00:01:34.770> damage<00:01:35.280> fall<00:01:35.490> off<00:01:35.670> so

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
are not affected by damage fall off so

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
are not affected by damage fall off so
that's<00:01:35.970> nice<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.750> grenades<00:01:37.079> arc

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that's nice the grenades arc

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.050 
that's nice the grenades arc
significantly<00:01:37.979> downward<00:01:38.369> after<00:01:38.610> being<00:01:38.790> fired

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
significantly downward after being fired

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.030 
significantly downward after being fired
and<00:01:39.360> launched<00:01:39.810> slightly<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.619> right<00:01:40.710> of

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and launched slightly to the right of

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
and launched slightly to the right of
the<00:01:41.070> crosshair<00:01:41.640> these<00:01:42.000> grenades<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.810> used

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the crosshair these grenades can be used

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
the crosshair these grenades can be used
as<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.290> makeshift<00:01:43.860> explosive<00:01:44.490> jump<00:01:44.729> however<00:01:45.149> if

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
as a makeshift explosive jump however if

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.179 
as a makeshift explosive jump however if
you're<00:01:45.509> using<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.470> sticky<00:01:46.770> jumper<00:01:47.159> you

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you're using the sticky jumper you

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
you're using the sticky jumper you
should<00:01:47.549> probably<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.090> use<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.390> or<00:01:48.810> if

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
should probably just use that or if

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.600 
should probably just use that or if
you're<00:01:49.470> using<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.740> sticky<00:01:50.040> launcher<00:01:50.430> that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
you're using the sticky launcher that

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.450 
you're using the sticky launcher that
does<00:01:50.820> work<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.329> well<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.530> splash<00:01:52.829> damage<00:01:53.100> on

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
does work as well the splash damage on

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.959 
does work as well the splash damage on
these<00:01:53.640> grenades<00:01:54.000> typically<00:01:54.960> between<00:01:55.140> 20<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
these grenades typically between 20 to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.510 
these grenades typically between 20 to
264<00:01:56.969> damage<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.290> yeah<00:01:58.829> definitely<00:01:59.070> don't

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
264 damage so yeah definitely don't

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.969 
264 damage so yeah definitely don't
expect<00:02:00.149> your<00:02:00.659> splash<00:02:01.079> damage<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.680> killing

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
expect your splash damage to be killing

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.399 
expect your splash damage to be killing
everyone<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> nice<00:02:03.719> feature<00:02:03.930> like

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
everyone but it is a nice feature like

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.069 
everyone but it is a nice feature like
if<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.799> lux<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.280> lols<00:02:05.520> did<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.329> splash<00:02:06.780> as

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
if the lux and lols did have splash as

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.869 
if the lux and lols did have splash as
in<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:07.890> didn't<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.280> break<00:02:08.520> upon

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
in if they didn't just break upon

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.059 
in if they didn't just break upon
hitting<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.209> ground<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.720> weapon<00:02:10.649> would<00:02:10.860> be

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
hitting the ground that weapon would be

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.149 
hitting the ground that weapon would be
very<00:02:11.879> very<00:02:12.090> over

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
very very over

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.770 
very very over
sort<00:02:14.159> of<00:02:14.310> an<00:02:14.400> unfortunate<00:02:15.060> exchange<00:02:15.420> here<00:02:15.750> I

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
sort of an unfortunate exchange here I

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.600 
sort of an unfortunate exchange here I
was<00:02:16.019> aiming<00:02:16.379> way<00:02:16.620> too<00:02:16.680> low<00:02:17.069> would<00:02:17.190> be<00:02:17.340> hitting

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
was aiming way too low would be hitting

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.509 
was aiming way too low would be hitting
those<00:02:17.760> guys<00:02:18.319> yeah<00:02:19.319> banking<00:02:20.069> on<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.280> splash

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
those guys yeah banking on the splash

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.970 
those guys yeah banking on the splash
damage<00:02:20.790> probably<00:02:21.420> not<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.659> best<00:02:21.690> bet<00:02:22.049> so<00:02:22.409> if<00:02:22.920> I

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
damage probably not the best bet so if I

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.070 
damage probably not the best bet so if I
could<00:02:23.129> do<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.220> again<00:02:23.580> gotta<00:02:24.239> aim<00:02:24.450> higher<00:02:24.690> but

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
could do that again gotta aim higher but

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.830 
could do that again gotta aim higher but
yeah<00:02:25.560> demo<00:02:25.920> troll<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.489> definitely<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.030> fun<00:02:27.510> load
