date for Avengers 3 they already have an

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.929 
date for Avengers 3 they already have an
idea<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.889> where<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:14.250> story<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.549> going<00:03:14.669> to<00:03:14.790> go

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
idea of where the story is going to go

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.610 
idea of where the story is going to go
so<00:03:15.209> they're<00:03:15.329> just<00:03:15.419> locking<00:03:15.689> him<00:03:15.930> down<00:03:16.139> so<00:03:16.439> once

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
so they're just locking him down so once

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.780 
so they're just locking him down so once
they<00:03:16.769> get<00:03:16.889> it<00:03:17.010> done<00:03:17.159> they<00:03:17.400> won't<00:03:17.579> have<00:03:17.669> to

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
they get it done they won't have to

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.550 
they get it done they won't have to
worry<00:03:17.970> about<00:03:18.030> him<00:03:18.329> what<00:03:18.840> does<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:18.989> mean<00:03:19.349> that

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
worry about him what does that mean that

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.710 
worry about him what does that mean that
means<00:03:20.069> that<00:03:20.759> they're<00:03:20.909> not<00:03:21.060> talking<00:03:21.599> about

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
means that they're not talking about

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.929 
means that they're not talking about
Iron<00:03:22.079> Man<00:03:22.290> 4<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.949> there<00:03:23.129> is<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> very<00:03:23.729> good

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:23.939 
Iron Man 4 so there is a very good

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.240 
Iron Man 4 so there is a very good
possibility<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.989> there<00:03:25.139> won't<00:03:25.439> be<00:03:25.739> an<00:03:25.949> iron

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
possibility that there won't be an iron

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.119 
possibility that there won't be an iron
man<00:03:26.430> movie<00:03:26.759> during<00:03:27.090> phase<00:03:27.419> 3<00:03:27.750> at<00:03:27.900> all<00:03:28.259> that

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
man movie during phase 3 at all that

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.800 
man movie during phase 3 at all that
makes<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.430> lot<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.609> sense<00:03:29.729> because<00:03:30.299> if<00:03:30.419> Marvel

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
makes a lot of sense because if Marvel

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.619 
makes a lot of sense because if Marvel
is<00:03:30.959> going<00:03:31.169> to<00:03:31.290> have<00:03:31.470> him<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:31.889> Avengers<00:03:32.579> 3<00:03:32.849> it'll

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
is going to have him in Avengers 3 it'll

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.140 
is going to have him in Avengers 3 it'll
give<00:03:33.780> them<00:03:33.989> time<00:03:34.259> to<00:03:34.739> find<00:03:35.069> a<00:03:35.280> new<00:03:35.310> Iron<00:03:35.849> Man

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
give them time to find a new Iron Man
