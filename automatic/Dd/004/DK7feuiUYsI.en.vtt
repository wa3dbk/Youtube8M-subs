00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.020
 Hello everyone, I am RXSFAI. 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:10.380
 This time I want to talk to you about the basic operation of the fighter and some air combat skills. 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.360
 Many friends often ask me how to fly the plane. 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.720
 How can I not hit the plane? 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.700
 Because there are quite a few newcomers, there are not many opportunities to use the aircraft. 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.240
 Most of them don’t understand how the fighters move, so they don’t fly. 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.000
 So it’s easy to see that they often crash into buildings or the ground. 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.060
 They also become unwilling to drive fighters and are not interested in fighters. 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.440
 So, I will take this opportunity to tell the basic manipulation methods with some friends who still don’t drive fighters. 

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:45.307
 In addition, I will also talk about a very important technology in the BF4 air battle. 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.980
 If you know how to drive a fighter, you don’t want to look at the basics. 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.320
 You can skip this part at the specified time in the [About] position below. 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.460
 Let's start talking about basic operations. 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.760
 First, let me talk about the interface of the fighter. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.820
 Whether you are driving an attack aircraft or a stealth jet 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.560
 There will also be a small cell with numbers written in your upper left and upper right corners. 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.020
 The number written on the left small square represents the speed of the fighter, and the right represents the height. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.360
 If you press the button, you can look in other directions from the driver’s point of view. 

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:29.146
 The operation of the fighter mainly revolves around using the keyboard and mouse 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.000
 The main control speed on the keyboard, the mouse controls the moving direction 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.360
 Of course, you can also use the keyboard to drive a fighter like me. 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.060
 However, the overall control will be rough and cannot be carefully moved 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.460
 In the control speed, the W key is acceleration, and the S key is deceleration. 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:01.320
 If you are manipulating the stealth jet, you can use the shift button to make additional acceleration using the shifter. 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.920
 A and D keys are left and right horizontal movements respectively 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.120
 But the movement is very small 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.360
 So if you need to turn a lot to the left or right, you need to use the mouse. 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.680
 Convert the weapon by pressing the F key 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.400
 X key is using thermal bombardment or ECM interference 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.120
 The blank key and the left button of the mouse are attacks. 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.980
 When using the mouse to move 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.920
 Since the system is preset to the Y axis (ie, up and down), it is the opposite 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.100
 So when you push the mouse forward, the plane will fly down, pull back and fly up. 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.980
 Of course, you can also set the opposite setting of the Y axis back to normal in [Settings]. 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.240
 In addition to controlling the plane to fly up and down, the mouse 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.980
 Can also control the airplane to rotate left or right 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:04.100
 When your plane flies sideways, you can fly up or down to make a large-scale steering flight. 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.340
 Speaking of this wrap, it is the basic flight operation of the aircraft. 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.860
 I suggest that friends who are still novices can go to the driving range first before entering the server to officially drive the fighter. 

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:25.602
 If you want to practice yourself, you won’t be able to crash into the building or the ground. You can enter some unoccupied [Dawning Action] maps and practice flying between the buildings. 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.140
 Then I will talk about a very important air combat skill. 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.080
 At the time of air combat with enemy fighters 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.280
 Because the fighter can only attack the front 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.180
 So you must chase the tail of the enemy plane 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.520
 And the battle opportunity ahead is because I want to leave the fighter behind. 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.160
 So most will choose to fly to the left or right continuously. 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.980
 In order to continue to chase him, you will follow him the same action. 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.900
 This keeps the two fighters hovering in the air. 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.660
 This air combat phenomenon is also known as Dogfight, dog fighting. 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.460
 Then, how can you get the upper hand in the dog fight? 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.740
 I will talk about the skills here. 

00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:17.251
 When you are fighting, you want to continue to use the cannon to attack the enemy, you must follow the enemy's flight action. 

00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:23.791
 But this tends to be a bit slower than the enemy's movements, so it's hard to have a chance to continue to attack you. 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:31.140
 If you want to hit the enemy, your mobility must be better than him, and the steering speed is faster. 

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:34.571
 How do you increase the mobility of your aircraft? 

00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:37.411
 The key is to control the optimal speed of the aircraft 

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:41.951
 The best speed to control the flight. This technique was discovered by players at BF2. 

00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:45.351
 At the same time, it has become the key technology for air battles. 

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:50.611
 As long as you can maintain the best flight speed, you can have the highest mobility 

00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:57.311
 In the BF4, the best flight speed of the fighter is about 300-310. 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.220
 As long as you remember this speed, you can use more maneuverability to hit the enemy first in the dog fight. 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.860
 However, you have to remember that whether you press W or not, the system defaults you to slowly accelerate to about 340. 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.900
 In addition, when you fly up or down, it will also accelerate or slow down due to the gravity of the Earth. 

00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:26.231
 So everyone must remember to pay attention to the number of their left speed and make appropriate acceleration and deceleration. 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.340
 To maintain your best flight speed 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.760
 However, this does not mean that you need to maintain the best flight speed for a long time. 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.100
 Suppose the enemy plane is far away, but you are keeping the best flight speed. 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.300
 In his vision, it seems to be no different from a slowly moving goal. 

00:05:46.807 --> 00:05:53.227
 So I suggest that the best flight speed is still used when staying in the dog fight. 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.460
 Then I will talk about this this time. 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.060
 I recently slowed down the speed of the movie because of personal reasons. 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.800
 But now, probably, it can also return to normal speed. 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.980
 If you have some weapons or equipment, I want to make a comment on the film, or want to play with me.
