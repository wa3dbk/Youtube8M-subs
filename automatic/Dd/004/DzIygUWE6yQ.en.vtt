Morales Anglin there's a lot of
different<00:03:12.950> ways<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.310> could<00:03:13.459> do<00:03:13.580> it<00:03:13.670> because<00:03:13.819> I

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
different ways you could do it because I

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.000 
different ways you could do it because I
actually<00:03:13.970> think<00:03:14.299> that<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.660> might<00:03:14.860> lose<00:03:15.860> an

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
actually think that you might lose an

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.740 
actually think that you might lose an
opportunity<00:03:16.099> if<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:16.700> if<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:17.180> mean<00:03:17.329> unless<00:03:17.480> you

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
opportunity if you if I mean unless you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.479 
opportunity if you if I mean unless you
bait<00:03:17.959> made<00:03:18.200> Peter<00:03:18.739> Parker<00:03:18.829> black<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.430> then

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
bait made Peter Parker black and then

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.060 
bait made Peter Parker black and then
miles<00:03:20.000> more<00:03:20.150> also<00:03:20.299> why<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:21.650> can<00:03:21.799> make<00:03:21.950> the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
miles more also why to you can make the

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.460 
miles more also why to you can make the
bomb<00:03:22.220> yes<00:03:22.459> it's<00:03:22.790> but<00:03:23.150> if<00:03:23.390> you<00:03:23.750> wanted<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.200> what

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
war or whatnot you'll have that

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.690

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
then miles were also take up the mantle

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.630 
then miles were also take up the mantle
with<00:03:36.260> five<00:03:36.470> ten<00:03:36.799> years<00:03:36.829> from<00:03:37.010> now<00:03:37.130> who<00:03:37.579> knows

with five ten years from now who knows

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.210 
with five ten years from now who knows
the<00:03:38.299> other<00:03:38.450> option<00:03:39.319> crazy<00:03:39.620> one<00:03:39.859> out<00:03:40.010> there

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
the other option crazy one out there

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.490 
the other option crazy one out there
that<00:03:40.430> could<00:03:40.609> maybe<00:03:41.000> they<00:03:41.959> introduce

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
that could maybe they introduce

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.160 
that could maybe they introduce
spider-man<00:03:43.400> Peter<00:03:43.670> Parker<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.870> Marvel

Cinematic<00:03:45.200> Universe<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.069> then<00:03:46.370> the

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
Cinematic Universe and then the

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.580 
Cinematic Universe and then the
standalone<00:03:46.850> movie<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.660> Miles<00:03:48.019> Morales<00:03:48.440> and

standalone movie is Miles Morales and

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.809 
standalone movie is Miles Morales and

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
then you could have those guys meet up

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.370 
then you could have those guys meet up
because<00:03:50.030> they<00:03:50.120> made<00:03:50.269> up<00:03:50.389> in<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.569> comics<00:03:50.930> once

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
because they made up in the comics once

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.099 
because they made up in the comics once
or<00:03:51.530> twice<00:03:51.620> is<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.579> a<00:03:52.639> far<00:03:52.819> fresh<00:03:53.030> idea<00:03:53.389> yes<00:03:53.720> but

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
or twice is it a far fresh idea yes but

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.809 
or twice is it a far fresh idea yes but
could<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:54.440> happen<00:03:54.560> i<00:03:54.920> disagree<00:03:55.489> i<00:03:55.519> don't<00:03:55.700> think

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
could it happen i disagree i don't think

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.160 
could it happen i disagree i don't think
it's<00:03:55.940> far-fetched<00:03:56.120> that's<00:03:56.480> i<00:03:56.630> was<00:03:56.750> suggesting

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
it's far-fetched that's i was suggesting

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.990 
it's far-fetched that's i was suggesting
the<00:03:57.260> same<00:03:57.410> thing<00:03:57.650> like<00:03:57.799> have<00:03:58.069> spider-man<00:03:58.609> and
