00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 ah 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:19.260
 and the afternoon presents Carmen Diaz and the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.869
 We are both working on a project 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.650
 a set called mutant the purpose 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.119
 of the project is to be able to link artists 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.230
 above all we are very interested in working 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.970
 with emerging artists with brands and 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 to be able to do projects in spaces 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.910
 social as in this case in the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.770
 filth 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.690
 it was the first space that we are 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.000
 working in this way under the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.080
 project to educate you the idea is that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.450
 mutar can begin to reach others 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.520
 social spaces and offer them to 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.020
 marks like this case to indian the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.630
 possibility to work directly with 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.450
 an artist and perform a project of 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.190
 dear marketing with brand elements 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.680
 inside the plastic artist 's work 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.619
 we practically started working 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.130
 at the beginning of August 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.680
 last year and the father of the concept 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.380
 is that we not only sit with things 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.390
 a little smaller this was started at 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.610
 make it bigger and bigger inclusive 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.560
 right now 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.580
 the opportunity to continue expanding and 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.280
 start doing all things 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.550
 much bigger and stronger and has 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.570
 been every day without stopping all the 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.190
 nights weekends birthday in 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.050
 reality has been a project in which 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.350
 We have been working daily during 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.400
 these months about everything interesting about 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.890
 this project is that it is a project a 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.710
 little is new is a new project is 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.600
 a new offering for for for 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.729
 brands in terms of advertising as 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.920
 to the communication of a language of 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.830
 mark then we had to structure the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.479
 in a way as very solid also not 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.270
 there's the interesting thing about this whole project 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.330
 it's like an idea this same idea gone 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.009
 mutating and growing is a bit like how 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.930
 the title or the name that we put on 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.190
 project we love the idea that 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.540
 Indian is in this case the first brand 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.390
 who supported us 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.730
 that speaks a lot about practically 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.950
 has an opening to new things to 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.650
 creative things to different things 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.700
 it was not easy the process has not been easy 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.540
 it has been 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.720
 pretty laborious but I think what 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.160
 brands like me have allowed us 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.110
 that's precisely what they believe in 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.010
 us that is the part where it has been 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.080
 easy not to be able to get to marks that the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.150
 mutar project what you offer to the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.250
 marks is just the possibility of 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.870
 interact with your language 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.700
 communication all brands have a 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.650
 campaign language a brand language 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.060
 then when we approach 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.590
 with Indians we present a series of 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.260
 possible artists who could work 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.569
 directly with the brand by the type of 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.390
 visual language that the artists 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.329
 they have in the brand 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.239
 Indians caught six who is the one who 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.250
 he made the mural and from what 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.769
 chose, we started with a job and everything 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.560
 a work process between the artist and 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.349
 the brand does not that that's really the are 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.760
 marketing as at what time the art and 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.180
 advertising can have a language 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.360
 in common and a visual artist can 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.740
 develop a specific campaign what 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.670
 important is what 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.590
 can increase the very impact of the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.720
 campaign because they make a series of 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.120
 things around there's nothing else the mural 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.430
 that has an exhibition in a space 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.320
 social with a certain amount of people 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.200
 who will see it around you 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.390
 generate videos generate interviews are 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.760
 generate a series of actions that make 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.490
 that the project has a lot more 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.040
 dissemination the brand has dissemination and about 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.140
 all the real purpose that the artist has the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.800
 dissemination that deserves to have in reality 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.360
 with colors and alessandra we have had 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.280
 as a great ally to any 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.910
 insurgents that in turn because the 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.580
 urgent 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.650
 Well, this same concept that we want 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.390
 handle for the artist in favor of 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.780
 be able to help all this emerging talent 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.060
 that is emerging in mexico this this 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.510
 place precisely adapted to those 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.030
 needs because this place has 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.700
 a lot of talking about culture has 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.460
 presentations plays and about 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.200
 all something very important that you what is 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.060
 of convenience for the brand by 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.040
 course for brands also the 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.990
 others that are going to be able to intervene 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.480
 the project and for the artist is that 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.370
 this space has an influx 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.950
 quite strong not on weekends 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.320

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.730
 good djs there are others today another series of 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.130
 activities plays exhibitions 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.470
 etcetera that always keep the place 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.350
 with a lot of affluence and with a lot of rotation 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.420
 of people not then this mural is going to 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.490
 have a visibility well enough 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.770
 interesting for both the artist and 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.300
 for the brands that are going to be 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.310
 involved in the project does not stop 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.569
 Indians above all we are commenting 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.389
 ask subject 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.360
 and then you can contact us for that 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.069
 half that we had the surprise 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.399
 right now that starting because 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:20.499
 really our networks to mutate you 

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:23.800
 are being born, projects have arrived 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:26.559
 very interesting that we are giving 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.839
 account of the great need that exists 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:31.990
 in Mexico and how wise is this 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:35.050
 project to be able to support artists 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.969
 that is for us the most important thing 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.580
 of the project so they can have a 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.740
 alliance with the big brands that are 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.509
 at this moment and they exist and that what 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.939
 we have now as proof in this case 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.819

 a moment that talking to six that 

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:59.050
 it was really quite interesting that 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:01.899
 he told us that a student like the 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.029

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:06.009
 more is a project he is a project 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:08.229

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.449
 scaffolding to pass him 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.520
 the water bottle to pass all this 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.880
 kind of things and it really makes a 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.430
 project so be a joint project 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.320

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.240

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.070
 scaffolding production let's mediate 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.550
 a video that is supporting us with everything 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:45.160
 the theme of doing all the step by step 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.919
 from the process of the pint of the 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.020
