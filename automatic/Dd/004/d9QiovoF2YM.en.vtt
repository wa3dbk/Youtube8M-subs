00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
maybe it I already broke it then we have

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.069 
maybe it I already broke it then we have
some<00:03:22.239> anaesthetic<00:03:23.239> wipes<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:23.989> know

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
some anaesthetic wipes that you know

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.979

idea<00:04:23.160> what<00:04:23.280> this<00:04:23.430> is<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:25.169> feels<00:04:25.560> like<00:04:25.710> felt

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
idea what this is so it feels like felt

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.710 
idea what this is so it feels like felt
I<00:04:26.250> also<00:04:26.460> have<00:04:26.729> no<00:04:26.880> idea<00:04:27.030> what<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.270> is<00:04:27.389> and<00:04:27.660> it

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
I also have no idea what it is and it

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.820 
I also have no idea what it is and it
looks<00:04:27.810> like<00:04:28.220> stuff<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.550> felt<00:04:30.120> sticker<00:04:30.830> another

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
looks like stuff a felt sticker another

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.360 
looks like stuff a felt sticker another
one<00:04:32.010> of<00:04:32.100> those<00:04:32.220> things<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:35.160> dropped

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
one of those things and I dropped

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.969 
one of those things and I dropped
another<00:04:35.610> ibuprofen<00:04:36.120> thing<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:36.870> think<00:04:37.440> I<00:04:37.740> don't

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
another ibuprofen thing I think I don't

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.480 
another ibuprofen thing I think I don't
know<00:04:38.160> if<00:04:38.220> nothing<00:04:38.610> else<00:04:39.740> it's<00:04:40.740> antibiotic

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
know if nothing else it's antibiotic

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.040 
know if nothing else it's antibiotic
ointment<00:04:41.940> so<00:04:42.060> this<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.360> like<00:04:42.539> neosporin

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
ointment so this is like neosporin

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:54.140 
ointment so this is like neosporin
basically<00:04:50.780> so<00:04:51.780> this<00:04:52.289> is<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.740> huge<00:04:53.580> first<00:04:54.030> day

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
basically so this is a huge first day

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.640 
basically so this is a huge first day
per<00:04:54.330> that's<00:04:54.510> why<00:04:54.660> like<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:55.200> don't<00:04:55.349> really<00:04:55.470> keep

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
per that's why like I don't really keep

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.529 
per that's why like I don't really keep
anything<00:04:56.220> else<00:04:56.370> other<00:04:56.550> than<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.030> rip<00:04:57.210> stuff

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539
