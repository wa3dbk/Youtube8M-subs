00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
had labored breathing so it looked very

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.889

making some clicking noises kind of
squeaking<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.789> definitely<00:00:53.969> looked

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
squeaking and so it definitely looked

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.630 
squeaking and so it definitely looked
definitely<00:00:55.260> looked<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.620> he<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:55.949> pain<00:00:56.370> or

I've<00:02:08.129> been<00:02:08.340> giving<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
I've been giving is I have a this is a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.640 
I've been giving is I have a this is a
eyedropper<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.870> works

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
eyedropper but this works

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.100 
eyedropper but this works
well<00:02:14.040> for<00:02:14.370> administering<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.569> things<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.079> I

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
well for administering the things that I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.929 
well for administering the things that I
need<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.439> to<00:02:16.739> pop-tart<00:02:17.159> because<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.819> has<00:02:17.909> a

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
need to to pop-tart because it has a

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.809 
need to to pop-tart because it has a
very<00:02:18.299> small<00:02:18.540> spout<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.799> just<00:02:19.950> really<00:02:20.549> good

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
very small spout it's just really good

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.580 
very small spout it's just really good
and<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.599> here<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.959> two<00:02:22.110> things<00:02:22.140> I've<00:02:22.560> been

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and so here the two things I've been

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.710 
and so here the two things I've been
giving<00:02:23.280> him<00:02:23.489> now<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.180> one<00:02:24.390> looks<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.689> little

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
giving him now this one looks a little

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.830 
giving him now this one looks a little
weird<00:02:25.079> but<00:02:25.349> this<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.549> have<00:02:27.150> them<00:02:27.329> labeled<00:02:27.480> two

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
weird but this I have them labeled two

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.089 
weird but this I have them labeled two
because<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.260> them<00:02:28.379> in<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:28.530> fridge<00:02:28.799> so

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
because I have them in the fridge so

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.339 
because I have them in the fridge so
this<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.579> says<00:02:29.790> fluid<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.629> this<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.079> a

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
this just says fluid and this is a

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.929 
this just says fluid and this is a
rehydration<00:02:32.189> mix<00:02:32.609> so<00:02:33.390> what<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.689> is<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.200> it's

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
rehydration mix so what this is is it's

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.250 
rehydration mix so what this is is it's
actually<00:02:35.939> transferred<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.689> to<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.930> smaller

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
actually transferred it to a smaller

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.259 
actually transferred it to a smaller
container<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:37.769> all<00:02:38.220> together<00:02:38.519> it's<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.909> cup<00:02:39.120> of

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
container but all together it's a cup of

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.619 
container but all together it's a cup of
water<00:02:40.040> some<00:02:41.040> salt<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.640> sugar<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.420> that's

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
water some salt and sugar and that's

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.890 
water some salt and sugar and that's
basically<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:44.099> help<00:02:44.340> rehydrate<00:02:45.000> his

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
basically to help rehydrate his

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.860 
basically to help rehydrate his
electrolytes<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:48.060> he<00:02:48.269> doesn't<00:02:48.599> get<00:02:48.690> as

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
electrolytes so he doesn't get as

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.809 
electrolytes so he doesn't get as
dehydrate<00:02:49.349> and<00:02:49.889> then<00:02:50.010> here<00:02:50.190> we<00:02:50.340> have<00:02:50.370> some

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
dehydrate and then here we have some

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.550 
dehydrate and then here we have some
thyme<00:02:51.810> or<00:02:52.319> not<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.950> time<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:55.260> is

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
thyme or not that time and this is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.289 
thyme or not that time and this is
supposed<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.799> help<00:02:56.069> with<00:02:56.340> his<00:02:56.760> respiratory

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
supposed to help with his respiratory

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.119 
supposed to help with his respiratory
problem<00:02:57.659> if<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.230> respiratory<00:02:58.560> problem

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
problem if it's a respiratory problem

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.210 
problem if it's a respiratory problem
it's<00:02:59.549> something<00:02:59.700> to<00:03:00.239> do<00:03:00.420> with<00:03:00.450> his<00:03:01.220> breathing

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
it's something to do with his breathing

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.509 
it's something to do with his breathing
so<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.569> does<00:03:04.139> actually<00:03:04.500> really<00:03:05.310> help

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
so and this does actually really help

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.099 
so and this does actually really help
the<00:03:05.670> time<00:03:05.909> so<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.879> fresh<00:03:08.879> thyme<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.659> we

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
the time so this is fresh thyme and we

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.059 
the time so this is fresh thyme and we
steeped<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.739> like<00:03:11.069> we<00:03:11.220> would<00:03:11.250> tea<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.060> then<00:03:13.069> it

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
steeped it like we would tea and then it

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.800 
steeped it like we would tea and then it
kind<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.459> makes<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.939> color<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.480> then<00:03:15.569> I<00:03:15.599> have

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
kind of makes this color and then I have

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.960 
kind of makes this color and then I have
just<00:03:16.049> a<00:03:16.170> couple<00:03:16.409> of<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.739> sprigs<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.639> still

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
just a couple of the sprigs of it still

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.619 
just a couple of the sprigs of it still
in<00:03:18.150> there<00:03:18.359> so<00:03:18.629> when<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.650> can<00:03:19.829> still<00:03:20.480> get<00:03:21.480> all

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
in there so when I so can still get all

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.229 
in there so when I so can still get all
the<00:03:21.959> good<00:03:22.889> flavors

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
the good flavors

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.059 
the good flavors
stuff<00:03:24.690> in<00:03:24.840> there<00:03:24.989> though<00:03:25.169> it's<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:25.680> hamsters

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
stuff in there though it's the hamsters

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.569 
stuff in there though it's the hamsters
don't<00:03:26.879> really<00:03:27.419> like<00:03:27.629> the<00:03:27.810> time<00:03:28.049> taste<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:29.489> I've

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
don't really like the time taste so I've

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.970 
don't really like the time taste so I've
kind<00:03:29.909> of<00:03:29.970> had<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.239> force<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:30.840> into<00:03:31.169> a<00:03:31.440> system

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
kind of had to force it into a system

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.020 
kind of had to force it into a system
like<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.250> sick<00:03:32.639> child<00:03:33.889> so<00:03:34.889> here's<00:03:35.220> what<00:03:35.489> time<00:03:35.699> is

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
like a sick child so here's what time is

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.860 
like a sick child so here's what time is
exactly<00:03:36.980> we<00:03:37.980> went<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.549> Sobeys<00:03:38.909> today<00:03:39.269> and

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
exactly we went to Sobeys today and

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.469 
exactly we went to Sobeys today and
picked<00:03:40.139> some<00:03:40.620> fresh<00:03:40.889> thyme<00:03:41.370> up<00:03:41.609> because<00:03:42.090> we

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
picked some fresh thyme up because we

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.670 
picked some fresh thyme up because we
did<00:03:42.629> not<00:03:42.750> have<00:03:42.900> any<00:03:43.079> in<00:03:43.229> the<00:03:43.319> house<00:03:43.440> obviously

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
did not have any in the house obviously

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.479 
did not have any in the house obviously
because<00:03:44.220> we've<00:03:44.549> never<00:03:44.699> used<00:03:44.970> time<00:03:45.239> before<00:03:45.569> but

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
because we've never used time before but

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.449 
because we've never used time before but
it's<00:03:47.489> something<00:03:47.760> that's<00:03:47.909> an<00:03:48.269> organic<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.459> it

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
it's something that's an organic and it

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.069 
it's something that's an organic and it
looks<00:03:50.669> just<00:03:50.909> something<00:03:51.329> like<00:03:51.449> this<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.900> looks

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
looks just something like this it looks

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.890 
looks just something like this it looks
a<00:03:52.169> little<00:03:52.349> odd<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.879> has<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.299> distinctive

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
a little odd and it has a distinctive

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.719 
a little odd and it has a distinctive
smell<00:03:55.109> too<00:03:55.579> but<00:03:56.579> it<00:03:56.699> just<00:03:56.849> looks<00:03:57.060> like<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:58.729> so

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
smell too but it just looks like that so

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.319 
smell too but it just looks like that so
that<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.269> what<00:04:00.599> is<00:04:01.409> in<00:04:01.859> here<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.549> it's<00:04:02.940> steeped

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
that is what is in here and it's steeped

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.039 
that is what is in here and it's steeped
like<00:04:03.690> tea<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.409> then<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.430> use<00:04:05.669> the<00:04:05.819> eyedropper

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
like tea and then I use the eyedropper

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.500 
like tea and then I use the eyedropper
to<00:04:07.049> give<00:04:07.379> it<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.590> him<00:04:07.769> now<00:04:08.760> I'm<00:04:08.970> gonna<00:04:09.120> be<00:04:09.299> doing

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
to give it to him now I'm gonna be doing

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.809 
to give it to him now I'm gonna be doing
a<00:04:09.599> video<00:04:09.720> all<00:04:10.019> about<00:04:10.049> time<00:04:10.560> because<00:04:10.979> time<00:04:11.609> is

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
a video all about time because time is

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.949 
a video all about time because time is
very<00:04:12.299> very<00:04:12.780> good<00:04:13.879> to<00:04:14.879> a<00:04:14.909> hamster<00:04:15.359> owner<00:04:15.569> I

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
very very good to a hamster owner I

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.930 
very very good to a hamster owner I
think<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.799> can<00:04:16.979> use<00:04:17.159> time<00:04:17.430> for<00:04:17.699> many

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
think you can use time for many

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.750 
think you can use time for many
different<00:04:18.269> things<00:04:18.659> for<00:04:19.109> hamster<00:04:20.070> illnesses

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
different things for hamster illnesses

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.640 
different things for hamster illnesses
so<00:04:21.150> I<00:04:21.180> definitely<00:04:21.750> am<00:04:21.900> going<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.229> be<00:04:22.320> doing<00:04:22.469> a

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
so I definitely am going to be doing a

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.780 
so I definitely am going to be doing a
video<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:22.979> that<00:04:23.250> and

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
video on that and

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.270 
video on that and
now<00:04:24.000> I'm<00:04:24.150> going<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.450> show<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.660> pop-tart<00:04:25.440> and

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.530 

if<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.400> guys<00:04:29.550> can<00:04:29.820> hear<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.390> is

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
if you guys can hear that that is

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.070 
if you guys can hear that that is
pop-tart<00:04:30.960> clicking<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:31.530> that's<00:04:31.680> because<00:04:33.080> the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
pop-tart clicking and that's because the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.030 
pop-tart clicking and that's because the
lungs<00:04:35.540> respiratory<00:04:36.540> problems<00:04:37.050> affect<00:04:37.560> lungs

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
lungs respiratory problems affect lungs

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.830 
lungs respiratory problems affect lungs
so<00:04:38.430> that's<00:04:38.610> why<00:04:38.790> it's<00:04:38.910> making<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.360> clicking

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
so that's why it's making the clicking

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.030 
so that's why it's making the clicking
noise<00:04:41.630> if<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:42.780> guys<00:04:43.020> can<00:04:43.290> hear<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:43.560> I'm<00:04:43.830> not

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
noise if you guys can hear that I'm not

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.180 
noise if you guys can hear that I'm not
sure<00:04:44.340> but<00:04:45.300> um<00:04:45.540> as<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.290> can<00:04:46.320> see<00:04:46.530> his<00:04:46.740> right
