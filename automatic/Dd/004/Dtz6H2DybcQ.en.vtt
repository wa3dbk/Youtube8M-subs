00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.700
 windows phone no longer has a single brand 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.070
 of reference htc has bet strongly for 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.510
 this operating system and your phone 8 x 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.330
 it's all an example of good work in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.849
 specifications and especially design the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.740
 htc 8x demonstrates with its finish and shapes 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.020
 that it is still possible to differentiate with 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.150
 quality with color and polycarbonate 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.890
 as protagonists the beveled edges 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.420
 they get this phone to be 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.190
 tremendously comfortable to carry in the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.350
 hand and transmits a feeling of 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.710
 resistance quality and lightness at the same 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.710
 weather 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.950
 Another example of the good work of this htc 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:03.129
 8x we find it on the 4.3 screen 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.019
 inches and 720p resolution is seen with 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.000
 brightness intensity and good angles of 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.760
 vision also had lides thanks to a 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.500
 need of 342 dots per inch to 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.270
 finishing level gorilla coverage 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.890
 Class 2 curves at its edges to 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.200
 fit perfectly with the housing 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.509
 of polycarbonate pity that for 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.040
 dimensions of your screen this htc be 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.290
 almost as long as a phone with 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.390
 more inches inside we find 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.490
 finally a double core but htc has 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.500
 left only 16 gigs of internal memory 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.910
 without possibility of expansion despite 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.910
 windows phone 8 already allows it 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.799
 no fault however the camera 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.270
 of 8 megapixels that meets well supported 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.820
 for a good section of the system 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.500
 operative is fast has buttons 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.960
 exclusive and will serve you in most 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.219
 situations and the secondary stands out for 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.570
 a very practical angle for 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.570
 self-portraits and video calls 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.590
 and is that we must not forget that this htc 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.480
 8x is a terminal that are windows 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.819
 phone 8 in spain 'and everything that 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.349
 involves at the hardware level now there's 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.480
 more freedom and possibilities for 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.189
 manufacturers that are encouraged visually 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.379
 the customization of the screen 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.299
 start the most flexible notifications 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.069
 or the children's corner reinforce a 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.629
 unique and different interface where the 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.569
 integration of services is very 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.889
 achieved and there are no fluency problems 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.750
 but it is still inadmissible that with the 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.090
 travel that carries windows phone and the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.290
 ecosystem is so limited the hope 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.970
 is that the ease with which the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.129
 applications created for windows 8 it 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.629
 can now port to windows phone anime 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.629
 the market because you need it
