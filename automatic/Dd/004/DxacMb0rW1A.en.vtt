00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.420
 Hi guys all right 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.270
 my name is adriana riba better known 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.119
 as brital dÃ¡vel and there will bring a 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.090
 Tip for you girls, women to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.250
 you men too because you do not 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.390
 always ask as it does to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.430
 leave the butt and legs in some 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.320
 turned and I see a lot of the girls 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.780
 doing those isolated exercises 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.809
 abcon shin guard on the four leg 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.610
 supports you can do that exercise 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.360
 no problem, but what do not you 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.980
 can take the squat out of the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.469
 training for you 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.690
 to focus on one squat 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.609
 full exercise it works - 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.000
 lower integer 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:03.329
 And then you are a beginner, do it halfway. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.610
 because you really need to work 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.520
 prepare the muscles now be training 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.290
 already intermediate and advanced and this 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.049
 a little easy and squatting 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.750
 background because on the back when you 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.939
 you ask for the region of the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.580
 gluteus without it solicits the entire region 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.970
 I can consider us keep talking 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.780
 which is the best exercise for glutes so 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.450
 girl in the squat has several 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.030
 several exercises one can do has one 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.560
 no matter a leg in the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.200
 front and back is passing the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.600
 pictures of some options for you 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.659
 and then, after all , the other exercises 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.380
 there and then you want too you do it 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.049
 isolated exercise but the tip is do not tire 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.790
 the squatting of your workout routine is 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.340
 which will make the biggest difference in 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.750
 end result of your training 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.430
 I hope I have helped with this tip ii 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.659
 until the next then with one more tip 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.649

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.649
