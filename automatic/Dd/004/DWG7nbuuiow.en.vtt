00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.690 

in<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:01.890> lesson<00:00:02.100> we'll<00:00:02.280> learn<00:00:02.340> how<00:00:02.580> we<00:00:02.639> can

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
in this lesson we'll learn how we can

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.579 
in this lesson we'll learn how we can
start<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.090> retain<00:00:03.570> cached<00:00:03.990> information

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
start to retain cached information

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.940 
start to retain cached information
within<00:00:04.740> our<00:00:04.920> scenes<00:00:06.230> okay<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.529> scene<00:00:07.710> file

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
within our scenes okay so the scene file

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.089 
within our scenes okay so the scene file
is<00:00:08.160> called<00:00:08.280> lesson<00:00:08.700> 10<00:00:09.030> start<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.920> again<00:00:10.920> just

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
is called lesson 10 start and again just

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.580 
is called lesson 10 start and again just
a<00:00:11.250> relatively<00:00:11.639> simple<00:00:11.849> scene<00:00:12.240> have<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> couple

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
a relatively simple scene have a couple

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.709 
a relatively simple scene have a couple
of<00:00:13.620> emitter<00:00:13.889> 'he's<00:00:14.009> some<00:00:14.670> gravity<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.269> volume

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
of emitter 'he's some gravity of volume

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.750 
of emitter 'he's some gravity of volume
both<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.020> which<00:00:16.139> i<00:00:16.289> currently<00:00:16.680> have<00:00:16.949> set<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.640> be

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
both of which i currently have set to be

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.599 
both of which i currently have set to be
invisible<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.920> if<00:00:19.920> i<00:00:20.010> were<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.189> come<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.430> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
invisible but if i were to come in and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.279 
invisible but if i were to come in and
press<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.300> key<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.689> our<00:00:21.720> keyboard<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.260> can

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
press the a key on our keyboard you can

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.560 
press the a key on our keyboard you can
see<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> couple<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.430> these

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
see that we do have a couple of these

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.439 
see that we do have a couple of these
fluids<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.689> here<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.080> are<00:00:25.400> mixing<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.580> sort

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
fluids in here that are mixing and sort

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.689 
fluids in here that are mixing and sort
of<00:00:27.480> interacting<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:28.050> each<00:00:28.140> other<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.490> what

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
of interacting with each other so what

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.220 
of interacting with each other so what
i'm<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.910> do<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.210> first<00:00:30.599> give<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:30.990> just

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
i'm going to do is first give this just

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.870 
i'm going to do is first give this just
a<00:00:31.289> moment<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.740> simulate<00:00:32.369> through<00:00:32.610> because

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
a moment to simulate through because

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.360 
a moment to simulate through because
what<00:00:33.059> i<00:00:33.120> want<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:34.230> my<00:00:34.440> cash<00:00:34.800> built

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
what i want to do is get my cash built

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.260 
what i want to do is get my cash built
up<00:00:35.520> here<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.820> my<00:00:35.850> timeline<00:00:37.760> okay<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.000> i'll<00:00:39.120> let

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
up here on my timeline okay so i'll let

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.030 
up here on my timeline okay so i'll let
this<00:00:39.360> simulate<00:00:39.780> through<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> about<00:00:40.260> frame<00:00:40.680> 80

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
this simulate through to about frame 80

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.760 
this simulate through to about frame 80
that<00:00:41.309> should<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.730> good<00:00:42.570> enough<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.469> once<00:00:43.680> i

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that should be good enough so once i

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.010 
that should be good enough so once i
have<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:43.950> set<00:00:44.309> i'll<00:00:45.120> go<00:00:45.300> ahead<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:45.840> just

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
have that set i'll go ahead and now just

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.100 
have that set i'll go ahead and now just
make<00:00:46.200> my<00:00:46.350> timeline<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.300> little<00:00:48.300> bit<00:00:48.390> shorter<00:00:48.719> so

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
make my timeline a little bit shorter so

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.330 
make my timeline a little bit shorter so
i'll<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.260> go<00:00:49.410> ahead<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.590> set<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> an<00:00:50.100> 80

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
i'll just go ahead and set it to an 80

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.250 
i'll just go ahead and set it to an 80
frame<00:00:50.640> durations<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.570> way<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.050> whole

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
frame durations that way that's my whole

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.430 
frame durations that way that's my whole
timeline<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.780> were<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:54.989> scrub<00:00:55.320> through

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
timeline so if we were to scrub through

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.660 
timeline so if we were to scrub through
this<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.280> cached

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
this you can see all the cached

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.430 
this you can see all the cached
information<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.510> has<00:00:57.809> been<00:00:57.840> written<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.379> as

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
information that has been written out as

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.500 
information that has been written out as
we<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.949> done<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> simulation<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.329> our

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
we have done the simulation so our

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
we have done the simulation so our
particles<00:01:00.930> mixing<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:01.949> our<00:01:02.039> particles

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
particles mixing we have our particles

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.560 
particles mixing we have our particles
that<00:01:02.489> are<00:01:02.579> being<00:01:02.730> killed<00:01:02.969> by<00:01:03.210> our<00:01:03.390> hidden

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that are being killed by our hidden

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.429 
that are being killed by our hidden
volume<00:01:04.409> demon<00:01:05.030> now<00:01:06.030> there<00:01:06.360> may<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.510> any<00:01:07.229> number

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
volume demon now there may be any number

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.410 
volume demon now there may be any number
of<00:01:07.680> situations<00:01:07.890> where<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:09.030> this

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
of situations where we have this

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.969 
of situations where we have this
information<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.110> has<00:01:10.320> now<00:01:10.500> been<00:01:10.710> simulated

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
information that has now been simulated

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.370 
information that has now been simulated
and<00:01:11.369> cashed<00:01:11.610> out<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.150> maybe<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.990> actually

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and cashed out and maybe we actually

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.649 
and cashed out and maybe we actually
want<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.979> keep<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.850> information<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.630> we

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
want to keep this information but we

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.760 
want to keep this information but we
still<00:01:15.960> want<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.320> able<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.530> come<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
still want to be able to come in and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.880 
still want to be able to come in and
perform<00:01:17.009> simulations<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.000> other<00:01:18.270> objects

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
perform simulations on other objects

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.260 
perform simulations on other objects
well<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.130> realflow<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.909> actually

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
well with in realflow we can actually

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.710 
well with in realflow we can actually
set<00:01:21.960> objects<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.680> either<00:01:22.950> re<00:01:23.820> simulate<00:01:24.240> every

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
set objects to either re simulate every

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.179 
set objects to either re simulate every
time<00:01:24.930> or<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.320> could<00:01:25.409> actually<00:01:25.590> tell<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
time or we could actually tell it to

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.280 
time or we could actually tell it to
just<00:01:26.400> go<00:01:26.520> ahead<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.759> continue<00:01:27.030> using<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
just go ahead and continue using this

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380 
just go ahead and continue using this
cached<00:01:28.710> data<00:01:29.009> every<00:01:29.670> time<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:30.000> try<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> re

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
cached data every time we try to re

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.469 
cached data every time we try to re
simulate<00:01:31.189> so<00:01:32.189> with<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.579> realflow<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.210> i<00:01:33.360> were

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
simulate so with in realflow if i were

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.670 
simulate so with in realflow if i were
to<00:01:33.570> say<00:01:34.250> like<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.479> little<00:01:37.350> yellow

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
to say like I have this little yellow

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
to say like I have this little yellow
emitter<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.820> these<00:01:38.909> yellow<00:01:39.180> particles

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
emitter here with these yellow particles

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.990 
emitter here with these yellow particles
let's<00:01:40.259> say<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> actually<00:01:40.799> am<00:01:41.220> pretty

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
let's say that I actually am pretty

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.219 
let's say that I actually am pretty
pleased<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.659> movement<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
like to come in and maybe make some

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
like to come in and maybe make some

adjustments to this set of blue

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.530 
adjustments to this set of blue

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
timeline this is signifying that this

the<00:02:31.290> next<00:02:31.530> time<00:02:31.650> we<00:02:31.800> set<00:02:31.950> up<00:02:32.040> our<00:02:32.160> simulation

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the next time we set up our simulation

the next time we set up our simulation
instead<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.360> will<00:02:33.540> rely<00:02:33.930> entirely<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:34.800> this

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
instead it will rely entirely on this

instead it will rely entirely on this
cached<00:02:35.820> information<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.590> now<00:02:37.890> if<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.520> were<00:02:38.640> to

cached information so now if I were to

cached information so now if I were to
commit<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.180> make<00:02:39.420> some<00:02:39.570> adjustments<00:02:40.020> to

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
commit it and make some adjustments to

commit it and make some adjustments to
this<00:02:40.200> circle<00:02:40.640> let's<00:02:41.640> say<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.910> increase<00:02:42.600> its

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
this circle let's say I increase its

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.970 
this circle let's say I increase its
resolution<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:44.209> let's<00:02:45.209> say<00:02:45.360> 10<00:02:45.830> just<00:02:46.830> for

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
resolution to let's say 10 just for

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.190 
resolution to let's say 10 just for
demonstration<00:02:47.130> sake<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.000> now<00:02:48.840> once<00:02:49.050> again

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200

demonstration sake and now once again
control<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.340> reset<00:02:50.910> my<00:02:51.060> timeline<00:02:51.480> looks

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
control a to reset my timeline looks

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.470 
control a to reset my timeline looks
like<00:02:52.410> everything<00:02:52.800> has<00:02:52.980> been<00:02:53.250> reset<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.330> now

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
like everything has been reset but now

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.380 
like everything has been reset but now
if<00:02:54.870> i<00:02:55.140> were<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.560> reset<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.610> simulation<00:02:57.150> let

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
if i were to reset the simulation let

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.380 
if i were to reset the simulation let
that<00:02:57.540> go<00:02:57.690> off<00:02:57.840> again<00:02:59.120> you<00:03:00.120> can<00:03:00.300> see<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:01.340> this

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
that go off again you can see that this

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.920 
that go off again you can see that this
square<00:03:03.390> emitter<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:03.900> actually<00:03:04.470> not<00:03:05.930> Reese

immolating itself at all instead it's
just<00:03:09.420> relying<00:03:10.050> purely<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.700> cached

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
just relying purely on that cached

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.610 
just relying purely on that cached

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
is something that can vary vary

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.979

significantly<00:03:20.070> speed<00:03:20.850> up<00:03:20.970> our<00:03:21.090> simulation<00:03:21.750> so

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
significantly speed up our simulation so

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.080 
significantly speed up our simulation so
if<00:03:22.140> we<00:03:22.290> had<00:03:22.470> things<00:03:22.769> like<00:03:22.860> rigid<00:03:23.400> bodies<00:03:23.700> or

then till real flow now every time we

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.990 
then till real flow now every time we
replay<00:03:40.019> just<00:03:40.260> reuse<00:03:41.100> that<00:03:41.280> same<00:03:41.640> cached

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
replay just reuse that same cached

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.370 
replay just reuse that same cached
information<00:03:42.570> instead<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.870> having<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.110> re

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
information instead of having to re

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.440 
information instead of having to re
simulate<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:43.860> all<00:03:44.160> over<00:03:44.250> again<00:03:44.580> then<00:03:45.209> we<00:03:45.330> can

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
simulate that all over again then we can

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.970 
simulate that all over again then we can
start<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.720> add<00:03:45.840> things<00:03:46.110> like<00:03:46.230> fluids<00:03:46.739> and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
start to add things like fluids and

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.660 
start to add things like fluids and
other<00:03:47.160> behaviors<00:03:47.670> directly<00:03:48.660> on<00:03:48.780> top<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.170> that

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
other behaviors directly on top of that

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.520 
other behaviors directly on top of that
so<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:51.630> thing<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:51.930> we<00:03:51.989> need<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.140> be<00:03:52.230> aware<00:03:52.470> of

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
so the thing that we need to be aware of

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.190 
so the thing that we need to be aware of
though<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.299> sometimes<00:03:54.299> this<00:03:54.420> can<00:03:54.690> become

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
though is that sometimes this can become

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.440 
though is that sometimes this can become
a<00:03:55.350> little<00:03:55.410> bit<00:03:55.650> confusing<00:03:56.100> as<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:57.090> few

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
a little bit confusing as a few

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.300 
a little bit confusing as a few
especially<00:03:57.989> if<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.200> set<00:03:58.500> an<00:03:58.620> object<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.010> maybe

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
especially if you set an object to maybe

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.000 
especially if you set an object to maybe
be<00:03:59.489> cached<00:03:59.820> but<00:04:00.540> maybe<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.170> accidentally

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
be cached but maybe you accidentally

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.090 
be cached but maybe you accidentally
forget<00:04:02.340> about<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:03.180> if<00:04:03.360> I<00:04:03.450> were<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.600> take<00:04:03.840> my

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
forget about it so if I were to take my

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.970 
forget about it so if I were to take my
cube<00:04:05.100> here<00:04:05.640> rather<00:04:05.820> my<00:04:06.030> square<00:04:06.360> emitter<00:04:06.600> and

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
cube here rather my square emitter and

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.229 
cube here rather my square emitter and
set<00:04:07.980> its<00:04:08.220> resolution<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:09.420> something<00:04:09.780> like<00:04:09.930> 10

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
set its resolution to something like 10

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.120 
set its resolution to something like 10
you<00:04:12.239> can<00:04:12.390> see<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.570> once<00:04:13.410> I<00:04:13.530> resim<00:04:13.920> you<00:04:14.010> late

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
you can see that once I resim you late

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.759 
you can see that once I resim you late
this<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.700> has<00:04:15.299> not<00:04:15.600> actually<00:04:15.930> updated

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
this it has not actually updated

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.500 
this it has not actually updated
anything<00:04:17.190> on<00:04:17.370> this<00:04:17.669> particular<00:04:17.850> emitter<00:04:18.299> you

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
anything on this particular emitter you

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.849 
anything on this particular emitter you
can<00:04:18.600> see<00:04:18.750> we<00:04:18.870> still<00:04:19.049> have<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.260> exact<00:04:19.680> same

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
can see we still have the exact same

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.010 
can see we still have the exact same
number<00:04:20.100> of<00:04:20.190> particles<00:04:20.609> compared<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.239> this

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
number of particles compared to this

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.170 
number of particles compared to this
event<00:04:22.169> over<00:04:22.530> here<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:23.550> keep<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:23.970> mind<00:04:24.150> that

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
event over here so keep in mind that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.820 
event over here so keep in mind that
because<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:24.720> object<00:04:25.110> is<00:04:25.169> set<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.560> cached

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
because this object is set to cached

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.800 
because this object is set to cached
that<00:04:26.400> none<00:04:26.789> of<00:04:26.820> these<00:04:27.030> changes<00:04:27.390> that<00:04:27.539> we

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
that none of these changes that we

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.540 
that none of these changes that we
we'll<00:04:28.139> have<00:04:28.350> any<00:04:28.650> influence<00:04:29.100> whatsoever

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
we'll have any influence whatsoever

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.210 
we'll have any influence whatsoever
because<00:04:30.150> again<00:04:30.780> this<00:04:31.200> is<00:04:31.410> all<00:04:31.440> just<00:04:31.919> reading

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
because again this is all just reading

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.550 
because again this is all just reading
the<00:04:32.340> stored<00:04:32.730> information<00:04:32.940> from<00:04:33.540> our<00:04:33.840> previous

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
the stored information from our previous

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.600 
the stored information from our previous
simulation<00:04:35.600> so<00:04:36.600> if<00:04:36.870> you<00:04:37.770> make<00:04:38.130> some<00:04:38.310> changes

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
simulation so if you make some changes

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.129 
simulation so if you make some changes
and<00:04:38.669> you<00:04:38.970> decide<00:04:39.389> to<00:04:39.570> actually<00:04:39.750> implement

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
and you decide to actually implement

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.050 
and you decide to actually implement
those<00:04:40.500> we<00:04:41.100> just<00:04:41.280> need<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:41.460> make<00:04:41.550> sure<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:41.790> now

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
those we just need to make sure that now

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.690 
those we just need to make sure that now
we<00:04:42.120> take<00:04:42.450> that<00:04:42.570> emitter<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.280> turn<00:04:44.280> its<00:04:44.460> cash

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
we take that emitter and turn its cash

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.030 
we take that emitter and turn its cash
off<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.360> instead<00:04:46.050> just<00:04:46.290> set<00:04:46.470> it<00:04:46.500> back<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.919> an

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
off and instead just set it back to an

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.850 
off and instead just set it back to an
active<00:04:47.460> simulation<00:04:48.110> now<00:04:49.110> we<00:04:49.169> can<00:04:49.440> actually<00:04:49.590> do

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
active simulation now we can actually do

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.640 
active simulation now we can actually do
this<00:04:50.010> now<00:04:50.250> in<00:04:50.490> realflow<00:04:50.790> 2012<00:04:51.750> with<00:04:52.380> these

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
this now in realflow 2012 with these

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.350 
this now in realflow 2012 with these
little<00:04:52.830> buttons<00:04:53.040> right<00:04:53.310> up<00:04:53.490> here<00:04:53.730> I<00:04:53.910> sort<00:04:54.300> of

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
little buttons right up here I sort of

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.960 
little buttons right up here I sort of
call<00:04:54.600> these<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.840> stoplight<00:04:55.770> buttons<00:04:56.639> we<00:04:56.790> have

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
call these the stoplight buttons we have

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.450 
call these the stoplight buttons we have
this<00:04:57.780> green<00:04:58.560> yellow<00:04:59.370> and<00:04:59.400> red<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.900> green<00:05:01.800> means

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
this green yellow and red so green means

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.150 
this green yellow and red so green means
this<00:05:02.639> object<00:05:03.000> will<00:05:03.120> be<00:05:03.210> active<00:05:03.690> if<00:05:03.870> I<00:05:04.770> set<00:05:05.070> it

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
this object will be active if I set it

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.730 
this object will be active if I set it
to<00:05:05.190> yellow<00:05:06.060> that's<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:06.900> same<00:05:07.229> as<00:05:07.260> setting<00:05:07.650> it

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
to yellow that's the same as setting it

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.200 
to yellow that's the same as setting it
to<00:05:07.860> a<00:05:07.889> cache<00:05:08.190> mode<00:05:08.400> again<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:08.820> can<00:05:08.970> see<00:05:09.000> that

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
to a cache mode again you can see that

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.570 
to a cache mode again you can see that
the<00:05:09.389> object<00:05:09.930> over<00:05:10.590> here<00:05:10.740> in<00:05:10.800> my<00:05:10.919> node<00:05:11.340> list

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
the object over here in my node list

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.850 
the object over here in my node list
turns<00:05:11.820> yellow<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:13.290> last<00:05:13.560> one<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:13.740> we

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
turns yellow and the last one that we

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.400 
turns yellow and the last one that we
have<00:05:14.070> is<00:05:14.250> inactive<00:05:14.940> so<00:05:15.600> if<00:05:15.720> I<00:05:15.810> set<00:05:16.020> an<00:05:16.110> object

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
have is inactive so if I set an object

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.640 
have is inactive so if I set an object
to<00:05:16.440> be<00:05:16.500> inactive<00:05:17.280> now<00:05:17.570> if<00:05:18.570> I<00:05:18.720> were<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:19.139> come<00:05:19.380> in

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
to be inactive now if I were to come in

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.830 
to be inactive now if I were to come in
and<00:05:19.970> reset<00:05:20.970> my<00:05:21.660> simulation<00:05:23.540> let<00:05:24.540> that<00:05:24.690> play

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
and reset my simulation let that play

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.190 
and reset my simulation let that play
through<00:05:25.139> you<00:05:25.770> can<00:05:25.919> see<00:05:26.070> this<00:05:26.900> emitter<00:05:27.900> right

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
through you can see this emitter right

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.080 
through you can see this emitter right
back<00:05:28.410> in<00:05:28.560> here<00:05:28.710> which<00:05:29.010> you<00:05:29.160> can<00:05:29.310> barely<00:05:29.669> see<00:05:30.000> at

back in here which you can barely see at

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.900 
back in here which you can barely see at
this<00:05:30.210> point<00:05:30.510> is<00:05:31.100> really<00:05:32.100> just<00:05:32.400> as<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.789> name

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
suggests completely inactive so this is

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.070 
suggests completely inactive so this is
actually<00:05:35.700> sort<00:05:35.880> of<00:05:35.910> a<00:05:36.000> useful<00:05:36.330> way<00:05:36.479> of<00:05:36.510> maybe

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
actually sort of a useful way of maybe

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.510 
actually sort of a useful way of maybe
having<00:05:37.320> a<00:05:37.560> couple<00:05:37.890> of<00:05:37.979> different<00:05:38.250> embitters

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
having a couple of different embitters

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.670 
having a couple of different embitters
set<00:05:38.700> up<00:05:38.789> in<00:05:38.880> your<00:05:38.970> scene<00:05:39.210> maybe<00:05:39.780> each<00:05:40.140> one<00:05:40.470> has

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
set up in your scene maybe each one has

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.529 
set up in your scene maybe each one has
slightly<00:05:41.130> different<00:05:41.580> settings<00:05:41.880> and<00:05:41.970> you<00:05:42.150> can

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
slightly different settings and you can

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.750 
slightly different settings and you can
now<00:05:42.750> turn<00:05:42.810> certain<00:05:43.590> hitters<00:05:43.740> on<00:05:44.070> or<00:05:44.400> often

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
now turn certain hitters on or often

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.300 
now turn certain hitters on or often
test<00:05:45.620> variations<00:05:46.620> in<00:05:46.770> your<00:05:46.890> settings<00:05:47.220> without

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
test variations in your settings without

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.570 
test variations in your settings without
having<00:05:47.760> to<00:05:47.880> worry<00:05:48.150> about<00:05:48.210> actually<00:05:48.810> losing<00:05:49.580> or

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
having to worry about actually losing or

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.860 
having to worry about actually losing or
having<00:05:50.820> to<00:05:50.910> remember<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.300> previous<00:05:51.600> settings

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
having to remember the previous settings

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.010 
having to remember the previous settings
in<00:05:52.140> other<00:05:52.410> remitters<00:05:52.740> and<00:05:52.919> things<00:05:53.039> like<00:05:53.160> that

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
in other remitters and things like that

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.240 
in other remitters and things like that
all<00:05:55.020> right<00:05:55.169> so<00:05:55.380> that's<00:05:55.590> a<00:05:55.650> look<00:05:55.800> at<00:05:55.979> how<00:05:56.100> we<00:05:56.160> can

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
all right so that's a look at how we can

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.180 
all right so that's a look at how we can
start<00:05:56.550> to<00:05:56.700> take<00:05:56.880> certain<00:05:57.810> bits<00:05:58.500> of<00:05:58.680> simulation

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
start to take certain bits of simulation

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.879 
start to take certain bits of simulation
information<00:05:59.639> and<00:05:59.789> then<00:06:00.360> actually<00:06:00.889> ensure

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
information and then actually ensure

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.800 
information and then actually ensure
that<00:06:02.100> that<00:06:02.280> information<00:06:02.669> is<00:06:03.000> retained<00:06:03.210> for

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
that that information is retained for

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.490 
that that information is retained for
any<00:06:04.080> previous<00:06:04.710> or<00:06:05.220> any<00:06:05.870> new<00:06:06.870> simulations<00:06:07.440> that

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
any previous or any new simulations that

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.910 
any previous or any new simulations that
we<00:06:07.650> perform<00:06:08.070> from<00:06:08.250> this<00:06:08.400> point<00:06:08.580> forward
