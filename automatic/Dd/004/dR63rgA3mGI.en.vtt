so<00:00:01.140> far<00:00:01.469> we've<00:00:01.800> really<00:00:02.280> been<00:00:02.429> focusing<00:00:03.090> on

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so far we've really been focusing on

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.019 
so far we've really been focusing on
developing<00:00:03.419> good<00:00:04.110> techniques<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:05.029> learning

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
developing good techniques and learning

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.550 
developing good techniques and learning
how<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.330> bring<00:00:06.690> all<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.870> these<00:00:07.170> different

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
how to bring all of these different

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.759 
how to bring all of these different
elements<00:00:08.010> together<00:00:09.139> hopefully<00:00:10.139> with

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
elements together hopefully with

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.860 
elements together hopefully with
practice<00:00:11.400> you've<00:00:11.730> seen<00:00:12.030> improvements<00:00:12.750> in

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
practice you've seen improvements in

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.900 
practice you've seen improvements in
your<00:00:12.900> own<00:00:13.200> technique<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.610> you're<00:00:14.790> now

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
your own technique and that you're now

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.240 
your own technique and that you're now
starting<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.660> feel<00:00:15.929> much<00:00:16.379> more<00:00:16.650> confident

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
starting to feel much more confident

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.760 
starting to feel much more confident
when<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.580> pick<00:00:17.760> up<00:00:17.789> your<00:00:18.090> base<00:00:18.770> please

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
when you pick up your base please

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.859 
when you pick up your base please
remember<00:00:20.130> though<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.730> your<00:00:21.180> overall

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
remember though that your overall

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.349 
remember though that your overall
technique<00:00:22.439> will<00:00:22.890> always<00:00:23.609> continue<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
technique will always continue to

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.529 
technique will always continue to
develop<00:00:24.779> as<00:00:25.170> long<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.279> continue<00:00:26.939> to

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
develop as long as you continue to

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.980 
develop as long as you continue to
challenge<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.340> so<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.210> motivational

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
challenge it so with the motivational

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.650 
challenge it so with the motivational
speech<00:00:31.289> over<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.890> now<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.090> introduce<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
speech over I now like to introduce you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.709 
speech over I now like to introduce you
to<00:00:34.079> our<00:00:34.110> next<00:00:34.620> area<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.040> study<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:36.149> world<00:00:36.450> of

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
to our next area of study the world of

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.350 
to our next area of study the world of
scales<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.440> why<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.219> personally<00:00:39.059> feel<00:00:39.300> that

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
scales and why I personally feel that

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.930 
scales and why I personally feel that
they're<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.050> fundamentally<00:00:41.010> important<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
they're so fundamentally important to

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.860 
they're so fundamentally important to
every<00:00:42.510> bass<00:00:42.719> player<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:44.390> scale<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.750> be

every bass player a scale can be

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.410 
every bass player a scale can be
described<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> series<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.219> notes<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:48.239> can

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
described as a series of notes that can

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.810 
described as a series of notes that can
be<00:00:48.510> played<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.780> sequence<00:00:49.469> either<00:00:50.129> ascending

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
be played in sequence either ascending

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.049 
be played in sequence either ascending
or<00:00:51.000> descending<00:00:51.199> in<00:00:52.199> pitch<00:00:52.550> when<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.640> comes<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
or descending in pitch when it comes to

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.569 
or descending in pitch when it comes to
playing<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.629> scale<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:55.500> typically<00:00:56.010> play<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
playing a scale we typically play the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.599 
playing a scale we typically play the
notes<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.059> order<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.579> starting<00:00:59.579> from

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
notes in order like this starting from

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.029 
notes in order like this starting from
the<00:00:59.850> lowest<00:01:00.000> pitch<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.660> ending<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the lowest pitch and ending on the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.210 
the lowest pitch and ending on the
highest

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.420 

but<00:01:06.880> we<00:01:07.510> can<00:01:07.690> also<00:01:07.960> pick<00:01:08.440> and<00:01:08.620> choose<00:01:08.860> any<00:01:09.160> of

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
but we can also pick and choose any of

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.880 
but we can also pick and choose any of
the<00:01:09.670> notes<00:01:09.880> from<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.240> scale<00:01:10.510> and<00:01:10.840> play<00:01:11.410> them<00:01:11.710> out

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
the notes from a scale and play them out

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.160 
the notes from a scale and play them out
of<00:01:11.950> their<00:01:12.520> original<00:01:12.850> sequence<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.840> create

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
of their original sequence to create

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.070 
of their original sequence to create
melodies<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:15.190> more<00:01:15.520> importantly<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.300> us<00:01:16.450> to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
melodies and more importantly to us to

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.270 
melodies and more importantly to us to
create<00:01:17.320> baselines<00:01:22.230> scales<00:01:23.230> differ<00:01:23.830> by

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
create baselines scales differ by

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.550 
create baselines scales differ by
containing<00:01:24.790> different<00:01:25.150> sequences<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.170> notes

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
containing different sequences of notes

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.340 
containing different sequences of notes
and<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:27.460> in<00:01:27.670> turn<00:01:27.700> gives<00:01:28.300> each<00:01:28.540> scale<00:01:28.990> its

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
and this in turn gives each scale its

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.940 
and this in turn gives each scale its
own<00:01:29.560> individual<00:01:30.280> sound<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:30.970> character<00:01:31.950> now

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
own individual sound and character now

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.700 
own individual sound and character now
with<00:01:33.250> time<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:34.000> focus<00:01:34.270> practice<00:01:35.050> we<00:01:35.530> can

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
with time and focus practice we can

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.340 
with time and focus practice we can
successfully<00:01:36.190> train<00:01:36.910> our<00:01:37.150> musical<00:01:37.660> ear<00:01:38.050> to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
successfully train our musical ear to

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.350 
successfully train our musical ear to
identify<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.220> sound<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.850> any<00:01:40.090> particular

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
identify the sound of any particular

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.680 
identify the sound of any particular
scale<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:42.130> example<00:01:42.160> you<00:01:42.820> might<00:01:43.450> have

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
scale for example you might have

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.359 
scale for example you might have
actually<00:01:43.840> recognizes<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.890> sound<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.280> the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
actually recognizes the sound of the

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.940 
actually recognizes the sound of the
scale<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:45.670> I've<00:01:45.940> just<00:01:46.180> been<00:01:46.300> using<00:01:46.720> so<00:01:47.380> to

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
scale that I've just been using so to

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.500 
scale that I've just been using so to
some<00:01:48.220> extent<00:01:48.610> you've<00:01:48.880> already<00:01:49.360> been

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
some extent you've already been

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.950 
some extent you've already been
developing<00:01:50.050> in<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.350> skill<00:01:50.880> now<00:01:51.960> hopefully

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
developing in this skill now hopefully

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.320 
developing in this skill now hopefully
I'm<00:01:53.170> sure<00:01:53.619> you<00:01:53.890> can<00:01:54.130> appreciate<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.790> just

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
I'm sure you can appreciate that just

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.600 
I'm sure you can appreciate that just
being<00:01:55.630> able<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:56.050> identify<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.740> sound<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.520> a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
being able to identify the sound of a

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.180 
being able to identify the sound of a
scale<00:01:57.910> isn't<00:01:58.509> really<00:01:59.080> all<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.320> useful<00:01:59.860> on

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
scale isn't really all that useful on

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.730 
scale isn't really all that useful on
its<00:02:00.340> own<00:02:00.550> it's<00:02:01.390> sort<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.810> like<00:02:01.960> saying<00:02:02.229> yep

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
its own it's sort of like saying yep

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.440 
its own it's sort of like saying yep
well<00:02:03.100> I've<00:02:03.190> heard<00:02:03.400> that<00:02:03.700> before<00:02:03.910> but<00:02:04.300> I

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
well I've heard that before but I

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.590 
well I've heard that before but I
haven't<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:05.050> clue<00:02:05.170> what<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.619> do<00:02:05.770> with<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.150> so<00:02:07.150> to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
haven't a clue what to do with it so to

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.960 
haven't a clue what to do with it so to
get<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.990> most<00:02:08.229> out<00:02:08.500> of<00:02:08.560> this<00:02:09.070> we<00:02:09.580> eventually

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
get the most out of this we eventually

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.330 
get the most out of this we eventually
need<00:02:10.570> to<00:02:10.780> start<00:02:11.050> linking<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.650> sound<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.250> a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
need to start linking the sound of a

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.390 
need to start linking the sound of a
scale<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.880> its<00:02:13.420> name<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.989> more<00:02:14.739> importantly

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400

we need to unlock it sound and then
learn<00:02:47.829> how<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.129> use<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.760> now<00:02:49.720> don't<00:02:50.470> go

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
learn how to use it now don't go
