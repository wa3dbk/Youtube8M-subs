00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
of this extreme Zephyr that I'm building

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.970 
of this extreme Zephyr that I'm building
here<00:00:16.150> it<00:00:17.150> is<00:00:17.360> the<00:00:18.050> z2<00:00:18.949> wing<00:00:19.369> set<00:00:19.810> with<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:21.289> zxl

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
here it is the z2 wing set with the zxl

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.189 
here it is the z2 wing set with the zxl
wing<00:00:22.789> tips<00:00:23.060> added<00:00:23.419> to<00:00:23.570> it<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:23.839> what's<00:00:24.050> nice

wing tips added to it and what's nice
about<00:00:24.259> the<00:00:24.619> zxl<00:00:25.130> wing<00:00:25.310> tips<00:00:25.550> is<00:00:25.929> you<00:00:26.929> can<00:00:27.140> cut

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
about the zxl wing tips is you can cut

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.460 
about the zxl wing tips is you can cut
them<00:00:27.470> down<00:00:27.650> to<00:00:27.710> size<00:00:27.859> to<00:00:28.400> make<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.880> z2<00:00:29.470> zxl

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
them down to size to make the z2 zxl

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.650 
them down to size to make the z2 zxl
whatever<00:00:31.429> you<00:00:31.609> end<00:00:31.640> up<00:00:31.849> wanting<00:00:32.090> to<00:00:32.240> do<00:00:32.419> I'm

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
calling this one the zxr because it's

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.730 
calling this one the zxr because it's
kind<00:00:35.210> of<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:36.370> gonna<00:00:37.370> be<00:00:37.460> built<00:00:37.760> for<00:00:37.910> speed<00:00:38.060> and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
kind of a gonna be built for speed and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.930 
kind of a gonna be built for speed and
flying<00:00:39.740> heavy<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.220> putting<00:00:40.490> a<00:00:40.520> bigger<00:00:40.670> motor

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940

so<00:00:42.950> what<00:00:43.580> I've<00:00:43.700> done<00:00:43.930> is<00:00:44.930> I've<00:00:45.110> taken<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.530> wing

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
so what I've done is I've taken the wing

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.630 
so what I've done is I've taken the wing
tips<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:47.210> I've<00:00:47.330> cut<00:00:47.600> that<00:00:47.780> much<00:00:47.960> off<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:48.860> you

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
tips and I've cut that much off and you

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.640 
tips and I've cut that much off and you
can<00:00:49.760> see<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.120> standard<00:00:50.510> spar<00:00:50.840> slot<00:00:51.170> at<00:00:51.380> the

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
can see the standard spar slot at the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.940 
can see the standard spar slot at the
top<00:00:51.830> there<00:00:52.130> what<00:00:52.970> I've<00:00:53.090> done<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:53.630> added<00:00:54.530> a

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
top there what I've done is added a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.360 
top there what I've done is added a
secondary<00:00:55.550> spar<00:00:55.940> one<00:00:56.360> inch<00:00:56.570> below<00:00:56.810> it<00:00:57.370> same

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
secondary spar one inch below it same

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.190 
secondary spar one inch below it same
spot<00:00:58.700> and<00:00:58.940> I<00:00:59.030> did<00:00:59.240> that<00:00:59.450> at<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.600> st.<00:00:59.990> because

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
spot and I did that at the st. because

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.890 
spot and I did that at the st. because

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.679 
there's the standard spot what I did is
add<00:01:03.080> one<00:01:03.290> just<00:01:03.590> below<00:01:03.740> it<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:05.089> I<00:01:05.210> extended

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
add one just below it and I extended

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:06.910 
add one just below it and I extended
them<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:05.900> little<00:01:06.140> bit<00:01:06.229> farther<00:01:06.500> into<00:01:06.770> the

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
them a little bit farther into the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.440

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
is that same spar there that new one I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.219

on the bottom of the wing I've also
added<00:01:15.649> a<00:01:16.100> piece<00:01:16.340> of<00:01:17.890> fiberglass<00:01:18.890> strip<00:01:19.399> spar

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
added a piece of fiberglass strip spar

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.770 
added a piece of fiberglass strip spar
on<00:01:20.590> top<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.070> main<00:01:22.310> spars<00:01:22.819> instead<00:01:23.600> of<00:01:23.689> in

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
on top of the main spars instead of in

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.779 
on top of the main spars instead of in
the<00:01:23.840> bottom<00:01:24.109> of<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.259> wing<00:01:24.380> I<00:01:24.649> added<00:01:25.310> one<00:01:25.460> just

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
the bottom of the wing I added one just

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.300 
the bottom of the wing I added one just
on<00:01:25.999> top<00:01:26.210> of<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.450> main<00:01:26.689> spars<00:01:27.079> and<00:01:27.829> when<00:01:28.039> I<00:01:28.069> did

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
on top of the main spars and when I did

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.819 
on top of the main spars and when I did
that<00:01:28.340> I<00:01:28.759> threw<00:01:29.179> a<00:01:29.240> 24-inch<00:01:29.810> turbo<00:01:30.259> extension

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
that I threw a 24-inch turbo extension

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.669 
that I threw a 24-inch turbo extension
in<00:01:30.979> on<00:01:31.130> top<00:01:31.399> so<00:01:31.609> I<00:01:31.670> can<00:01:31.880> feed<00:01:32.240> my<00:01:32.780> ppm<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.530> my

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
in on top so I can feed my ppm to my

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.160 
in on top so I can feed my ppm to my
dragon<00:01:34.039> link<00:01:34.219> and<00:01:34.429> then<00:01:34.939> also<00:01:35.420> get<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:35.990> feed

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
dragon link and then also get the feed

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.620 
dragon link and then also get the feed
from<00:01:36.350> my<00:01:36.560> video<00:01:37.219> transmitter<00:01:37.819> here<00:01:38.420> on<00:01:38.539> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
from my video transmitter here on the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.899 
from my video transmitter here on the
other<00:01:38.719> side<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:39.409> I<00:01:39.619> threw<00:01:40.039> that<00:01:40.069> in<00:01:40.369> on<00:01:40.520> top<00:01:40.789> of

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
other side so I threw that in on top of

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.120 
other side so I threw that in on top of
it<00:01:41.030> after<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.359> see<00:01:41.569> a<00:01:41.600> that<00:01:41.899> in<00:01:42.109> and<00:01:42.679> then<00:01:42.859> I<00:01:42.950> went

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
it after I see a that in and then I went

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.309 
it after I see a that in and then I went
through<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.549> drip<00:01:43.939> some<00:01:44.149> gorilla<00:01:44.869> glue<00:01:45.109> down

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
through and drip some gorilla glue down

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.319 
through and drip some gorilla glue down
into<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.710> slot<00:01:46.009> but<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.819> goes<00:01:46.969> right<00:01:47.270> over

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
into that slot but it goes right over

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.139 
into that slot but it goes right over
the<00:01:47.539> top<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:47.810> then<00:01:48.170> over<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.679> firewall<00:01:49.219> in

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
the top and then over the firewall in

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.489 
the top and then over the firewall in
between<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.600> base<00:01:50.749> I<00:01:51.049> did<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.289> same<00:01:51.439> thing

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 
between the base I did the same thing

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:54.849 
between the base I did the same thing
again<00:01:51.950> I<00:01:52.130> dropped<00:01:52.850> another<00:01:53.209> spar<00:01:53.859> directly

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
again I dropped another spar directly

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.440 
again I dropped another spar directly
over<00:01:55.069> that<00:01:55.100> firewall<00:01:55.639> and<00:01:55.939> I<00:01:56.030> did<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.299> same

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
over that firewall and I did the same

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.279 
over that firewall and I did the same
thing<00:01:56.509> on<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.929> bottom

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
thing on the bottom

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.569 
thing on the bottom
since<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:57.709> thing's<00:01:57.979> going<00:01:58.189> to<00:01:58.249> be<00:01:58.369> hauling

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.120 
some nice nice internal Center strength
same<00:02:05.869> with<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.139> side<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.590> went<00:02:06.859> through<00:02:06.979> and

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.859 
same with this side I went through and
added<00:02:07.340> that<00:02:07.459> secondary<00:02:07.939> spar<00:02:08.300> on<00:02:08.450> here

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
added that secondary spar on here

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.480 
added that secondary spar on here
I<00:02:08.899> moved<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.590> servos<00:02:09.950> out<00:02:10.130> from<00:02:10.340> their

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
I moved the servos out from their

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.300 
I moved the servos out from their
standard<00:02:10.940> slot<00:02:11.240> all<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.530> way<00:02:12.650> out<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:13.190> where

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
standard slot all the way out to where

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.479 
standard slot all the way out to where
they<00:02:13.490> just<00:02:13.760> clear<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.620> spar<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.159> I<00:02:16.189> had<00:02:16.370> to

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
they just clear the spar so I had to

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.030 
they just clear the spar so I had to
bring<00:02:16.610> them<00:02:16.730> up<00:02:16.909> about<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.209> third

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
bring them up about a third

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.410 
bring them up about a third
and<00:02:18.159> put<00:02:18.579> them<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.849> leading<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.329> know

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
and put them in the leading you know

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.699 
and put them in the leading you know
right<00:02:19.659> up<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.989> leading<00:02:20.170> your<00:02:20.319> hands<00:02:20.469> in

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
right up in the leading your hands in

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.490 
right up in the leading your hands in
front<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.390> taking<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:23.140> look<00:02:23.319> at

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
front of that so just taking a look at

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.380 
front of that so just taking a look at
it<00:02:23.680> basically<00:02:24.099> also<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.489> all's<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.849> do<00:02:24.909> to<00:02:25.120> move

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
it basically also you all's I do to move

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.410 
it basically also you all's I do to move
it<00:02:25.540> over<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:25.840> enough<00:02:26.549> to<00:02:27.549> get<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.879> just<00:02:28.239> on

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
it over just enough to get it just on

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.209 
it over just enough to get it just on
that<00:02:28.599> side<00:02:29.519> when<00:02:30.519> I<00:02:30.549> did<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.909> I<00:02:31.120> bored<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.599> hole

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
that side when I did that I bored a hole

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:37.589 
that side when I did that I bored a hole
through<00:02:33.219> there<00:02:34.200> with<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.230> hot<00:02:35.530> poker<00:02:35.769> in<00:02:36.599> here

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.630 
through there with a hot poker in here
and<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.840> ran<00:02:37.989> my<00:02:38.170> servo<00:02:38.470> wires<00:02:38.769> in<00:02:39.099> and<00:02:39.400> through

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
and I ran my servo wires in and through

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.330 
and I ran my servo wires in and through
there<00:02:39.879> all<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.720> way<00:02:40.810> out<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:42.189> outer

there all the way out to it the outer

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.520 
there all the way out to it the outer
servo<00:02:42.819> slots<00:02:43.120> I've<00:02:43.629> just<00:02:44.079> filled<00:02:44.349> them<00:02:44.409> in

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
servo slots I've just filled them in

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.960 
servo slots I've just filled them in
with<00:02:44.590> PU<00:02:44.980> I'm<00:02:45.159> gonna<00:02:45.340> go<00:02:45.489> ahead<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:45.760> run<00:02:45.939> some

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
with PU I'm gonna go ahead and run some

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.080 
with PU I'm gonna go ahead and run some
spackle<00:02:46.420> over<00:02:47.260> everything<00:02:47.709> now<00:02:48.069> all<00:02:48.370> over<00:02:48.430> the

spackle over everything now all over the
the<00:02:49.420> regular<00:02:49.780> slots<00:02:50.370> over<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.639> joints<00:02:52.060> where

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
the regular slots over the joints where

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.289 
the regular slots over the joints where
the<00:02:52.239> wings<00:02:52.480> join<00:02:53.760> I've<00:02:54.760> given<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.180> good

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
the wings join I've given it a good

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.000 
the wings join I've given it a good
sanding<00:02:55.750> now<00:02:55.870> it's<00:02:56.019> time<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.349> do<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.500> spackle

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
sanding now it's time to do a spackle

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.670 
sanding now it's time to do a spackle
job<00:02:57.159> on<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.540> on<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.780> inside<00:02:59.109> you<00:02:59.230> can<00:02:59.290> see<00:02:59.409> I've

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
job on it on the inside you can see I've

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.979 
job on it on the inside you can see I've
cut<00:02:59.950> these<00:03:00.099> in<00:03:00.310> quite<00:03:00.609> quite<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.180> far<00:03:01.510> distance

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
cut these in quite quite a far distance

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.020 
cut these in quite quite a far distance
on<00:03:02.139> both<00:03:02.169> sides<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:03.010> we<00:03:03.129> can<00:03:03.280> fit<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.489> Ruby<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
on both sides so we can fit the Ruby the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.809 
on both sides so we can fit the Ruby the
voltage<00:03:04.329> regulators<00:03:05.280> any<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.579> flight

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
voltage regulators any of the flight

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.250 
voltage regulators any of the flight
gear<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.299> might<00:03:07.480> want<00:03:07.659> to<00:03:07.720> put<00:03:07.900> in<00:03:08.019> there

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
gear that you might want to put in there

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.229 
gear that you might want to put in there
and<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.799> did<00:03:08.980> that<00:03:09.129> prior<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.489> gluing<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.060> wing

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
and I did that prior to gluing the wing

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.240 
and I did that prior to gluing the wing
halves<00:03:10.480> together<00:03:10.750> I'll<00:03:11.560> give<00:03:11.859> you<00:03:11.950> guys<00:03:12.069> some

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
halves together I'll give you guys some

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.289 
halves together I'll give you guys some
pictures<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:13.560> some<00:03:14.669> video<00:03:15.669> here<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.150> can

see a little bit everything in the same
on<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.159> bottom<00:03:18.280> I'd<00:03:18.970> added<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.419> spar<00:03:19.750> like<00:03:19.780> I

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
on the bottom I'd added that spar like I

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.640 
on the bottom I'd added that spar like I
was<00:03:20.169> saying<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.180> direct<00:03:22.479> spot<00:03:22.780> over<00:03:23.620> I

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
was saying in the direct spot over I

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.770 
was saying in the direct spot over I
mean<00:03:24.030> opposing<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.150> spar<00:03:25.419> that's<00:03:25.599> on<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
mean opposing that spar that's on the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.390 
mean opposing that spar that's on the
top<00:03:27.329> regular<00:03:28.329> mains<00:03:28.569> put<00:03:29.079> them<00:03:29.169> in<00:03:29.310> then<00:03:30.310> I

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
top regular mains put them in then I

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.550 
top regular mains put them in then I
added<00:03:30.609> this<00:03:30.970> one<00:03:31.120> here<00:03:31.359> in<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.840> center<00:03:32.139> just

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
added this one here in the center just

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.189 
added this one here in the center just
over<00:03:32.829> that<00:03:32.949> firewall<00:03:33.430> one<00:03:33.699> that's<00:03:34.449> on<00:03:34.989> the

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
over that firewall one that's on the

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.689 
over that firewall one that's on the
other<00:03:35.349> side<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.680> wing<00:03:35.829> create<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.579> little

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
other side of the wing create a little

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.460 
other side of the wing create a little
flex<00:03:36.970> down<00:03:37.120> plus<00:03:37.359> I've<00:03:37.569> also<00:03:37.750> extended<00:03:38.349> these

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
flex down plus I've also extended these

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.740 
flex down plus I've also extended these
spars<00:03:38.849> and<00:03:39.849> melted<00:03:40.209> them<00:03:40.299> down<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.479> little<00:03:40.599> bit

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
spars and melted them down a little bit

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.409 
spars and melted them down a little bit
deeper<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:41.199> extended<00:03:42.069> them<00:03:42.220> over<00:03:42.699> and<00:03:42.970> under

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
deeper I extended them over and under

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.199 
deeper I extended them over and under
over<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.739> main<00:03:45.639> part<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.269> battery<00:03:47.229> area
