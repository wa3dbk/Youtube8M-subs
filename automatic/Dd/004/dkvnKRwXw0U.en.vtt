00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.340
 from Switzerland 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.560
 but under the guiding threat 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.560
 not only of hill but also of roberti that has passed 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.559
 badini and who feels push wings robert pestle with leave to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.799
 outside these kids little bit violent 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.509
 that said if you come see bruno 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.300
 Italian was already very hot 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.069
 he managed to manage himself 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.849
 at the end of the first round 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.849
 it is excessively fast 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.089
 do you convert with lille 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.510
 for last year indeed ceased while 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.590
 as for him exceeded 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.080
 the line that dislodges tony is the time of the third place 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.940
 precisely the Swiss 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.980
 Milan loses positions 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.970
 the sahwa inflicted his two teammates to try to put it back together 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.980
 Coffee 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.460
 but probably not much faster than him 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.050
 it will be necessary to wait for the last part 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.050
 to hope you have to alternate schnerb 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 catch up a little late 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.460
 police and their stage races 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.460
 quite some time 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.830
 while being the whole country besides 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.229
 well this time it's definitely over 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.130
 unless we manage to get out of the gravel trap in any case for a 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.690
 good result 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.970
 for this one and the same damn 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.980
 in short, we will defend in the smile 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.980
 a bit incomprehensible 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.570
 it already makes me 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.570
 a car from me anyway for the win and when we know that m 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630
 that of one of the Barthes years left in last position 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.150
 well, it's going to be very complicated 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.750
 for the times that will give to obtain a good result even if the consoling 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.190
 These hazel gabart can always go up 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.310
 the dollar just back in first place 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.740
 it may be a little bit violent 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.290
 led a penalty only penalty that's very important obviously a 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.850
 drive through for mater to mobile 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.240
 it is estimated that he stole the departure 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.020
 it's true that at the moment 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.870
 where he shows up on the line 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.090
 there is the ferrari seems to me abortion is coming off 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.179
 that's it he'll be able to leave 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.359
 ferrari was already in season 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:16.519
 saline 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.519
 we see the toupin are converted who was on the brink of disaster 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:22.439
 the 3 4 5 6 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.439
 toni sailer time here I am trying to go to the pits 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.639
 and it looks like it looks good 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.619
 but obviously it will probably have to return 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.869
 toni sailer the euro - to check if there were any stations 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:40.099
 if tricks concluded which bobby in mind before remy best of himself 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.699
 converted badini and more 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.499
 not for a saleen in the middle of sacred harry 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.109
 but so mateo bobby who will have to purge 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.519
 relief 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.849
 which may well make him lose command even though he has already dug 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.849
 a nice Italian gap 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.709
 for once he was 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.179
 obviously in front of the saleen to debate and that 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.879
 this forbidden 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.379
 not frankly 27 to messi 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.939
 the Italian world champion in the title Milky Way 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.179
 Sunday at the stadium 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.449
 one will do that pass but it is sure he will lose his head since 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.449
 you have previewed to the far left of your screen 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.069
 it's already crossing the line 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.279
 louis gardel who sees his 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:31.539
 teammates 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.979
 by saying to himself without a doubt it's a shame here he is taking the track 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.189
 she must be 5 or 6e fabrizio of himself 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.429
 the driver in fifth position 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:46.259
 26 laps completed 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.029
 and already a refueling 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:53.019
 mopped barthel cebit alzen tablecloth they opted for a 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.849
 the strategy of three refuelings 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.819
 we need two to some of their competitors 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.989
 the idea being obviously to be lighter 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.159
 we will try to regain a maximum of time here is where we will get them to -5 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.909
 to the word 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.009
 you have a problem 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.009
 with gasoline 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:17.009
 we talked on the radio 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.259
 it's a job we've missed a strategy three stops 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.759
 hatchet magnard menaka 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.729
 was doing well 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.860
 we wanted when I came back to give up driving from those 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.349
 dna data 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.349
 Michel Barthès has left 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.150
 if I did see that two other imax halls these are the same victims of 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.960
 rémada auxerre 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.270
 after 32 laps and nîmes guard and command in front of his goal
