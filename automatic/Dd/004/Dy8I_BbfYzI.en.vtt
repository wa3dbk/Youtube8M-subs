00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.490
 Do you also know the tiresome problem you 

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.929
 put your mobile phone on the table 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.910
 or connected to the outlet and 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.349
 to charge the battery a notification 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.389
 but do not know that you are her 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.250
 have received why because your display 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.720
 that does not show you there are at 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.910
 samsung galaxy s 4 course the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.420
 possibility of the led notified 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.950
 to prove 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.510
 you can see that on the outside 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.190
 Display a notification 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.530
 received, unfortunately, but that is at 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.170
 my device at the lgp 880 not so 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.089
 but what I do with no load change now 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.609
 can 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:37.649
 the emergency can google places for free 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.690
 Download is ready for all devices 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.190
 or android devices 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.620
 and you can see it from the rating 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.499
 It has 43 points on average 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.989
 that it is a very reliable and 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:55.499
 good result how does this work 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.149
 Let us further see the way of functioning of the 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.649
 apps is actually quite simple when 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.649
 always we receive a notification 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.759
 Now we get a symbol 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.320
 on our display we see that 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.299
 At any time we will be on ours 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.680
 display are immediately informed 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.340
 that we receive a notification 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.500
 to have 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.479
 the attitudes are actually right 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.299
 Simple one can, for example, at any time 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.920
 on and off otherwise we have 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.530
 Here is a small overview of all 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.299
 tools we can click on immediately 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.140
 among other things load shows what I 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.579
 can highly recommend 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.990
 because when we get our device on stream 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.310
 be connected on the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.420
 display informs about this for example 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.810
 The battery is charged 100 percent 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.549
 In addition, we also have the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.340
 possibility to pick us whether we for 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.659
 example about symbols or dots about 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.020
 be notified 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.820
 want 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.590
 We can still color the dots 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.850
 adjust at any time red yellow and blue 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.009
 as well as we want 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.929
 Personally, of course I am for 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.399
 the symbols decided that has that 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.170
 advantage that currently with a 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.340
 Look at the display where I see the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.860
 have also received notification 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 even facebook 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.400
 what else do we have here yet 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.050
 The option will be monitored sms 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.240
 I've disfigure like facebook percent 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.010
 e mail what my favorite apps are 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.570
 otherwise with a click on the plus 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.690
 we can also do others at any time 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.210
 set apps temporarily informs 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.350
 should be where she must have we 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.820
 For example, the advantage we can here 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.230
 Set how large the symbols 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.310
 should standard means big but still 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.880
 bigger you also have the possibility 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.020
 to install at another to the app 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.090
 individually adapt 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.920
 otherwise we have a big one, of course 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.750
 operate a variety of settings 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.820
 or notification by tone 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.410
 the settings options to yourself 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.120
 of course huge what they highly recommend 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.800
 good is that i here that this 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.450
 tutorial takes a closer look 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.100
 These are very many things described 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.290
 and explains how the function of the 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.640
 otherwise I wish you much fun 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.350
