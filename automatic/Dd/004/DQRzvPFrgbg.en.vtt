Tommy<00:02:56.870> Cooper<00:02:57.139> one<00:02:58.069> night<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.340> was<00:02:58.700> sitting

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
Tommy Cooper one night I was sitting

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.949 
Tommy Cooper one night I was sitting
alone<00:02:59.180> in<00:02:59.420> my<00:02:59.810> room<00:03:00.650> at<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.459> hotel<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.299> I<00:03:02.720> was

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
alone in my room at the hotel and I was

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.599 
alone in my room at the hotel and I was
watching<00:03:03.139> a<00:03:03.440> television<00:03:03.590> show<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.340> think

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
watching a television show and I think

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.069 
watching a television show and I think
one<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.970> strangest<00:03:05.389> things<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.870> world

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
one of the strangest things in the world

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.319 
one of the strangest things in the world
is<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.650> laugh<00:03:06.920> when<00:03:07.250> you're<00:03:07.400> all<00:03:07.609> alone<00:03:07.639> out

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
is to laugh when you're all alone out

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.190 
is to laugh when you're all alone out
loud<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.870> think<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.560> really<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.780> example<00:03:11.780> of

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
loud I think it really is a example of

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.530 
loud I think it really is a example of
really<00:03:12.650> thinking<00:03:13.040> something<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.579> funny<00:03:13.910> so

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540

gonna<00:05:15.240> get<00:05:15.449> boring<00:05:17.120> then<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.270> subject<00:05:18.479> is

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:18.689 
gonna get boring then the subject is

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:21.379 
gonna get boring then the subject is
keeping<00:05:19.080> my<00:05:19.199> figure<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:20.699> have<00:05:20.939> 60

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389

seconds<00:05:21.749> starting<00:05:22.319> now<00:05:22.379> I<00:05:22.830> think<00:05:22.919> keeping

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
seconds starting now I think keeping

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.129 
seconds starting now I think keeping
your<00:05:23.550> figure<00:05:23.969> is<00:05:23.999> very<00:05:24.419> important<00:05:24.990> but

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
your figure is very important but

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.040 
your figure is very important but

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:41.939 
subject you can you can't we were then I

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:50.749 
subject you can you can't we were then I
got<00:05:42.150> two<00:05:42.449> laughs<00:05:42.779> and<00:05:43.139> you're<00:05:43.259> mad<00:05:43.439> at<00:05:43.650> me<00:05:49.759> you

got more than two Elaine and you've got
another<00:05:52.830> point<00:05:53.159> for<00:05:53.400> an<00:05:53.460> incorrect<00:05:53.699> challenge

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
another point for an incorrect challenge

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.629 
another point for an incorrect challenge
so<00:05:55.050> mean<00:05:55.439> you've<00:05:55.710> only<00:05:55.740> been<00:05:56.009> going<00:05:56.219> for<00:05:56.370> two

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
so mean you've only been going for two

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.269 
so mean you've only been going for two
seconds<00:05:57.089> you<00:05:57.569> have<00:05:57.810> 58<00:05:58.169> seconds<00:05:58.680> to<00:05:58.830> continue

00:05:59.269 --> 00:05:59.279 
seconds you have 58 seconds to continue

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.909 
seconds you have 58 seconds to continue
on<00:05:59.399> keeping<00:05:59.849> my<00:06:00.000> figure<00:06:00.330> starting<00:06:00.899> now<00:06:01.139> is<00:06:01.860> I

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
on keeping my figure starting now is I

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.860 
on keeping my figure starting now is I
think<00:06:02.250> the<00:06:02.789> most<00:06:02.939> important<00:06:03.539> thing<00:06:03.689> in<00:06:03.779> the

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
think the most important thing in the

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.740 
think the most important thing in the
world<00:06:03.949> not<00:06:04.949> only<00:06:05.009> for<00:06:05.370> a<00:06:05.639> man<00:06:05.969> I<00:06:06.300> mean<00:06:06.539> a<00:06:06.569> woman

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
world not only for a man I mean a woman

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.920 
world not only for a man I mean a woman
like<00:06:07.110> myself<00:06:07.379> but<00:06:07.860> for<00:06:08.159> four<00:06:08.550> men<00:06:08.819> when<00:06:09.750> I<00:06:09.779> was

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
like myself but for four men when I was

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.839 
like myself but for four men when I was
growing<00:06:10.770> up<00:06:10.919> I<00:06:11.159> think<00:06:11.219> it<00:06:11.460> was<00:06:11.580> one<00:06:11.699> of<00:06:11.729> the

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
growing up I think it was one of the

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:13.459 
growing up I think it was one of the
most<00:06:12.000> important<00:06:12.539> things<00:06:12.750> in<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:12.960> world<00:06:13.110> to<00:06:13.259> me

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:13.469 
most important things in the world to me

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.800 
most important things in the world to me
to<00:06:13.500> be<00:06:13.770> thin<00:06:14.069> I<00:06:14.279> was<00:06:14.460> almost<00:06:14.759> to<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.389> point<00:06:15.569> of

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
to be thin I was almost to the point of

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.079 
to be thin I was almost to the point of
anorexia<00:06:16.529> because<00:06:16.979> I<00:06:17.250> wanted<00:06:17.789> to<00:06:17.879> be<00:06:18.000> an

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.089 
anorexia because I wanted to be an

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:20.450 
anorexia because I wanted to be an
actress<00:06:18.509> and<00:06:18.629> I<00:06:18.899> thought<00:06:19.439> that<00:06:19.680> all<00:06:19.710> actresses

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
actress and I thought that all actresses

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.550 
actress and I thought that all actresses
had<00:06:20.639> to<00:06:20.789> be<00:06:20.909> very<00:06:21.210> very<00:06:21.449> thin<00:06:21.870> because<00:06:22.080> someone

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
had to be very very thin because someone

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.899 
had to be very very thin because someone
told<00:06:22.770> me<00:06:22.919> once<00:06:22.949> that<00:06:23.219> when<00:06:23.399> you<00:06:23.490> went<00:06:23.669> on<00:06:23.759> the

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
told me once that when you went on the

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:25.149 
told me once that when you went on the
screen<00:06:24.180> you<00:06:24.389> put<00:06:24.599> on<00:06:24.689> 10<00:06:24.990> pounds

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
screen you put on 10 pounds

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.079 
screen you put on 10 pounds
automatically<00:06:26.159> whether<00:06:26.339> you<00:06:26.580> weighed<00:06:26.819> more

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:27.089 
automatically whether you weighed more

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.719 
automatically whether you weighed more
more<00:06:27.629> than<00:06:27.839> that<00:06:28.050> or<00:06:28.289> whether<00:06:28.529> you<00:06:29.099> didn't<00:06:29.520> and

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
more than that or whether you didn't and

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.670 
more than that or whether you didn't and
so<00:06:30.300> when<00:06:30.509> I<00:06:30.629> don't<00:06:30.960> do<00:06:31.139> this<00:06:31.289> to<00:06:31.529> me<00:06:31.649> again

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
so when I don't do this to me again

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.920 
so when I don't do this to me again
because

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.530 

if<00:06:35.320> I<00:06:35.530> don't<00:06:35.740> play<00:06:35.979> one<00:06:36.310> shot<00:06:36.669> at<00:06:36.850> this<00:06:37.000> gun<00:06:37.240> oh

really found out the absolute causes for

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.620 
really found out the absolute causes for
putting<00:06:45.280> on<00:06:45.460> weight<00:06:45.699> they<00:06:45.940> really<00:06:46.300> began<00:06:46.570> to

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
putting on weight they really began to

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.080 
putting on weight they really began to
bore<00:06:46.990> me<00:06:47.169> as<00:06:47.320> I<00:06:47.500> got<00:06:47.710> older<00:06:47.740> because<00:06:48.250> I<00:06:48.550> used<00:06:48.970> to
