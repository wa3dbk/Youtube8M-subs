just this car and four figures cost

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.370 
just this car and four figures cost
about<00:00:18.800> $50<00:00:19.460> which<00:00:19.700> is<00:00:20.000> a<00:00:20.270> little<00:00:20.660> high<00:00:20.870> but<00:00:21.320> I

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
about $50 which is a little high but I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.680 
about $50 which is a little high but I
guess<00:00:21.710> it<00:00:21.890> should<00:00:22.070> be<00:00:22.160> expected<00:00:22.520> from<00:00:22.910> Lego

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
guess it should be expected from Lego

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.220 
guess it should be expected from Lego

so before we take a look at the figures

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.940 
so before we take a look at the figures
I<00:01:13.420> did<00:01:13.600> want<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.990> actually<00:01:14.140> show<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:14.590> the

things<00:01:32.350> at<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.679> back<00:01:34.259> somewhere<00:01:35.259> in<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.500> back

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
here it talks about the designer Brent

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.929 
here it talks about the designer Brent
Waller<00:01:39.969> even<00:01:40.539> though<00:01:40.689> I<00:01:41.610> truly<00:01:42.610> don't<00:01:42.759> think

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
Waller even though I truly don't think

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.520 
Waller even though I truly don't think
Brent<00:01:43.360> Waller<00:01:43.569> should<00:01:43.899> have<00:01:44.020> received<00:01:44.319> all

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
Brent Waller should have received all

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.350 
Brent Waller should have received all
the<00:01:44.679> credit<00:01:44.979> for<00:01:45.189> it<00:01:45.250> since<00:01:45.610> there<00:01:46.209> was

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
the credit for it since there was

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.039 
the credit for it since there was
another<00:01:46.630> guy<00:01:46.899> named<00:01:47.349> TK<00:01:47.819> who<00:01:48.819> actually<00:01:49.450> posted

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
another guy named TK who actually posted

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.260 
another guy named TK who actually posted
pretty<00:01:50.799> much<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.159> exact<00:01:51.489> same<00:01:51.520> project

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
pretty much the exact same project

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.510 
pretty much the exact same project
before<00:01:53.129> Brent<00:01:54.129> Waller

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
before Brent Waller

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.600 
before Brent Waller
but<00:01:54.939> he<00:01:55.119> received<00:01:55.420> no<00:01:55.659> credit<00:01:56.049> so<00:01:56.500> I<00:01:56.829> will<00:01:57.429> give

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
but he received no credit so I will give

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.819 
but he received no credit so I will give
TK<00:01:58.179> credit<00:01:58.569> in<00:01:58.689> my<00:01:58.899> review<00:01:59.289> because<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.679> think

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
TK credit in my review because I think

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.839 
TK credit in my review because I think
this<00:02:00.250> was<00:02:00.810> initially<00:02:01.810> his<00:02:02.439> idea<00:02:02.799> but<00:02:03.219> anyway

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
this was initially his idea but anyway

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.779 
this was initially his idea but anyway
and<00:02:04.239> first<00:02:04.899> up<00:02:05.170> for<00:02:05.590> your<00:02:05.770> mini<00:02:06.039> figures<00:02:06.459> we

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
and first up for your mini figures we

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.020 
and first up for your mini figures we
have<00:02:06.819> race<00:02:07.420> stands<00:02:08.019> and<00:02:08.410> as<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.220> can<00:02:09.369> see<00:02:09.429> each

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
have race stands and as you can see each

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.930 
have race stands and as you can see each
figure<00:02:10.569> does<00:02:10.869> come<00:02:11.200> with<00:02:11.379> a<00:02:11.440> proton<00:02:12.069> pack<00:02:12.459> and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
figure does come with a proton pack and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.180 
figure does come with a proton pack and
it<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:13.810> printed<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.500> piece<00:02:14.769> on<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.010> back

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
it is printed that piece on the back

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.430 
it is printed that piece on the back
there<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:16.090> that's<00:02:16.269> really<00:02:16.569> really<00:02:16.959> cool<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
there so that's really really cool and

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.099 
there so that's really really cool and
they<00:02:17.950> do<00:02:18.010> have<00:02:18.370> each<00:02:19.030> figure<00:02:19.450> does<00:02:19.660> have<00:02:19.870> a

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109 
they do have each figure does have a

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.470 
they do have each figure does have a
double-sided<00:02:20.650> face<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.760> think<00:02:22.060> they<00:02:22.299> did<00:02:22.329> a

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
double-sided face so I think they did a

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.870 
double-sided face so I think they did a
really<00:02:22.750> cool<00:02:23.049> job<00:02:23.350> on<00:02:23.620> these<00:02:23.829> and<00:02:24.130> they<00:02:24.700> also

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
really cool job on these and they also

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.839 
really cool job on these and they also
have<00:02:25.329> a<00:02:25.660> nice<00:02:26.079> little<00:02:26.319> initials<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.579> front

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
have a nice little initials on the front

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.879 
have a nice little initials on the front
there<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.420> next<00:02:29.230> up<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.620> Egon<00:02:30.549> Spengler<00:02:31.120> and

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
there and next up is Egon Spengler and

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.740 
there and next up is Egon Spengler and
you'll<00:02:32.889> notice<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.579> torsos<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:34.329> all<00:02:34.569> of

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
you'll notice on the torsos on all of

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.349 
you'll notice on the torsos on all of
these<00:02:34.900> there<00:02:35.470> are<00:02:35.650> slight<00:02:36.010> variations

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
these there are slight variations

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.240 
these there are slight variations
besides<00:02:37.359> just<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.019> change<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.799> initials

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
besides just the change in the initials

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.150 
besides just the change in the initials
obviously<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.180> all<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.139> proton<00:02:41.590> packs<00:02:41.919> are

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
obviously and all the proton packs are

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.390 
obviously and all the proton packs are
the<00:02:42.340> same<00:02:42.639> I<00:02:43.530> think<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.620> proton<00:02:44.980> packs<00:02:45.220> are

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
the same I think the proton packs are

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.069 
the same I think the proton packs are
actually<00:02:45.700> pretty<00:02:45.940> cool<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.389> they<00:02:46.959> are

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
actually pretty cool and they are

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.800 
actually pretty cool and they are
brick-built<00:02:47.530> obviously<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:48.609> pretty<00:02:49.389> awesome

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
brick-built obviously but pretty awesome

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.680 
brick-built obviously but pretty awesome
in<00:02:49.930> my<00:02:49.959> opinion<00:02:50.079> and<00:02:50.760> here<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.970> Peter<00:02:52.359> Venkman

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
in my opinion and here is Peter Venkman

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.440 
in my opinion and here is Peter Venkman
who<00:02:53.560> was<00:02:53.739> portrayed<00:02:54.099> by<00:02:54.220> Bill<00:02:54.760> Murray<00:02:55.030> in<00:02:55.329> the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
who was portrayed by Bill Murray in the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.680 
who was portrayed by Bill Murray in the
movies<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.319> you'll<00:02:56.950> notice<00:02:57.220> on<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.489> back<00:02:57.690> on

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
movies and you'll notice on the back on

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.330 
movies and you'll notice on the back on
each<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.139> these<00:02:59.260> they<00:02:59.470> have<00:02:59.620> really<00:02:59.919> cool<00:03:00.069> back

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
each of these they have really cool back

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.520 
each of these they have really cool back
printing<00:03:00.849> with<00:03:01.060> their<00:03:01.209> name<00:03:01.419> on<00:03:01.690> it<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:02.019> think

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
printing with their name on it I think

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.990 
printing with their name on it I think
that<00:03:02.560> was<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.769> really<00:03:03.190> nice<00:03:03.340> touch<00:03:03.669> that<00:03:03.970> they

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
that was a really nice touch that they

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000 
that was a really nice touch that they
added

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
added

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.000 
added
and<00:03:05.099> finally<00:03:05.970> here<00:03:06.300> is<00:03:06.330> what's<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.319> zeddmore

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
and finally here is what's and zeddmore

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.699 
and finally here is what's and zeddmore
and<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:09.209> might<00:03:09.420> notice<00:03:09.750> what<00:03:10.230> he's<00:03:10.470> holding

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
and you might notice what he's holding

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.820 
and you might notice what he's holding
there<00:03:11.159> it's<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:12.060> ghost<00:03:12.390> trap<00:03:12.810> which<00:03:13.200> I'm<00:03:13.620> glad

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
there it's the ghost trap which I'm glad

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.880 
there it's the ghost trap which I'm glad
that<00:03:14.159> they<00:03:14.340> included<00:03:14.940> but<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.769> think<00:03:16.769> they

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
that they included but I think they

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.740 
that they included but I think they
could<00:03:17.099> have<00:03:17.190> done<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.400> much<00:03:17.519> better<00:03:17.970> job<00:03:18.450> with

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
could have done a much better job with

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.670 
could have done a much better job with
it<00:03:19.549> it's<00:03:20.549> kind<00:03:20.879> of<00:03:20.970> basic<00:03:21.930> compared<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.500> what<00:03:22.650> I

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
it it's kind of basic compared to what I

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.130 
it it's kind of basic compared to what I
think<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.069> should<00:03:23.459> have<00:03:23.670> been<00:03:23.879> so<00:03:24.720> these<00:03:24.930> are

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
think it should have been so these are

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.410 
think it should have been so these are
all<00:03:25.319> your<00:03:25.560> figures<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:27.060> cool

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
all your figures and this is the cool

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.210 
all your figures and this is the cool
little<00:03:27.660> stands<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.560> get<00:03:28.769> with<00:03:28.980> this

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
little stands that you get with this

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.850 
little stands that you get with this
ought<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.700> put<00:03:30.060> your<00:03:30.180> figures<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:31.019> makes<00:03:31.709> it

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
ought to put your figures on it makes it

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.149 
ought to put your figures on it makes it
really<00:03:32.040> really<00:03:32.310> easy<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:33.180> display<00:03:33.569> them<00:03:33.840> and

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
really really easy to display them and

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.100 
really really easy to display them and
also<00:03:35.159> that<00:03:35.489> Ghostbusters<00:03:36.329> symbol<00:03:36.840> on<00:03:36.989> the

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
also that Ghostbusters symbol on the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.170 
also that Ghostbusters symbol on the
front<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.590> not<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.370> sticker<00:03:38.819> there<00:03:39.090> are

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
front is not a sticker there are

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.809 
front is not a sticker there are
actually<00:03:39.480> no<00:03:39.780> stickers<00:03:40.230> in<00:03:40.379> this<00:03:40.530> set<00:03:40.739> that<00:03:41.010> is

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
actually no stickers in this set that is

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.699 
actually no stickers in this set that is
printed<00:03:42.329> so<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.569> think<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.109> very<00:03:43.170> very

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
printed so I think that is very very

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.539 
printed so I think that is very very
cool<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.700> lot<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:46.040> finally<00:03:47.040> here

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
cool I like that a lot and finally here

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.130 
cool I like that a lot and finally here
is<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:48.120> ecto-1

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
is the ecto-1

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.430 
is the ecto-1
which<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:50.099> really<00:03:50.489> cool<00:03:50.790> vehicle<00:03:51.480> they

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
which is a really cool vehicle they

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.680 
which is a really cool vehicle they
added<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:52.920> lot<00:03:53.129> of<00:03:53.280> detail<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:54.000> which<00:03:54.359> I

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
added a lot of detail to it which I

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.680 
added a lot of detail to it which I
think<00:03:55.079> they<00:03:55.200> did<00:03:55.379> a<00:03:55.410> good<00:03:55.650> job<00:03:55.709> on<00:03:56.569> now<00:03:57.569> if

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
think they did a good job on now if

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.390 
think they did a good job on now if
you're<00:03:57.840> looking<00:03:58.170> for<00:03:58.319> a<00:03:58.379> set<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.829> play<00:03:59.129> with

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
you're looking for a set to play with

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.360 
you're looking for a set to play with
this<00:04:00.090> has<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.840> very<00:04:01.230> very<00:04:01.590> little<00:04:01.829> playability

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
this has a very very little playability

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.539 
this has a very very little playability
other<00:04:02.879> than<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.480> basic<00:04:04.260> car<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:05.010> know<00:04:05.099> just

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
other than a basic car you know just

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.119 
other than a basic car you know just
rolling<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.450> wheels<00:04:06.810> around<00:04:06.980> other<00:04:07.980> than

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
rolling the wheels around other than

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.289 
rolling the wheels around other than
that<00:04:08.280> there's<00:04:08.489> not<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.700> lot<00:04:08.879> of<00:04:08.910> playability

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
that there's not a lot of playability

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.360 
that there's not a lot of playability
this<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.870> really<00:04:10.169> designed<00:04:10.349> for<00:04:10.650> collectors

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
this is really designed for collectors

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.909 
this is really designed for collectors
but<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:12.870> think<00:04:13.230> they<00:04:13.380> did<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> pretty<00:04:13.709> good

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
but I do think they did a pretty good

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:14.720 
but I do think they did a pretty good
job<00:04:13.980> on<00:04:14.400> it

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
job on it

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.979 
job on it
now<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.660> um<00:04:16.789> it<00:04:17.789> really<00:04:17.820> only<00:04:18.209> fits<00:04:18.570> three

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
now it is um it really only fits three

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.210 
now it is um it really only fits three
figures<00:04:19.789> you<00:04:20.789> can<00:04:21.209> make<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:22.169> fourth<00:04:22.650> point<00:04:22.860> fit

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
figures you can make a fourth point fit

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.000 
figures you can make a fourth point fit
and<00:04:23.460> I'll<00:04:23.639> show<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:23.940> how<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.960> course<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.919> know

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
and I'll show you how a course you know

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.310 
and I'll show you how a course you know
no<00:04:26.430> one<00:04:26.610> would<00:04:26.760> ride<00:04:27.210> in<00:04:27.479> a<00:04:27.570> vehicle<00:04:27.840> like<00:04:28.139> this

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
no one would ride in a vehicle like this

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.490 
no one would ride in a vehicle like this
I<00:04:28.530> hope<00:04:28.740> at<00:04:29.010> least<00:04:29.090> but<00:04:30.090> this<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.110> only<00:04:31.260> way

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
I hope at least but this is the only way

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.950 
I hope at least but this is the only way
I<00:04:31.530> found<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.280> fit<00:04:32.700> four<00:04:33.030> figures<00:04:33.479> in<00:04:33.690> here

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
I found to fit four figures in here

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.129 
I found to fit four figures in here
without<00:04:34.889> changing<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.639> design<00:04:35.820> on<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.389> you

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
without changing the design on it you

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.719 
without changing the design on it you
can<00:04:37.320> have<00:04:37.500> one<00:04:37.770> way<00:04:37.979> in<00:04:38.099> the<00:04:38.160> back

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
can have one way in the back

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.140 
can have one way in the back
but<00:04:39.419> that's<00:04:39.720> about<00:04:40.020> it<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.430> actually

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
but that's about it and that is actually

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.080 
but that's about it and that is actually
probably<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.930> only<00:04:43.400> playability<00:04:44.400> feature

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
probably the only playability feature

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.000 
probably the only playability feature
that's<00:04:45.570> included<00:04:46.110> is<00:04:46.229> that<00:04:46.260> you<00:04:46.530> can<00:04:46.680> take<00:04:46.860> the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
that's included is that you can take the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.330 
that's included is that you can take the
roof<00:04:47.160> off<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:48.030> put<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.300> figures<00:04:48.630> in<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:50.220> know

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
roof off to put the figures in you know

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.029 
roof off to put the figures in you know
this<00:04:51.210> that's<00:04:51.479> really<00:04:51.750> cool<00:04:52.110> but<00:04:52.380> there's<00:04:52.650> one

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
this that's really cool but there's one

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.700 
this that's really cool but there's one
thing<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.639> me<00:04:54.030> that<00:04:54.270> just<00:04:54.510> feels<00:04:55.320> like<00:04:55.500> it's

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
thing to me that just feels like it's

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.180 
thing to me that just feels like it's
missing<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.840> for<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.900> Ghostbusters<00:04:58.620> set<00:04:58.919> it

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
missing and for a Ghostbusters set it

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.820 
missing and for a Ghostbusters set it
just<00:04:59.270> feels<00:05:00.270> like<00:05:00.570> there<00:05:00.840> should<00:05:00.870> be<00:05:01.139> a<00:05:01.470> ghost

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
just feels like there should be a ghost

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.520 
just feels like there should be a ghost
in<00:05:02.099> it<00:05:02.130> I<00:05:02.460> think<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.419> would<00:05:03.570> have<00:05:03.660> been<00:05:03.690> perfect

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
in it I think it would have been perfect

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.040 
in it I think it would have been perfect
to<00:05:04.860> have<00:05:05.010> Slimer<00:05:05.460> in<00:05:05.789> there<00:05:06.000> but<00:05:06.810> there's

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
to have Slimer in there but there's

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.779 
to have Slimer in there but there's
plenty<00:05:07.380> of<00:05:07.590> others<00:05:08.039> that<00:05:08.280> they<00:05:08.430> could<00:05:08.669> have

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
plenty of others that they could have

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:09.740 
plenty of others that they could have
chosen

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
chosen

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.260 
chosen
I<00:05:09.900> just<00:05:10.380> think<00:05:10.530> Slimer<00:05:10.920> is<00:05:11.220> very<00:05:11.460> iconic<00:05:11.940> and

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
I just think Slimer is very iconic and

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.240 
I just think Slimer is very iconic and
it<00:05:12.330> would<00:05:12.480> have<00:05:12.570> been<00:05:12.630> fantastic<00:05:13.380> if<00:05:14.010> they<00:05:14.160> had

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
it would have been fantastic if they had

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.680 
it would have been fantastic if they had
included<00:05:14.700> that<00:05:15.020> but<00:05:16.020> oh<00:05:16.260> well<00:05:17.390> there's<00:05:18.390> a<00:05:18.480> lot

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
included that but oh well there's a lot

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.380 
included that but oh well there's a lot
of<00:05:18.810> detailing<00:05:19.170> on<00:05:19.380> it<00:05:19.500> like<00:05:19.650> I<00:05:19.770> said<00:05:20.300> there's<00:05:21.300> a

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
of detailing on it like I said there's a

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.220 
of detailing on it like I said there's a
lot<00:05:21.600> on<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:21.990> roof<00:05:22.200> and<00:05:23.360> Penny<00:05:24.360> tenner<00:05:24.660> let<00:05:25.080> you

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
lot on the roof and Penny tenner let you

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.270 
lot on the roof and Penny tenner let you
see<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.560> roof<00:05:25.740> up<00:05:25.980> close<00:05:26.310> and<00:05:27.740> do<00:05:28.740> have<00:05:28.980> the

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
see the roof up close and do have the

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.420 
see the roof up close and do have the
license<00:05:29.790> plate<00:05:30.150> that<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.990> ecto-1<00:05:31.350> New<00:05:32.130> York

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
on there I love all the details on it

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.360 
on there I love all the details on it
especially<00:05:36.600> like<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.440> Ghostbusters<00:05:37.710> symbol

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
especially like the Ghostbusters symbol

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.730 
especially like the Ghostbusters symbol
on<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.640> side<00:05:38.670> and<00:05:39.420> things<00:05:39.990> like<00:05:40.140> that<00:05:40.410> and

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
on the side and things like that and

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.240 
on the side and things like that and
even<00:05:40.860> on<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.250> back<00:05:42.200> but<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.470> just<00:05:43.980> wish<00:05:44.190> it

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
even on the back but I just wish it

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.340 
even on the back but I just wish it
maybe<00:05:45.060> had<00:05:45.330> a<00:05:45.360> little<00:05:45.570> bit<00:05:45.690> more<00:05:45.720> playability

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
maybe had a little bit more playability

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.790 
maybe had a little bit more playability
or<00:05:47.030> included<00:05:48.030> Slimer<00:05:48.419> I<00:05:48.840> wouldn't<00:05:49.530> even<00:05:49.590> care

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
or included Slimer I wouldn't even care

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.870 
or included Slimer I wouldn't even care
about<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:50.070> play<00:05:50.190> those<00:05:50.430> Lydia<00:05:50.669> if<00:05:50.760> they

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
about the play those Lydia if they

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.240 
about the play those Lydia if they
included<00:05:51.300> Slimer<00:05:51.600> or<00:05:51.990> some<00:05:52.350> kind<00:05:52.620> of<00:05:52.650> ghost<00:05:52.860> I

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
included Slimer or some kind of ghost I

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.430 
included Slimer or some kind of ghost I
also<00:05:53.760> really<00:05:54.120> like<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.450> hubcaps<00:05:54.960> I<00:05:55.200> think

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
also really like the hubcaps I think

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.880 
also really like the hubcaps I think
they're<00:05:55.950> really<00:05:56.250> really<00:05:56.370> cool<00:05:57.440> so<00:05:58.440> overall<00:05:58.800> a

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
they're really really cool so overall a

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.260 
they're really really cool so overall a
really<00:05:59.370> cool<00:05:59.610> set

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
really cool set

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.860 
really cool set
probably<00:06:00.990> overpriced<00:06:01.650> and<00:06:02.330> maybe<00:06:03.330> they<00:06:03.630> left

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
probably overpriced and maybe they left

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.740 
probably overpriced and maybe they left
out<00:06:04.400> something<00:06:05.400> they<00:06:05.520> should<00:06:05.760> have<00:06:06.030> included

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
out something they should have included

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.960 
out something they should have included
and<00:06:07.169> maybe<00:06:07.650> they<00:06:07.860> gave<00:06:08.070> credit<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:08.790> wrong

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
and maybe they gave credit to the wrong

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.170 
and maybe they gave credit to the wrong
person<00:06:09.240> but<00:06:10.169> other<00:06:10.530> than<00:06:10.770> that<00:06:10.890> I<00:06:11.400> think<00:06:11.970> kids

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
person but other than that I think kids

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.870 
person but other than that I think kids
