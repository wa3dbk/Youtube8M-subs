00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.610
 you get the original weighs 20.6 the reason 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.099
 why it weighs less is because it was more 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.560

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.679

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.650
 administrator 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.410
 we removed the music in bad condition but 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.420
 the following because we have directory 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.420
 the installation I'm going to put him in being 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.420
 because in I do not have anymore I do not have 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.970
 or my space is not good for you 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.720
 goes on the next one we remove these two 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.080
 options we put next 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.780
 in style I canceled it because I no longer 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.980
 I have executor space the case that 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.440
 you had finished by that 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.220
 installation we will proceed to translate 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.900
 the game as I told you is in mega van 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.080
 to be able to download it and they will leave a 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:02.090
 file like the one I have here 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.190
 it's called back twv r2 point there is no 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.890
 have passwords because it 's so that 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.900
 share with all your friends the case 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.760
 is that when they have downloaded it 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.070
 what they are going to do is independently of 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.270
 you from where you have your 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:20.510
 download directory will copy the 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.510
 I cut forgiveness and file will go 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.400
 its where they installed the king's game 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.010
 so for example I have it 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.550
 installed in data I know total program 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.220
 war room will go to data and there is the route 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.230
 installation of the program this is mine 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.410
 and cause that they have to put in total 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.860
 war 22 then adapt here they have to 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.270
 paste 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.560
 what is the translator that I did to them 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.740
 then the team car double double click them 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.210
 will detect what the director is 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.140
 installation simply put you 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.350
 extracting they put me that true and good 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.300

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.130
 good friends already having finished what 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.110
 what is the process of extraction you 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.070
 they will notice that there are two files that 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.340

 my music esp what you are going to have 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.300
 what to do is we are going to erase 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.360
 files we're going to erase the ones that say in 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.860
 local jon low in the can leave but 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.940
 Well, I recommend that you delete them for 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.130
 that they do not serve us and to take away 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.410
 space to our hard drive we are going to 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.070
 eliminate local those that say in in if 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.280
 the only ones who win are these four 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.550
 local in enron local music pack here 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.310
 and music came in we are going to suppress it for 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.410
 take away a few gigas of our 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.270
 from our computer and then we're going to 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.460
 proceed to create the game 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.200
 the crack well on what is the disc 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.510

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.680

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.680
 spanish remember 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.600
 we can also change 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.600
 I'm going to put me 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.629
