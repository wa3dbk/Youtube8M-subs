Albanian saying that my dad tells me but

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.080 
Albanian saying that my dad tells me but
I'll<00:02:50.470> try<00:02:50.770> and<00:02:50.920> capture<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.640> generally<00:02:52.030> as

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
I'll try and capture it generally as

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.430 
I'll try and capture it generally as
much<00:02:52.209> as<00:02:52.330> I<00:02:52.390> can<00:02:52.660> but<00:02:52.870> um<00:02:53.080> -<00:02:53.980> never

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
much as I can but um - never

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.400 
much as I can but um - never
it's<00:02:57.070> gonna<00:02:57.160> seem<00:02:57.400> very<00:02:57.640> very<00:02:58.630> generic<00:02:59.170> but

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
it's gonna seem very very generic but

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.470 
it's gonna seem very very generic but
never<00:02:59.860> spend<00:03:00.310> more<00:03:00.700> than<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:00.910> can<00:03:01.060> afford

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480

you<00:03:02.110> know<00:03:02.260> baiting<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.680> seems<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.980> little<00:03:03.070> more

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
you know baiting it seems a little more

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.280 
you know baiting it seems a little more
clever<00:03:03.550> but<00:03:03.820> that's<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:04.600> basically<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.200> it's

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
clever but that's but basically and it's

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.660 
clever but that's but basically and it's
not<00:03:05.410> just<00:03:05.560> about<00:03:05.680> money<00:03:06.010> but<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.550> about

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
not just about money but it is about

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.800 
not just about money but it is about
money<00:03:06.850> but<00:03:07.000> it's<00:03:07.120> about<00:03:07.240> life<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.750> know

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
money but it's about life and you know

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.110 
money but it's about life and you know
to<00:03:07.959> always<00:03:08.230> plan<00:03:08.560> ahead<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.190> always<00:03:09.459> know

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
to always plan ahead and to always know

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.370 
to always plan ahead and to always know
what<00:03:10.300> you're<00:03:10.420> capable<00:03:10.570> of<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.290> always

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
what you're capable of and to always

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.590 
what you're capable of and to always
measure<00:03:11.709> your<00:03:11.920> next<00:03:12.160> step<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.610> I<00:03:12.790> think

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
measure your next step and I think

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.870 
measure your next step and I think
that's<00:03:13.810> something<00:03:14.140> that's<00:03:14.290> very<00:03:14.880> generous

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
that's something that's very generous

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.140 
that's something that's very generous
person<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.300> know<00:03:16.420> very<00:03:17.760> common<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.850> say<00:03:19.090> but

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
person you know very common to say but

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.729 
person you know very common to say but
it<00:03:19.630> makes<00:03:19.840> sense<00:03:20.050> when<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.260> put<00:03:20.470> in<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.590> bigger

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
it makes sense when you put in a bigger

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.160 
it makes sense when you put in a bigger
picture
