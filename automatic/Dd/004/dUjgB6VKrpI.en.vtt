00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 I'll show you how to use the numbers 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.140
 different in a single phone today we're going 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.719
 to talk about dual sim are teams that we 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.150
 allow to carry two lines in one 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.400
 phone and how they do it unlike 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.859
 your phone that has only one chip and 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.369
 therefore a line these teams we 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.170
 allow to charge in the absence of 1 2 chips 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.600
 different that can be like in this 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.029
 case of different companies or they can be 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.070
 from it they receive what is good 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.929
 that changing from one line to the other does not 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.030
 requires neither opening the phone nor 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.130
 turn it off and turn it on is just a tap 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.219
 look, I want to use my phone to 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.300
 call and I'll call my manager 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.850
 obviously from where I do it from my 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.980
 instant work account with just 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 a tap'm choosing the name of 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.120
 my work account now let's assume 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.870
 that it was done at night and I have nobody 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.879
 call a friend here and choose which 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.070
 personal line and without changing chip without 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.050
 absolutely nothing I'm already calling 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.010
 my friend from my own person there 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.270
 companies that on weekends 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.590
 double the load 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.850
 there are companies that allow you to call 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.559
 free to those who have that company 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.780
 good taking the chips 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.909
 you will never miss a promotion 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.470
 and for those who like me need yes or yes 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.329
 have internet all the time in your 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.100
 phone that better than having two 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.380
 different companies and because there are places 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.329
 from the city where your company out there 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.759
 It has only one limit but if you have 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.100
 a chip from another company you changed it pum 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.289
 and you have full full signal and no 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.329
 problem but before when we thought about 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.570
 the phone to the cinema we thought of 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:33.000
 heavy fat big teams no longer the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.189
 sim phones span the gamut 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.380
 of the market from the smallest and 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.600
 economics going through teams like the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.729
 engine a super prize phone that 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.649
 has digital tv that has radio and the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.600
 possibility of having two chips but as 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.929
 if that were not enough I can show you this 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.200
 octa core eight cores in a single 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.780
 full hd phone on the full hd screen 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.700
 a movie like in bluray you're going to see it 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.390
 here exactly with the same amount of 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.549
 points 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.709
 this is a look at the dual world serves 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.709
 there is much more I invite you to know it
