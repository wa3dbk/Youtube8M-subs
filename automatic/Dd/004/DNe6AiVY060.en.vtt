00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.059
 nothing more stain 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.480
 hello welcome winners to head a foundation program 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.709
 quality zoo 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.769
 they use I am pooch 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.409
 and this where we are is the aviary 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:17.759
 of the Kabul Zoo home 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.400
 this morning bouquet mafia practice we are premiering daily 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.630
 after the same as before 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 but everything is new new plants were put new trees 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.550
 many species passed 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.000
 and they are seeing a lot and they are singing spectacular 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.700
 We were going to take 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.420
 is that all this change was made 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.560
 the weapon and who did it and how they did it 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.880
 equally all near the truth is known about 10 thousand species of 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.180
 live birds in the world inhabit diverse ecosystems throughout the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.360
 balloon from the Arctic to Antarctica having adapted to 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.670
 multiple environments 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.730
 so far these days is the encartado in remodeling to do some 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.990
 mode and the aviary for one that completely changed 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.250
 why it was decided to make this change 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.979
 but two editions ago 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.679
 investigation trying to be park happens outside everyday that people complain 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:13.680
 is that I see it from the arts 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.660
 we did a study 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.440
 the depurated for him as to his behavior and we realized 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.970
 who hid areas 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.480
 too covered and can not be seen 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.850
 causing set of angus and recession people wanted to be a whole 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.770
 change trying to get people out 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.780
 ea accept me better texidor that is very cute and make better use of it 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 Colombia is the country with the greatest diversity of birds worldwide and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.409
 that counts within its territory with thousand 871 officially reported species 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.560
 go and what were the causes page 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.390
 they do not pay 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.420
 that is the amount of vegetation or 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.700
 p display 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.789
 to recreate the spaces the this said 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.870
 the liver knows 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.220
 well that escaped damp millacura and if a recreation a little closer 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.259
 what they live 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.519
 good eco sully your exit from the accessions in an initial phase 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.070
 good look percent and agreements 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.160
 he does it for all the aviary first thing that marks that I can not 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.859
 but yes percent has focused certain steps that are representative 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.669
 from the top they inhabit 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.739
 I think it's even that I can see it's on the outside 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.349
 in a certain way they prefer certain spaces for sayings that are very much in keeping with 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.519
 What they 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.299
 but you believe in the wild the great diversity of birds that Colombia has 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.400
 owes to the geography so different and special that it presents are no longer 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.980
 Mountains for Mons Seas Rivers make this country a perfect place for 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.089
 birds 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.890
 it is very important that people that are logical physics 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.220
 understand that the diary 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.729
 it's a space for people 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:59.219
 percent be a bit of how is the behavior when you visit in the jungle 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.099
 it's not so easy to see the scam birds and see the animals but you want to 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.869
 discover why in certain ways colors is true type of camouflage 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.479
 help you already feel protected 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:13.189
 zelaya that passes quickly along the path that may possibly perceive everything 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:14.719
 what we have 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:19.299
 but if you stop a little look at the ads and that relates to the 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.009
 spaces with ecosystems 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:22.409
 and search among the three 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.979
 among them the one of gestation 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.449
 what are the warnings surely is the great reference to the PSOE with a 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:28.829
 very nice expression 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.839
 that was to offer the good aviary was not many thanks atacama 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:37.559
 explorers velveteen planet crown with the online plos nothing more 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:40.649
 Malaga 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.869
 We came for the aviary with orchestra that will tell us well 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.849
 it's good that we did in the aviary because they say there are several ecosystems 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.629
 but this similar ecosystem the restructuring was 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.459
 from the mesh above this change 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.729
 He said that it is very deteriorated 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:58.689
 this program 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.769
 thanks to atmospheric grapefruit systems 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.719
 it's about the forest vs barcelona and that can see percent 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:08.369
 bores the fact one hundred 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:12.739
 wild but half patiÃ±o very few 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.629
 the vegetation after the assault 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:17.639
 reply 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.999
 and this has ended here also in front of the vast historical 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:22.889
 where it was also achieved 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.240
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.340
 introduce an assistance born makes are steelmakers 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.279
 who are beings and those who are 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.619
 all the dependencies we supply this country some selections 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.890
 reprimanded 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.520
 sport is another year for you 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.520
 the birds be as coach of this plan 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.979
 to throw people the phrase seems to compensate 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:47.910
 shocking 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.610
 ride on the hangers there 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.460
 for that reason people the source 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.879
 look a lot better 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.090
 Birds descend from reptiles 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.650
 at 1,200 million years ago the scales developed in feathers 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.820
 arising in this way the first enabled it is estimated that currently 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.069
 there are about 9 thousand 700 different species of birds 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.349
 the idea is that in the aviary there different species of birds 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.050
 each one possesses some 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.139
 of each of these systems were Indian agreement with each ecosystem 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:26.379
 they can identify these exposures to which they belong by 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.379
 inflation sessions if the complaint made 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.599
 if they accept it 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:32.800
 the city of the plains 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.009
 police ccd from this city 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.620
 they can shelter themselves they locate themselves no one tells him to fill 

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:43.599
 the scenario in which its de facto ecosystem 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.379
 today almost every plate that was merged daily from where 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.529
 some of them we had in Tibet 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:52.289
 and others were brought from the 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.009
 in the vicinity of where there is why it can be done to help a lot to this 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:56.629
 center 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:58.120
 but the majority is saying 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.169
 80 percent arrested in the plantations the wasps are divided into 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:04.530
 two basic groups 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.169
 those who can fly 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.099
 which include the penguins because although they do not fly through the 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:14.639
 air if they do it in the water and the group of birds that the name of the year 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.430
 free calls with runners among which are the ostrich the menus 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.339
 the Cassowary his uncle others 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.569
 when the whole process since we started 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.770
 to remove the bushes that were before and put the new bushes and that are already 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.900
 rooted and that could already be brought open the road to the public that process 

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:36.240
 lasted 90 days 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.939
 90 of 90 days but working full 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:43.300
 olguita thank you very much for sharing with us efe 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.059
 furniture that had been logically diverse 

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:49.250
 thank you and whoever wants a recognition for my team 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.680
 I was very hard with a lot of love, also because we are all 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.560
 explorers by nature with the sale of food in some normal way 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.560
 stain 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:03.759
 a side 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:08.569
 this type of Hermosillo rock enclosures are colorful masses and there are many factors 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:10.680
 of type of rotation 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.210
 it is not easy carlos 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.759
 what happens is that you have to 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:17.169
 to get away from time to look for all the birds 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:22.829
 and looking up between the rocks in the water what I was saying liked 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.300
 pay attention to the ear 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.309
 listen well where there were arrested here is there or not look for it 

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:32.939
 the semades we found page play in auschwitz that reported 

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:36.199
 antam because obviously they are internal nocturnal in rolls but 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:39.909
 we can look for them for example among the rocks you have to look in the room 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:43.849
 the orchestra closest to reality come single disc street to know the 

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:48.789
 Aviary visit us on the internet a triple of a point only ico de Cali Puntocom

 also panista 

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:54.039
 in addition to explorers abasolo state together with tips 

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:58.189
 we are explorers by nature finish talavera goal is not 

00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:59.319
