today is show you how to measure your

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.600 
today is show you how to measure your
groups<00:00:05.549> in<00:00:05.850> ballistic<00:00:06.480> AE<00:00:07.280> it<00:00:08.280> took<00:00:08.460> me<00:00:08.580> a

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
groups in ballistic AE it took me a

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.950 
groups in ballistic AE it took me a
little<00:00:08.670> bit<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.000> get<00:00:09.120> it<00:00:09.210> all<00:00:09.269> figured<00:00:09.450> out<00:00:09.690> and

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
little bit to get it all figured out and

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.720 
little bit to get it all figured out and
with<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.170> updates<00:00:10.559> I've<00:00:10.830> seen<00:00:11.040> some<00:00:11.250> changes

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
back anyway you go into your target will

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:50.979 
back anyway you go into your target will
select<00:00:43.820> zero<00:00:44.820> car<00:00:45.090> okay<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:47.870> select<00:00:48.870> target

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
select zero car okay so select target

00:00:50.989 --> 00:01:01.939 
select zero car okay so select target
choose<00:00:51.989> from<00:00:52.170> library<00:00:56.629> it's<00:00:57.629> finally<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
choose from library it's finally so this

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.260 
choose from library it's finally so this
is<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.520> I've<00:01:02.640> done<00:01:02.789> before<00:01:02.940> this

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
was a ten shot group so you can kind of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:20.090 
was a ten shot group so you can kind of
move<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.200> scale<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.900> get<00:01:09.900> done

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
now when I go to grouping up in the up

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.719 
now when I go to grouping up in the up
here<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> top<00:01:25.190> actually<00:01:26.190> I<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.430> back<00:01:26.580> to

here on the top actually I go back to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.240 
here on the top actually I go back to
scoring<00:01:27.060> I'm<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.479> delete<00:01:30.890> okay<00:01:31.890> let's

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
start over so you get a target or

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.980 
start over so you get a target or
grouping<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.180> sorry<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.660> up<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:36.900> in

grouping I'm sorry which is up there in
the<00:01:37.080> top<00:01:37.290> right<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:39.530> you're<00:01:40.530> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> scale

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the top right and you're going to scale

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.100 
the top right and you're going to scale
the<00:01:41.190> target<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.570> time<00:01:42.750> I'm<00:01:42.900> going<00:01:43.050> to

top left and so I'm just going to leave

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.530 
top left and so I'm just going to leave
that<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:13.019> that's<00:02:13.200> where<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.470> would<00:02:14.540> that's

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
that but that's where you would that's

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.440 
that but that's where you would that's
where<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.810> would<00:02:15.870> edit<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:18.209> now<00:02:18.330> that

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
where you would edit that so now that

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.570 
where you would edit that so now that
I've<00:02:18.600> scaled<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.959> target<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.500> can<00:02:20.160> go<00:02:20.370> back<00:02:20.550> to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
I've scaled the target I can go back to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.699 
I've scaled the target I can go back to
scoring<00:02:21.180> up<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> top<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.440> right

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
scoring up in the top and to the right

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.300 
scoring up in the top and to the right
is<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.640> plus<00:02:27.000> sign<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.650> added<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.010> bullet

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
is a plus sign so I just added a bullet

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.880 
is a plus sign so I just added a bullet
now<00:02:29.730> if<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:29.970> look<00:02:30.209> in<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.450> left<00:02:30.739> you're<00:02:31.739> going

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
now if you look in the left you're going

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.770 
now if you look in the left you're going
to<00:02:31.950> see<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.100> number<00:02:32.220> one<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.600> grab

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
to see a number one so you can grab

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.810 
to see a number one so you can grab
close<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:35.209> pull<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.299> down<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:37.579> place<00:02:38.579> it

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
close to that pull it down you place it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.610 
close to that pull it down you place it
where<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:38.970> want<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.360> go<00:02:41.390> to

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.130

each time I hit the plus button you'll

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.730 
each time I hit the plus button you'll
see<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.270> up<00:03:00.450> there<00:03:00.630> under<00:03:00.780> average<00:03:01.200> velocity

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
see it up there under average velocity

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.010 
see it up there under average velocity
