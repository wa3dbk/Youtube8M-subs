 do not forget to check the description 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.280
 of the video for more information 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.110
 and now they are worlds today and those and by 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.590
 youtube channel of hewitt mexico and the 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.570
 today 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.590
 Well, I wanted to vary a bit 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.540
 videos so I bring you good if you saw 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.110
 in the video of the update number 6 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.000
 They will know what multi-mahora are already 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.100
 four teams of three people each 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.040
 so this is walton rocket race 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.570
 basically all three are in a room 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.260
 as if you wanted it but this time 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.150
 is this in a room here I was playing 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.330
 with volts and a friend of volts that 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.030
 called alonso this one happened to them and 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.550
 invent in the description in case 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.630
 they want to add this if he was playing 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.700
 with them two 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.200
 balls you already know who you have to 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.160
 send the videos if they have any video 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.530
 good 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.290
 they will review them so 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.320
 if we were playing rock breaks until 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.170
 now we are going 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.920
 first of all but only if they want 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.360
 know we do not win so this is 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.330
 just a video to entertain them 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.340
 There is a little good because most 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.830
 of the videos are going to be boring 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.240
 we do not want that to happen and so 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.740
 we want you to be encouraged to play crowd 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.330
 also so that you are in this 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.860
 kind of games where they can get the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.619
 achievement of killing an enemy in a game 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.920
 de roque you see how I just did I got 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.240
 a triple death with the cannon of 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.360
 wharton 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.950
 so this time this 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.229
 we bring this video 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.549
 the game is quite entertaining 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.070
 because this is always happening very 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.880
 good 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.950
 for example we do not even know how 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.170
 we went out and what happened 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.280
 and if I really do not have much that 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.280
 say so 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.250
 basically what happens in rockets 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.220
 rice is that if you leave the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.739
 vehicle are completely deadly 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.040
 while you are in the vehicle 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.989
 they have unlimited life good do not receive 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.120
 any damage so the vehicle is the 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.010
 that goes flying does not take damage either 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.430
 one simply flies away is 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.569
 quite funny to see how it flies like 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.780
 a feel like this is flying 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.780
 Well, if this is very entertaining 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.560
 so I was going to tell them if they send videos 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.430
 complete as well of complete games as 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.430
 I'm doing it now 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.819
 tell me if you want them to comment on their 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.830
 videos are not friends appear their 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.250
 videos or if you do not want to display the 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.190
 videos 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.200
 because well I do not know if they want a 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.550
 specific comment of what I think 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.290
 of his video some other comment not 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.290
 I'm sure what they want 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.180
 also explain to me that the clips from 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.519
 video those I do not comment on just what 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.430
 I upload like this and the full videos if 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.980
 you good if I choose to put them 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.560
 you have the option to tell me 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.340
 I want you to comment on it, I want you 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.340
 talk in the video 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.620
 Well yes or do not speak simply good 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.250
 it would save me a little more time if 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.320
 I do not speak but 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.470
 because really I do not care I do not 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.180
 this when I have time so if 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.820
 then I do not upload videos and then I'm not 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.710
 with you it's because I have other things 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.740
 what do i do in the xbox 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.620
 I do not respond to your group requests 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.490
 of chat to none of your messages 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.470
 because well I'm a little busy 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.010
 doing something inside the xbox or 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.500
 I'm just absent, it's usually 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.569
 because I am absent or also because 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.349
 I'm doing something there 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.349
 so 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.989
 well that's what I wanted to tell you 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.660
 let's start with the maps already 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.110
 soon I will upload more videos of 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.840
 multiplayer of examples of the new 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.090
 updates that are new in the 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.900
 playlists what things can play 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.009
 what things do I recommend that really 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.620
 you will like it 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:44.540
 Well, if all that here, basically 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.190
 how they may have realized what 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.580
 you see is simply to reach the 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:53.280
 destinations are marked on the map 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.440
 of specific points while you are leaving 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.840
 flying with your underwater 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.729
 You can also kill enemies like 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.639
 I told them 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.409
 you can take the achievement like this to get the 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.490
 achievement first you need to buy the 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:13.729
 de novo map package because it results 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.680
 that if they do not have that pack of maps, 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.909
 can take out the achievements that say not very 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.309
 ok so from what they see in the video 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:26.180
 we can conclude that bolt is a 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:28.249
 idiot to drive and that according to him 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.849
 he was obstructing engine and who knows what 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.689
 things but I have no 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.789
 do not 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:38.269
 If parents are listening voice 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:41.179
 this does not get your license for 

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:43.969
 drive because I do not want to god 

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:46.080
 imagine what would happen if that happens 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:49.080
 so 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.949
 this good the most likely bold would come out 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:57.800
 in the newspaper in the press 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:59.810
 bleeding on the front page this 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:05.150
 if other things and stay a long time 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:08.510
 out of the vehicle this puts them good 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.000
 inside the vehicle this one 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.050
 so there we can see how I'm going to 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.590
 teleport 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.590
 there 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.970
 they transport anthologically within 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.620
 vehicle now is not like the 3 kilo in 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:27.160
 halo 3 this rocker breaks was bad for 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.260
 all of him 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.660
 the fact that you could not kill the 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.220
 enemies more than killing the fact 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.800
 that if your partner left you behind 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.830
 well it was not very convenient because it was 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.740
 weak and he had to get to the area 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.480
 marked if you did not have the point 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.740
 then it was not very convenient to do 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.319
 that 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.720
 I had many problems but they have already been 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:53.759
 arranged I remind you that this kind of 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.280
 game is on the list of multi game 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:07:00.319
 team that was all for today I hope that what 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.319
 have enjoyed see you in the next
