guess<00:00:59.269> we<00:00:59.420> could<00:00:59.570> say<00:00:59.720> that<00:00:59.750> something<00:01:00.170> wrong

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
guess we could say that something wrong

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.469 
guess we could say that something wrong
is<00:01:00.500> happening<00:01:00.650> and<00:01:01.250> that<00:01:01.309> when<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:02.120> go<00:01:02.269> to<00:01:02.330> the

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
is happening and that when you go to the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:03.969 
is happening and that when you go to the
outside<00:01:02.629> of<00:01:02.809> your<00:01:02.960> foot<00:01:03.019> that's<00:01:03.320> not<00:01:03.559> good<00:01:03.769> and

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
outside of your foot that's not good and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.950 
outside of your foot that's not good and
so<00:01:04.519> right<00:01:05.150> off<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.330> bat<00:01:05.449> I<00:01:05.600> think<00:01:05.900> the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
so right off the bat I think the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.899 
so right off the bat I think the
simplest<00:01:06.260> thing<00:01:06.470> could<00:01:06.590> be<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:07.250> a<00:01:07.280> maybe<00:01:07.760> you

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
simplest thing could be that a maybe you

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.570 
simplest thing could be that a maybe you
just<00:01:08.060> shifting<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:08.510> too<00:01:08.659> far<00:01:08.869> as<00:01:09.140> we<00:01:09.799> know<00:01:09.979> we

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
just shifting it too far as we know we

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.350 
just shifting it too far as we know we
want<00:01:10.729> to<00:01:10.880> stand<00:01:11.119> shoulder<00:01:11.210> wide<00:01:11.690> and<00:01:12.590> and<00:01:13.360> the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
want to stand shoulder wide and and the

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.120 
want to stand shoulder wide and and the
only<00:01:14.540> foot<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:14.990> gets<00:01:15.229> wider<00:01:15.530> in<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:15.890> stance

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
only foot that gets wider in the stance

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.320 
only foot that gets wider in the stance
will<00:01:16.280> be<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.490> forward<00:01:16.790> foot<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.150> right<00:01:17.180> foot

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
will be the forward foot the right foot

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.730 
will be the forward foot the right foot
should<00:01:17.690> be<00:01:17.750> in<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:17.960> same<00:01:18.140> place<00:01:18.320> with<00:01:18.530> every

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
should be in the same place with every

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.499 
should be in the same place with every
golf<00:01:18.950> club<00:01:19.159> so<00:01:19.579> let's<00:01:19.759> first<00:01:19.969> and<00:01:20.180> foremost

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
golf club so let's first and foremost

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.880 
golf club so let's first and foremost
established<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.140> place<00:01:21.409> because<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.680> think

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
established that place because I think

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.200 
established that place because I think
there's<00:01:22.009> a<00:01:22.039> good<00:01:22.189> chance<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:23.000> a<00:01:23.030> you

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
there's a good chance that a you

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.670 
there's a good chance that a you
probably<00:01:23.689> have<00:01:23.810> your<00:01:23.960> right<00:01:24.109> foot<00:01:24.320> under<00:01:24.590> you

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
probably have your right foot under you

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.349 
probably have your right foot under you
too<00:01:24.859> much<00:01:25.039> so<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.640> even<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.909> slightest

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
too much so that even the slightest

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.539 
too much so that even the slightest
shift<00:01:26.539> will<00:01:27.439> get<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.740> foot<00:01:27.920> outside<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:28.430> got

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
shift will get the foot outside you got

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.310 
shift will get the foot outside you got
to<00:01:28.640> do<00:01:28.759> this<00:01:28.789> now<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.719> to<00:01:29.810> get<00:01:29.930> that<00:01:30.049> foot

to do this now and to get that foot

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.990 
to do this now and to get that foot
centered<00:01:30.710> if<00:01:30.859> it's<00:01:31.250> in<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.460> wrong<00:01:31.579> place<00:01:31.850> in

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
check that out right here this is about

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.149 
check that out right here this is about
my<00:02:01.789> driver's<00:02:02.210> stance<00:02:02.560> alright<00:02:03.560> notice<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:03.950> just

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
my driver's stance alright notice I just

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.580 
my driver's stance alright notice I just
move<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:04.340> foot<00:02:04.670> again<00:02:05.079> from<00:02:06.079> where<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.259> had<00:02:06.469> it

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
move that foot again from where I had it

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.380 
move that foot again from where I had it
to<00:02:06.679> demonstrate<00:02:07.100> where<00:02:07.249> you<00:02:07.340> were<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.520> Roy<00:02:07.700> ok

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
to demonstrate where you were a Roy ok

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.500 
to demonstrate where you were a Roy ok
so<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.619> wedge<00:02:10.069> will<00:02:10.220> be<00:02:10.310> about<00:02:10.550> here<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.000> then

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
so the wedge will be about here and then

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.150 
so the wedge will be about here and then
my<00:02:11.660> driver<00:02:11.930> goes<00:02:12.170> almost<00:02:12.440> about<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.920> width<00:02:13.100> of

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160

where the outside of the foot was for

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.610 
where the outside of the foot was for
the<00:02:16.940> wedge<00:02:17.120> ok<00:02:17.480> you're<00:02:17.690> with<00:02:17.810> me<00:02:17.930> on<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:18.140> so

about there at the heel okay now give
you<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.870> good<00:03:06.019> idea<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.859> would<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.069> driver

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
you a good idea that that would a driver

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.770 
you a good idea that that would a driver
you<00:03:07.549> will<00:03:07.669> be<00:03:07.790> at<00:03:07.909> the<00:03:08.030> heel<00:03:08.209> or<00:03:08.389> the<00:03:08.480> ball<00:03:08.659> will

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
you will be at the heel or the ball will

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.599 
you will be at the heel or the ball will
be<00:03:08.870> somewhat<00:03:09.230> pretty<00:03:09.709> close<00:03:09.889> out<00:03:10.129> from<00:03:10.459> your

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
be somewhat pretty close out from your

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.289 
be somewhat pretty close out from your
from<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.299> your<00:03:11.750> armpit<00:03:12.079> ok<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:13.519> I<00:03:13.760> think<00:03:14.030> that

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
from the your armpit ok so I think that

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.089 
from the your armpit ok so I think that
number<00:03:14.689> one<00:03:14.930> your<00:03:15.349> foots<00:03:15.620> probably<00:03:15.980> too

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
number one your foots probably too

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.459 
number one your foots probably too
narrow<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:16.939> get<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.150> drill<00:03:17.540> here<00:03:17.810> naturally

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:18.469 
narrow so get that drill here naturally

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.580 
narrow so get that drill here naturally
if<00:03:18.609> until<00:03:19.609> i<00:03:19.669> get<00:03:19.730> my<00:03:19.879> white<00:03:20.180> pressure<00:03:20.590> the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
if until i get my white pressure the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.589 
if until i get my white pressure the
kneecap<00:03:21.980> will<00:03:22.189> be<00:03:22.340> when<00:03:22.909> I<00:03:22.939> get<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.329> outward

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
kneecap will be when I get the outward

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.270 
kneecap will be when I get the outward
pressure<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:24.230> will<00:03:24.439> be<00:03:24.590> over<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.919> center<00:03:25.250> of

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
pressure it will be over the center of

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.069 
pressure it will be over the center of
the<00:03:25.459> ankle<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:25.879> there's<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.510> there's<00:03:26.750> you

the ankle and there's this there's you
there's<00:03:27.290> your<00:03:27.620> case<00:03:27.769> there<00:03:28.010> another<00:03:28.760> way<00:03:28.909> I'd

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
there's your case there another way I'd

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.819 
there's your case there another way I'd
like<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.299> try<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.540> teach<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.049> it's<00:03:30.409> just<00:03:30.500> if

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
like to try to teach it is it's just if

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.140 
like to try to teach it is it's just if
you're<00:03:31.010> standing<00:03:31.370> up<00:03:31.430> which<00:03:31.639> is<00:03:31.790> your<00:03:32.030> way

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
you're standing up which is your way

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.030 
you're standing up which is your way

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
stance you're going to use all you have

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.309 
stance you're going to use all you have
to<00:03:35.090> do<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.269> imagine<00:03:35.419> picking<00:03:35.780> your<00:03:35.930> belt<00:03:36.139> up

to do is imagine picking your belt up

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.050 
to do is imagine picking your belt up
and<00:03:36.470> just<00:03:36.560> go<00:03:36.620> in<00:03:36.799> like<00:03:36.949> that<00:03:36.979> just<00:03:37.699> pick<00:03:37.849> it<00:03:37.879> up

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
and just go in like that just pick it up

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.879 
and just go in like that just pick it up
and<00:03:38.239> moving<00:03:38.599> movie<00:03:39.109> your<00:03:39.229> belt<00:03:39.409> buckle<00:03:39.470> your

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
and moving movie your belt buckle your

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.409 
and moving movie your belt buckle your
belly<00:03:40.040> button<00:03:40.340> about<00:03:40.519> no<00:03:40.790> more<00:03:40.970> than<00:03:41.090> one<00:03:41.209> inch

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
belly button about no more than one inch

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.180 
belly button about no more than one inch
alright<00:03:42.139> so<00:03:42.290> that's<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.530> pre-loaded<00:03:42.859> heavy

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
alright so that's a pre-loaded heavy

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.460 
alright so that's a pre-loaded heavy
right<00:03:43.400> concept<00:03:43.819> alright<00:03:44.599> so<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.169> question

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
right concept alright so the question

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.119 
right concept alright so the question
becomes<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:47.169> think<00:03:48.169> the<00:03:48.319> problems<00:03:48.739> will<00:03:48.889> come

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
becomes I think the problems will come

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.860 
becomes I think the problems will come
from<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.639> is<00:03:49.819> that<00:03:50.000> if<00:03:50.150> your<00:03:50.299> way<00:03:50.479> if<00:03:50.720> your

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
from that is is that if your way if your

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.990 
from that is is that if your way if your
feet<00:03:51.139> are<00:03:51.349> in<00:03:51.829> a<00:03:51.919> prim<00:03:52.220> proper<00:03:52.400> place<00:03:52.790> even

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
feet are in a prim proper place even

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.309 
feet are in a prim proper place even
when<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.299> get<00:03:53.449> pre-loaded<00:03:53.900> heavy<00:03:54.049> right

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
when you get pre-loaded heavy right

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.750 
when you get pre-loaded heavy right
you're<00:03:54.889> going<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.099> have<00:03:55.159> problems<00:03:55.430> with<00:03:55.609> your

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
you're going to have problems with your

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.490 
you're going to have problems with your
backswing<00:03:56.180> where<00:03:56.359> once<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:56.959> start<00:03:57.199> to<00:03:57.349> make

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
backswing where once you start to make

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.499 
backswing where once you start to make
your<00:03:57.709> weight<00:03:58.159> shift<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.549> turn<00:03:58.729> you<00:03:59.359> could

00:03:59.499 --> 00:03:59.509 
your weight shift and turn you could

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.509 
your weight shift and turn you could
find<00:03:59.750> yourself<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.650> could<00:04:00.829> find<00:04:01.040> yourself<00:04:01.129> if

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
find yourself you could find yourself if

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.710 
find yourself you could find yourself if
the<00:04:01.609> foot<00:04:01.819> stun<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.150> too<00:04:02.269> much<00:04:02.419> as<00:04:02.540> soon<00:04:02.659> as

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
the foot stun you too much as soon as

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.119 
the foot stun you too much as soon as
you<00:04:02.810> turn<00:04:03.019> you're<00:04:03.199> losing<00:04:03.500> your<00:04:03.620> balance<00:04:03.769> and

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
you turn you're losing your balance and

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.670 
you turn you're losing your balance and
so<00:04:04.669> therefore<00:04:04.909> you'll<00:04:05.810> almost<00:04:05.989> make<00:04:06.259> no<00:04:06.439> turn

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
so therefore you'll almost make no turn

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.949 
so therefore you'll almost make no turn
and<00:04:06.859> in<00:04:07.549> fact<00:04:07.729> probably<00:04:08.060> use<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.509> half<00:04:08.810> the

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
and in fact probably use a half the

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.869 
and in fact probably use a half the
floyd<00:04:09.199> push<00:04:09.439> forward<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:09.829> little<00:04:09.949> bit<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.669> not

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
floyd push forward a little bit to not

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.789 
floyd push forward a little bit to not
fall<00:04:11.120> backwards<00:04:11.569> so<00:04:12.049> that's<00:04:12.319> why<00:04:12.470> it's<00:04:12.500> so

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
fall backwards so that's why it's so

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.770 
fall backwards so that's why it's so
critical<00:04:12.829> that<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:14.060> that's<00:04:14.239> your<00:04:14.449> foot<00:04:14.629> be

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
critical that that that's your foot be

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.649 
critical that that that's your foot be
in<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.409> proper<00:04:15.739> place<00:04:15.889> again<00:04:16.759> right<00:04:17.030> here<00:04:17.269> so

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:17.659 
in the proper place again right here so

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.479 
in the proper place again right here so
that<00:04:17.870> what<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.590> little<00:04:18.769> turn<00:04:18.979> we<00:04:19.099> do<00:04:19.280> make

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
that what the little turn we do make

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.460 
that what the little turn we do make
your<00:04:19.909> right<00:04:20.090> on<00:04:20.239> inside<00:04:20.959> centre<00:04:21.259> of<00:04:21.349> your

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
bikes tends to to to flex a little bit

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.070 
bikes tends to to to flex a little bit
more<00:04:31.759> as<00:04:31.880> i<00:04:31.970> call<00:04:32.120> sitter<00:04:32.419> sink<00:04:32.690> in<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.900> back

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
push up and forward when I transition

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.640 
push up and forward when I transition
when<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.580> ring<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.909> bell<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:38.090> bump<00:04:38.590> ok<00:04:39.590> so

when I ring the bell and bump ok so

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.500 
when I ring the bell and bump ok so
that's<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.070> key<00:04:40.250> yeah<00:04:40.909> a<00:04:40.940> lot<00:04:41.180> of<00:04:41.330> bad<00:04:41.479> things

could<00:04:41.840> happen<00:04:41.900> if

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
could happen if

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.989 
could happen if
foots<00:04:42.559> under<00:04:42.770> you<00:04:42.830> too<00:04:42.979> much<00:04:43.129> just<00:04:43.580> as<00:04:43.729> well<00:04:43.879> if

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:43.999 
foots under you too much just as well if

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.109 
foots under you too much just as well if
it's<00:04:44.149> too<00:04:44.300> wide<00:04:44.569> you<00:04:45.229> have<00:04:45.889> to<00:04:46.069> sway<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.699> very

00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:47.119 
it's too wide you have to sway and very

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:49.149 
it's too wide you have to sway and very
likely<00:04:47.360> in<00:04:47.599> swaying<00:04:47.899> to<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.229> and<00:04:48.770> turning

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
likely in swaying to it and turning

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.249 
likely in swaying to it and turning
which<00:04:49.669> allows<00:04:49.879> more<00:04:50.089> turn<00:04:50.330> very<00:04:50.509> likely<00:04:50.749> your

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
which allows more turn very likely your

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.510 
which allows more turn very likely your
leg<00:04:51.439> will<00:04:51.589> likely<00:04:51.770> straighten<00:04:52.189> up<00:04:52.249> and<00:04:52.399> push

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
leg will likely straighten up and push

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.389 
leg will likely straighten up and push
you<00:04:52.669> forward<00:04:52.939> so<00:04:53.360> I<00:04:53.389> don't<00:04:53.719> really<00:04:53.809> see<00:04:54.399> again

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:55.399 
you forward so I don't really see again

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:56.950 
you forward so I don't really see again
you<00:04:55.550> could<00:04:55.789> its<00:04:55.969> way<00:04:56.240> all<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.449> way<00:04:56.539> to<00:04:56.659> it<00:04:56.869> and

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
you could its way all the way to it and

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.100 
you could its way all the way to it and
lose<00:04:57.139> your<00:04:57.319> weight<00:04:57.439> and<00:04:57.649> but<00:04:58.309> I<00:04:58.539> I<00:04:59.539> think<00:04:59.990> that

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
lose your weight and but I I think that

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.749 
lose your weight and but I I think that
I<00:05:00.139> see<00:05:00.379> more<00:05:00.619> often<00:05:00.949> with<00:05:01.129> people<00:05:01.279> trying<00:05:01.610> to

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
I see more often with people trying to

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.399 
I see more often with people trying to
do<00:05:01.969> the<00:05:02.360> peak<00:05:02.539> performance<00:05:02.990> set<00:05:03.110> up<00:05:03.229> which

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
do the peak performance set up which

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:04.989 
do the peak performance set up which
means<00:05:03.559> to<00:05:03.710> feed<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:03.919> narrower<00:05:04.279> they<00:05:04.729> actually

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:04.999 
means to feed a narrower they actually

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:06.429 
means to feed a narrower they actually
have<00:05:05.119> the<00:05:05.210> foot<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:05.599> unto<00:05:05.899> them<00:05:06.050> rather<00:05:06.319> than

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:06.439 
have the foot to unto them rather than

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.589 
have the foot to unto them rather than
to<00:05:06.680> outside<00:05:07.069> but<00:05:07.879> either<00:05:07.969> way<00:05:08.180> that's<00:05:08.300> a<00:05:08.419> big

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
to outside but either way that's a big

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.899 
to outside but either way that's a big
problem<00:05:08.809> but<00:05:09.409> I<00:05:09.439> see<00:05:09.830> more<00:05:10.039> of<00:05:10.159> the<00:05:10.279> fleet<00:05:10.759> the

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
problem but I see more of the fleet the

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.459 
problem but I see more of the fleet the
feet<00:05:11.089> to<00:05:11.240> now<00:05:11.419> especially<00:05:11.869> the<00:05:12.110> back<00:05:12.259> foot

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:12.469 
feet to now especially the back foot

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:14.429 
feet to now especially the back foot
alright<00:05:13.039> so<00:05:13.219> get<00:05:13.399> that<00:05:13.430> back<00:05:13.759> foot<00:05:13.939> directly

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:14.439 
alright so get that back foot directly

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.199 
alright so get that back foot directly
from<00:05:15.439> the<00:05:15.559> shoulder<00:05:15.860> socket<00:05:16.219> the<00:05:16.789> shaft<00:05:17.029> comes

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:17.209 
from the shoulder socket the shaft comes

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:18.699 
from the shoulder socket the shaft comes
right<00:05:17.419> down<00:05:17.569> touches<00:05:17.959> a<00:05:17.990> knee<00:05:18.169> to<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:18.349> senator

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:18.709 
right down touches a knee to the senator

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:20.109 
right down touches a knee to the senator
foot<00:05:18.919> and<00:05:19.159> I<00:05:19.279> think<00:05:19.490> you'll<00:05:19.610> find<00:05:19.669> that<00:05:19.909> you'll

00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:20.119 
foot and I think you'll find that you'll

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:21.449 
foot and I think you'll find that you'll
be<00:05:20.240> able<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:20.389> make<00:05:20.479> that<00:05:20.539> a<00:05:20.839> nice<00:05:21.199> little

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:21.459 
be able to make that a nice little

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
be able to make that a nice little
intermittent<00:05:22.459> up<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.639> tree<00:05:22.849> turn<00:05:23.059> with<00:05:23.449> the

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
intermittent up the tree turn with the

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.510 
intermittent up the tree turn with the
sinking<00:05:23.899> onto<00:05:24.169> the<00:05:24.259> onto<00:05:24.709> the<00:05:24.860> back<00:05:25.099> leg<00:05:25.339> so

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
sinking onto the onto the back leg so

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.790 
sinking onto the onto the back leg so
you<00:05:25.580> can<00:05:25.789> you<00:05:26.240> can<00:05:26.360> have<00:05:26.449> a<00:05:26.509> good<00:05:26.689> stable<00:05:26.959> turn

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
you can you can have a good stable turn

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.980 
you can you can have a good stable turn
and<00:05:28.159> again<00:05:28.459> if<00:05:28.580> you're<00:05:28.699> doing<00:05:28.939> this<00:05:29.059> to<00:05:29.330> make

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
and again if you're doing this to make

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.899 
and again if you're doing this to make
too<00:05:30.169> big<00:05:30.199> a<00:05:30.379> turn<00:05:30.649> is<00:05:30.800> going<00:05:30.949> to<00:05:31.009> help<00:05:31.129> is<00:05:31.580> going

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:31.909 
too big a turn is going to help is going

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:33.189 
too big a turn is going to help is going
to<00:05:31.969> very<00:05:32.149> likely<00:05:32.330> pull<00:05:32.629> you<00:05:32.719> out<00:05:32.839> of<00:05:32.959> balance

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
to very likely pull you out of balance

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.959 
to very likely pull you out of balance
so<00:05:33.559> that's<00:05:33.709> why<00:05:33.860> this<00:05:33.919> position<00:05:34.430> is<00:05:34.550> also<00:05:34.849> very

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
so that's why this position is also very

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.429 
so that's why this position is also very
good<00:05:35.209> in<00:05:35.389> that<00:05:35.719> making<00:05:36.020> sure<00:05:36.139> that<00:05:36.289> you're

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:36.439 
good in that making sure that you're

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.350 
good in that making sure that you're
very<00:05:36.709> likely<00:05:36.919> it'll<00:05:37.459> help<00:05:37.610> you<00:05:37.729> not<00:05:37.849> overturn

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
very likely it'll help you not overturn

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.820 
very likely it'll help you not overturn
and<00:05:38.599> not<00:05:38.749> overswing<00:05:39.139> because<00:05:39.169> you'll<00:05:39.709> lose

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
and not overswing because you'll lose

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.290 
and not overswing because you'll lose
your<00:05:40.009> balance<00:05:40.159> so<00:05:40.759> you<00:05:40.849> just<00:05:40.969> get<00:05:41.119> in<00:05:41.209> that

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
your balance so you just get in that

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.760 
your balance so you just get in that
position<00:05:41.419> you<00:05:41.749> push<00:05:42.020> off<00:05:42.199> and<00:05:42.229> swing<00:05:42.589> through

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
position you push off and swing through

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.709 
position you push off and swing through
and<00:05:42.800> hit<00:05:43.339> the<00:05:43.459> ball<00:05:43.610> more<00:05:43.759> solid<00:05:44.119> straight<00:05:44.300> and

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:44.719 
and hit the ball more solid straight and

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.929 
and hit the ball more solid straight and
shoot<00:05:45.349> those<00:05:45.559> low<00:05:45.680> scores<00:05:46.039> well<00:05:46.669> that's<00:05:46.819> it

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:46.939 
shoot those low scores well that's it

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:48.699 
shoot those low scores well that's it
for<00:05:47.059> today<00:05:47.300> for<00:05:47.629> the<00:05:47.719> surge<00:05:47.930> and<00:05:48.469> i'll<00:05:48.589> be

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:48.709 
for today for the surge and i'll be

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:51.370 
for today for the surge and i'll be
talking<00:05:48.889> all<00:05:49.129> again<00:05:49.339> soon
