00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:09.446
 Today, more than half of the world's population 

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:11.366
 lives in urban areas. 

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.694
 At the middle of the century, it will reach 70%. 

00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:16.782
 But only 100 years ago, 

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.491
 only 2 out of 10 people lived in cities, 

00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:21.615
 and before that, even less. 

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:22.700
 How have we reached 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.785
 similar level of urbanization 

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:27.180
 and what does it mean for the future? 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.250
 At the beginning of the history of mankind, 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.000
 humans were hunter-gatherers, 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.709
 often changing place 

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:34.645
 Looking for food. 

00:00:35.153 --> 00:00:36.744
 But 10 000 years ago, 

00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:38.831
 our ancestors began to learn the secrets 

00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:40.204
 of selective cultivation 

00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:42.612
 and rudimentary agricultural techniques. 

00:00:42.612 --> 00:00:43.881
 For the first time, 

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:45.113
 people could cultivate, 

00:00:45.113 --> 00:00:46.555
 instead of looking for food 

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:47.938
 and I am gave rise to the development 

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:49.521
 of semi-permanent settlements 

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:51.775
 for the first time in history. 

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:54.271
 They will ask themselves: Why semi-permanent? 

00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.036
 Well, at the beginning, the villages still had to move 

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:58.460
 After a few years 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.441
 because the fertility of the earth decreased. 

00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:02.329
 Only with the arrival of techniques 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.502
 like watering and tilling the earth 

00:01:04.502 --> 00:01:06.044
 about 5000 years ago 

00:01:06.044 --> 00:01:07.664
 people could depend on a provision 

00:01:07.664 --> 00:01:09.501
 of stable and long-term food, 

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.913
 making permanent settlements possible. 

00:01:11.913 --> 00:01:13.434
 And with the surplus of food 

00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:15.056
 who generated these techniques 

00:01:15.056 --> 00:01:17.595
 it was no longer necessary for everyone to be cattle ranchers. 

00:01:17.595 --> 00:01:18.992
 This allowed the development 

00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:20.680
 of other specialized trades, 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.906
 and, therefore, of the cities. 

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:25.986
 With cities producing surplus food 

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:26.974
 and tools, 

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:27.438
 Utensils 

00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:28.572
 and other goods, 

00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:30.509
 now there was the possibility of trade 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.405
 and the interaction at greater distances. 

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:34.742
 And, as commerce flourishes, 

00:01:34.742 --> 00:01:37.549
 so did the technologies that facilitated it, 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.467
 like cars, 

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:40.901
 boats, 

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:41.962
 roads, 

00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:43.154
 and ports. 

00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:45.320
 Of course, these things required even more labor 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.789
 to be built and maintained, 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:47.987
 so more people migrated 

00:01:47.987 --> 00:01:49.794
 from the countryside to the cities 

00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:51.247
 having more jobs available 

00:01:51.247 --> 00:01:52.960
 and opportunities. 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.141
 If you think that modern cities are overcrowded, 

00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:56.461
 you will be surprised to know 

00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.906
 that some cities in 2000 BC doubled 

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:03.909
 the population density of Shanghai or Calcutta. 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:04.902
 One of the reasons 

00:02:04.902 --> 00:02:07.524
 is that there were not many means of transportation available 

00:02:07.524 --> 00:02:10.150
 so he should be able to walk everywhere, 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.156
 including the few foci of clean water 

00:02:12.156 --> 00:02:13.774
 that existed then. 

00:02:13.774 --> 00:02:15.407
 The territory of the city 

00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:17.648
 it was even more restricted by the need for walls 

00:02:17.648 --> 00:02:20.116
 to defend it from attacks. 

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:22.990
 The Roman Empire was able to develop infrastructures 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.043
 to overcome these limitations 

00:02:25.043 --> 00:02:26.327
 but other than that, 

00:02:26.327 --> 00:02:27.628
 modern cities as we know them 

00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:28.943
 they did not exist 

00:02:28.943 --> 00:02:30.940
 until the Industrial Revolution, 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.697
 when the technology used on a large scale 

00:02:33.697 --> 00:02:36.386
 allowed cities to expand and integrate, 

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:37.672
 creating police departments 

00:02:37.672 --> 00:02:38.271
 firefighters 

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.782
 and health, 

00:02:39.782 --> 00:02:41.342
 as well as road networks, 

00:02:41.342 --> 00:02:43.815
 and, later, distribution of electricity. 

00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:46.572
 So, what is the future of cities? 

00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:49.475
 The world population now exceeds 7 billion 

00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:52.227
 and it is expected to reach 10 billion. 

00:02:52.227 --> 00:02:53.730
 The majority of this growth will occur 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.023
 in the urban areas of the poorest countries. 

00:02:57.023 --> 00:02:58.943
 So, how do cities change? 

00:02:58.943 --> 00:03:01.134
 to adapt to this growth? 

00:03:01.134 --> 00:03:03.309
 First, the world must find the way 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:04.754
 to provide enough food, 

00:03:04.754 --> 00:03:05.714
 health 

00:03:05.714 --> 00:03:07.954
 and education for all. 

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.831
 Second, growth must occur 

00:03:09.831 --> 00:03:11.713
 so that it does not harm the earth 

00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:13.796
 that brings us the goods and services 

00:03:13.796 --> 00:03:16.513
 that maintain humanity. 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.590
 Production could move 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.713
 to vertical farms and skyscrapers, 

00:03:20.713 --> 00:03:21.795
 gardens on the roofs, 

00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:24.272
 or empty parking lots in city centers, 

00:03:24.272 --> 00:03:25.802
 at the same time that the energy will proceed more and more 

00:03:25.802 --> 00:03:28.689
 of various sources of renewable energy. 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.728
 Instead of single-family homes, 

00:03:30.728 --> 00:03:33.338
 more vertical residences will be built. 

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.299
 We could get to see buildings with everything 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.616
 what people need for their daily life, 

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.579
 and also smaller and self-sufficient cities 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.701
 focused on local and sustainable production. 

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:44.794
 The future of cities is diverse, 

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:45.466
 malleable 

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:46.328
 and creative, 

00:03:46.328 --> 00:03:48.593
 not already developed around a single industry 

00:03:48.593 --> 00:03:50.968
 but reflecting a world more and more 

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:53.087
 connected and global.
