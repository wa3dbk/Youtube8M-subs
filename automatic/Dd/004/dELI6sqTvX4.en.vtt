00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
I'm going to replace a battery on the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.990 
I'm going to replace a battery on the
2007<00:00:04.620> Maxima<00:00:05.220> remote<00:00:06.170> for<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.230> car<00:00:07.849> so<00:00:08.849> it's

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
2007 Maxima remote for the car so it's

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.190 
2007 Maxima remote for the car so it's
pretty<00:00:09.210> easy<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.570> don't<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.960> bring<00:00:10.080> this

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
pretty easy you don't have to bring this

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.720 
pretty easy you don't have to bring this
to<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.769> dealership<00:00:11.130> or<00:00:11.370> anything<00:00:11.519> like<00:00:11.670> that

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
to the dealership or anything like that

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.509 
to the dealership or anything like that
and<00:00:12.120> they're<00:00:12.929> gonna<00:00:13.049> probably<00:00:13.380> over<00:00:13.860> charge

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
and they're gonna probably over charge

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.150 
and they're gonna probably over charge
you<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:15.000> bring<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.330> over<00:00:15.360> there<00:00:16.010> so<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.130> just

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
you you bring it over there so it just

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060 
you you bring it over there so it just
uses<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.850> battery<00:00:18.330> right<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.930> its<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
uses this battery right here on its the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.450 
uses this battery right here on its the
to<00:00:20.340> zero<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.820> five<00:00:21.410> cr2025<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.250> at

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
to zero to five cr2025 to get this at

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.880 
to zero to five cr2025 to get this at
probably<00:00:24.330> CVS<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:25.199> Walmart

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
probably CVS or Walmart

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.529

wherever<00:00:26.519> they<00:00:26.640> sell<00:00:26.880> batteries<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:27.480> I

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
wherever they sell batteries but I

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.410 
wherever they sell batteries but I
probably<00:00:28.320> recommend<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.609> CVS<00:00:30.090> because

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420

I can't hold the camera and do this at

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.119 
I can't hold the camera and do this at
the<00:00:58.199> same<00:00:58.350> time<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.100> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the same time so I'm just going to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:16.630 
the same time so I'm just going to
quickly<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.579> it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.420 

so<00:01:17.240> it's<00:01:17.360> just<00:01:17.740> puncture<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:18.770> didn't<00:01:21.280> kind<00:01:22.280> of

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
so it's just puncture I didn't kind of

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.390 
so it's just puncture I didn't kind of
get<00:01:22.550> it<00:01:22.640> all<00:01:22.760> down<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.330> slightly<00:01:23.990> open<00:01:24.500> so

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
get it all down so it slightly open so

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.370 
get it all down so it slightly open so
you<00:01:25.490> look<00:01:25.640> at<00:01:25.760> it<00:01:25.790> now<00:01:25.940> just<00:01:26.470> slightly<00:01:27.470> open<00:01:27.800> so

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
you look at it now just slightly open so

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.810 
you look at it now just slightly open so
you<00:01:30.380> have<00:01:30.590> nails<00:01:30.950> over<00:01:31.250> anything<00:01:31.430> in<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:31.700> so

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
you have nails over anything in that so

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.370 
you have nails over anything in that so
you<00:01:31.850> could<00:01:32.030> use<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.210> screwdriver<00:01:32.510> to<00:01:32.960> continue

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
you could use a screwdriver to continue

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.800 
you could use a screwdriver to continue
opening<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.770> up<00:01:33.890> but<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.190> have<00:01:34.370> nails<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:37.780> see<00:01:38.780> I

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
opening it up but I have nails so see I

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.300 
opening it up but I have nails so see I
could<00:01:39.140> just<00:01:39.320> punch<00:01:39.590> my<00:01:39.770> new<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.070> then<00:01:40.190> just

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
could just punch my new and then just

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.540 
could just punch my new and then just
open<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.670> up<00:01:40.790> yeah<00:01:41.510> get<00:01:41.690> out<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:42.220> pretty<00:01:43.220> simple

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
open it up yeah get out it pretty simple

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.290 
open it up yeah get out it pretty simple
actually<00:01:43.970> so<00:01:44.210> um<00:01:45.310> this<00:01:46.310> promote<00:01:46.700> where<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:47.000> has

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
actually so um this promote where it has

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.900 
actually so um this promote where it has
a<00:01:47.560> computer<00:01:48.560> chip<00:01:48.740> on<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:49.369> it<00:01:49.580> recognizes

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
a computer chip on it so it recognizes

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.630 
a computer chip on it so it recognizes
your<00:01:50.330> um<00:01:50.780> your<00:01:51.470> settings<00:01:51.890> for<00:01:51.950> your<00:01:52.160> seat<00:01:52.430> and
