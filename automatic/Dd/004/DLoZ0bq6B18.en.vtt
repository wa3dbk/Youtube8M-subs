00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
simple question for you the virtual

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.330 
simple question for you the virtual
gravity<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> most<00:00:22.410> successful<00:00:22.619> bowling

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
gravity was the most successful bowling

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.550 
gravity was the most successful bowling
ball<00:00:23.519> storm<00:00:23.910> has<00:00:24.029> ever<00:00:24.180> made<00:00:24.410> how<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.470> you

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
ball storm has ever made how do you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.650 
ball storm has ever made how do you
improve<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.130> kind<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.400> success<00:00:26.660> well

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
improve on that kind of success well

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.970 
improve on that kind of success well
that's<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.960> tough<00:00:28.140> thing<00:00:28.320> Randy<00:00:28.650> because<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
that's a tough thing Randy because you

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.310 
that's a tough thing Randy because you
know<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.189> try<00:00:29.490> really<00:00:29.760> hard<00:00:30.019> to<00:00:31.019> find<00:00:31.230> that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
know we try really hard to find that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
know we try really hard to find that
next<00:00:31.529> level<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.890> performance<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.969> virtual

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
next level of performance in a virtual

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.540 
next level of performance in a virtual
gravity<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.020> by<00:00:34.620> far<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.950> best<00:00:35.190> ball<00:00:35.399> we've

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
gravity is by far the best ball we've

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.060 
gravity is by far the best ball we've
ever<00:00:35.700> made<00:00:35.940> most<00:00:36.420> successful<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.980> you

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
ever made most successful and so you

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.470 
ever made most successful and so you
have<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.399> take<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:38.969> good<00:00:39.180> look<00:00:39.300> at

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
have to take a really good look at

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.600 
have to take a really good look at
design<00:00:40.170> development<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.920> try<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> figure<00:00:41.489> out

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
design development and try to figure out

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.150 
design development and try to figure out
what<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.719> improve<00:00:42.809> upon<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.290> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
what can we do to improve upon that so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.080 
what can we do to improve upon that so
we<00:00:44.250> know<00:00:44.370> we're<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.850> really<00:00:44.969> want

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
we know we're not going to really want

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.660 
we know we're not going to really want
to<00:00:45.180> poop<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> core<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> next<00:00:47.280> level<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to poop on the core so the next level is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.020 
to poop on the core so the next level is
cover<00:00:48.059> stuff<00:00:48.440> well<00:00:49.489> Luud<00:00:50.489> did<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> lot<00:00:50.910> of

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
cover stuff well Luud did a lot of

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.939 
cover stuff well Luud did a lot of
research<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.719> found<00:00:51.930> something<00:00:52.320> very<00:00:52.739> very

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
research we found something very very

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.880 
research we found something very very
special<00:00:53.570> brought<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> market<00:00:55.379> now

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
special brought it to the market now

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.170 
special brought it to the market now
we're<00:00:56.010> gonna<00:00:56.100> call<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.399> virtual<00:00:56.550> gravity<00:00:56.940> nano

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
we're gonna call it virtual gravity nano

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.290 
we're gonna call it virtual gravity nano
take<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.629> same<00:00:57.899> great<00:00:58.230> cord<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.890> used

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
take that same great cord that we used

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.819 
take that same great cord that we used
and<00:01:00.300> put<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> new<00:01:00.690> cover<00:01:00.960> stock<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> whole<00:01:01.710> new

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
and put a new cover stock on a whole new

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.460 
and put a new cover stock on a whole new
base<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.730> special<00:01:03.270> additive<00:01:03.690> gives<00:01:04.350> us

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
base and a special additive gives us

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.320 
base and a special additive gives us
even<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:04.769> traction<00:01:05.250> very<00:01:05.880> very<00:01:06.180> unique

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
virtual gravity nano I got to know more

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.490 
virtual gravity nano I got to know more
about<00:01:09.689> this

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.450 

biggest<00:01:18.500> thing<00:01:18.590> about<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.830> virtual<00:01:19.130> gravity

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
biggest thing about a virtual gravity

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.649 
biggest thing about a virtual gravity
nano<00:01:19.670> is<00:01:19.880> it's<00:01:20.060> something<00:01:20.390> quite<00:01:20.630> unique

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
nano is it's something quite unique

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.870 
nano is it's something quite unique
first<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.470> all<00:01:21.590> it's<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.250> very<00:01:22.280> new<00:01:22.640> base

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
first of all it's a very new base

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.700 
first of all it's a very new base
reactive<00:01:23.630> material<00:01:24.050> something<00:01:24.380> that's<00:01:24.530> never

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
reactive material something that's never

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.160 
reactive material something that's never
been<00:01:24.890> seen<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.340> marketplace<00:01:25.700> before

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
been seen in the marketplace before

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.080 
been seen in the marketplace before
something<00:01:27.170> that<00:01:27.320> that<00:01:27.680> chemistry<00:01:28.160> a<00:01:28.460> very<00:01:28.940> new

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
something that that chemistry a very new

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.850 
something that that chemistry a very new
isocyanate<00:01:29.750> chemistry<00:01:30.229> something<00:01:30.470> that<00:01:30.710> is

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
isocyanate chemistry something that is

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.290 
isocyanate chemistry something that is
very<00:01:31.490> very<00:01:31.640> special

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
very very special

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.000 
very very special
but<00:01:32.659> we<00:01:32.750> found<00:01:32.900> a<00:01:33.050> special<00:01:33.560> additive

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
but we found a special additive

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.500 
but we found a special additive
something<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:34.760> creates<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:35.270> little<00:01:35.420> more

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
something that creates a little more

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.990 
something that creates a little more
subsurface<00:01:36.110> texture<00:01:36.740> something<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.790> gives

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
subsurface texture something that gives

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.780 
subsurface texture something that gives
us<00:01:38.590> durability<00:01:39.590> longevity<00:01:40.280> something<00:01:40.490> we've

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
us durability longevity something we've

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.550 
us durability longevity something we've
never<00:01:41.420> seen<00:01:41.750> before<00:01:41.930> in<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.259> bullying

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
never seen before in the bullying

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.290 
never seen before in the bullying
industry<00:01:42.890> we<00:01:43.369> feel<00:01:43.610> it's<00:01:43.790> like<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.119> next

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
industry we feel it's like the next

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.840 
industry we feel it's like the next
generation<00:01:44.990> we<00:01:45.650> saw<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:46.190> know<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.400> angle<00:01:46.580> of

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
generation we saw you know the angle of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.359 
generation we saw you know the angle of
the<00:01:46.940> 1980s<00:01:47.690> be<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.350> first<00:01:48.590> thing<00:01:48.800> in<00:01:48.920> urethane

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
the 1980s be the first thing in urethane

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.029 
the 1980s be the first thing in urethane
and<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:49.759> set<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.390> bowling<00:01:50.810> industry<00:01:51.229> on<00:01:51.830> its

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
and and set the bowling industry on its

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.830 
and and set the bowling industry on its
knees<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.280> then<00:01:52.610> all<00:01:52.729> of<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.880> sudden<00:01:53.119> in<00:01:53.210> 91<00:01:53.660> we

saw<00:01:53.990> an<00:01:54.080> Excalibur<00:01:54.470> come<00:01:54.920> out<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.369> it<00:01:56.090> mark

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
saw an Excalibur come out and it mark

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.450 
saw an Excalibur come out and it mark
McDowell<00:01:56.990> makes<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.410> shot<00:01:57.619> peel<00:01:57.890> off<00:01:58.039> you

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
McDowell makes the shot peel off you

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.279 
McDowell makes the shot peel off you
know<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.729> two<00:01:58.910> board<00:01:59.149> down<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.509> lane<00:01:59.690> and<00:01:59.930> go

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
know the two board down the lane and go

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.719 
know the two board down the lane and go
high<00:02:00.440> flush<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.920> everybody<00:02:01.220> went<00:02:01.430> what<00:02:01.670> in

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
high flush and everybody went what in

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.730 
high flush and everybody went what in
the<00:02:01.789> world<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.869> we<00:02:03.289> feel<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:03.530> the

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
the world is that and we feel that the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.529 
the world is that and we feel that the
virtual<00:02:04.009> gravity<00:02:04.340> nano<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:04.729> really<00:02:05.270> really

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
virtual gravity nano is really really

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.139 
virtual gravity nano is really really
that<00:02:06.320> next<00:02:06.710> step<00:02:06.950> something<00:02:07.670> that's<00:02:07.910> going<00:02:08.090> to

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
that next step something that's going to

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:19.399 
that next step something that's going to
make<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.690> bowling<00:02:09.080> world<00:02:09.259> go<00:02:09.470> WOW

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.539 

so<00:02:20.409> Hank<00:02:20.650> for<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.890> average<00:02:21.040> League<00:02:21.400> bowlers

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
so Hank for the average League bowlers

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.699 
so Hank for the average League bowlers
out<00:02:21.879> there<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.510> had<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> lot<00:02:23.049> of<00:02:23.079> success<00:02:23.560> with

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
out there that had a lot of success with

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.699 
out there that had a lot of success with
the<00:02:23.890> virtual<00:02:24.280> gravity<00:02:24.900> what<00:02:25.900> are<00:02:26.170> some<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.620> the

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
the virtual gravity what are some of the

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.050 
the virtual gravity what are some of the
differences<00:02:27.220> they're<00:02:27.459> going<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.760> see<00:02:27.909> with

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
differences they're going to see with

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.089 
differences they're going to see with
the<00:02:28.150> new<00:02:28.299> virtual<00:02:28.629> gravity<00:02:29.200> nano<00:02:29.439> the<00:02:29.860> biggest

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
the new virtual gravity nano the biggest

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.050 
the new virtual gravity nano the biggest
thing<00:02:30.189> they're<00:02:30.310> going<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.459> see<00:02:30.640> on<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.879> Nano

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
thing they're going to see on the Nano

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.280 
thing they're going to see on the Nano
is<00:02:31.299> something<00:02:31.629> that's<00:02:31.780> going<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:31.989> give<00:02:32.140> them

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
is something that's going to give them

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.619 
is something that's going to give them
that<00:02:32.769> same<00:02:33.069> type<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.519> motion<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.180> core<00:02:34.390> motion

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
that same type of motion the core motion

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.869 
that same type of motion the core motion
but<00:02:35.019> all<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.379> sudden<00:02:35.709> down<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.700> lane

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
but all of a sudden down the lane

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:37.770 
but all of a sudden down the lane
they're<00:02:37.060> gonna<00:02:37.150> see<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.390> little<00:02:37.569> bit<00:02:37.720> more

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
they're gonna see a little bit more

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.210 
they're gonna see a little bit more
motion<00:02:38.049> a<00:02:38.260> little<00:02:38.349> bit<00:02:38.530> more<00:02:38.650> off<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.920> spot

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
motion a little bit more off the spot

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.890 
motion a little bit more off the spot
something<00:02:39.819> that<00:02:39.940> kind<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.150> peels<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.569> pattern

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
something that kind of peels the pattern

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.660 
something that kind of peels the pattern
apart<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.440> really<00:02:41.950> gives<00:02:42.129> them<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.430> lot<00:02:42.609> more

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
apart and really gives them a lot more

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.300 
apart and really gives them a lot more
angle<00:02:43.269> down<00:02:43.720> Lane<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.590> even<00:02:44.799> as<00:02:44.920> they<00:02:45.069> move

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
angle down Lane and even as they move

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.970 
angle down Lane and even as they move
and<00:02:45.579> they<00:02:45.670> keep<00:02:45.849> moving<00:02:46.599> left<00:02:46.810> or<00:02:47.109> if<00:02:47.590> you're<00:02:47.709> a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
and they keep moving left or if you're a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.920 
and they keep moving left or if you're a
left-hander<00:02:48.459> moving<00:02:48.700> right<00:02:48.879> ball<00:02:49.569> just<00:02:49.780> keeps

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
left-hander moving right ball just keeps

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.210 
left-hander moving right ball just keeps
coming<00:02:50.109> back<00:02:50.379> where<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.680> virtual<00:02:50.829> gravity

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
coming back where the virtual gravity

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.009 
coming back where the virtual gravity
might<00:02:51.370> slow<00:02:51.609> down<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.819> little<00:02:52.030> bit<00:02:52.180> boy<00:02:52.840> this

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
might slow down a little bit boy this

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.420 
might slow down a little bit boy this
one<00:02:53.140> just<00:02:53.290> keeps<00:02:53.470> coming<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.950> subsurface

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
one just keeps coming that subsurface

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.260 
one just keeps coming that subsurface
profile<00:02:54.970> Wow<00:02:55.690> something<00:02:56.139> different
