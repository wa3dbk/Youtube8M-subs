the<00:02:42.510> other<00:02:42.689> one<00:02:42.750> was<00:02:42.959> outside<00:02:43.109> upgrading<00:02:43.829> I

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
the other one was outside upgrading I

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.860 
the other one was outside upgrading I
think<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.760> one<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.150> all<00:02:45.329> red<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:45.840> and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
think and this one is all red here and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.080 
think and this one is all red here and
it's<00:02:46.290> not<00:02:46.829> anywhere<00:02:47.250> near<00:02:47.310> me<00:02:47.549> so<00:02:47.700> air

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
it's not anywhere near me so air

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.569 
it's not anywhere near me so air
sweepers<00:02:48.480> didn't<00:02:48.780> matter<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.530> raid<00:02:49.799> I<00:02:50.069> think

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
sweepers didn't matter this raid I think

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.860 
sweepers didn't matter this raid I think
in<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.700> future<00:02:50.849> air<00:02:51.209> sweepers<00:02:51.569> are<00:02:51.690> going<00:02:51.810> to

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
in the future air sweepers are going to

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.039 
in the future air sweepers are going to
matter<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.139> lot<00:02:52.849> when<00:02:53.849> you're<00:02:54.030> using<00:02:54.239> loons<00:02:54.840> and

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
matter a lot when you're using loons and

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.680 
matter a lot when you're using loons and
hay<00:02:55.139> spells<00:02:55.440> but<00:02:56.340> eventually<00:02:56.609> that<00:02:57.150> hay<00:02:57.420> spell

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
hay spells but eventually that hay spell

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.589 
hay spells but eventually that hay spell
when<00:02:57.900> it's<00:02:58.049> maxed<00:02:58.560> it's<00:02:59.400> gonna<00:02:59.579> have<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.150> much

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
when it's maxed it's gonna have so much

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.569 
when it's maxed it's gonna have so much
speed<00:03:00.989> increase<00:03:01.379> it<00:03:01.920> might<00:03:02.069> not<00:03:02.220> even<00:03:02.250> matter

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
speed increase it might not even matter

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.640 
speed increase it might not even matter

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
problem is that central Archer Queen but

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.869 
problem is that central Archer Queen but
she's<00:04:06.180> level<00:04:06.510> one<00:04:07.129> kind<00:04:08.129> of<00:04:08.280> thinking<00:04:08.579> we<00:04:08.730> can

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
yeah

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.670 
yeah
eleven<00:04:33.180> spells<00:04:33.450> so<00:04:35.600> we<00:04:36.600> get<00:04:36.720> that<00:04:36.930> no<00:04:37.200> we<00:04:37.530> can

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
eleven spells so we get that no we can

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.950 
eleven spells so we get that no we can
not<00:04:37.890> looks<00:04:38.190> like<00:04:38.310> it's<00:04:38.460> almost<00:04:38.850> time<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.690> drop

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
not looks like it's almost time to drop

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.530 
not looks like it's almost time to drop
our<00:04:40.170> troops<00:04:40.440> there's<00:04:40.650> no<00:04:40.890> more<00:04:41.540> free

buildings<00:04:43.140> here<00:04:43.520> so<00:04:44.520> I<00:04:45.000> think<00:04:45.510> we<00:04:45.780> might<00:04:46.080> have

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.590 
buildings here so I think we might have
a<00:04:46.260> lava<00:04:46.530> hound<00:04:46.740> in<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.890> clan<00:04:47.070> castle<00:04:47.600> let's

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
should right I remember rage spells had

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.530 
should right I remember rage spells had
a<00:06:06.390> little<00:06:06.720> clause<00:06:07.110> in<00:06:07.440> them<00:06:07.620> that<00:06:07.800> said<00:06:08.540> that

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
a little clause in them that said that

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.450 
a little clause in them that said that
they<00:06:09.750> won't<00:06:10.020> speed<00:06:10.410> up<00:06:10.530> heroes<00:06:10.919> as<00:06:11.130> much<00:06:11.310> as

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
they won't speed up heroes as much as

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.700 
they won't speed up heroes as much as
they<00:06:11.610> speed<00:06:11.820> up<00:06:11.850> troops<00:06:12.320> maybe<00:06:13.320> that's<00:06:13.560> the

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
they speed up troops maybe that's the

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.380 
they speed up troops maybe that's the
same<00:06:13.860> case<00:06:14.070> maybe<00:06:14.310> it's<00:06:14.520> not<00:06:14.669> I'm<00:06:14.790> not<00:06:15.210> really

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
same case maybe it's not I'm not really

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
same case maybe it's not I'm not really
sure<00:06:15.830> anyways<00:06:16.970> good<00:06:17.970> loot<00:06:18.240> and<00:06:18.480> I'm<00:06:19.110> pretty

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.140 
farming with it I'm thinking if I stick
to<00:06:25.560> bases<00:06:25.980> like<00:06:26.100> this<00:06:26.280> I<00:06:26.430> can<00:06:26.640> do<00:06:26.700> pretty<00:06:26.880> good

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
to bases like this I can do pretty good

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.110 
to bases like this I can do pretty good
with<00:06:27.300> this<00:06:27.390> army<00:06:27.750> only<00:06:28.740> problem<00:06:29.220> is<00:06:29.400> I<00:06:29.669> can't

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
with this army only problem is I can't

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.150 
with this army only problem is I can't
use<00:06:30.240> this<00:06:30.360> many<00:06:30.570> spells<00:06:30.840> every<00:06:31.080> time<00:06:31.260> you<00:06:32.040> know

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
use this many spells every time you know

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.490 
use this many spells every time you know
using<00:06:32.490> six<00:06:32.760> spells<00:06:33.000> five<00:06:33.330> or<00:06:33.510> six<00:06:33.660> spells<00:06:33.870> it's

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
using six spells five or six spells it's

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.480 
using six spells five or six spells it's
not<00:06:34.650> going<00:06:34.800> to<00:06:34.860> cut<00:06:35.010> it<00:06:35.039> because<00:06:35.160> they're<00:06:35.460> too

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
not going to cut it because they're too

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.460 
not going to cut it because they're too
expensive<00:06:35.760> and<00:06:36.210> they<00:06:36.270> take<00:06:36.450> too<00:06:36.600> long<00:06:36.780> but<00:06:37.080> all

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
expensive and they take too long but all

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.560 
expensive and they take too long but all
in<00:06:37.770> all<00:06:37.890> I<00:06:38.100> do<00:06:38.220> think<00:06:38.820> even<00:06:39.210> though<00:06:39.300> about<00:06:39.419> hey

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
in all I do think even though about hey

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.380 
in all I do think even though about hey
spells<00:06:39.840> were<00:06:39.990> level

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
spells were level

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.320 
spells were level
one<00:06:40.510> there<00:06:41.260> a<00:06:41.290> massive<00:06:41.890> help<00:06:42.130> they<00:06:42.610> work<00:06:42.880> so

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
one there a massive help they work so

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.710 
one there a massive help they work so
well<00:06:43.600> but<00:06:43.810> with<00:06:44.140> balloons<00:06:44.530> and<00:06:44.830> even<00:06:45.720> just

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
well but with balloons and even just

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.930 
well but with balloons and even just
having<00:06:46.930> a<00:06:47.140> couple<00:06:47.500> would<00:06:47.890> massively<00:06:48.580> help

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
having a couple would massively help

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.600 
having a couple would massively help
your<00:06:49.120> balloons<00:06:49.420> get<00:06:50.170> in<00:06:50.410> quicker<00:06:51.070> I<00:06:51.400> mean

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
your balloons get in quicker I mean

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.460 
your balloons get in quicker I mean
that's<00:06:51.880> the<00:06:52.090> main<00:06:52.390> problem<00:06:52.810> with<00:06:52.840> balloons<00:06:53.230> is

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
that's the main problem with balloons is

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.560 
that's the main problem with balloons is
they're<00:06:53.620> so<00:06:53.770> slow<00:06:54.100> so<00:06:55.000> if<00:06:55.060> we<00:06:55.120> can<00:06:55.240> speed<00:06:55.450> them

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.570 
they're so slow so if we can speed them
