00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
interesting to see is as we he's gonna

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.770 
interesting to see is as we he's gonna
be<00:01:01.129> a<00:01:01.160> little<00:01:01.339> bit<00:01:01.579> more<00:01:01.850> passive<00:01:02.480> I<00:01:02.570> would

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
be a little bit more passive I would

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.180 
be a little bit more passive I would
have<00:01:02.899> thought<00:01:03.140> these<00:01:03.379> teams<00:01:03.710> know<00:01:03.859> there's

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
have thought these teams know there's

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.430 
have thought these teams know there's
only<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.430> few<00:01:04.670> kills<00:01:04.970> in<00:01:05.120> it<00:01:05.239> look<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:06.110> see<00:01:06.260> this

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
only a few kills in it look to see this

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.020 
only a few kills in it look to see this
time<00:01:06.710> if<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:06.950> see<00:01:07.190> someone<00:01:07.400> pushing<00:01:07.850> top

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
time if you see someone pushing top

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.090 
time if you see someone pushing top
turbine<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:08.720> gain<00:01:08.930> control<00:01:09.470> of<00:01:09.500> that<00:01:09.740> plasma

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
turbine and gain control of that plasma

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.830 
turbine and gain control of that plasma
