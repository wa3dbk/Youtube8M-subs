that's me now I'm gonna show you must
make<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> paper<00:00:12.000> airplane<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.599> was<00:00:12.719> sent<00:00:12.990> in

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
make a paper airplane that was sent in

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.259 
make a paper airplane that was sent in
to<00:00:13.590> me<00:00:13.620> from<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.219> guy<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.400> America<00:00:14.910> called

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
to me from a guy in America called

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.560 
to me from a guy in America called
Dimitri<00:00:16.220> and<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.400> been<00:00:17.550> an<00:00:17.670> unusual<00:00:17.789> take<00:00:18.330> on

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
Dimitri and it's been an unusual take on

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.260 
Dimitri and it's been an unusual take on
the<00:00:18.930> plastic<00:00:19.350> does<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.920> very<00:00:20.520> similar<00:00:20.850> plane

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the plastic does so very similar plane

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.630 
the plastic does so very similar plane
to<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.140> classic<00:00:22.529> dot<00:00:22.710> if<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.980> want<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.279> give

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
to the classic dot if you want to give

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.349 
to the classic dot if you want to give
that<00:00:23.820> when<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.000> go<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:25.430> just<00:00:26.430> again<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.910> camera

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
that when I go to just again the camera

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.280 
that when I go to just again the camera
lined<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:30.289> there<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.410> go<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
lined up there we go so this is what the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.979 
lined up there we go so this is what the
plane<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.340> look<00:00:35.550> like<00:00:35.809> when<00:00:36.809> it's

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
plane is going to look like when it's

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.840 
plane is going to look like when it's
done<00:00:37.430> as<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.730> see<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.480> plastic<00:00:40.230> duck

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
done as you can see to the plastic duck

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.290 
done as you can see to the plastic duck
one<00:00:41.850> side<00:00:43.129> bit<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.219> an<00:00:44.309> unusual<00:00:44.579> take<00:00:45.030> though

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
one side bit of an unusual take though

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.350 
one side bit of an unusual take though
on<00:00:45.600> how<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.140> make<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.770> place<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.399> unlike

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
on how to make this place so unlike

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.060 
on how to make this place so unlike
normally<00:00:48.840> follow<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> plane<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.620> half<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
normally follow the plane in half and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.260 
normally follow the plane in half and
then<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> fall<00:00:50.430> down<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.640> wings<00:00:50.910> has<00:00:51.090> gone

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
then you fall down the wings has gone

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.410 
then you fall down the wings has gone
the<00:00:51.960> idea<00:00:52.289> with<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.649> plane<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:54.000> fold<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the idea with this plane is to fold the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.020 
the idea with this plane is to fold the
wings<00:00:54.660> down<00:00:54.780> first<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:56.460> what<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.670> want<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> do

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
wings down first so what you want to do

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.729 
wings down first so what you want to do
is<00:00:57.180> start<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.620> corner<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.370> and<00:01:00.739> making

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
is start from the corner here and making

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.889 
is start from the corner here and making
sure<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.129> hold<00:01:02.340> sort<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> corner<00:01:03.539> nice

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
sure you hold sort of the corner nice

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.210 
sure you hold sort of the corner nice
and<00:01:04.140> tight<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.769> line<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:06.200> this<00:01:07.200> tip<00:01:07.710> from<00:01:08.040> this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and tight you line up this tip from this

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.609 
and tight you line up this tip from this
side<00:01:08.549> over<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.750> line<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.350> side

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
side over here to line up with the side

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.000 
side over here to line up with the side
with<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> corner<00:01:11.820> held<00:01:12.060> down<00:01:12.330> tight<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.110> then

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
with the corner held down tight and then

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.950 
with the corner held down tight and then
you<00:01:14.790> make<00:01:15.000> your<00:01:15.030> creases<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.110> way<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
you make your creases that way so as you

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.499 
you make your creases that way so as you
can<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.470> there<00:01:19.740> what's<00:01:20.520> happened<00:01:21.000> at<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> top

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
can see there what's happened at the top

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.920 
can see there what's happened at the top
is<00:01:22.229> definitely<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.420> exactly

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
is definitely not that we have exactly

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.410 
is definitely not that we have exactly
halfway<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:25.860> very<00:01:26.400> much<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> half<00:01:27.210> way

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
halfway that's very much not a half way

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.020 
halfway that's very much not a half way
across<00:01:27.689> split<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.170> anything's<00:01:28.560> sort<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.579> 2/3

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
across split if anything's sort of 2/3

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.670 
across split if anything's sort of 2/3
it's<00:01:30.299> maybe<00:01:30.509> maybe<00:01:30.960> even<00:01:31.079> better<00:01:31.320> three

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
it's maybe maybe even better three

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.289 
it's maybe maybe even better three
fifths<00:01:32.100> or<00:01:32.250> something<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> way<00:01:32.970> across

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
fifths or something of the way across

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.960 
fifths or something of the way across
there<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> first<00:01:34.979> part<00:01:35.189> now

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
there so that's the first part now

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.399 
there so that's the first part now
change<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.420> slightly<00:01:36.600> think<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> way<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.259> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
change it slightly think the way that I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170 
change it slightly think the way that I
do<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> diagrams<00:01:38.490> what<00:01:38.850> I'd<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
do it in the diagrams what I'd like to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.249 
do it in the diagrams what I'd like to
do<00:01:39.509> now<00:01:40.100> is<00:01:41.100> actually<00:01:41.369> open<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> up<00:01:42.210> make<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
do now is actually open it up make the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.859 
do now is actually open it up make the
paper<00:01:43.470> flat<00:01:43.799> again<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> same

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
paper flat again and then do the same

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.179 
paper flat again and then do the same
with<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.229> other<00:01:46.439> side

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
with the other side

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.760 
with the other side
I<00:01:47.659> found<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> much<00:01:49.320> easier<00:01:49.350> way

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
I found that this is a much easier way

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.130 
I found that this is a much easier way
to<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> fall<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.299> correct<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.869> stage

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
to get the fall to correct at this stage

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.260 
to get the fall to correct at this stage
because<00:01:53.100> before<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.640> was<00:01:53.759> very

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
because before I was very

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.190 
because before I was very
right<00:01:55.600> so<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:56.590> just<00:01:56.619> bring<00:01:57.070> this<00:01:57.219> across<00:01:58.200> just

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
right so you just bring this across just

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.660 
right so you just bring this across just
like<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.060> you've<00:02:01.299> reached<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.869> right

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
like so so that you've reached the right

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.399 
like so so that you've reached the right
hand<00:02:03.670> they're<00:02:03.880> just<00:02:04.060> tip<00:02:04.329> just<00:02:04.630> touches<00:02:05.259> the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
hand they're just tip just touches the

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.419 
hand they're just tip just touches the
line<00:02:05.789> there<00:02:07.289> hold<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.440> now<00:02:08.590> flat<00:02:08.950> make<00:02:09.280> sure

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
line there hold that now flat make sure

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.410 
line there hold that now flat make sure
the<00:02:09.550> corners<00:02:09.970> done<00:02:10.239> and<00:02:11.230> then<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:12.760> crease<00:02:13.180> it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
the corners done and then just crease it

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.619 
the corners done and then just crease it
across<00:02:13.750> again<00:02:14.160> nice<00:02:15.330> solid<00:02:16.330> cream<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:19.480> can

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
across again nice solid cream you can

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:26.880 
across again nice solid cream you can
see<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:19.930> for<00:02:20.170> me<00:02:20.319> too<00:02:20.799> nice<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.890> in

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
see is for me too nice like this this in

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.559 
see is for me too nice like this this in
the<00:02:27.099> paper<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:30.280> next<00:02:30.549> step<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.209> it's<00:02:31.360> back<00:02:31.540> to

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
the paper the next step so it's back to

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.839 
the paper the next step so it's back to
comport<00:02:32.110> look<00:02:32.319> what's<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.769> website<00:02:32.950> you

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
comport look what's on the website you

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.460 
comport look what's on the website you
bring<00:02:34.030> this<00:02:34.120> over<00:02:34.329> and<00:02:34.660> then<00:02:35.019> what<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.319> want

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
bring this over and then what you want

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.819 
bring this over and then what you want
to<00:02:35.500> do<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.829> fold<00:02:36.130> down<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.489> pre<00:02:37.090> crease<00:02:37.450> line

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
to do is fold down a pre crease line

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.770 
to do is fold down a pre crease line
keeping<00:02:38.829> the<00:02:39.150> tip<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.390> other<00:02:40.510> piece<00:02:40.750> of

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
keeping the tip of the other piece of

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.470 
keeping the tip of the other piece of
paper<00:02:41.049> in<00:02:41.349> there<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:42.310> fold<00:02:42.940> along<00:02:43.269> that

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
paper in there and just fold along that

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.650 
paper in there and just fold along that
line<00:02:43.660> precreased<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:45.790> produce<00:02:45.940> busy<00:02:46.390> shape

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
line precreased to produce busy shape

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.690 
line precreased to produce busy shape
now<00:02:47.500> you've<00:02:47.620> got<00:02:47.769> this<00:02:47.829> massive<00:02:48.099> overhang

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
now you've got this massive overhang

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.979 
now you've got this massive overhang
here<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:49.630> want

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
here you want

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.870 
here you want
as<00:02:50.290> always<00:02:50.590> with<00:02:50.890> all<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.130> planes<00:02:51.400> -<00:02:51.549> what's<00:02:51.730> a

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
as always with all the planes - what's a

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.369 
as always with all the planes - what's a
waiter<00:02:52.090> than<00:02:52.299> this<00:02:52.390> this<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.870> really<00:02:53.079> great

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
waiter than this this is really great

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.530 
waiter than this this is really great
because<00:02:53.680> what<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.099> means<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.329> wrap

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
because what it means is you can wrap

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.920 
because what it means is you can wrap
this<00:02:55.780> around<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.220> turn<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.610> over<00:02:57.760> use<00:02:58.599> that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
this around so you turn it over use that

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.289 
this around so you turn it over use that
edge<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.440> guide<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.670> then<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.940> fold<00:03:01.150> it

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
edge of the guide and then you fold it

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.949 
edge of the guide and then you fold it
right<00:03:01.950> tight<00:03:02.950> along<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.489> edge<00:03:03.730> just<00:03:04.690> like

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
right tight along that edge just like

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.830 
right tight along that edge just like
that<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:05.739> mean<00:03:06.700> it's<00:03:06.850> on<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.060> plane<00:03:07.239> over<00:03:07.359> again

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
that I mean it's on the plane over again

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.190 
that I mean it's on the plane over again
and<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.769> one<00:03:09.280> last<00:03:09.519> time<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:10.180> loop<00:03:10.900> that

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
and just one last time you loop that

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.470 
and just one last time you loop that
piece<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.620> paper<00:03:11.829> around<00:03:12.329> until<00:03:13.329> you've

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
piece of paper around until you've

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.289 
piece of paper around until you've
produced<00:03:13.780> this<00:03:14.019> nice<00:03:14.440> bit<00:03:14.950> whoops<00:03:15.730> there's<00:03:16.209> a

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
produced this nice bit whoops there's a

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.229 
produced this nice bit whoops there's a
nice<00:03:16.480> bit<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.870> extra<00:03:17.440> weight<00:03:17.739> at<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:18.790> front<00:03:19.120> of

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
nice bit of extra weight at the front of

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.259 
nice bit of extra weight at the front of
the<00:03:19.299> plane<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:20.530> from<00:03:20.769> your<00:03:21.000> supported<00:03:22.000> area

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
the plane so from your supported area

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.629 
the plane so from your supported area
like<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:23.250> plane<00:03:24.250> over<00:03:24.670> for<00:03:25.450> once<00:03:25.859> turn<00:03:26.859> over

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
like this plane over for once turn over

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.140 
like this plane over for once turn over
fold<00:03:28.359> again<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:29.829> you've<00:03:30.069> got<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.549> pretty<00:03:31.060> good

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
fold again and you've got a pretty good

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.379 
fold again and you've got a pretty good
outline<00:03:31.599> shape<00:03:32.849> pretty<00:03:33.849> obvious<00:03:34.180> what<00:03:34.299> you're

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
outline shape pretty obvious what you're

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.150 
outline shape pretty obvious what you're
going<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.569> do<00:03:34.690> next<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.170> is<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.319> dark<00:03:35.829> shape

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
going to do next this is a dark shape

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.890 
going to do next this is a dark shape
very<00:03:36.519> similar<00:03:36.910> as<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.090> said<00:03:37.299> before<00:03:37.480> it's<00:03:37.810> the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
very similar as I said before it's the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.140 
very similar as I said before it's the
classic<00:03:38.139> dot<00:03:38.470> all<00:03:39.370> you're<00:03:39.609> going<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.819> do<00:03:40.000> is

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
classic dot all you're going to do is

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.080 
classic dot all you're going to do is
fold<00:03:40.359> it<00:03:40.480> in<00:03:40.599> half<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:41.109> create<00:03:41.139> the<00:03:41.440> fuselage

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
fold it in half to create the fuselage

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.980 
fold it in half to create the fuselage
so<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.150> want<00:03:43.389> to<00:03:43.450> line<00:03:43.599> up<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.840> two<00:03:44.169> wings

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:04:01.950 

the<00:03:49.990> front<00:03:56.610> this<00:03:58.350> then<00:03:59.350> slowly<00:04:00.250> crease<00:04:00.960> all

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
the front this then slowly crease all

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.020 
the front this then slowly crease all
the<00:04:02.440> way<00:04:02.560> down<00:04:02.800> plane<00:04:05.490> it's<00:04:06.490> really<00:04:06.730> looking

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
the way down plane it's really looking

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.420 
the way down plane it's really looking
like<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.210> dump<00:04:07.540> at<00:04:07.720> this<00:04:07.870> stage<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.890> last<00:04:09.160> thing

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
like a dump at this stage and last thing

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.090 
like a dump at this stage and last thing
to<00:04:09.580> do<00:04:09.760> is<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.090> fold<00:04:10.330> down<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.660> wings<00:04:11.020> so<00:04:12.010> you

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
to do is to fold down the wings so you

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.460 
to do is to fold down the wings so you
take<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:12.430> top<00:04:12.760> edge<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.780> run<00:04:13.990> its<00:04:14.140> little

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
take this top edge you run its little

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:27.990 
take this top edge you run its little
line<00:04:14.650> at<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:14.890> bottom<00:04:15.070> fuselage<00:04:15.850> I<00:04:23.460> think<00:04:27.000> this

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
line at the bottom fuselage I think this

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.910 
line at the bottom fuselage I think this
play<00:04:28.210> doesn't<00:04:28.600> really<00:04:28.810> have<00:04:29.080> any<00:04:29.560> aerodynamic

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
play doesn't really have any aerodynamic

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.640 
play doesn't really have any aerodynamic
qualities<00:04:31.350> intentionally<00:04:32.350> you're<00:04:32.440> just

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
qualities intentionally you're just

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.260 
qualities intentionally you're just
creating<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:33.190> ballistic<00:04:33.670> object<00:04:34.090> that<00:04:34.180> you're

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
creating a ballistic object that you're

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.330 
creating a ballistic object that you're
going<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.480> throw<00:04:34.690> followed<00:04:35.620> in<00:04:36.280> that

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
going to throw followed in that

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.490 
going to throw followed in that
parabolic<00:04:37.030> trajectory<00:04:37.540> maybe<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.840> tiny<00:04:38.200> little

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
parabolic trajectory maybe a tiny little

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.370 
parabolic trajectory maybe a tiny little
extra<00:04:38.860> light<00:04:39.070> but<00:04:39.310> not<00:04:39.490> much<00:04:39.990> it's<00:04:40.990> really

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
extra light but not much it's really

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:54.360

good he's sort of a hard and fast who
did<00:04:54.850> this<00:04:55.030> one<00:04:55.290> experiment<00:04:56.290> where<00:04:56.470> he<00:04:56.530> used<00:04:56.710> to

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
did this one experiment where he used to

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.680 
did this one experiment where he used to
put<00:04:57.040> a<00:04:57.720> sheep<00:04:58.890> made<00:04:59.890> out<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.310> wool<00:05:00.700> that<00:05:01.450> had

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
put a sheep made out of wool that had

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.830 
put a sheep made out of wool that had
been<00:05:01.930> soaked<00:05:02.890> in<00:05:03.300> nitric<00:05:04.300> acid<00:05:04.630> and<00:05:04.660> sulfuric

been soaked in nitric acid and sulfuric

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.050 
been soaked in nitric acid and sulfuric
acid<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.590> turn<00:05:05.860> it<00:05:06.010> into<00:05:06.160> nitrocellulose

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
acid to turn it into nitrocellulose

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.000 
acid to turn it into nitrocellulose
which<00:05:07.419> is<00:05:07.540> very<00:05:07.720> explosive<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:08.380> then<00:05:08.950> he

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
which is very explosive and then he

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.980 
which is very explosive and then he
painted<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.669> with<00:05:09.790> TriMet<00:05:10.270> R'lyeh<00:05:10.600> dye<00:05:10.810> which

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
painted it with TriMet R'lyeh dye which

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.620 
painted it with TriMet R'lyeh dye which
is<00:05:11.020> highly<00:05:11.680> unstable<00:05:12.300> substance<00:05:13.300> if<00:05:13.540> you

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
is highly unstable substance if you

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.140 
is highly unstable substance if you
touch<00:05:13.810> it<00:05:13.930> with<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.080> feather<00:05:14.640> it<00:05:15.640> would<00:05:15.790> explode

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
touch it with a feather it would explode

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.270 
touch it with a feather it would explode
