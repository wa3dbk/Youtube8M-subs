I had it for Xbox but I think if you

I had it for Xbox but I think if you
have<00:00:57.539> an<00:00:57.629> xbox<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.019> ps3<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.769> same

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
have an xbox and ps3 you have the same

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.040 
have an xbox and ps3 you have the same
game<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.390> one's<00:01:00.629> hard<00:01:00.870> an

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
game this one I think this one's hard an

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.349 
game this one I think this one's hard an
Xbox<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.800> truth<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.609> hard<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.120> don't<00:01:03.269> know

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
Xbox the truth it's hard I don't know

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.870 
Xbox the truth it's hard I don't know
like<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> controller<00:01:04.379> already<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.190> ps3<00:01:05.640> it's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
like the controller already and ps3 it's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.870 
like the controller already and ps3 it's
easier<00:01:06.300> and<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.690> get<00:01:07.020> more<00:01:07.380> kills<00:01:07.890> than<00:01:08.190> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
easier and I get more kills than the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850 
easier and I get more kills than the
Xbox<00:01:09.210> version<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:10.170> know<00:01:10.259> funny
