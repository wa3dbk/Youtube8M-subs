about<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> week<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.870> ago<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.379> wasn't<00:01:04.799> quite

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
about a week or so ago I wasn't quite

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.410 
about a week or so ago I wasn't quite
sure<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.549> because<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.090> thought<00:01:06.270> they

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
sure what it was because I thought they

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.840 
sure what it was because I thought they
were<00:01:06.479> very<00:01:06.600> small<00:01:07.130> but<00:01:08.130> they<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.400> grow<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.640> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
were very small but they can grow up to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.890 
were very small but they can grow up to
about<00:01:08.939> 8<00:01:09.299> millimeters<00:01:09.900> or<00:01:10.140> roughly<00:01:11.630> 3/8<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.780> an

plate<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:17.159> montipora<00:01:18.950> I'm<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
plate of this montipora I'm going to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:30.240 
plate of this montipora I'm going to
zoom<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.970> show<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.990> new<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.350> break

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.370 

once<00:01:31.250> what<00:01:31.549> you'll<00:01:31.700> see<00:01:31.880> right<00:01:32.030> here<00:01:32.259> as<00:01:33.259> soon

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
once what you'll see right here as soon

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.910 
once what you'll see right here as soon
as<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.590> focus<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.189> is<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:36.110> large<00:01:36.320> new<00:01:36.590> tuberank

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
as I focus it is the large new tuberank

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.830 
as I focus it is the large new tuberank
as<00:01:37.189> well<00:01:38.090> as<00:01:38.560> smaller<00:01:39.560> white<00:01:39.950> dots<00:01:40.659> which<00:01:41.659> are

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
as well as smaller white dots which are

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.639 
as well as smaller white dots which are
actually<00:01:42.289> little<00:01:42.619> clutches<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.130> eggs<00:01:44.649> these

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
actually little clutches of eggs these

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.580 
actually little clutches of eggs these
neuter<00:01:46.009> Brinks<00:01:46.539> from<00:01:47.539> my<00:01:47.689> understanding<00:01:47.929> can

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
neuter Brinks from my understanding can

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.620 
neuter Brinks from my understanding can
reproduce<00:01:48.920> asexually

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
reproduce asexually

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.950 
reproduce asexually
so<00:01:51.170> one<00:01:51.590> new<00:01:51.829> tuberank<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:53.450> has<00:01:53.720> been

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
so one new tuberank that has been

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.160 
so one new tuberank that has been
fertilized<00:01:54.560> in<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.920> past<00:01:55.539> can<00:01:56.539> produce<00:01:56.810> eggs

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
fertilized in the past can produce eggs

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.469 
fertilized in the past can produce eggs
without<00:01:58.039> a<00:01:58.280> second<00:01:58.850> neuter<00:01:59.030> break<00:01:59.210> in<00:01:59.390> the

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
without a second neuter break in the

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.370 
without a second neuter break in the
system<00:02:00.880> this<00:02:01.880> small<00:02:02.179> area<00:02:02.450> here<00:02:02.810> above<00:02:03.140> where

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
the large neuter brink is there is dead

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.999 
the large neuter brink is there is dead
coral<00:02:06.979> tissue<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.080> politics<00:02:09.500> tension<00:02:09.890> on

my<00:02:10.130> coral<00:02:10.630> is<00:02:11.630> still<00:02:11.989> good<00:02:12.519> so<00:02:13.599> hopefully<00:02:14.599> I've

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
my coral is still good so hopefully I've

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.670 
my coral is still good so hopefully I've
caught<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.400> soon<00:02:16.400> enough<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.500> one<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.590> the
