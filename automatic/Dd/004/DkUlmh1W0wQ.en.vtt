00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.820 

many<00:05:34.700> times<00:05:35.060> don't<00:05:35.510> drop<00:05:35.750> these<00:05:36.050> hot<00:05:36.350> rods<00:05:36.650> a

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
many times don't drop these hot rods a

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.010

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
lot lower to the ground and do what they

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.890 
lot lower to the ground and do what they
call<00:05:39.230> slamming<00:05:39.800> to<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.490> car<00:05:40.700> and<00:05:41.000> so<00:05:41.570> what

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
call slamming to the car and so what

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.390 
call slamming to the car and so what
that<00:05:41.930> means<00:05:42.290> is<00:05:42.410> that<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:42.740> frame<00:05:43.010> of<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.220> car

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
that means is that the frame of the car

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.760 
that means is that the frame of the car
is<00:05:43.640> going<00:05:44.000> to<00:05:44.060> touch<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.570> floor<00:05:44.810> in<00:05:45.440> order<00:05:45.710> to

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
is going to touch the floor in order to

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.320 
is going to touch the floor in order to
make<00:05:45.980> the<00:05:46.130> car<00:05:46.340> seem<00:05:46.610> like<00:05:46.790> it's<00:05:46.940> just<00:05:47.090> sitting

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
make the car seem like it's just sitting

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.820 
make the car seem like it's just sitting
on<00:05:47.420> the<00:05:47.540> ground<00:05:47.720> although<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:48.260> tires<00:05:48.470> are<00:05:48.680> on

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
on the ground although the tires are on

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.920 
on the ground although the tires are on
it<00:05:49.010> and<00:05:49.160> so<00:05:49.670> usually<00:05:50.090> they'll<00:05:50.270> be<00:05:50.390> hydraulics

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
it and so usually they'll be hydraulics

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.960 
it and so usually they'll be hydraulics
or<00:05:51.020> airbags<00:05:51.470> that<00:05:51.710> will<00:05:51.830> pick<00:05:51.980> the<00:05:52.100> car<00:05:52.310> up<00:05:52.340> in
