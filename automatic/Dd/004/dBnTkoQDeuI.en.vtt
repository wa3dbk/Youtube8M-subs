 [Music] 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.790

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.220
 comfortable in the sacristy here in Breton 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.830

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.329
 something father but maybe a little sheep 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.720

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.220
 God and his holy commandments is more 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.800

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.460
 conversations and you will see how I have nothing 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.040
 that hide by is a good place sir 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.650

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.650

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.880
 the sacristy 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.220
 here nothing nothing nothing but it has the 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.120
 person who approaches who seems to be 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.870
 very distressed from a grave 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.900
 I would like that if I right now as he said 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.420
 jingoist nothing, sir, bishop, nothing 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.720

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.720
 days 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.220
 today I can not confess pity because 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.220
 not because you do not come back in a year 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.240
 the one who blames it and the cabbage of boredom and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.090
 shoot over my soul like the fog in 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.570
 a wheat field and why do you say that chabelita 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.570
 now 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.119
 the father of this man in me the seed 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.040
 of a road network objection to that 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.040
 now he reconciles me father 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.390
 what obsession is that candle that everything 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.210
 started yesterday when the lord comes 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.820
 bishop to give the mass half of the saint 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.820

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.560
 I was here, I'm fine, I'm stopping 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.790
 to dance 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.980
 what a great impression I thought that what 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.000
 would be bigger because how are you doing? 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.000
 big key 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.770

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.110
 and still questions because I hit you 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.820

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.820
 size has Mr. Bishop 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.850

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.420

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.420

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.250
 philistine 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.110
 the whole church we have seen it 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.110

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.970

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.459
 greengrocery 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.220

 Sir, what awaits me good and in what 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.680
 consists your lack of a key in addition to 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.780
 to be watching what does not concern you 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.370

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.780

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.780

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.260

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.909
 which is also that for money 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.200

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.200
