 well seasoned 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.730
 with garlic salt and I love the salt away 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.640
 one of my favorite things and a little 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.110
 of pepper if they feel that garlic salt

 to go putting our apart I put my to 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.380
 As I have a comal and I add a 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.600
 little olive oil a few drops 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.990
 nothing else so that he is not going to stick the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.820
 chicken and I will not burn and what I did 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.160
 was to stir my chicken that is already assumed 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.840
 as they were previously given 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.270
 What will I do ? 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.880
 the same evil 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.170
 ahead you can only observe the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.170
 illicit landmarks 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.680
 fifth oil we let go and we're going to 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.960
 continue with the preparation of our 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.119
 cream when we start to see that 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.970
 our chicken establishing ads and 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:59.720
 in this way medium and granite we are going to 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:01.790
 go turning to burn and also 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.350
 very careful after the chicken is not us 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.350
 go manolo a long time ago 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.180
 now we are going to pass the part to do 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.820
 our cream for and we will need 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.550
 our dates that are already finally biting 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.770
 You can not see and it's not for Carlos 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.190
 alpaca reason to attend and pickles 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:28.020
 little kids and media has been cited in 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.020
 delicious and this take 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.230
 and we will also need our 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.850
 butter let's put in our 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.790
 skillet 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.970
 that I have to go heating up we're going to 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.440
 put a tablespoon of butter and it 's 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.070
 listen now butter we're going to 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.830
 add our easy ones and us to 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.650
 step to say that we are achieving that 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.710
 appreciate how you can appreciate we are going to 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.490
 add our creams 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.490
 this grass 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.409
 for an average two or three people 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.409
 patita 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.010
 Sharmarke three parts being more but 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.010
 whatever you want to call it 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.870
 and we are going to do 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.549
 and the chicken on this side we can go 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.549
 turning off 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.060
 that's what they live here, we're going to add 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.420
 also our weights that is the same 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.420
 quantity 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.599
 of cream 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:57.230
 we put on a slow fire because you already know 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.230
 that this can burn very fast 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.840
 and to finish and season add 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.010
 a little salt of garlic or normal salt the 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.440
 that you like a little pepper 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.390
 and as I think it's a little bit 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.350
 thick for my taste I'm going to add a 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.910
 minimal trickle of milk so you do not 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.540
 it's so thick it's a little bit more 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.540
 hold 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.280
 already with this we already finished what comes 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.310
 being the basics of the recipe this is the 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.370
 sauce with which we are going to serve the chicken 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.650
 It has a very rich sweet and sour taste and 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.199
 I'm going to teach you how to serve 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.620
 dish good friends then if we have one 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.020
 recipe served at the end this is couscous 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.300
 which prepares them in a video that 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.160
 see you go up with this one so that you do not 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.270
 lose the recipe is a way to make 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:58.539
 it's a very simple way to do 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:01.550
 we can say that rice one then 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:03.590
 variation is similar to rice but not 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.060
 it is but it is delicious the truth that yes already 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.249
 for one they can save you a little bit of 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.569
 tomato 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:14.539
 and some lemon juice in the part 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:18.139
 above if you like them and the truth is that 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.689
 it is delicious I recommend it a thousand times 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.429
 I hope you like it to prove anything 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.479
 the chicken served the sauce 

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:29.379
