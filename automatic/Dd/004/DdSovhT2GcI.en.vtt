today<00:00:14.980> we're<00:00:15.129> talking<00:00:15.219> about<00:00:15.520> starting

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
today we're talking about starting

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.010 
today we're talking about starting
plants<00:00:16.360> from<00:00:16.510> seed<00:00:16.840> I<00:00:17.140> like<00:00:17.470> going<00:00:17.650> right<00:00:17.949> into

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
plants from seed I like going right into

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.910 
plants from seed I like going right into
something<00:00:20.020> like<00:00:20.110> this<00:00:20.260> that<00:00:20.410> has<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.680> trays

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
something like this that has the trays

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.380 
something like this that has the trays
and<00:00:20.949> then<00:00:21.279> you<00:00:21.340> can<00:00:21.490> grow<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:22.060> plants

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
and then you can grow the plants

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.640 
and then you can grow the plants
individually<00:00:22.960> and<00:00:23.110> then<00:00:23.200> you<00:00:23.260> just<00:00:23.410> pull<00:00:23.560> them

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
individually and then you just pull them

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.600 
individually and then you just pull them
right<00:00:23.710> out<00:00:23.830> of<00:00:23.950> here<00:00:24.100> put<00:00:24.280> them<00:00:24.400> into<00:00:24.490> the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
right out of here put them into the

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.280 
right out of here put them into the
garden<00:00:24.880> so<00:00:25.270> this<00:00:25.390> has<00:00:25.600> holes<00:00:25.870> in<00:00:26.020> it<00:00:26.110> for

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
garden so this has holes in it for

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.140 
garden so this has holes in it for
drainage<00:00:26.650> then<00:00:27.160> I<00:00:27.250> can<00:00:27.400> plop<00:00:27.670> it<00:00:27.850> into<00:00:27.970> this

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
drainage then I can plop it into this

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.870 
drainage then I can plop it into this
guy<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.890> doesn't<00:00:30.190> have<00:00:30.310> holes<00:00:30.520> in<00:00:30.670> it<00:00:30.790> and

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
guy which doesn't have holes in it and

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.490 
guy which doesn't have holes in it and
that<00:00:31.120> can<00:00:31.330> capture<00:00:31.540> the<00:00:31.780> water<00:00:31.930> so<00:00:32.200> that's<00:00:32.349> how

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
that can capture the water so that's how

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.029 
that can capture the water so that's how
that<00:00:32.559> works

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
that works

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.440 
that works
in<00:00:33.100> terms<00:00:33.340> of<00:00:33.489> what<00:00:33.579> kind<00:00:33.730> of<00:00:33.789> potting<00:00:34.149> mix<00:00:34.329> you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
in terms of what kind of potting mix you

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.240 
in terms of what kind of potting mix you
use<00:00:34.690> if<00:00:34.960> you<00:00:35.020> get<00:00:35.170> a<00:00:35.200> conventional<00:00:35.950> potting

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
use if you get a conventional potting

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.590 
use if you get a conventional potting
mix<00:00:36.460> it's<00:00:36.610> usually<00:00:36.910> going<00:00:37.000> to<00:00:37.059> have<00:00:37.120> chemical

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
mix it's usually going to have chemical

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.569 
mix it's usually going to have chemical
fertilizers<00:00:38.140> in<00:00:38.289> it<00:00:38.379> and<00:00:38.530> peat<00:00:39.039> moss<00:00:39.219> in<00:00:39.460> it

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
fertilizers in it and peat moss in it

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.489 
fertilizers in it and peat moss in it
now<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:39.999> chemical<00:00:40.390> fertilizers<00:00:40.870> I<00:00:41.109> don't<00:00:41.320> I'm

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:41.499 
now the chemical fertilizers I don't I'm

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:42.989 
now the chemical fertilizers I don't I'm
not<00:00:41.559> really<00:00:41.800> a<00:00:41.890> big<00:00:42.010> fan<00:00:42.039> of<00:00:42.280> for<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:42.670> number<00:00:42.969> of

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:42.999 
not really a big fan of for a number of

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.329 
not really a big fan of for a number of
reasons<00:00:43.089> the<00:00:43.989> peat<00:00:44.230> moss<00:00:44.440> I'm<00:00:44.800> not<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.010> huge<00:00:45.280> fan

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
reasons the peat moss I'm not a huge fan

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.279 
reasons the peat moss I'm not a huge fan
of<00:00:45.579> it's<00:00:46.210> something<00:00:46.539> that<00:00:46.659> basically<00:00:46.749> is<00:00:47.140> not

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
of it's something that basically is not

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.569 
of it's something that basically is not
that<00:00:47.440> sustainable<00:00:47.980> you<00:00:48.129> know<00:00:48.219> we<00:00:48.309> should<00:00:48.489> be

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
that sustainable you know we should be

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.250 
that sustainable you know we should be
leaving<00:00:48.730> those<00:00:48.940> peat<00:00:49.390> bogs<00:00:49.659> where<00:00:49.960> they<00:00:50.109> are

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
leaving those peat bogs where they are

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.419 
leaving those peat bogs where they are
they<00:00:50.379> have<00:00:50.499> a<00:00:50.530> really<00:00:50.679> important<00:00:51.100> role<00:00:51.129> to

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
they have a really important role to

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:54.029 
they have a really important role to
play<00:00:51.519> in<00:00:51.850> our<00:00:52.089> ecosystem<00:00:52.780> that<00:00:52.929> being<00:00:53.140> said<00:00:53.379> it

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
play in our ecosystem that being said it

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.500 
play in our ecosystem that being said it
can<00:00:54.249> be<00:00:54.370> beneficial<00:00:54.519> in<00:00:54.909> seed<00:00:55.149> starting

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
can be beneficial in seed starting

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.759 
can be beneficial in seed starting
there's<00:00:55.690> even<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.929> research<00:00:56.229> showing<00:00:56.499> that<00:00:56.620> if

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
there's even a research showing that if

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.049 
there's even a research showing that if
you<00:00:56.859> don't<00:00:56.979> have<00:00:57.159> peat<00:00:57.370> moss<00:00:57.519> in<00:00:57.729> there<00:00:57.909> the

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
you don't have peat moss in there the

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.849 
you don't have peat moss in there the
process<00:00:58.210> doesn't<00:00:58.629> work<00:00:58.780> quite<00:00:58.960> as<00:00:59.260> well<00:00:59.289> it

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
process doesn't work quite as well it

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.799 
process doesn't work quite as well it
still<00:01:00.100> has<00:01:00.190> always<00:01:00.370> worked<00:01:00.609> okay<00:01:00.850> for<00:01:01.030> me<00:01:01.149> but

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
still has always worked okay for me but

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.209 
still has always worked okay for me but
um<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.440> I'm<00:01:02.559> not<00:01:02.679> really<00:01:02.769> sure<00:01:02.979> what<00:01:03.129> to<00:01:03.190> say

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
um so I'm not really sure what to say

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.240 
um so I'm not really sure what to say
about<00:01:03.339> that<00:01:03.670> I<00:01:03.760> don't<00:01:03.999> tend<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.299> use<00:01:04.420> peat<00:01:04.659> moss

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
about that I don't tend to use peat moss

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.520 
about that I don't tend to use peat moss
but<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.549> little<00:01:07.240> bit<00:01:07.420> maybe<00:01:07.630> is<00:01:07.870> okay

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
but a little bit maybe is okay

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.380 
but a little bit maybe is okay
can<00:01:08.770> I<00:01:08.830> leave<00:01:08.950> that<00:01:09.070> that<00:01:09.280> for<00:01:09.430> now<00:01:09.520> because<00:01:10.240> I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
can I leave that that for now because I

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.460 
can I leave that that for now because I
want<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.600> keep<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.780> video<00:01:10.840> short<00:01:11.020> but<00:01:11.440> I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
want to keep the video short but I

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.750 
want to keep the video short but I
recommend<00:01:11.860> most<00:01:11.920> people<00:01:12.220> do<00:01:12.280> is<00:01:12.400> go<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.610> buy

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
recommend most people do is go and buy

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.410 
recommend most people do is go and buy

that<00:01:19.510> means<00:01:19.690> you<00:01:19.810> know<00:01:19.900> what's<00:01:20.050> organic<00:01:20.500> it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
that means you know what's organic it

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.170 
that means you know what's organic it
probably<00:01:20.980> is<00:01:21.130> gonna<00:01:21.310> have<00:01:21.490> peat<00:01:21.730> moss<00:01:21.880> on

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
probably is gonna have peat moss on

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.640 
probably is gonna have peat moss on
there<00:01:22.420> I'll<00:01:22.600> have<00:01:22.630> some<00:01:22.870> compost<00:01:23.260> in<00:01:23.500> there

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
there I'll have some compost in there

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.920 
there I'll have some compost in there
maybe<00:01:23.830> a<00:01:23.950> bit<00:01:24.130> of<00:01:24.220> lime<00:01:24.400> and<00:01:24.940> that's<00:01:25.780> but

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
maybe a bit of lime and that's but

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.880 
maybe a bit of lime and that's but
that's<00:01:25.990> something<00:01:26.260> that's<00:01:26.380> really<00:01:26.440> easy<00:01:26.740> to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
that's something that's really easy to

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.470 
that's something that's really easy to
get<00:01:27.010> going<00:01:27.130> with<00:01:27.280> if<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:27.760> have<00:01:27.910> a<00:01:27.940> really<00:01:28.330> nice

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
get going with if you have a really nice

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.120 
get going with if you have a really nice
big<00:01:28.750> window<00:01:29.140> you<00:01:29.200> can<00:01:29.440> just<00:01:29.590> put<00:01:29.740> your<00:01:29.860> seeds

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
big window you can just put your seeds

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.620 
big window you can just put your seeds
right<00:01:30.400> there<00:01:30.640> they<00:01:31.060> really<00:01:31.330> need<00:01:31.450> at<00:01:31.600> least

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
right there they really need at least

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.720 
right there they really need at least
eight<00:01:32.230> hours<00:01:32.410> of<00:01:32.680> Sun<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.890> day<00:01:32.980> and<00:01:33.580> what<00:01:33.700> I

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
eight hours of Sun a day and what I

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.220 
eight hours of Sun a day and what I
always<00:01:33.940> find<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.360> even<00:01:34.540> if<00:01:34.720> I<00:01:34.780> do<00:01:34.840> have<00:01:35.050> a<00:01:35.110> nice

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
always find is even if I do have a nice

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.690 
always find is even if I do have a nice
big<00:01:35.440> window<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:35.830> can<00:01:35.860> be<00:01:36.160> difficult<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.550> get

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
big window it can be difficult to get

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.150 
big window it can be difficult to get
enough<00:01:36.850> Sun<00:01:37.210> because<00:01:37.540> your<00:01:38.110> your<00:01:38.470> overhang<00:01:39.010> of

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
enough Sun because your your overhang of

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.950 
enough Sun because your your overhang of
your<00:01:39.310> roof<00:01:39.550> and<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.000> walls<00:01:40.210> block<00:01:40.630> some<00:01:40.870> of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
your roof and the walls block some of

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.690 
your roof and the walls block some of
that<00:01:41.050> Sun<00:01:41.260> from<00:01:41.470> coming<00:01:41.710> in<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:41.980> what<00:01:42.400> happens

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
that Sun from coming in and what happens

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.850 
that Sun from coming in and what happens
is<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.150> plants<00:01:43.480> can<00:01:43.690> start<00:01:44.320> leaning<00:01:44.740> to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
is that the plants can start leaning to

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.590 
is that the plants can start leaning to
the<00:01:44.980> Sun<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:45.340> get<00:01:45.430> kind<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.730> lanky<00:01:45.940> so<00:01:46.450> what

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
the Sun and get kind of lanky so what

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.300 
the Sun and get kind of lanky so what
you<00:01:46.660> have<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.840> do<00:01:46.930> in<00:01:47.050> that<00:01:47.110> case<00:01:47.200> is<00:01:47.410> turn<00:01:47.890> the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
you have to do in that case is turn the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.160 
you have to do in that case is turn the
plants<00:01:48.700> regularly<00:01:49.600> that's<00:01:49.960> kind<00:01:50.140> of

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
plants regularly that's kind of

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.600 
plants regularly that's kind of
unnatural<00:01:50.440> for<00:01:50.890> them<00:01:50.980> actually<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.430> have<00:01:51.520> to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
unnatural for them actually to have to

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.860 
unnatural for them actually to have to
be<00:01:51.700> turned<00:01:51.940> like<00:01:52.120> that<00:01:52.270> all<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.510> time<00:01:52.660> but

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
be turned like that all the time but

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.540 
be turned like that all the time but
that's<00:01:53.020> what<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.260> need<00:01:53.410> to<00:01:53.500> do<00:01:53.620> on<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.520> other

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
that's what you need to do on the other

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.890 
that's what you need to do on the other
hand<00:01:54.820> what<00:01:54.910> I<00:01:54.940> like<00:01:55.150> to<00:01:55.240> do<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.600> have<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.780> little

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
hand what I like to do is have a little

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.600 
hand what I like to do is have a little
bit<00:01:56.020> of<00:01:56.170> supplemental<00:01:56.770> lighting<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.250> here<00:01:57.490> is

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
bit of supplemental lighting so here is

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.970 
bit of supplemental lighting so here is
a<00:01:57.640> fluorescent<00:01:58.390> light<00:01:58.540> it's<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.020> 6000

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
a fluorescent light it's in the 6000

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.680 
a fluorescent light it's in the 6000
Kelvin<00:02:00.250> range<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:01.150> look<00:02:01.300> for<00:02:01.480> that<00:02:01.540> when

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
Kelvin range so look for that when

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.330 
Kelvin range so look for that when
you're<00:02:01.840> buying<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.230> I'll<00:02:02.590> turn<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:02.920> on<00:02:03.010> so<00:02:03.250> you

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
you're buying it I'll turn it on so you

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.070 
you're buying it I'll turn it on so you
can<00:02:03.460> see<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.790> and<00:02:03.970> what<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.420> do<00:02:04.540> is<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:04.900> haven't

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
can see it and what I do is I haven't

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.530 
can see it and what I do is I haven't
propped<00:02:05.470> up<00:02:05.710> about<00:02:05.950> four<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.000> six<00:02:07.030> inches

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
propped up about four to six inches

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.419 
propped up about four to six inches
above<00:02:07.750> wherever<00:02:08.349> my<00:02:08.500> plants<00:02:08.890> are<00:02:08.979> so

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
above wherever my plants are so

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.680 
above wherever my plants are so
occasionally<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.940> need<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.179> raise<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.509> up<00:02:10.569> a

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
occasionally I need to raise it up a

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.149 
occasionally I need to raise it up a
little<00:02:10.780> bit<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.379> just<00:02:11.560> put<00:02:11.709> out<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.860> on<00:02:11.950> top

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
little bit and I just put out the on top

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.470 
little bit and I just put out the on top
of<00:02:12.280> whatever<00:02:12.519> I<00:02:12.580> have<00:02:12.819> today<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.150> have<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.420> on

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
of whatever I have today I have it on

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.360 
of whatever I have today I have it on
top<00:02:13.659> of<00:02:13.780> my<00:02:13.870> book<00:02:14.080> that's<00:02:14.770> usually<00:02:15.190> where<00:02:15.310> it

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
top of my book that's usually where it

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.290 
top of my book that's usually where it
kind<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.580> starts<00:02:15.910> out<00:02:16.030> at<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.850> just<00:02:19.060> set<00:02:19.210> it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
kind of starts out at and I just set it

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.950 
kind of starts out at and I just set it
there<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.540> that

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
there like that

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.390 
there like that
what<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.200> do<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.440> I'll<00:02:20.560> leave<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:20.830> on<00:02:20.980> for<00:02:21.190> 12

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
what I do is I'll leave this on for 12

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.070 
what I do is I'll leave this on for 12
to<00:02:21.520> 14<00:02:21.880> hours<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> day<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:22.390> then<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.750> plants<00:02:23.020> are

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
to 14 hours a day so then the plants are

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.420 
to 14 hours a day so then the plants are
getting<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.320> lot<00:02:23.560> more<00:02:23.800> light<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.190> they<00:02:24.280> can

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
getting a lot more light and they can

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.010 
getting a lot more light and they can
grow<00:02:24.640> more<00:02:25.060> efficiently<00:02:25.510> they're<00:02:25.750> gonna<00:02:25.840> grow

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
grow more efficiently they're gonna grow

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.300 
grow more efficiently they're gonna grow
straight<00:02:26.320> up<00:02:26.350> instead<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:26.830> pointing<00:02:27.190> out

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
straight up instead of pointing out

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.010 
straight up instead of pointing out
towards<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.640> window<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.090> still<00:02:28.450> often<00:02:28.630> put<00:02:28.930> it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
towards the window I still often put it

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.420 
towards the window I still often put it
by<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.200> window<00:02:29.620> anyway<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:29.980> don't<00:02:30.130> know<00:02:30.250> why<00:02:30.340> I

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
by a window anyway I don't know why I

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.770 
by a window anyway I don't know why I
kind<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.760> like<00:02:30.820> having<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.240> natural<00:02:31.660> light

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
kind of like having that natural light

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.000 
kind of like having that natural light
there<00:02:32.020> now<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.260> other<00:02:32.440> thing<00:02:32.620> we<00:02:32.710> can<00:02:32.800> do<00:02:32.920> to

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
there now the other thing we can do to

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.740 
there now the other thing we can do to
really<00:02:33.160> improve<00:02:33.460> this<00:02:33.610> process<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.420> a

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
really improve this process is to have a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.170 
really improve this process is to have a
heat<00:02:35.170> mat<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:36.130> provide<00:02:36.400> some<00:02:36.610> heat<00:02:36.820> because<00:02:37.150> a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
heat mat to provide some heat because a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.370 
heat mat to provide some heat because a
lot<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.390> these<00:02:37.510> plants<00:02:37.840> really<00:02:37.990> want<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.290> have

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
lot of these plants really want to have

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.080 
lot of these plants really want to have
nice<00:02:38.590> warm<00:02:38.860> soil<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.760> know<00:02:39.850> we<00:02:39.940> want

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
nice warm soil and you know we want

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.790 
nice warm soil and you know we want
things<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.390> happen<00:02:40.600> fairly<00:02:40.780> quickly<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.530> so

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
things to happen fairly quickly and so

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.170 
things to happen fairly quickly and so
that's<00:02:41.980> where<00:02:42.130> heat<00:02:42.280> mat<00:02:42.430> comes<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.820> it<00:02:42.970> plugs

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
that's where heat mat comes in it plugs

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.800 
that's where heat mat comes in it plugs
right<00:02:43.300> into<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.540> wall

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
right into the wall

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.310 
right into the wall
you<00:02:44.350> set<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.680> under<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.910> tray<00:02:46.240> just<00:02:46.870> like<00:02:47.020> this

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
you set it under the tray just like this

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.840 
you set it under the tray just like this
and<00:02:47.620> we<00:02:47.770> got<00:02:47.890> our<00:02:47.980> heated<00:02:48.220> seats<00:02:48.520> can<00:02:48.700> take<00:02:48.820> a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
and we got our heated seats can take a

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.520 
and we got our heated seats can take a
while<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.090> get<00:02:49.330> germinating<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:49.990> get<00:02:50.170> going

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
while to get germinating and get going

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.690 
while to get germinating and get going
and<00:02:50.590> we<00:02:50.710> really<00:02:50.920> want<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.130> help<00:02:51.280> them<00:02:51.520> along

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
and we really want to help them along

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.730 
and we really want to help them along
with<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.910> process<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.630> what<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.810> do<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.320> soak

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
with that process so what I do is I soak

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.650 
with that process so what I do is I soak
them<00:02:53.980> for<00:02:54.160> six<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.490> twelve<00:02:54.700> hours<00:02:55.000> that's<00:02:55.510> why

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
them for six to twelve hours that's why

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.600 
them for six to twelve hours that's why
I<00:02:55.720> have<00:02:55.900> them<00:02:56.050> sitting<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.440> this<00:02:56.560> bowl<00:02:56.770> instead

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
I have them sitting in this bowl instead

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.790 
I have them sitting in this bowl instead
of<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.240> seed<00:02:58.540> packet<00:02:58.690> so<00:02:59.290> there's<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> couple

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
of in a seed packet so there's a couple

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.590 
of in a seed packet so there's a couple
of<00:02:59.920> reasons<00:03:00.010> we<00:03:00.280> do<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.520> one<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.120> just<00:03:01.360> having

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
of reasons we do this one is just having

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.330 
of reasons we do this one is just having
them<00:03:01.720> in<00:03:01.810> water<00:03:02.080> is<00:03:02.380> going<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.590> get<00:03:02.740> them<00:03:02.920> nice

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
them in water is going to get them nice

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.920 
them in water is going to get them nice
and<00:03:03.400> full<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:03.940> water<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.420> course<00:03:04.630> they<00:03:04.750> need

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
and full of water of course they need

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.480 
and full of water of course they need
wanted<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.260> get<00:03:05.380> germinating<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.400> it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
wanted to get germinating and so it

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.950 
wanted to get germinating and so it
really<00:03:06.730> helps<00:03:06.970> them<00:03:07.120> kind<00:03:07.210> of<00:03:07.360> swell<00:03:07.630> up<00:03:07.840> and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
really helps them kind of swell up and

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.630 
really helps them kind of swell up and
get<00:03:08.140> going<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.590> really<00:03:08.620> starts<00:03:09.460> that

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
get going it really starts that

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.550 
get going it really starts that
germination<00:03:10.030> process<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.990> other<00:03:11.080> reason<00:03:11.410> is

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
germination process the other reason is

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.410 
germination process the other reason is
the<00:03:11.680> water<00:03:11.890> allows<00:03:12.250> me<00:03:12.460> to<00:03:12.640> coat<00:03:12.880> them<00:03:13.120> in<00:03:13.150> some

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
the water allows me to coat them in some

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.670 
the water allows me to coat them in some
other<00:03:13.540> things<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:13.960> I've<00:03:14.140> talked<00:03:14.440> about

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
other things that I've talked about

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.500 
other things that I've talked about
before<00:03:14.800> liquid<00:03:15.400> kelp<00:03:15.610> which<00:03:15.850> has<00:03:16.000> lots<00:03:16.270> and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
before liquid kelp which has lots and

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.570 
before liquid kelp which has lots and
lots<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.840> different<00:03:17.110> minerals<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.980> natural

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
lots of different minerals and natural

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.130 
lots of different minerals and natural
growth<00:03:19.090> hormones<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.720> really<00:03:19.870> helped<00:03:20.050> that

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
growth hormones that really helped that

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.260 
growth hormones that really helped that
germination<00:03:20.530> process<00:03:20.680> along<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:21.790> it's<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.030> main

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
germination process along so it's a main

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.460 
germination process along so it's a main
one<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.600> is<00:03:22.690> often<00:03:22.840> used<00:03:22.990> been<00:03:23.260> soaking

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
one that is often used been soaking

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.560 
one that is often used been soaking
seeds<00:03:23.860> should<00:03:24.130> say<00:03:24.640> on<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.760> label<00:03:25.000> hopefully

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
seeds should say on the label hopefully

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.180 
seeds should say on the label hopefully
but<00:03:25.720> just<00:03:25.930> half<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.260> teaspoon<00:03:26.740> per<00:03:26.950> 500

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
but just half a teaspoon per 500

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.430 
but just half a teaspoon per 500
milliliters<00:03:27.910> of<00:03:27.940> water<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.720> same<00:03:28.960> amount<00:03:29.290> of

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
milliliters of water the same amount of

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.430 
milliliters of water the same amount of
sea<00:03:29.710> minerals<00:03:30.390> which<00:03:31.390> is<00:03:31.510> full<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.840> minerals

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
sea minerals which is full of minerals

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.770 
sea minerals which is full of minerals
and<00:03:32.920> other<00:03:33.370> bioactive<00:03:34.060> substances<00:03:34.570> and<00:03:34.690> you

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
and other bioactive substances and you

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.420 
and other bioactive substances and you
could<00:03:34.930> use<00:03:35.050> either<00:03:35.380> of<00:03:35.650> these<00:03:35.770> or<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.160> could

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
could use either of these or you could

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.830 
could use either of these or you could
use<00:03:36.550> both<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.820> them<00:03:37.090> now<00:03:37.300> I'm<00:03:37.450> starting

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
use both of them now I'm starting

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.790 
use both of them now I'm starting
something<00:03:37.960> that<00:03:38.200> I've<00:03:38.290> never<00:03:38.530> bothered

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
something that I've never bothered

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.830 
something that I've never bothered
starting<00:03:39.340> before<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:39.820> is<00:03:40.000> corn<00:03:40.390> and

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
starting before and that is corn and

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.030 
starting before and that is corn and
that's<00:03:40.930> kind<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.320> weird<00:03:41.470> thing<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.740> start

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
that's kind of a weird thing to start

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.070 
that's kind of a weird thing to start
because<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:43.120> can<00:03:43.240> just<00:03:43.330> put<00:03:43.450> corn<00:03:43.900> out<00:03:44.020> there

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
because you can just put corn out there

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.110 
because you can just put corn out there
it<00:03:44.320> works<00:03:44.500> fine<00:03:44.770> but<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.400> just<00:03:45.730> kind<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:45.940> wanted

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
it works fine but I just kind of wanted

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.370 
it works fine but I just kind of wanted
to<00:03:46.180> see<00:03:46.270> what<00:03:46.450> happens<00:03:46.720> when<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:46.930> start<00:03:47.110> corn

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
to see what happens when you start corn

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.660 
to see what happens when you start corn
so<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.560> thought<00:03:47.800> I'm<00:03:47.950> gonna<00:03:48.070> start<00:03:48.310> corn<00:03:48.550> today

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
so I thought I'm gonna start corn today

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.430 
so I thought I'm gonna start corn today
next<00:03:49.300> thing<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.630> do<00:03:49.690> once<00:03:49.960> I've<00:03:50.080> poured<00:03:50.350> that

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
next thing I do once I've poured that

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.380 
next thing I do once I've poured that
off<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.540> take<00:03:52.690> my<00:03:52.840> micro<00:03:53.140> eyes'll<00:03:53.440> fungi

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
off is I take my micro eyes'll fungi

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.750 
off is I take my micro eyes'll fungi
because<00:03:55.390> corn<00:03:55.660> loves<00:03:55.960> these<00:03:56.350> micro<00:03:56.620> fungi<00:03:57.100> and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
because corn loves these micro fungi and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.880 
because corn loves these micro fungi and
I<00:03:57.850> just<00:03:58.120> sprinkle<00:03:59.020> on<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.260> tiniest<00:03:59.620> little

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
I just sprinkle on the tiniest little

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.620 
I just sprinkle on the tiniest little
bit<00:04:00.010> over<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.250> seeds<00:04:00.490> tada<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.270> have<00:04:01.420> some

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
bit over the seeds tada I have some

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.180 
bit over the seeds tada I have some
potting<00:04:01.900> mix<00:04:02.050> in<00:04:02.170> here<00:04:02.350> now<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.980> I<00:04:03.070> actually

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
potting mix in here now and I actually

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.710 
potting mix in here now and I actually
have<00:04:03.490> a<00:04:03.520> good<00:04:03.700> tip<00:04:03.880> for<00:04:03.910> you<00:04:04.240> after<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:04.540> get

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
have a good tip for you after you get

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.390 
have a good tip for you after you get
your<00:04:04.810> potting<00:04:05.110> mix<00:04:05.260> in<00:04:05.410> there<00:04:05.590> then<00:04:06.100> you<00:04:06.130> can

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
your potting mix in there then you can

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.920 
your potting mix in there then you can
water<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:07.000> in<00:04:07.120> before<00:04:07.300> you've<00:04:07.600> done<00:04:07.630> your

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
water it in before you've done your

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.450 
water it in before you've done your
seeding<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.500> it's<00:04:09.010> just<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.190> little<00:04:09.370> bit

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
seeding and it's just a little bit

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.160 
seeding and it's just a little bit
easier<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.790> get<00:04:09.940> things<00:04:10.150> wet<00:04:10.360> beforehand<00:04:11.020> I

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
easier to get things wet beforehand I

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.350 
easier to get things wet beforehand I
find<00:04:11.440> so<00:04:12.010> and<00:04:12.670> when<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:12.850> do<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.240> know<00:04:13.330> I

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
find so and when I do that you know I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.300 
find so and when I do that you know I
put<00:04:13.570> my<00:04:13.660> bio<00:04:13.840> stimulants<00:04:14.380> and<00:04:14.500> my<00:04:14.560> ium<00:04:14.890> in<00:04:15.070> in

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
put my bio stimulants and my ium in in

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.860 
put my bio stimulants and my ium in in
there<00:04:15.670> as<00:04:15.820> well<00:04:15.970> it's<00:04:16.150> just<00:04:16.210> a<00:04:16.390> habit<00:04:16.540> of<00:04:16.750> mine

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
there as well it's just a habit of mine

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.030 
there as well it's just a habit of mine
whenever<00:04:17.080> I'm<00:04:17.320> watering<00:04:17.590> something<00:04:17.920> like

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
whenever I'm watering something like

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.349 
whenever I'm watering something like
this<00:04:18.130> I'm<00:04:18.310> using<00:04:18.489> those<00:04:18.640> biostimulant<00:04:19.239> off

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
this I'm using those biostimulant off

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.580 
this I'm using those biostimulant off
and<00:04:19.570> when<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.690> do<00:04:19.840> something<00:04:19.989> like<00:04:20.170> this<00:04:20.290> it

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
and when you do something like this it

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.370 
and when you do something like this it
makes<00:04:20.770> sense<00:04:20.950> to<00:04:21.160> seed<00:04:21.430> two<00:04:22.180> seeds<00:04:22.210> into<00:04:22.990> each

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
makes sense to seed two seeds into each

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.230 
makes sense to seed two seeds into each
spot<00:04:23.980> and<00:04:24.310> then<00:04:24.460> what<00:04:24.580> happens<00:04:24.880> is<00:04:25.000> when<00:04:25.120> they

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
spot and then what happens is when they

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.290 
spot and then what happens is when they
come<00:04:25.480> up<00:04:25.660> you<00:04:25.870> can<00:04:26.290> basically<00:04:26.820> cut<00:04:27.820> out<00:04:27.970> the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
come up you can basically cut out the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.580 
come up you can basically cut out the
weakest<00:04:28.630> evening<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.200> means<00:04:29.350> you're<00:04:29.470> always

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
weakest evening that means you're always

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.130 
weakest evening that means you're always
selecting<00:04:30.220> for<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.430> stronger<00:04:30.790> seedling<00:04:31.330> so<00:04:31.840> in

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
selecting for a stronger seedling so in

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.279 
selecting for a stronger seedling so in
this<00:04:32.410> case<00:04:32.650> since<00:04:32.830> I'm

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
this case since I'm

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.049 
this case since I'm
corne<00:04:33.649> and<00:04:33.860> since<00:04:34.039> they're<00:04:34.189> so<00:04:34.339> big<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.879> since

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:35.059 
corne and since they're so big and since

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:36.040 
corne and since they're so big and since
I<00:04:35.119> know<00:04:35.180> they're<00:04:35.389> gonna<00:04:35.479> germinate<00:04:35.899> pretty

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
I know they're gonna germinate pretty

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.149 
I know they're gonna germinate pretty
well<00:04:36.229> or<00:04:36.349> I<00:04:36.409> hope<00:04:36.529> they're<00:04:36.680> gonna<00:04:36.740> germinate

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
well or I hope they're gonna germinate

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.859 
well or I hope they're gonna germinate
pretty<00:04:37.339> well<00:04:37.460> I'm<00:04:38.059> only<00:04:38.180> gonna<00:04:38.330> plant<00:04:38.569> one<00:04:38.719> you

00:04:38.859 --> 00:04:38.869 
pretty well I'm only gonna plant one you

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:39.790 
pretty well I'm only gonna plant one you
guys<00:04:38.990> think<00:04:39.199> it's<00:04:39.289> kind<00:04:39.439> of<00:04:39.469> weird<00:04:39.529> to<00:04:39.710> start

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
guys think it's kind of weird to start

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.019 
guys think it's kind of weird to start
corn<00:04:40.099> from<00:04:40.249> seed<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:40.550> think<00:04:40.759> it's<00:04:40.849> kind<00:04:40.999> of

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:41.029 
corn from seed I think it's kind of

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:42.159 
corn from seed I think it's kind of
ready<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.210> start<00:04:41.419> corn<00:04:41.629> from<00:04:41.749> seed<00:04:41.960> but<00:04:41.990> it's

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
ready to start corn from seed but it's

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.989 
ready to start corn from seed but it's
also<00:04:42.289> really<00:04:42.499> fun<00:04:42.649> to<00:04:42.919> try<00:04:43.189> stuff<00:04:43.520> like<00:04:43.759> this

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:43.999 
also really fun to try stuff like this

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.359 
also really fun to try stuff like this
who<00:04:44.749> knows<00:04:44.990> what<00:04:45.289> will<00:04:45.409> happen<00:04:45.439> here's<00:04:46.219> how<00:04:46.309> we

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:46.369 
who knows what will happen here's how we

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:50.709 
who knows what will happen here's how we
do<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.550> go<00:04:47.210> like<00:04:47.389> that<00:04:49.330> just<00:04:50.330> make<00:04:50.479> sure<00:04:50.569> it's

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:50.719 
do it go like that just make sure it's

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:52.959 
do it go like that just make sure it's
covered<00:04:50.949> some<00:04:51.949> seeds<00:04:52.249> will<00:04:52.399> come<00:04:52.520> up<00:04:52.639> in<00:04:52.819> a<00:04:52.939> few

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:52.969 
covered some seeds will come up in a few

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.089 
covered some seeds will come up in a few
days<00:04:53.419> some<00:04:53.839> will<00:04:53.990> take<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.169> couple<00:04:54.499> of<00:04:54.589> weeks<00:04:54.770> a

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
days some will take a couple of weeks a

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.439 
days some will take a couple of weeks a
lot<00:04:55.339> of<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.490> vegetable<00:04:55.849> seeds<00:04:55.999> we<00:04:56.149> do<00:04:56.270> take

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
lot of the vegetable seeds we do take

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.879 
lot of the vegetable seeds we do take
less<00:04:56.629> than<00:04:56.659> a<00:04:56.839> week<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.409> want<00:04:57.529> to<00:04:57.649> keep<00:04:57.740> it

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
less than a week you want to keep it

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.230 
less than a week you want to keep it
moist<00:04:58.039> in<00:04:58.309> there<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.729> until<00:04:59.089> they've

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
moist in there and until they've

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.579 
moist in there and until they've
germinated<00:04:59.449> an<00:04:59.899> easy<00:05:00.139> way<00:05:00.349> to<00:05:00.409> do<00:05:00.559> that

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:00.589 
germinated an easy way to do that

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:02.499 
germinated an easy way to do that
without<00:05:00.830> really<00:05:01.240> aggravating<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.300> seeds

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
without really aggravating the seeds

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:03.939 
without really aggravating the seeds
with<00:05:02.719> a<00:05:02.749> watering<00:05:03.139> can<00:05:03.169> is<00:05:03.349> to<00:05:03.589> use<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.740> spray

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
with a watering can is to use a spray

with a watering can is to use a spray
bottle

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
bottle

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.189 
bottle
once<00:05:04.969> I'm<00:05:05.119> done<00:05:05.149> seeding<00:05:05.599> I'll<00:05:05.689> put<00:05:05.869> this<00:05:06.020> on

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
once I'm done seeding I'll put this on

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.929 
once I'm done seeding I'll put this on
top<00:05:06.409> to<00:05:06.619> keep<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.889> moisture<00:05:07.369> in<00:05:07.399> there<00:05:07.699> and

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:07.939 
top to keep the moisture in there and

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:09.909 
top to keep the moisture in there and
then<00:05:08.419> once<00:05:08.689> those<00:05:08.839> have<00:05:09.020> germinated<00:05:09.529> and<00:05:09.740> come

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
then once those have germinated and come

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.529 
then once those have germinated and come
up<00:05:10.039> I'm<00:05:10.189> gonna<00:05:10.279> want<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:10.580> take<00:05:10.789> that<00:05:10.969> off<00:05:11.180> or<00:05:11.449> at

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
up I'm gonna want to take that off or at

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.389 
up I'm gonna want to take that off or at
least<00:05:11.749> remove<00:05:12.169> it<00:05:12.319> partly<00:05:12.619> to<00:05:13.039> get<00:05:13.159> some<00:05:13.279> more

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:13.399 
least remove it partly to get some more

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.489 
least remove it partly to get some more
air<00:05:13.639> circulation<00:05:14.149> going<00:05:14.419> on<00:05:14.629> in<00:05:14.809> there<00:05:14.990> then

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:15.499 
air circulation going on in there then

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:16.359 
air circulation going on in there then
eventually<00:05:15.740> I'll<00:05:15.949> take<00:05:16.129> it<00:05:16.219> right<00:05:16.309> off

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:16.369

eventually I'll take it right off
through<00:05:16.789> the<00:05:16.909> magic<00:05:17.330> of<00:05:17.419> time-travel<00:05:18.139> we<00:05:18.259> now

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:18.469

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:20.829 
through the magic of time-travel we now
have<00:05:18.740> corn<00:05:19.069> it's<00:05:19.669> actually<00:05:20.089> been<00:05:20.330> about<00:05:20.629> a

00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:20.839 
have corn it's actually been about a

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.079 
have corn it's actually been about a
week<00:05:21.050> and<00:05:21.349> things<00:05:22.129> are<00:05:22.279> looking<00:05:22.309> really<00:05:22.909> good

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:23.089 
week and things are looking really good

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.059 
week and things are looking really good
and<00:05:23.149> there's<00:05:23.449> only<00:05:23.569> one<00:05:23.959> problem<00:05:24.229> and<00:05:24.619> that<00:05:24.889> is

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069 
and there's only one problem and that is

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:26.079 
and there's only one problem and that is
that<00:05:25.219> I'm<00:05:25.309> heading<00:05:25.550> out<00:05:25.639> of<00:05:25.669> town<00:05:25.759> tomorrow

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:26.089 
that I'm heading out of town tomorrow

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:27.999 
that I'm heading out of town tomorrow
for<00:05:26.389> three<00:05:26.569> weeks<00:05:26.779> so<00:05:27.379> I<00:05:27.439> have<00:05:27.589> to<00:05:27.709> plant<00:05:27.919> this

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
for three weeks so I have to plant this

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.010 
for three weeks so I have to plant this
corn<00:05:28.249> today<00:05:28.479> ideally<00:05:29.479> what<00:05:29.599> I<00:05:29.629> would<00:05:29.779> want<00:05:29.869> to

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
corn today ideally what I would want to

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.209 
corn today ideally what I would want to
do<00:05:30.110> is<00:05:30.229> let<00:05:30.379> it<00:05:30.409> be<00:05:30.680> in<00:05:30.800> here<00:05:30.949> for<00:05:31.099> probably

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:31.219 
do is let it be in here for probably

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:32.739 
do is let it be in here for probably
another<00:05:31.490> week<00:05:31.789> or<00:05:31.969> so<00:05:32.029> to<00:05:32.180> establish<00:05:32.389> a

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:32.749 
another week or so to establish a

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.689 
another week or so to establish a
stronger<00:05:33.110> root<00:05:33.409> system<00:05:33.830> but<00:05:33.979> I<00:05:34.279> can't<00:05:34.550> do<00:05:34.669> that

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
stronger root system but I can't do that

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.699 
stronger root system but I can't do that
so<00:05:35.029> we'll<00:05:35.180> see<00:05:35.449> how<00:05:35.629> well<00:05:35.779> it<00:05:35.899> works<00:05:35.930> but<00:05:36.589> at

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:36.709 
so we'll see how well it works but at

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:38.409 
so we'll see how well it works but at
least<00:05:36.830> we<00:05:37.039> have<00:05:37.159> a<00:05:37.189> nice<00:05:37.430> example<00:05:37.909> here<00:05:38.389> of

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
least we have a nice example here of

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.389 
least we have a nice example here of
