00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
the same kind of efficiency right now is

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.399 
the same kind of efficiency right now is
is<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.830> motion<00:02:01.040> going<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.700> be<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:02.409> particular

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
is the motion going to be a particular

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.140 
is the motion going to be a particular
to<00:02:03.620> like<00:02:03.979> say<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.460> want<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.700> command<00:02:05.090> your

you<00:02:33.380> had<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> chance<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:34.010> play<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.580> what<00:02:34.730> was

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
you had a chance to play it what was

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.520 
you had a chance to play it what was
what<00:02:35.330> was<00:02:35.420> your<00:02:35.510> experience<00:02:35.690> well<00:02:36.230> if<00:02:36.470> you

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
what was your experience well if you

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.110 
what was your experience well if you
ever<00:02:36.620> played<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.280> guess<00:02:37.610> like<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.760> first-person

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
ever played I guess like a first-person

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.059 
ever played I guess like a first-person
shooter<00:02:38.420> on<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.630> we<00:02:38.750> it's<00:02:39.410> very<00:02:39.590> similar<00:02:39.920> to

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
shooter on the we it's very similar to

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.770 
shooter on the we it's very similar to
that<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:40.430> basically<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.850> move<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.300> your<00:02:41.600> wii

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
that so basically the move is your wii

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.960 
that so basically the move is your wii
remote<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.830> sub<00:02:43.040> controller<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.700> your

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
remote and the sub controller is your

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.030 
remote and the sub controller is your
nunchuck<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.140> basically<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.950> know<00:02:46.010> you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
nunchuck so you basically you know you

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.650 
nunchuck so you basically you know you
point<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.610> move<00:02:47.000> at<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.300> screen<00:02:47.540> to

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
point the move at the screen to

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.420 
point the move at the screen to
basically<00:02:47.900> move<00:02:48.080> your<00:02:48.260> camera<00:02:48.380> around<00:02:48.860> if<00:02:49.160> you

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
basically move your camera around if you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.620 
basically move your camera around if you
put<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.819> the<00:02:49.910> far<00:02:50.090> edges<00:02:50.269> of<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.510> screen

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
put it to the far edges of the screen

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.780 
put it to the far edges of the screen
you'll<00:02:50.959> actually<00:02:51.080> turn<00:02:51.440> around<00:02:51.799> but<00:02:52.430> basic

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
you'll actually turn around but basic

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.309 
you'll actually turn around but basic
movement<00:02:53.239> like<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.510> know<00:02:53.600> forward<00:02:53.930> backwards

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
movement like you know forward backwards

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.809 
movement like you know forward backwards
a<00:02:54.380> strafing<00:02:54.650> left<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.100> right<00:02:55.250> that's<00:02:55.640> all

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
a strafing left and right that's all

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.430 
a strafing left and right that's all
done<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.239> sub<00:02:56.420> controller<00:02:56.780> now<00:02:57.140> did<00:02:57.319> it

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
done in the sub controller now did it

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.650 
done in the sub controller now did it
look<00:02:57.650> as<00:02:57.860> responsive<00:02:58.610> as<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:59.000> they<00:02:59.239> showed<00:02:59.480> off

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
look as responsive as it they showed off

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.960 
look as responsive as it they showed off
on<00:02:59.989> or<00:03:00.380> did<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.709> feel<00:03:00.890> as<00:03:01.100> responsive<00:03:01.610> as<00:03:01.730> they

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
on or did it feel as responsive as they

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.030

showed off on stage or yeah yeah it felt
pretty<00:03:04.100> good<00:03:04.280> had<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.670> real<00:03:05.209> couple<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.720> minutes

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
pretty good had a real couple of minutes

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.300 
pretty good had a real couple of minutes
with<00:03:06.019> it<00:03:06.140> but<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.530> seems<00:03:06.830> like<00:03:07.010> all<00:03:07.190> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
with it but it seems like all the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.920 
with it but it seems like all the
controls<00:03:07.610> you'd<00:03:07.730> probably<00:03:07.940> find<00:03:08.269> you<00:03:08.810> know

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
controls you'd probably find you know

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.050 
controls you'd probably find you know
using<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.680> normal<00:03:09.980> dualshock<00:03:10.610> I've<00:03:10.790> been<00:03:10.910> that

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
using a normal dualshock I've been that

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.490 
using a normal dualshock I've been that
pretty<00:03:11.239> well<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:11.959> can<00:03:12.110> you<00:03:12.410> know

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
pretty well to it so you can you know

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.470 
pretty well to it so you can you know
you<00:03:12.530> can<00:03:12.650> click<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.580> trigger<00:03:13.850> on<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.269> sub

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
you can click the the trigger on the sub

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.690 
you can click the the trigger on the sub
control<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:14.959> that'll<00:03:15.200> put<00:03:15.319> you<00:03:15.440> into<00:03:15.700> into

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
control and that'll put you into into

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.150 
control and that'll put you into into
cover<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.540> think<00:03:18.109> Travis<00:03:18.680> mentioned<00:03:19.010> there<00:03:19.130> are

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
cover I think Travis mentioned there are

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.650 
cover I think Travis mentioned there are
some<00:03:19.430> of<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.579> other<00:03:19.820> squad<00:03:20.060> news<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.390> can<00:03:20.510> do

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
some of the other squad news you can do

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.300 
some of the other squad news you can do
so<00:03:20.810> that's<00:03:20.989> all<00:03:21.200> that's<00:03:21.620> all<00:03:21.829> map<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:22.220> the

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
so that's all that's all map to the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.830 
so that's all that's all map to the
d-pad<00:03:22.700> basically<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.239> think<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.510> think<00:03:23.720> you

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
d-pad basically I think you think you

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.830 
d-pad basically I think you think you
hold<00:03:24.079> down<00:03:24.320> there<00:03:25.190> like<00:03:25.280> l1<00:03:25.790> on<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:26.810> the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
hold down there like l1 on the on the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.960 
hold down there like l1 on the on the
sub<00:03:27.079> controller<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:27.799> go<00:03:28.220> into<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.459> slo-mo

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
sub controller and you go into a slo-mo

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.340 
sub controller and you go into a slo-mo
mode<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.510> basically<00:03:29.630> can<00:03:29.959> tell<00:03:30.170> your

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
mode and you basically can tell your

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.170
