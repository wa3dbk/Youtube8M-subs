for them I don't care if you go out and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.420 
for them I don't care if you go out and
buy<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> 280<00:01:49.140> gallon<00:01:49.530> tank<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.040> still<00:01:50.280> only

buy a 280 gallon tank it's still only

buy a 280 gallon tank it's still only
going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.820> about<00:01:51.000> 2<00:01:51.270> foot<00:01:51.570> 3<00:01:51.960> foot<00:01:51.990> wide<00:01:52.229> at

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619

going to be about 2 foot 3 foot wide at
the<00:01:52.649> most<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.520> he's<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.840> be

the most and he's just not going to be

the most and he's just not going to be
able<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.170> turn<00:01:55.320> around<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.799> once<00:01:56.009> he<00:01:56.159> gets

any<00:01:56.520> size<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:57.210> them<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.110> at<00:01:58.259> first<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.710> going

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
any size on them so at first it's going

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.340 
any size on them so at first it's going
to<00:01:58.950> look<00:01:59.070> really<00:01:59.340> cool<00:01:59.490> but<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> long<00:02:01.079> run

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
to look really cool but in the long run

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.590 
to look really cool but in the long run
it's<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> disjoint<00:02:02.700> waste<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.299> money

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
it's really a disjoint waste of money

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.350 
it's really a disjoint waste of money
here's<00:02:04.560> another<00:02:04.710> caging<00:02:05.369> idea<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.000> can

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
here's another caging idea as you can

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.960 
here's another caging idea as you can
see<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> wood<00:02:07.649> frame<00:02:07.970> with

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
see here we just have a wood frame with

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.970 
see here we just have a wood frame with
a<00:02:09.569> tarp<00:02:10.200> as<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.890> bottom

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
a tarp as the bottom

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.290 
a tarp as the bottom
and<00:02:12.040> then<00:02:12.159> we<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.370> kiddie<00:02:12.640> pool<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:13.209> him

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
and then we have a kiddie pool for him

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.449 
and then we have a kiddie pool for him
to<00:02:13.360> swim<00:02:13.659> at<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.379> kiddie<00:02:14.650> pool<00:02:14.739> ain't<00:02:15.190> really

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
to swim at the kiddie pool ain't really

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.890 
to swim at the kiddie pool ain't really
big<00:02:15.640> enough<00:02:15.849> for<00:02:15.909> them<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.239> do<00:02:16.420> much<00:02:16.599> swimming

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
big enough for them to do much swimming

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.850 
big enough for them to do much swimming
the<00:02:17.680> tarps<00:02:18.159> they<00:02:18.370> go<00:02:18.549> and<00:02:18.730> they<00:02:19.170> poop<00:02:20.170> all<00:02:20.440> over

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
the tarps they go and they poop all over

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.140 
the tarps they go and they poop all over
it<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.280> got<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.519> figure<00:02:21.670> out<00:02:21.879> how<00:02:22.000> you're

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
it and you got to figure out how you're

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.460 
it and you got to figure out how you're
going<00:02:22.269> to<00:02:22.390> clean<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.750> off<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.170> can<00:02:23.319> either

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
going to clean it off you can either

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.339 
going to clean it off you can either
take<00:02:23.769> it<00:02:23.799> out<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.489> try<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.760> get<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.030> back<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.629> or

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
take it out and try to get it back in or

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.330 
take it out and try to get it back in or
just<00:02:26.799> a<00:02:27.250> big<00:02:27.430> pain<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.819> butt<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.980> course<00:02:30.220> I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
just a big pain in the butt of course I

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.070 
just a big pain in the butt of course I
only<00:02:30.400> got<00:02:30.610> one<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.970> one<00:02:31.150> heat<00:02:31.390> lamp<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.900> is

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
only got one the one heat lamp this is

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.780 
only got one the one heat lamp this is
just<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.410> show<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.680> what<00:02:33.160> really<00:02:33.400> ain't<00:02:33.700> a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
just to show you what really ain't a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.460 
just to show you what really ain't a
good<00:02:33.940> cage<00:02:34.239> it's<00:02:34.510> just<00:02:34.690> too<00:02:34.840> hard<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.140> clean

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
good cage it's just too hard to clean

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.559 
good cage it's just too hard to clean
another<00:02:36.220> thing<00:02:36.580> with<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.790> other<00:02:36.970> cage<00:02:37.330> with

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
another thing with the other cage with

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.229 
another thing with the other cage with
the<00:02:37.690> half<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.170> half<00:02:38.319> water<00:02:38.769> if<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.849> water<00:02:40.060> is

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
the half and half water if the water is

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.089 
the half and half water if the water is
your<00:02:40.420> main<00:02:40.629> base<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.409> then<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.620> got<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.799> little

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
your main base and then you got a little

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.979 
your main base and then you got a little
built<00:02:42.340> up<00:02:42.549> land<00:02:42.879> you<00:02:43.180> can<00:02:43.360> just<00:02:43.510> rinse<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
built up land you can just rinse the

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.110 
built up land you can just rinse the
land<00:02:44.200> off<00:02:44.470> with<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.310> water<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.819> goes<00:02:45.910> down

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
land off with the water and it goes down

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.759 
land off with the water and it goes down
sell<00:02:46.360> water<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:46.750> your<00:02:46.840> filtration<00:02:47.440> will<00:02:47.590> take

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
sell water and your filtration will take

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.500 
sell water and your filtration will take
care<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.760> course<00:02:48.819> here<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.269> actually

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
care of that of course here you actually

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.849 
care of that of course here you actually
got<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.049> figure<00:02:50.260> out<00:02:50.290> how<00:02:50.500> you're<00:02:50.680> going<00:02:50.799> to

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
got to figure out how you're going to

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.220 
got to figure out how you're going to
clean<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.459> this<00:02:52.390> is<00:02:52.599> really<00:02:52.870> any<00:02:53.049> good

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
clean it and this is really any good

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.059 
clean it and this is really any good
cage<00:02:53.410> idea<00:02:54.840> here's<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.989> enclosure<00:02:56.379> I<00:02:56.560> tend<00:02:56.980> to

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
cage idea here's the enclosure I tend to

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.970 
cage idea here's the enclosure I tend to
use<00:02:57.129> this<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.239> just<00:02:58.510> your<00:02:58.720> normal<00:02:59.109> stuff<00:02:59.500> tank

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
use this is just your normal stuff tank

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.940 
use this is just your normal stuff tank
and<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:01.180> fill<00:03:01.450> it<00:03:01.629> anywhere<00:03:02.560> from<00:03:02.739> about<00:03:02.859> a

and I fill it anywhere from about a

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.030 
and I fill it anywhere from about a
quarter<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.609> half<00:03:03.640> full<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:04.239> water<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.980> time

your<00:03:42.730> crocodilian<00:03:43.359> starts<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.870> get<00:03:44.019> bigger<00:03:44.260> if

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
your crocodilian starts to get bigger if

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.339 
your crocodilian starts to get bigger if
you<00:03:45.280> only<00:03:45.459> use<00:03:45.669> one<00:03:45.700> heat<00:03:46.299> lamp<00:03:46.569> he<00:03:46.870> will<00:03:47.019> start

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
you only use one heat lamp he will start

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.339 
you only use one heat lamp he will start
to<00:03:47.440> get<00:03:47.530> burns<00:03:47.859> on<00:03:48.280> him<00:03:48.489> and<00:03:48.639> that<00:03:48.700> can<00:03:49.599> cause

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
to get burns on him and that can cause

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.349 
to get burns on him and that can cause
infection<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.130> can<00:03:51.250> even<00:03:51.489> kill<00:03:51.730> them<00:03:51.940> this

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
infection and can even kill them this

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.059 
infection and can even kill them this
one<00:03:52.630> got<00:03:52.780> burnt<00:03:53.049> once<00:03:53.319> when<00:03:53.530> he<00:03:53.560> was<00:03:53.650> younger

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
one got burnt once when he was younger

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.170 
one got burnt once when he was younger
it's<00:03:54.819> healing<00:03:55.510> up<00:03:55.780> quite<00:03:56.349> nicely<00:03:56.620> he's<00:03:57.190> going

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
it's healing up quite nicely he's going

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.490 
it's healing up quite nicely he's going
to<00:03:58.269> have<00:03:58.359> a<00:03:58.389> little<00:03:58.629> bit<00:03:58.750> of<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.870> scar<00:03:59.169> but<00:03:59.349> it

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
to have a little bit of a scar but it

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.360 
to have a little bit of a scar but it
will<00:03:59.590> deteriorate<00:03:59.919> over<00:04:00.280> time<00:04:00.750> but<00:04:01.750> anyway<00:04:02.019> uh

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
will deteriorate over time but anyway uh

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.550 
will deteriorate over time but anyway uh
so<00:04:03.370> yeah<00:04:03.549> use<00:04:03.849> multiple<00:04:04.780> heat<00:04:04.959> lamps<00:04:05.349> once

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
so yeah use multiple heat lamps once

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.920 
so yeah use multiple heat lamps once
they<00:04:05.709> get<00:04:05.799> a<00:04:05.859> little<00:04:06.310> bit<00:04:06.879> over<00:04:07.120> 18<00:04:07.480> inches<00:04:07.780> you

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930
