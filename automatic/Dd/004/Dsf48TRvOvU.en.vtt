00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello to all of you mine 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.640
 has seen other videos 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.550
 won't have much trouble with it 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.500
 find out how this trick works 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.240
 nevertheless I think it is a nice trick l 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.370
 starting with a card 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.370
 for example this one 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.320
 The most chosen card is the hartboer 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.930
 may I farmer this heart in the middle 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.859
 from the pile for it in my mine 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.080
 fingers cut 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.079
 want to see you became the houses farmer more 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.300
 there is one more time on top 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.920
 put the heart farmer in the middle of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.930
 the pile 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.930
 I understand fingers that he will see 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.660
 ok again then we do see again 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.510
 or look up for it 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.360
 should not be very difficult ah look 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.859
 agree to stab it again then 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.390
 in the middle of the table and is none 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.890
 pear what do you think is on top 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.890
 no of course it is not me that is it 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.330
 well look and have man 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.929
 I used this trick 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.299
 of the following cards 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.700
 a heart farmer with a red backside 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.969
 a heart farmer 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.429
 the blue back and this card 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.270
 blank card with the backside 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.240
 then the text 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.950
 no of course not written as 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.149
 you do not have blank cards yourself and you 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.039
 choose to include the text for example 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.420
 to write a dark or I to 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.250
 call it i did i have a white 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.869
 paper straws stuck on a card and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.380
 text no of course not there 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.380
 written down 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.250
 in preparation for the trick you do 

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:50.640
 next path first about two and from 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.229
 the pile of how the little steel you are 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.869
 then put the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.959
 no of course not card and there 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.880
 on top of the hartboer with a blue 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.099
 put it down with the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.039
 pictures upwards 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:07.200
 on top go the rest of the pile and 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.899
 finally you put the heart farmer 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.510
 need to grub up the backside on top now 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.400
 The trick you start asking your audience is one 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.319
 choose a card but that's it 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.480
 important that you have a card let it be 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.130
 upper half of the pile so that they 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.709
 not the reverse by accident 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.569
 encounter heart farmer 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.680
 for example, you opt for this 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.840
 Map 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.440
 put it on top of the pile and make it 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.440
 a pile of 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.100
 so the order on top as follows 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.370
 lighter I work everything cars of public 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.079
 and below that the heart farmer here before 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.819
 day had left 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.239
 You have to think your audience real 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.540
 that the heart farmer is their chosen card 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.380
 then you do double lift 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.150
 or two cards at the same time 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.980
 and so you continue to see the hartboer 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.209
 reality is here in this case 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.780
 the window without ID card rows 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.450
 back and then grab the top card 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.790
 because is the actually chosen card 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.790
 you stick halfway through the pile 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.670
 cliti fingers and according to no show 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.670
 that heart farmer is still on top 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.960
 called junk one more time 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.460
 clears the number in the middle of the states 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:31.910
 this time i always show that i like him 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:34.310
 and really put in with even more 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:39.170
 fingers and light to the farmers again 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.300
 on top oh no , something went wrong 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.880
 then i'll wait a minute we'll do the trick 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.860
 start looking for the hartboer again 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.050
 it must be easy to find 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.160
 you go through the pile you want 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.230
 naturally 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.030
 almost hartboer that you come from 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.230
 in a pile beforehand 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.910
 laid 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.070
 public or boss and the fact that the 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.470
 carice turned around but spend it yourself 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.800
 would rather not find extra attention to that 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.220
 I that it also makes this card more fun 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.630
 that is the card with the blue back 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.370
 when i say they do the trick one more 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.130
 Going to do so is important now 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.930
 blue africa not yet see late I do 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.090
 as follows i first wanted the top half 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.640
 from the state to which I put on the 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.650
 hartboer then strokes the orsel 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.090
 from the stand to which I put my hair 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.520
 to do 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.840
 the write to the farmers in their midst and 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.729
 I say we will of course one more time 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.160
 to go 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.010
 I cut my fingers and guess what you will 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.590
 the hartboer you lie on top again 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.810
 nice that is now automatically the 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.350
 No of course not map on top 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.350
 come to lie 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.240
 you can finish the trick by letting 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.450
 see that in the pile 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.760
 a blue card and that's that 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.760
 of course there is a farmer
