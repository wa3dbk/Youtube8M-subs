00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.019
 tooth and the roscón also because no 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.600
 we begin by adding two eggs in a 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.300
 bol butter in ointment 150 ml 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.150
 warm milk warm tempered not hot 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.430
 75 milliliters of orange blossom water 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.170
 zest of a lemon and an orange and 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.300
 where can i buy scratch mister 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.360
 pilot and nowhere in ice rai 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.050
 you who have to say everything 150 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.590
 grams of sugar 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.590
 to 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.600
 only a little nutmeg remains 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.730
 crumble the yeast include the 650 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.100
 grams of flour and a little bit 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.559
 of salt the time has come to soil 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.600
 the little hands stir the mixture until 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.090
 get a mass that you can work with 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 comfort at this point the smell 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.710
 of the mass will try to attract you as the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.570
 song of a mermaid but fuck you must 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.670
 be strong and do not eat the raw ones if 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.320
 you do not want that of course without roscón this is 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.600
 an advice that is worth so much to you 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.509
 recipes as if you are some gangsters not 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.789
 eat while you are cooking in order 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.800
 you must let the dough rest at least 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.250
 for three hours spent that time 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.260
 will have doubled its size 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.240
 three hours of waiting but what are we going to 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.800
 do meanwhile mister vilobí is 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.750
 a good question small tim and 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.970
 meanwhile we can go cutting the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.370
 candied fruit moistening sugar 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.420
 for decoration and even mounting the 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.310
 cream for the filling 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.820
 to 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.820
 ah 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.800
 ah 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.290
 you are chocolate lovers add 2 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.270
 spoonfuls of cocoa powder and you get 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.270
 of a soft mocha flavor filling 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.510
 After three hours the dough has doubled 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.310
 size and we should give it a few laps to 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.900
 eliminate bubbles that have formed 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.549
 inside to shape it 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.040
 you just have to make a hole 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.440
 with the daco editogran giving it up 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.540
 it looks like a bicycle wheel another 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.250
 now seriously another one now has to 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.230
 be resting after painting the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.690
 surface with beaten egg 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.879
 after that time he will have doubled again 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.890
 its size and we can decorate it another 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.049
 layer of beaten egg and you can put the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.760
 candied fruit do not stay short 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.340
 that this bloats a lot and if you leave little 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.140
 fruit then gives a lot of penita just remain 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.560
 the almonds rolled if the sugar has 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.480
 moistened 180 degrees 25-30 minutes in 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.940
 the oven 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.769
 this is another thing truth is so good 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.870
 that you will want to marry the damn 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.030
 roscón only it is to introduce the filling 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.280
 for this we will use the legendary 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.230
 technique of split the roscón by the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.150
 half with a saw knife and 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.610
 we introduce the cream and the mocha to 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.560
 large scoops may not be the 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.330
 more elegant technique but I will not 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.730
 dancing with the roscón I'm going to eat it 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.860
 this is all for today little ones see you 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.569
 in the next video and remember not 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.569
 forget to play with food
