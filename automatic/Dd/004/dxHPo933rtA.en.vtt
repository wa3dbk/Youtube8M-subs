hey guys so it's me girl Henry I've been
away<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.510> while<00:00:15.570> because<00:00:15.900> I've<00:00:16.380> been<00:00:16.440> sick

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
away for a while because I've been sick

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.810 
away for a while because I've been sick
again<00:00:18.140> as<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.380> all<00:00:19.529> know<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:20.040> work<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.580> clinic

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
again as you all know I work in a clinic

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.960 
again as you all know I work in a clinic
and<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.720> guess<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.619> puts<00:00:22.860> me<00:00:23.160> at<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> high<00:00:23.580> risk

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and I guess that puts me at a high risk

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.929 
and I guess that puts me at a high risk
of<00:00:24.210> getting<00:00:24.630> sick<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.890> I've<00:00:26.189> been<00:00:26.220> sick<00:00:26.700> for

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.680 
horribly so then I just started twisting
my<00:01:28.740> hair<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.370> blue<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.910> it<00:01:30.450> took
