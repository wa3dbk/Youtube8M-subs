00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.550 
everybody this is Joseph welcome to
another<00:00:02.159> qml<00:00:03.090> tutorial<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:04.259> in<00:00:04.500> this

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
another qml tutorial and in this

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.019 
another qml tutorial and in this
tutorial<00:00:04.680> we're<00:00:05.250> gonna<00:00:05.310> be<00:00:05.549> learning<00:00:05.700> about

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
tutorial we're gonna be learning about

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.259 
tutorial we're gonna be learning about
our<00:00:06.270> property<00:00:06.509> animation<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.980> how<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.340> start

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
our property animation and how to start

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.990 
our property animation and how to start
something<00:00:10.040> differently<00:00:11.040> than<00:00:11.429> how<00:00:11.610> we<00:00:11.670> did<00:00:11.910> it

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
something differently than how we did it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.379 
something differently than how we did it
before<00:00:12.769> in<00:00:13.769> our<00:00:13.889> last<00:00:14.040> tutorial<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.269> can

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
before in our last tutorial so we can

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.990 
before in our last tutorial so we can
take<00:00:15.599> code<00:00:16.260> from<00:00:16.440> our<00:00:16.590> last<00:00:16.770> tutorial<00:00:17.039> get<00:00:17.850> rid

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
take code from our last tutorial get rid

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.910 
take code from our last tutorial get rid
of<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:19.609> we<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.789> start<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.390> mouse<00:00:21.660> area<00:00:22.199> down

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
of it and we can start a mouse area down

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.230 
of it and we can start a mouse area down
here<00:00:23.310> underneath<00:00:23.730> our<00:00:24.289> main<00:00:25.289> image<00:00:26.029> let's<00:00:27.029> do

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
here underneath our main image let's do

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:38.869 
here underneath our main image let's do
that<00:00:29.420> fulfill<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:36.710> okay<00:00:37.710> that's<00:00:38.489> all<00:00:38.670> for

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
that fulfill it okay that's all for

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:39.920 
that fulfill it okay that's all for
right<00:00:38.910> now<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:39.510> we're<00:00:39.629> gonna<00:00:39.719> make<00:00:39.870> our

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
right now now we're gonna make our

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.369 
right now now we're gonna make our
property<00:00:40.910> animation<00:00:44.960> we're<00:00:45.960> gonna<00:00:46.050> give<00:00:46.260> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
property animation we're gonna give it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.970 
property animation we're gonna give it
the<00:00:46.410> ID<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:48.050> scale<00:00:49.940> animation<00:00:51.860> we're<00:00:52.860> gonna

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the ID of scale animation we're gonna

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.299 
the ID of scale animation we're gonna
target<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:55.379> main<00:00:56.300> image<00:00:57.410> we<00:00:58.410> are<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.949> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
target the main image we are going to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.320 
target the main image we are going to
set<00:00:59.820> from<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> property<00:01:01.969> of<00:01:03.710> scale<00:01:05.210> we<00:01:06.210> were

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
set from the property of scale we were

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.880 
set from the property of scale we were
gonna<00:01:06.450> say<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:08.659> 0<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:10.970> 1<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:13.439> set<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
gonna say from 0 to 1 and set the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.660 
gonna say from 0 to 1 and set the
duration<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:16.820> 1,200<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.390> easy<00:01:20.270> tight<00:01:21.619> to

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
duration to 1,200 and easy tight to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:32.539 
duration to 1,200 and easy tight to
using<00:01:24.500> out<00:01:25.700> back<00:01:29.509> now<00:01:30.509> we're<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> this

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
using out back now we're going to this

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.990 
using out back now we're going to this
up<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.000> bit<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.770> are<00:01:34.799> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.640> now

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
up a little bit and we are going to now

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.929 
up a little bit and we are going to now
make<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.329> numbered<00:01:36.930> animation

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.940 

I'm<00:01:41.450> going<00:01:41.689> to<00:01:41.840> give<00:01:42.049> this<00:01:42.259> one<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.799> idea<00:01:43.159> of

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
I'm going to give this one the idea of

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.249 
I'm going to give this one the idea of
opacity<00:01:47.619> animation<00:01:49.810> same<00:01:50.810> deal<00:01:51.049> we're

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
opacity animation same deal we're

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.719 
opacity animation same deal we're
targeting<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:52.299> main<00:01:53.299> image<00:01:54.609> for<00:01:55.609> the

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
targeting the main image for the

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.510 
targeting the main image for the
property<00:01:56.689> though<00:01:56.869> this<00:01:57.079> time<00:01:58.689> pass<00:01:59.689> city<00:02:00.520> and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
property though this time pass city and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.730 
property though this time pass city and
we're<00:02:01.789> gonna<00:02:01.909> say<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.450> same<00:02:02.719> deal<00:02:02.959> from

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.509 

indexing<00:02:06.740> they're<00:02:07.009> from<00:02:07.660> zero<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.890> one

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:19.839 

duration<00:02:13.519> I<00:02:16.209> don't<00:02:17.209> say<00:02:17.360> 28<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.340> then<00:02:19.640> you

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
duration I don't say 28 and then you

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:35.530 
duration I don't say 28 and then you
don't<00:02:20.090> say<00:02:20.799> using<00:02:21.799> a<00:02:24.220> type-1<00:02:26.260> say<00:02:27.879> using<00:02:34.540> and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
don't say using a type-1 say using and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.490 
don't say using a type-1 say using and
we<00:02:36.140> clean<00:02:36.769> up<00:02:37.010> our<00:02:37.250> code<00:02:37.489> now<00:02:38.090> let's<00:02:38.930> go<00:02:39.200> back

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
we clean up our code now let's go back

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.849 
we clean up our code now let's go back
over<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.629> our<00:02:43.120> mouse<00:02:44.120> area<00:02:44.510> here<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:45.530> anchor

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
over to our mouse area here this anchor

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.420 
over to our mouse area here this anchor
filling<00:02:46.160> our<00:02:46.250> main<00:02:46.430> image<00:02:46.639> and<00:02:47.120> let's<00:02:47.389> say<00:02:47.780> a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
filling our main image and let's say a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.040 
filling our main image and let's say a
clicked

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.270 

okay<00:02:58.090> scale<00:02:59.090> animation<00:02:59.650> dot<00:03:00.650> start<00:03:02.110> and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
okay scale animation dot start and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.340 
okay scale animation dot start and
opacity<00:03:05.080> animation<00:03:06.850> start<00:03:08.050> okay<00:03:09.050> so<00:03:09.110> we're

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
opacity animation start okay so we're

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.350 
opacity animation start okay so we're
gonna<00:03:09.440> start<00:03:09.770> those<00:03:10.040> when<00:03:10.310> we<00:03:10.430> click<00:03:10.700> on<00:03:10.880> any

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
gonna start those when we click on any

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.650 
gonna start those when we click on any
one<00:03:11.570> of<00:03:11.630> these<00:03:11.840> images<00:03:12.170> right<00:03:12.910> so<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.270> should

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
one of these images right so it should

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.510 
one of these images right so it should
just<00:03:14.810> go<00:03:14.900> each<00:03:15.260> image<00:03:15.680> by<00:03:15.890> image<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.430> it

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
just go each image by image and it

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.740 
just go each image by image and it
shouldn't<00:03:16.820> be<00:03:16.970> like<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.390> whole<00:03:17.540> thing<00:03:18.410> Sophos

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
shouldn't be like the whole thing Sophos

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.310 
shouldn't be like the whole thing Sophos
give<00:03:20.750> er<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.840> shot<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:23.510> there<00:03:23.690> they<00:03:23.780> go<00:03:24.020> they

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
give er a shot so there they go they

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.680 
give er a shot so there they go they
come<00:03:24.980> right<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.520> then<00:03:25.610> we<00:03:25.700> can<00:03:25.850> click<00:03:26.360> on<00:03:26.540> it

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
come right and then we can click on it

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.860 
come right and then we can click on it
and<00:03:26.870> then<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.170> does<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.500> animations<00:03:28.040> for<00:03:28.310> us

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
and then it does the animations for us

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.199 
and then it does the animations for us
so<00:03:29.870> it's<00:03:30.050> just<00:03:30.170> single<00:03:30.950> element<00:03:31.610> animations

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
so it's just single element animations

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.440 
so it's just single element animations
within<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.900> model<00:03:33.380> right<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:38.090> course<00:03:38.150> we

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
within a model right and of course we

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.180 
within a model right and of course we
could<00:03:38.600> have<00:03:38.690> kept<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.020> behavior<00:03:39.470> on<00:03:39.800> scale

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
could have kept the behavior on scale

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.770 
could have kept the behavior on scale
and<00:03:40.370> stuff<00:03:40.520> but<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:41.240> just<00:03:41.390> tend<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.350> ruin<00:03:42.650> this

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
and stuff but it just tend to ruin this

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.540 
and stuff but it just tend to ruin this
single<00:03:44.780> animation<00:03:47.680> anybody's<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:49.220> is<00:03:49.430> how

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550
