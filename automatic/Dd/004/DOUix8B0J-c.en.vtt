00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.060
 free market friends thank you 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.230
 that they have visited us 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.520
 publication 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.160
 on this occasion hand let's make a 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.460
 review of this model of hearing aids 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.710
 will mark power that is 80 29 these 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.000
 hearing aids have a system via 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.550
 bluetooth but you can also 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.710
 connect them wired ie with a 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.399
 3.5 minute cable these hearing aids 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.869
 can be converted to connect from 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.460
 It forms the factory and good as 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.039
 interesting is that they also include what 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.480
 which is the regular for the micro sd and 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.430
 can 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.800
 and listen to the songs to whoever has 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.680
 his music recorded on a good micro sd 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.960
 because referring to model 80 29 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.910
 but he showed that unlike his 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.160
 previous is an 80 28 good because the 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.050
 boxes change completely continue 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.879
 having that aesthetic of black in the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.800
 information the back and good 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.750
 Well let's open it to see what 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.420
 we find our hearing aids 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.730
 we realize that these hearing aids and 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.610
 in the following has said how to 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.409
 see it is also different from the 80 29 that 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.479
 it was a square shaped box 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.789
 on this good occasion we are from 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.920
 this way we are currently 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.799
 having four types of hearing aids that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.679
 they are white with black black the color 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.380
 our color purple and reason within 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.899
 the box we realize that a 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.060
 instructive entered the part of the 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.060
 instructive that the advantage of this is 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.869
 which is instructive helps you to know a 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.659
 little bit more about hearing aids and 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:40.170
 advantage is that well then is the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:42.719
 People who like it in Spanish and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.610
 good is concluded what is your cable 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.560
 usb so they can load it 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.050
 He also leaves these hearing aids that also 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.030
 as it is will mark it futile 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.800
 charge about two hours before an hour and 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.710
 half an hour can be charged by 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.330
 Battery will last up to 8 from 7 to 8 hours 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.550
 about that we are talking about 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.860
 a constant use between music in 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.870
 Answer calls etc. but good 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.990
 they have not been tested I also realize 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.880
 that in a week and a half week with 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.010
 constant use live the gym in 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.930
 public transport and so on 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.459
 Referees get to have enough 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.290
 battery for week to week and a half 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.459
 approximately good then we are going to 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.620
 know a little more of these 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.860
 hearing aids we realize that the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.450
 hearing aids change things too 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.950
 practically all its aesthetics why 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.590
 because in the top part we give ourselves 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.430
 mind that the headband is something 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.920
 padded that's what makes it 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.290
 pretty attractive because it changes 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.239
 completely the way to know the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.680
 hearing aids and the advantage of these 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.510
 hearing aids that you no longer owe 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.580
 worry about scratches and you from 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.790
 worry about none 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.730
 this type of malfunction that can 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.260
 cause these headphones to the headband 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.940
 these hearing aids then the advantage is 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.530
 that when you put them on, it feels good 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.810
 a quite pretty performance 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.200
 good 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.640
 it also includes what controls are 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.989
 inside the hearing aids that are in the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.599
 part of the erection the left part 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.709
 where on the right side good we 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.599
 we realize that there is the option of 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.120
 On is the option to increase 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.890
 decrease volume and is also found 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.830
 here the part of the microsd slot 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.920
 on the left side, well, there is the 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.880
 change of song that can do it 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.410
 or simply the play 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.990
 the stop inside the good 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.660
 Well, it 's a pretty pretty aesthetic 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.850
 is still the conditioned the schoolboy 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.720
 has characterized by the following 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.120
 operation is quite thick 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.520
 quite comfortable not like other types of 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.320
 hearing aids that they presume is the 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.490
 mattress ado but it's a line really 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.560
 from collection to lie this is 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.840
 enough or that I have to have comfort 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.580
 the theme of the diameter of the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.400
 pretty headphones too pretty 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.860
 broad same way as the 80 28 these 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.540
 themselves 80 29 helps you to be able to 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.060
 cover the largest size in part of the 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.970
 the ear then they also have the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.920
 way to reduce outside noise 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.960
 quite interesting and good then you 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.630
 it helps the sound to be very very 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.030
 well then let's try them now 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.430
 then I have prepared what is my 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.710
 mobile phone remembering the questions 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.150
 frequent that have made me is hey serves 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.620
 for any type of smartphone the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.720
 answer is if it serves for any 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.079
 kind of high- end smartphone 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.030
 low range 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.310
 it's simply being in a correction and 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.960
 absolute then good so let's give 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.610
 what it is to light them there is something 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.080
 interesting are icons when 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.509
 prendes 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.960
 you get an agricultural benefit 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.960
 they detached 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.920
 ok then when we got to 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.030
 connect us that in this Colombian case 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.030
 I already have programmed here 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.259
 and indicates when you learn when you've already 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.330
 properly connected the bluetooth the 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.919
 hearing aids then let's listen to what 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.500
 it's a song that I have prepared 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.760
 youtube where are we going to find the 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.230
 sound quality 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.230
 let's see how it is heard not 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.009
 let's wait for it to load 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.009
 then here we can realize 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.990
 of music and the advantage is that with 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.720
 controllers I can decrease or lower the 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.050
 song 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.950
 here it has reached the maximum 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.440
 but I can also lower them 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.750
 quite interesting today is that I want 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.100
 cause you then it 's time to 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.630
 pause is simply going to explain 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.580
 here 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.830
 and they completely pass the song is 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.120
 say from here my idea of ​​youtube 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.700
 let's go to the song I want to go back to 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.180
 listen I put it here and it gets on play 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.560
 in again 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.840
 and interesting about this part then 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.340
 good is the part of youtube remembering 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.220
 who can also answer their 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.660
 calls for these hearing aids and good 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.699
 Well now let's prove what is the 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.780
 micro sd we are going to disconnect tantito 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:56.400
 this part 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.380
 we will connect ready and now let's 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.690
 try what is the micro sd in this 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.100
 case let's turn them on again we 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.100
 they are going to say that they went on 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.839
 and now we are going to use our micro 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:10.210
 sd I have prepared with you 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:11.469
 excuse me here I have the micro sd 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.889
 what I'm going to do is but I'm going to 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.889
 place 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.080
 then he says he found the music and in 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.160
 automatic starts playing 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.160
 then we will raise education 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.750
 let's keep thinking about the 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.750
 controllers to lower the volume 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.540
 now 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.540
 I'm going to change the songs 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.530
 that's not what I wanted and I keep walking 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.289
 now also serves to pause the 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.219
 song in the right place 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:54.219
 he was put on pause 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.530
 and so it's that simple then these 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.389
 only economic hearing aids in question 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.979
 that have many features have 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.479
 what is a micro sd connection youtube 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:08.280
 you can connect your call remembering 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.509
 that you have the integrated microphone and 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.520
 Well obviously you take some 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:13.650
 Pretty pretty hearing aids with good 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.469
 aesthetics then hopefully they can be encouraged 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.000
 people play our song or 

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.710
 classic animal is with us 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.389
 reminding them that people who 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.610
 come in the federal district can 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.919
 have shipments in different points of the 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.719
 metro we are flexible I remind you that 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:29.340
 we are flexible in case you are 

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:30.870
 working somewhere else and for 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.219
 issues of distance do not reach a 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.949
 point where we can remember 

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:36.900
 we can go towards a place 

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:38.669
 closest to you then I wish 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.289
 can be encouraged with us also to 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:42.539
 the interior of the republic we have the 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:45.240
 10 in the 110 pesos to the whole republic 

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:47.610
 Mexican and good also the guarantee is 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.969
 30 days with us directly in 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.069
 home 

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:51.779
 in contrast some damage of the 

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.770
 hearing aids we change them and 

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:55.199
 no problem 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.789

00:07:55.199 --> 00:08:00.050
