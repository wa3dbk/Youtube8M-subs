kind of confusing to figure out how to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.400 
kind of confusing to figure out how to
do<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.860> it's<00:00:43.860> pretty<00:00:44.100> easy<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> can

that icon and you'll see these four
states<00:01:10.159> down<00:01:11.159> here<00:01:11.670> or<00:01:12.540> actually<00:01:13.340> ten<00:01:14.340> frame

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
states down here or actually ten frame

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.190 
states down here or actually ten frame
sections<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.710> doesn't<00:01:17.009> really<00:01:17.159> tell<00:01:17.520> you

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
sections that it doesn't really tell you

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.510 
sections that it doesn't really tell you
what<00:01:19.200> these<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:20.060> this<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.240> actually<00:01:21.900> your

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
what these are this is actually your

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.490

normal focus in focus out and activate

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.370 
normal focus in focus out and activate
so<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.360> important<00:01:30.869> when<00:01:31.170> you're

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
so that's really important when you're

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.940 
so that's really important when you're
trying<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.890> place<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> focus<00:01:32.610> icon<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.439> how<00:01:34.439> how

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
trying to place a focus icon and how how

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.649 
trying to place a focus icon and how how
it<00:01:35.130> will<00:01:35.250> actually<00:01:35.430> work<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.030> your<00:01:36.210> theme<00:01:38.299> so<00:01:39.299> i

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
it will actually work in your theme so i

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:47.510 
it will actually work in your theme so i
am<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.259> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.990 

just<00:01:48.520> find<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:49.120> basic

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.020 

highlight<00:01:55.900> and<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.890> way<00:01:57.040> I<00:01:57.070> typically<00:01:57.760> do<00:01:58.000> is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
highlight and the way I typically do is

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.980 
highlight and the way I typically do is
drop<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:58.750> off<00:01:58.870> to<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.080> side<00:01:59.170> so<00:01:59.800> it<00:02:00.100> is<00:02:00.990> not

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
drop it off to the side so it is not

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.590 
drop it off to the side so it is not
right<00:02:02.770> on<00:02:02.800> top<00:02:03.190> of<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.490> icons<00:02:03.940> which<00:02:04.240> makes<00:02:04.479> it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
right on top of the icons which makes it

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.110 
right on top of the icons which makes it
easier<00:02:04.930> for<00:02:05.290> me<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.500> come<00:02:05.800> in<00:02:06.010> you<00:02:06.880> want<00:02:07.060> to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
easier for me to come in you want to

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.359 
easier for me to come in you want to
highlight<00:02:07.300> all<00:02:07.479> of<00:02:07.630> them<00:02:07.960> even<00:02:08.590> though<00:02:09.009> your

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
highlight all of them even though your

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.670 
highlight all of them even though your
focus<00:02:09.700> image<00:02:09.970> isn't<00:02:10.149> visible<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:11.230> still<00:02:11.500> want

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
focus image isn't visible you still want

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.180 
focus image isn't visible you still want
to<00:02:11.740> highlight<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:13.380> then<00:02:14.380> use<00:02:14.590> your<00:02:14.620> alignment

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
to highlight it then use your alignment

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.620 
to highlight it then use your alignment
tools<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:19.480> compress<00:02:19.870> them<00:02:20.080> together<00:02:21.300> now<00:02:22.300> if

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
tools to compress them together now if

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.320 
tools to compress them together now if
you<00:02:23.050> it'll<00:02:23.980> it'll<00:02:24.220> automatically<00:02:24.790> overlay<00:02:25.270> it

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
you it'll it'll automatically overlay it

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.949 
you it'll it'll automatically overlay it
as<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:26.080> top<00:02:26.400> icon<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.660> top<00:02:28.900> image<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.610> usually

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
as the top icon the top image I usually

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.780 
as the top icon the top image I usually
move<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.110> down<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> bottom<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.459> it'll

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
move it down to the bottom so that it'll

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.100 
move it down to the bottom so that it'll
be<00:02:33.850> underneath<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:35.739> images<00:02:36.630> now<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:38.050> is

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
be underneath the images now this is

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.900 
be underneath the images now this is
your<00:02:38.440> normal<00:02:38.650> state<00:02:39.070> so<00:02:39.550> you're<00:02:39.730> going<00:02:39.850> to

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
your normal state so you're going to

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.229 
your normal state so you're going to
