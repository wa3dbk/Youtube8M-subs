you saw immediately and you thought you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.460 
you saw immediately and you thought you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
Knight f4 one Knight f6 um so that's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.649 
Knight f4 one Knight f6 um so that's
kind<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> defense<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.180> was<00:02:00.210> counting<00:02:00.600> on

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
kind of the defense I was counting on

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.149 
kind of the defense I was counting on
and<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.870> underestimated<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.680> she<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:01.950> pins

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
and I underestimated that she just pins

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:02.780 
and I underestimated that she just pins
it

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
it

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.240 
it
pins<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.300> knight<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.540> e4<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.620> then<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:04.860> know

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
pins the knight on e4 so then I know

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.890 
pins the knight on e4 so then I know
then<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.580> noticed<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.300> I<00:02:06.570> came<00:02:06.630> up<00:02:06.810> with

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
then I noticed it that I came up with

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.580 
then I noticed it that I came up with
another<00:02:07.050> great<00:02:07.260> defense<00:02:07.800> Knight<00:02:08.009> g5<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:09.590> was

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
another great defense Knight g5 I was

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.209 
another great defense Knight g5 I was
very<00:02:10.800> resourceful<00:02:11.159> in<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.700> game

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:13.219 
very resourceful in this game

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.179 
very resourceful in this game
but<00:02:14.569> maybe<00:02:15.569> I'm<00:02:15.840> thinking<00:02:16.079> f3<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.920> wasn't

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
but maybe I'm thinking f3 like wasn't

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.370 
but maybe I'm thinking f3 like wasn't
that<00:02:17.249> like<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.459> normal-looking<00:02:17.819> move<00:02:18.260> f3

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
that like a normal-looking move f3

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.870 
that like a normal-looking move f3
here<00:02:19.590> yeah<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.220> think<00:02:20.280> gotta<00:02:20.640> sit<00:02:20.790> maybe

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
here yeah and I think gotta sit maybe

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.570 
here yeah and I think gotta sit maybe
like<00:02:21.150> Bishop<00:02:21.420> e5<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:22.020> for<00:02:22.260> black<00:02:22.470> or<00:02:22.830> does

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
like Bishop e5 here for black or does

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.150 
like Bishop e5 here for black or does
that<00:02:23.700> make<00:02:23.820> any<00:02:23.970> sense<00:02:24.650> o3<00:02:25.650> looks<00:02:25.800> like<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> much

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
that make any sense o3 looks like a much

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.550 
that make any sense o3 looks like a much
better<00:02:26.340> move<00:02:26.700> yeah<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.570> mean<00:02:27.870> same<00:02:28.080> ideas<00:02:28.440> in

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
better move yeah I mean same ideas in

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.750 
better move yeah I mean same ideas in
the<00:02:28.620> game<00:02:28.800> we<00:02:28.950> could<00:02:29.130> take<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.520> then<00:02:29.610> play

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
the game we could take and then play

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.860 
the game we could take and then play
Bishop<00:02:29.910> e5<00:02:30.180> right<00:02:31.520> okay<00:02:32.520> right<00:02:33.030> well<00:02:33.300> at<00:02:33.750> least

Bishop e5 right okay right well at least
this<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.170> not<00:02:34.320> like<00:02:34.500> losing<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.220> same<00:02:35.430> easy

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.440 
this is not like losing in the same easy
way<00:02:37.160> well<00:02:38.160> rook<00:02:38.310> every<00:02:38.610> ball<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.030> still<00:02:39.150> okay

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
rook f3 okay yeah I mean if I would have

rook f3 okay yeah I mean if I would have
realized<00:02:42.540> how<00:02:42.810> bad<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.200> was<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.680> know<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.830> would

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
realized how bad it was you know I would

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.710 
realized how bad it was you know I would
have<00:02:44.070> searched<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.520> defense<00:02:44.700> but<00:02:45.240> I

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
have searched for that defense but I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.900 
have searched for that defense but I
spent<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.140> lot<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.320> time<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.400> when<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.610> say<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
spent a lot of time so when you say that

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.310 
spent a lot of time so when you say that
you've<00:02:48.000> missed<00:02:48.270> things<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:48.630> Queen<00:02:48.870> f1

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
you've missed things like Queen f1

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.720 
you've missed things like Queen f1
sometimes<00:02:49.830> it's<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.100> weakness<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.490> your<00:02:50.550> play

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
sometimes it's a weakness in your play

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.020 
sometimes it's a weakness in your play
do<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.940> mean<00:02:51.710> yeah<00:02:52.710> this<00:02:53.100> guy<00:02:53.280> yeah<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.640> mean<00:02:53.970> I

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
just feel like it's not the first time

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.480 
just feel like it's not the first time
like<00:02:55.350> in<00:02:55.470> some<00:02:55.680> somewhere<00:02:56.070> I've<00:02:56.160> missed<00:02:56.370> that

like in some somewhere I've missed that

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.580 
like in some somewhere I've missed that

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
the tactic that strong players are most

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.210

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
prepared to play the sharpest minds with

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.030 
prepared to play the sharpest minds with
hum<00:04:36.090> taking<00:04:37.090> honey<00:04:37.210> 495<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.290> whatnot<00:04:38.560> right

hum taking honey 495 and whatnot right

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.800 
hum taking honey 495 and whatnot right
well<00:04:39.400> it's<00:04:39.580> not<00:04:39.700> exactly<00:04:39.850> her<00:04:40.240> style<00:04:40.570> but<00:04:40.780> also

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
well it's not exactly her style but also

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.390 
well it's not exactly her style but also
it's<00:04:41.050> not<00:04:41.139> just<00:04:41.290> about<00:04:41.380> her<00:04:41.530> being<00:04:41.710> prepared<00:04:42.070> I

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
it's not just about her being prepared I

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.490 
it's not just about her being prepared I
mean<00:04:42.760> it's<00:04:43.540> like<00:04:43.690> she<00:04:43.840> could<00:04:43.960> play<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.320> but

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
mean it's like she could play that but

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.870 
mean it's like she could play that but
obviously<00:04:44.680> she<00:04:45.130> wouldn't<00:04:45.370> have<00:04:45.460> prepared

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
obviously she wouldn't have prepared

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.930 
obviously she wouldn't have prepared
that<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.450> I<00:04:46.810> had<00:04:47.139> looked<00:04:47.290> at<00:04:47.470> that<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:47.889> I<00:04:48.190> know

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
that and I had looked at that so I know

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.270 
that and I had looked at that so I know
in<00:04:49.419> any<00:04:49.510> case<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:50.139> would<00:04:50.530> be<00:04:50.560> more<00:04:50.980> ready<00:04:51.190> for

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
in any case I would be more ready for

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.790 
in any case I would be more ready for
that<00:04:51.610> then<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:53.020> you<00:04:53.260> weren't<00:04:53.470> surprised

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
that then and you weren't surprised

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.930 
that then and you weren't surprised
therefore<00:04:54.070> when<00:04:54.280> she<00:04:54.520> went<00:04:54.669> for<00:04:54.790> something

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
therefore when she went for something

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.960 
therefore when she went for something
more<00:04:55.800> no<00:04:56.800> because<00:04:57.190> it<00:04:57.310> she<00:04:57.430> actually<00:04:57.639> had<00:04:57.940> a

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
more no because it she actually had a

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.629 
more no because it she actually had a
game<00:04:58.180> like<00:04:58.360> this<00:04:58.480> in<00:04:58.600> 2005<00:04:59.440> where<00:05:00.220> she<00:05:00.400> played

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.710 

I'm<00:06:18.550> not<00:06:18.640> sure<00:06:18.789> they're<00:06:18.940> always<00:06:19.060> being<00:06:19.300> honest

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
I'm not sure they're always being honest

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.700 
I'm not sure they're always being honest
but<00:06:19.840> it<00:06:19.930> seems<00:06:20.080> that<00:06:20.169> some<00:06:20.350> players<00:06:20.500> when

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
but it seems that some players when

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.840 
but it seems that some players when
their<00:06:20.830> opponents<00:06:21.160> funders<00:06:21.430> say<00:06:21.580> that<00:06:21.729> they

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
their opponents funders say that they

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.420 
their opponents funders say that they
they're<00:06:22.450> not<00:06:22.570> happy<00:06:22.870> to<00:06:22.960> win<00:06:23.080> that<00:06:23.200> way

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
they're not happy to win that way

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.620 
they're not happy to win that way
whereas<00:06:24.430> you're<00:06:24.700> saying<00:06:24.940> the<00:06:25.060> opposite<00:06:25.479> which

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
whereas you're saying the opposite which

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.330 
whereas you're saying the opposite which
I<00:06:25.750> feel<00:06:25.990> like<00:06:26.140> it<00:06:26.350> might<00:06:26.470> be<00:06:26.500> more<00:06:26.650> honest<00:06:27.130> in<00:06:27.250> a

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
I feel like it might be more honest in a

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.490 
I feel like it might be more honest in a
way<00:06:27.539> well<00:06:28.539> you<00:06:28.630> know<00:06:28.750> when<00:06:28.870> you're<00:06:28.990> down<00:06:29.140> when

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
way well you know when you're down when

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.750 
way well you know when you're down when
you've<00:06:29.620> been<00:06:29.770> defending<00:06:30.160> a<00:06:30.220> position<00:06:30.340> unlike

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
you've been defending a position unlike

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.310 
you've been defending a position unlike
a<00:06:30.820> five-second<00:06:31.360> increment<00:06:31.720> for<00:06:31.900> many<00:06:32.080> moves

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
a five-second increment for many moves

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.960 
a five-second increment for many moves
and<00:06:32.590> you<00:06:32.650> sort<00:06:32.830> of<00:06:32.919> manage<00:06:33.070> to<00:06:33.400> consolidate<00:06:33.940> a

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
and you sort of manage to consolidate a

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.190 
and you sort of manage to consolidate a
losing<00:06:34.330> position<00:06:34.450> into<00:06:34.840> something<00:06:35.169> that

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
losing position into something that

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.040 
losing position into something that
looks<00:06:35.320> like<00:06:35.530> a<00:06:35.620> position<00:06:36.190> you<00:06:36.820> know<00:06:36.940> and<00:06:37.300> in<00:06:37.930> a

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
looks like a position you know and in a

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.450 
looks like a position you know and in a
way<00:06:38.169> you<00:06:38.260> get<00:06:38.380> a<00:06:38.440> little<00:06:38.620> bit<00:06:38.890> rewarded<00:06:39.310> for

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
way you get a little bit rewarded for

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.279 
way you get a little bit rewarded for
your<00:06:39.520> for<00:06:40.090> your<00:06:40.180> defense<00:06:40.690> because<00:06:40.990> obviously

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
your for your defense because obviously

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:42.779 
your for your defense because obviously
it<00:06:41.560> wasn't<00:06:41.680> even<00:06:41.860> easy<00:06:42.070> for<00:06:42.310> me<00:06:42.400> to<00:06:42.430> get<00:06:42.640> to

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:42.789 
it wasn't even easy for me to get to

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:44.570 
it wasn't even easy for me to get to
that<00:06:42.820> losing<00:06:43.120> position<00:06:43.630> from<00:06:43.840> what<00:06:43.990> I<00:06:44.020> had

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
that losing position from what I had

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.960 
that losing position from what I had
so<00:06:45.120> I<00:06:45.600> feel<00:06:46.260> like<00:06:46.290> in<00:06:46.500> some<00:06:46.680> sense<00:06:46.890> uh<00:06:46.980> I<00:06:47.430> earned

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
so I feel like in some sense uh I earned

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.430 
so I feel like in some sense uh I earned
my<00:06:48.090> luck<00:06:48.270> a<00:06:48.300> little<00:06:48.600> bit<00:06:48.780> but<00:06:48.990> of<00:06:49.080> course<00:06:49.320> not

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
my luck a little bit but of course not

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.980 
my luck a little bit but of course not
completely<00:06:50.240> so<00:06:51.240> when<00:06:51.390> you<00:06:51.450> look<00:06:51.600> back<00:06:51.750> in<00:06:51.900> this

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
completely so when you look back in this

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.360 
completely so when you look back in this
tournament<00:06:52.260> what<00:06:52.440> do<00:06:52.500> you<00:06:52.560> think<00:06:52.710> will<00:06:52.830> will

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
tournament what do you think will will

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.390
