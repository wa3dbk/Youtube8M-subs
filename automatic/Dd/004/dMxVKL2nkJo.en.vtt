manager and an application manager which
is<00:01:52.649> really<00:01:52.829> nice<00:01:53.009> i'll<00:01:53.280> show<00:01:53.459> it<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.639> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
is really nice i'll show it on the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.940 
is really nice i'll show it on the
software<00:01:54.179> part<00:01:54.389> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.539> review<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.829> a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
software part of the review you have a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.789 
software part of the review you have a
joystick<00:01:56.639> control<00:01:57.600> which<00:01:58.170> i<00:01:58.350> must<00:01:58.560> say<00:01:58.770> i

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
joystick control which i must say i

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.370 
joystick control which i must say i
don't<00:01:59.009> i<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.639> better<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.969> d-pad<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.689> probably

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
don't i like better a d-pad or probably

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.090 
don't i like better a d-pad or probably
a<00:02:02.039> trackball<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.119> i'll<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:04.409> testing<00:02:04.709> it<00:02:04.979> out

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
a trackball but i'll be testing it out

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.459 
a trackball but i'll be testing it out
see<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:06.060> worth<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.719> really

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
see if it's really worth the really

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.639 
see if it's really worth the really
worth<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:08.660> benefit<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.350> an<00:02:10.470> end

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
worth the benefit and we have an end

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.140 
worth the benefit and we have an end
button<00:02:10.860> which<00:02:11.039> has<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> peculiarity<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.970> if

you<00:02:12.240> press<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.480> once<00:02:12.780> it'll<00:02:12.990> end<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.230> call<00:02:13.470> and

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
you press it once it'll end the call and

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.690

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
the top you have just the GPS insignia

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.780 
the top you have just the GPS insignia
with<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.750> lanyard<00:02:29.230> connection<00:02:29.770> if<00:02:30.640> you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
with the lanyard connection if you

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.460 
with the lanyard connection if you
compare<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.270> device<00:02:31.540> with<00:02:31.720> others<00:02:32.020> for

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
compare the device with others for

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.960 
compare the device with others for
example<00:02:32.830> my<00:02:32.920> Harold<00:02:33.250> here<00:02:33.430> your<00:02:33.610> knowledge

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
example my Harold here your knowledge

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.750 
example my Harold here your knowledge
you'll<00:02:34.210> notice<00:02:34.480> there<00:02:34.630> are<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.750> same<00:02:34.930> size

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
you'll notice there are the same size

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.330 
you'll notice there are the same size
definitely<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.790> lot<00:02:37.150> lighter<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:38.200> glofish<00:02:39.040> is

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
definitely a lot lighter the glofish is

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.580 
definitely a lot lighter the glofish is
a<00:02:39.370> lot<00:02:39.580> lighter<00:02:40.080> definitely<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> lot<00:02:41.320> thinner

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
a lot lighter definitely a lot thinner

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
a lot lighter definitely a lot thinner
because<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:42.040> don't<00:02:42.160> have<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.310> built-in

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
because you don't have a built-in

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.510 
because you don't have a built-in
keyboard<00:02:43.050> he<00:02:44.050> compared<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> ipad<00:02:44.830> there's

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
keyboard he compared to the ipad there's

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.170 
keyboard he compared to the ipad there's
a<00:02:45.580> very<00:02:45.820> big<00:02:46.030> difference<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:47.650> it's<00:02:48.580> ass<00:02:48.880> then

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
a very big difference but it's ass then

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.450 
a very big difference but it's ass then
which<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.540> really<00:02:49.780> good<00:02:50.220> probably<00:02:51.220> one<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
which is really good probably one of the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.890 
which is really good probably one of the
things<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.790> like<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.000> most<00:02:52.120> about<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.570> device

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
things I like the most about this device

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.720 
things I like the most about this device
is<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.140> vga<00:02:53.440> screen<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:54.040> must<00:02:54.280> say<00:02:54.460> it's

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
is the vga screen I must say it's

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.690 
is the vga screen I must say it's
definitely<00:02:55.180> brilliant<00:02:55.830> 2.8<00:02:56.830> inch<00:02:57.070> screen

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
definitely brilliant 2.8 inch screen

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.790 
definitely brilliant 2.8 inch screen
with<00:02:58.000> vga<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:58.870> definitely<00:02:59.380> seamless

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
with vga is definitely seamless

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.650 
with vga is definitely seamless
resolution<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.610> looks<00:03:00.820> beautiful<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.450> like

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
resolution that looks beautiful I like

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.260 
resolution that looks beautiful I like
it<00:03:01.840> definitely<00:03:02.680> like<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.880> out<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:04.060> memory

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
it definitely like it out of memory

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.250 
it definitely like it out of memory
probably<00:03:04.990> what<00:03:05.560> you'll<00:03:05.770> get<00:03:06.040> even<00:03:06.670> though<00:03:07.260> you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
probably what you'll get even though you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.580 
probably what you'll get even though you
have<00:03:08.350> 256<00:03:09.100> megabytes<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.760> RAM<00:03:09.970> out<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.270> which

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
have 256 megabytes of RAM out of which

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.560

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
RAM out of which only 47.2 are mentioned

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.390

but<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.150> actually<00:03:19.330> only<00:03:19.780> get<00:03:20.020> 20<00:03:20.230> point<00:03:20.650> 67

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
but you actually only get 20 point 67

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.100 
but you actually only get 20 point 67
which<00:03:21.550> is<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.790> something<00:03:22.570> I<00:03:22.780> don't<00:03:22.960> like<00:03:22.990> about

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
which is a something I don't like about
