the<00:00:12.030> crappy<00:00:12.719> gimbal<00:00:13.580> this<00:00:14.580> robot<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.089> inspired

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
the crappy gimbal this robot is inspired

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.140 
the crappy gimbal this robot is inspired
from<00:00:15.540> insects<00:00:16.340> because<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.460> looked<00:00:17.640> at<00:00:17.820> you

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
from insects because we looked at you

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.970 
from insects because we looked at you
know<00:00:18.240> how<00:00:18.270> fly<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.750> colliding<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.439> things<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
know how fly is colliding to things and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.160 
know how fly is colliding to things and
you<00:00:20.730> know<00:00:20.850> they<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.270> die<00:00:21.510> when<00:00:21.869> they<00:00:21.990> touch

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
you know they do not die when they touch

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.830 
you know they do not die when they touch
a<00:00:22.199> window<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.789> we<00:00:23.789> wanted<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> replicate<00:00:24.720> this

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
a window and we wanted to replicate this

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.019 
a window and we wanted to replicate this
behavior<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.099> planked<00:00:26.310> robots<00:00:26.609> because

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
behavior in in a planked robots because

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.599 
behavior in in a planked robots because
we<00:00:27.150> thought<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.630> 500<00:00:28.500> million<00:00:29.250> years<00:00:29.369> of

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
we thought you know 500 million years of

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.150 
we thought you know 500 million years of
in<00:00:29.779> evolution<00:00:30.779> can<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.289> wrong<00:00:31.500> gimbal<00:00:32.130> is

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
in evolution can be wrong gimbal is

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.670 
in evolution can be wrong gimbal is
another<00:00:32.910> flying<00:00:33.270> robots<00:00:33.690> because<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.530> has

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
another flying robots because it has

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.060 
another flying robots because it has
this<00:00:34.860> rotating<00:00:35.579> protective<00:00:36.120> frame<00:00:36.329> around

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
this rotating protective frame around

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.510 
this rotating protective frame around
around<00:00:38.070> its<00:00:38.280> inner<00:00:38.879> part<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:40.399> where<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
around its inner part to see where the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850 
around its inner part to see where the
actual<00:00:41.910> flying<00:00:42.210> robot<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.719> actually<00:00:43.200> located

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
actual flying robot is actually located

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.400 
actual flying robot is actually located
and<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:45.210> allows<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> robot<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.960> collide

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and this allows the robot to collide

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.799 
and this allows the robot to collide
them<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> things<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.160> continue<00:00:48.149> its<00:00:48.539> flight

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
them to things and continue its flight

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.709 
them to things and continue its flight
undisturbed<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.670> also<00:00:50.820> safe<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.210> fly<00:00:51.539> close

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
undisturbed it is also safe to fly close

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.330 
undisturbed it is also safe to fly close
to<00:00:51.930> human<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.190> touch

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to human because you can you can touch

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.529 
to human because you can you can touch
it<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.640> flight<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.270> cage

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
it in flight you have this cage

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.600 
it in flight you have this cage
protecting<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.739> dangerous<00:00:56.100> propellers

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
protecting the the dangerous propellers

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.110 
protecting the the dangerous propellers
from<00:00:57.410> from<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:58.649> hurting<00:00:58.859> your<00:00:59.129> hands<00:00:59.489> we

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
from from you know hurting your hands we

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.479 
from from you know hurting your hands we
believe<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.719> having<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.649> mechanical

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
believe that having this mechanical

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.990 
believe that having this mechanical
intelligence<00:01:03.059> built<00:01:03.899> into<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> system

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
intelligence built into the system

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.070 
intelligence built into the system
instead<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> having<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.630> complex

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
instead of having you know complex

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.670 
instead of having you know complex
obstacle<00:01:07.710> avoidance<00:01:07.799> system<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.840> is<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.380> great

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
obstacle avoidance system is is a great

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.590 
obstacle avoidance system is is a great
solution<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.369> very<00:01:11.610> complex<00:01:12.060> problem<00:01:12.510> of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
solution to this very complex problem of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.560 
solution to this very complex problem of
flying<00:01:13.500> robots<00:01:13.590> indoors<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.270> describe

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
flying robots indoors can you describe

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
flying robots indoors can you describe
the<00:01:15.810> different<00:01:16.080> components<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.920> sure<00:01:17.880> when

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the different components to it sure when

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.149 
the different components to it sure when
I<00:01:18.360> look<00:01:18.570> at<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.810> lot<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.259> quad<00:01:19.439> copters<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:19.890> then

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
I look at a lot of quad copters and then

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
I look at a lot of quad copters and then
like<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> quadcopter<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.840> you

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
like this is not a quadcopter as you

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.539 
like this is not a quadcopter as you
said<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.439> not<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.680> quadcopter

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
said it's not a quadcopter

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.780 
said it's not a quadcopter
it's<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.060> two<00:01:24.750> contra-rotating<00:01:25.200> propellers<00:01:25.790> so

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it's a two contra-rotating propellers so

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.760 
it's a two contra-rotating propellers so
the<00:01:27.000> idea<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:28.049> best<00:01:28.290> use<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the idea is to you know best use the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.969 
the idea is to you know best use the
space<00:01:29.040> inside<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.060> sphere<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.740> that's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
space inside the sphere and and that's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.679 
space inside the sphere and and that's
why<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.310> use<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.670> technology<00:01:33.030> instead<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
why we use this technology instead of a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.800 
why we use this technology instead of a
quad<00:01:34.009> we<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.189> some<00:01:35.700> flaps<00:01:35.970> down<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:36.420> that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
quad we have some flaps down there that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.469 
quad we have some flaps down there that
are<00:01:37.500> used<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.070> guidance<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> robots<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
are used for guidance of the robots and

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.490 
are used for guidance of the robots and
for<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> stabilization<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:42.420> board<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
for the stabilization on board we have a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.359 
for the stabilization on board we have a
we<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.280> an<00:01:44.549> HD<00:01:44.970> camera<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
we have an HD camera and we have all the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.149 
we have an HD camera and we have all the
all<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.000> electronics<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.840> allow<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
all the electronics that allow for the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.179 
all the electronics that allow for the
control<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.820> robot<00:01:51.590> now<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.950> real

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
control of the robot now the real

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.300 
control of the robot now the real
innovation<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.970> there<00:01:54.780> lies<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.979> this

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
innovation in there lies on on this

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.740 
innovation in there lies on on this
gimbal<00:01:57.180> system<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.710> see<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:59.250> two

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
gimbal system so you can see here two

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.679 
gimbal system so you can see here two
carbon-fiber<00:02:00.750> rings<00:02:01.490> that's<00:02:02.689> actually

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
carbon-fiber rings that's actually

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.130 
carbon-fiber rings that's actually
decouple

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
decouple

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.440 
decouple
a<00:02:05.170> frame<00:02:05.590> from<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.760> outer<00:02:07.000> frame<00:02:07.890> let<00:02:08.890> me

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
a frame from the outer frame let me

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.510 
a frame from the outer frame let me
some<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.810> nation

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520
