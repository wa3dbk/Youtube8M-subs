00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.720
 Hi girls, how are you? I 'm fine. 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.600
 today to show you 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.099
 the video of the tattoo I did on my 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.590
 pinky finger 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.869
 Actually, neither apple is in this video. 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.739
 because I did not think it stayed this way it 's 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.719
 super explanatory and but I decided 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.600
 to bet because many of you were 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.510
 asking me curious to know of my 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.270
 of my new arm tattoos 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.480
 I'm going to record another video will not go 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.719
 give in because you gave her trouble 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.210
 I'll explain to you later, but then I 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.719
 I'll show you, then, just the little pinkie. 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.879
 my fourth tattoo and I have one 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.339
 so special affection for her that I 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.110
 I think it got super cute and I did not feel 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.820
 a lot of pain because I know you're going 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.729
 ask right? 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.850
 in a matter of pain is a place yes that is 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.040
 very sensitive and you will feel quite 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.439
 Sweet, you do something great. 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.680
 detailed and completed 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.000
 as mine was a little heart in the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.220
 little finger because I think we 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.040
 other fingers ends up getting a drawing a 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.590
 slightly higher with the finger by finger area 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.869
 be bigger as I chose the pinky to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.530
 small area and I chose a heart 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.900
 small and only bypassed is when I 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.270
 I started to feel pain I just knew 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.490
 because it's just the outline 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.079
 So it was really quiet, I guess. 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.439
 which was one of the tattoos you feel 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.210
 less pain because it was super fast and 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.390
 Look, I have five tattoos and the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.280
 my tattoos are not big and so 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.560
 is here or if you feel like 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.259
 do finger tattoo and are afraid because 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.479
 They say it hurts a lot that they say that finger. 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.710
 of the foot ribs are the places that most 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.569
 It hurts if your finger ends up not feeling 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.190
 a lot of pain you know because they are usually 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.130
 small drawings is that's it 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.550
 My computer did not understand with 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.950
 no one because it was super 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.360
 only thing to do the tattoo on the finger 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.640
 which may be an obstacle to 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.460
 some people do as it goes 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.500
 spending time means that the tattoo will 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.260
 disappearing because it is a place where you 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.390
 moves a lot 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.970
 but this can be only you retouch the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.550
 My, for example, I already have some good ones. 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.520
 three months out there about three months 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.890
 and her little corner is already fading 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.640
 This is how it's doing with everything 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.640
 Okay, but you know, it's not black. 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.830
 getting pale and then I have here the most 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.130
 or less, about six months a year already 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.840
 sure to touch her and the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.780
 only problem is the one you have to 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.730
 Retouch but if you have no problem 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.850
 none of this I always recommend 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.180
 I think we give it super cool charm. 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.400
 My little fingered because the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.320
 finger on the side would be the finger of the covenant 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.880
 When I get married and God willing I go 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.520
 to marry and then this is how it is gives a charm 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.600
 the more abel I'm in love with my 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.420
 tattoo 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.010
 I'm too suspicious to talk and that's it. 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.200
 I hope I have clarified who 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.180
 you have more questions, just leave it in the 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.820
 information that I'll be responding to 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.910
 to anyone who wants to see more photos of all 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.830
 details of the studio where I made the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.230
 My tattoo is just entering the blog that 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.239
 I'm going to leave everything okay. 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.239
 A goodbye, bye, bye to the next one. 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.239
 O
