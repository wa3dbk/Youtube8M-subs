 the essence of training is easy to understand 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.630
 build-up we can understand on simple 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.750
 example when you lift heavy 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.750
 landing occurs microtrauma muscle 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.260
 domino fibers in human 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.690
 body work amazing 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.370
 adaptation mechanism itself healing if 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.940
 get iran fracture cut

 new fabric is formed to the sport 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:18.530
 filling the gap 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.800
 it looks like smart phones welders 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.790

 n natural oils made public and that 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.700
 the most important boosting mechanism 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.640
 self-cleaning the body for example with 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.450
 using capillary shake sizo in 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.010
 fiber intake 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.929
 earlier drop in alkaline ration in 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.149
 building is the ability to get microtrauma 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.359
 muscle and give them time for 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:48.839
 recovery gap new 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.100
 muscle tissue it requires admission 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.839
 plenty of healthy nutrients 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.260
 by eating food prepared for us 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.479
 nature of the recovery process 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.089
 require a good rest of one of 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.729
 the most important principles will be 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.949
 money while self underestimating you 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:03.610
 neglect 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.640
 halftime people think they need to 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.800
 eat more and exercise but sleep 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.650
 and rest is also important and sometimes even more important 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.740
 importance must not be neglected 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.929
 good sleep 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.359
 it is also important when you go to bed you

 you need a lot of sunshine 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.750
 because taking skin contact 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.410
 organized brings important 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.180
 nutrients with essential 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.509
 health and growing street 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.719
 and what exercises we do gym 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.409
 Well, first of all, this is not 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.049
 there must be gyms 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.450
 exercise can be done anywhere 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.020
 it could be a playground

 rooms of the hotel or home bedroom 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.259
 kitchen backyard you can work with

 partners in the park who grew up in general almost 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.880
 everywhere I don't need complex simulators and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.469

 certain exercises are said 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.270

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.460
 similar to Latin 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.020
 alas edges that is attached to mars and

 process is done usually on 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.859
 the other side of the joint is still 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:12.790
 one muscle which at the time 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.370
 stretched but if it is easier to talk with 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.290
 a cat that makes muscle cut 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.480
 work and therefore trains

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.179
 famous v shaped figure is formed for 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:44.099
 back muscle count rearing the most 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.119
 heavy thoughts work through however

 muscle corset around the spine 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.679
 when i like volatility 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:57.649
 moment did not visit therapists many 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:58.169
 the years 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.929
 it is also useful to people who are many 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.649
 work at the computer for 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:03.079

 which reduce the gluteal muscles 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.040
 for example understanding legs back lifting 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.050
 lowering with weight on the box will arrest 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.690
 raise and lower 110 minutes more

 conditions are amazing how much fun 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.610
 come up with different ways 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.390
 training this case that you have 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.850
 surrounds as for food then many people 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.930
 think you need to eat a lot of meat to

 who don't eat drink straight on 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.490
 building new places becomes coruÃ±a 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.200
 attached just like human muscles 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.080
 White is made of amino acids when we 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.030
 eat meat but must pay for them 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.420
 acids from which can then 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.380
 human muscles are formed but 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.740
 our body spend a lot 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.420
 strenuously splitting their 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.930
 opinions 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.220
 already reducing such a form as may 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.240
 be transported in the cell through the blood you 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.510
 noticed how you feel

 typical jogging especially if in it 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.770
 eat meat vegetable food 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.830
 digested much easier they 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.460
 require for this much less 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.880
 energy she is cleaner and healthier 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.980
 plant foods have amino acids 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.730
 so you can build on it 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.620
 muscles and you can see this 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.740
 look at the people in this movie on the most 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.320
 big and powerful animals on the planet

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.490
 muscles you can get the belov 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.660
 from plant food we are the only ones 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.760
 creatures on the planet who are preparing their 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.920
 the trouble is the only being who

 cancer obesity and so on are the only ones 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.780
 animals that are sick of these 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.240
 diseases are those that are fed 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.430
 man the more we see food in that form 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.890
 in which it is created by nature and this is the 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.990
 fruit vegetables nuts seeds and berries and the 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.000
 so healthier stronger freer 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.170
 diseases we become we live longer 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.040
