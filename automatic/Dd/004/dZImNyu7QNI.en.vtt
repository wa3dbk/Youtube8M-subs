tip to keep it not slow down so once you
use<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.770> use

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
use that then you go like you you use

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.480 
use that then you go like you you use
the<00:01:23.340> sides<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.820> keep<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:26.159> keep<00:01:26.369> on

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the sides to keep on going you keep on

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.249 
the sides to keep on going you keep on
going<00:01:26.759> keep<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.000> spinning<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.049> add

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
going keep on spinning then you can add

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.350 
going keep on spinning then you can add
it<00:01:28.380> once<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.009> done<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:30.060> spin<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
it once you get this done just spin the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
you have the spinning down you can have

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.469 
you have the spinning down you can have
a<00:01:37.979> little<00:01:38.159> jump<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.930> put<00:01:40.079> four<00:01:40.290> fingers

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
a little jump you can put four fingers

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.940 
a little jump you can put four fingers
you<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.630> switch<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> four<00:01:43.409> fingers<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.799> one

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you can switch to a four fingers to one

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.590 
you can switch to a four fingers to one
finger<00:01:44.570> if<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.689> switch<00:01:45.899> fingers<00:01:46.259> period<00:01:50.600> and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
finger if you switch fingers period and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.800 
finger if you switch fingers period and
go<00:01:51.750> back<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.049> four<00:01:52.200> fingers<00:01:53.240> then<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.720> add
