things
three<00:00:40.320> things<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.739> could<00:00:40.770> think<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:42.440> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
three things I could think of one the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.470 
three things I could think of one the
last<00:00:43.649> time<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.100> had<00:00:44.340> touched<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:45.030> my<00:00:45.149> edges

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
last time I had touched up my edges

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.290 
last time I had touched up my edges
because<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.960> between<00:00:46.620> my<00:00:47.489> last<00:00:47.700> relaxed<00:00:48.120> right

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
because in between my last relaxed right

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.200 
because in between my last relaxed right
now<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.539> did<00:00:49.070> put<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:50.370> relaxer<00:00:50.879> around<00:00:51.120> my

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
now I did put a little relaxer around my

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.510 
now I did put a little relaxer around my
edges<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.379> last<00:00:52.410> time<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.980> did<00:00:53.280> that

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
edges and the last time that I did that

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.350 
edges and the last time that I did that
I<00:00:53.579> had<00:00:53.809> like<00:00:54.809> an<00:00:55.079> allergic<00:00:55.620> reaction<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.850> would

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
I had like an allergic reaction I would

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.569 
I had like an allergic reaction I would
say<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.469> don't<00:00:58.859> know<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.160> was<00:00:59.280> from<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
say and I don't know if it was from the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
say and I don't know if it was from the
relaxer<00:01:00.239> or<00:01:00.680> I<00:01:01.680> also<00:01:02.129> did<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.820> rinse<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.960> day

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
relaxer or I also did a rinse that day

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.560 
relaxer or I also did a rinse that day
could<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.500> been<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.070> well<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:06.000> could

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
could have been that as well so I could

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.179 
could have been that as well so I could
adjust<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.229> my<00:01:07.409> products<00:01:07.830> was<00:01:07.979> old

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
adjust then that my products was old

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.550 
adjust then that my products was old
because<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> had<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.780> relaxer<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.409> had

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
because I had the relaxer that I had

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.859 
because I had the relaxer that I had
used<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.950> time<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.549> had<00:01:11.939> had<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.240> quite<00:01:12.600> some

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
used that time I had had for quite some

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.350 
used that time I had had for quite some
time<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.549> was<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:15.030> bit<00:01:15.180> leery

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
time so I was just a little bit leery

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.570 
time so I was just a little bit leery
about<00:01:15.540> relaxing<00:01:16.350> my<00:01:16.500> hair<00:01:16.740> again<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> got

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
about relaxing my hair again but I got

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.789 
about relaxing my hair again but I got
over<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.570> obviously<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.470> relaxed<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.340> today

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
over it and obviously I relaxed it today

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.800 
over it and obviously I relaxed it today
second<00:01:22.799> reason<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.820> didn't<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.540> any

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
second reason was I didn't have any

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.490 
second reason was I didn't have any
relaxer<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.590> last<00:01:26.040> relaxer<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:27.200> only<00:01:28.200> had<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
relaxer that last relaxer I only had a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.020 
relaxer that last relaxer I only had a
very<00:01:28.590> little<00:01:28.950> bit<00:01:29.130> left<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.520> obviously<00:01:30.000> I

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
very little bit left and obviously I

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
very little bit left and obviously I
didn't<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> use<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.720> again<00:01:31.020> not<00:01:31.259> knowing

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
didn't want to use it again not knowing

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.469 
didn't want to use it again not knowing
if<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.799> was<00:01:31.890> old<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.400> maybe<00:01:32.579> cause<00:01:32.909> me<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.240> have

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
if it was old and maybe cause me to have

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.980 
if it was old and maybe cause me to have
that<00:01:33.990> reaction<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.360> third<00:01:36.659> reason

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that reaction and then the third reason

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.819 
that reaction and then the third reason
was<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:37.710> stopped<00:01:38.070> making<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.540> formula<00:01:40.530> that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
it for years you like it and then they

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.720 
it for years you like it and then they
go<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.180> prove<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:19.049> for<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.010> you're<00:02:20.700> just

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
go and prove it for you and you're just

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.199 
go and prove it for you and you're just
like<00:02:21.060> why<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.799> was<00:02:23.459> on<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.670> fence<00:02:23.940> for<00:02:24.150> a

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
like why so I was on the fence for a

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.350 
like why so I was on the fence for a
while<00:02:24.420> about<00:02:24.660> what<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.379> was<00:02:25.530> gonna<00:02:25.680> do<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.760> they

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
while about what I was gonna do and they

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.289 
while about what I was gonna do and they
also<00:02:27.629> have<00:02:28.230> changed<00:02:29.220> these<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.849> have<00:02:29.970> my<00:02:30.239> own

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
also have changed these to have my own

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.699 
also have changed these to have my own
normal<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.230> super<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.950> now<00:02:32.129> they<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.549> have

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
normal and super and now they just have

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.789 
normal and super and now they just have
mild<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.099> normal<00:02:35.549> so<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.120> was<00:02:36.569> like<00:02:36.810> okay<00:02:37.650> what

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
mild and normal so I was like okay what

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.119 
mild and normal so I was like okay what
I<00:02:37.829> still<00:02:38.099> get<00:02:38.250> normal<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.959> was<00:02:40.140> worried

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
I still get normal and I was worried

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.130 
I still get normal and I was worried
about<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.430> because<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.480> normal<00:02:42.959> bottle

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
about that because on the normal bottle

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.119 
about that because on the normal bottle
it<00:02:43.440> says<00:02:43.470> something<00:02:43.920> like<00:02:44.280> from<00:02:44.879> moderate<00:02:45.420> to

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
it says something like from moderate to

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.100 
it says something like from moderate to
maximum<00:02:47.129> straightening<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.879> as<00:02:48.269> many<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.989> you

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
maximum straightening and as many of you

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.199 
maximum straightening and as many of you
know<00:02:49.319> I<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.190> leave<00:02:50.370> some<00:02:50.400> texture<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.150> my

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
know I like to leave some texture in my

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.319 
know I like to leave some texture in my
hair<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.810> something<00:02:52.379> that<00:02:52.410> says<00:02:53.329> maximum

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
hair so something that says maximum

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.360 
hair so something that says maximum
straightening<00:02:55.049> just<00:02:55.440> really<00:02:55.890> doesn't<00:02:56.160> appeal

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
straightening just really doesn't appeal

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.240 
straightening just really doesn't appeal
to<00:02:56.400> me<00:02:56.579> so<00:02:57.239> anyway<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.170> ended<00:02:58.410> up<00:02:58.739> getting<00:02:59.069> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
to me so anyway I ended up getting the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.110 
to me so anyway I ended up getting the
mild<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.940> I'm<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.269> happy<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.810> did<00:03:00.930> because

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
mild and I'm so happy that I did because

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.119 
mild and I'm so happy that I did because
after<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> was<00:03:03.510> done<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.750> could<00:03:04.049> still<00:03:04.530> feel<00:03:04.799> you

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
after I was done I could still feel you

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.059 
after I was done I could still feel you
know<00:03:05.959> somewhat<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.079> a<00:03:07.139> curl<00:03:07.380> pattern<00:03:07.739> at<00:03:07.920> my

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
know somewhat of a curl pattern at my

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.920 
know somewhat of a curl pattern at my
roots<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:08.819> is<00:03:08.940> exactly<00:03:09.359> what<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.599> like<00:03:09.780> I

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
roots and that is exactly what I like I

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.020 
roots and that is exactly what I like I
don't<00:03:09.989> care<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:11.040> relax<00:03:11.519> my<00:03:11.639> hair<00:03:11.670> bone

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
don't care to relax my hair bone

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.050 
don't care to relax my hair bone
straight<00:03:12.329> anymore<00:03:12.569> so<00:03:13.280> gay<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.519> probably<00:03:14.819> will

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
straight anymore so gay I probably will

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.979 
straight anymore so gay I probably will
make<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.299> review<00:03:15.930> on<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:17.180> new<00:03:18.180> formula

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
make a review on this new formula

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.420 
make a review on this new formula
because<00:03:19.380> when<00:03:19.769> I<00:03:19.799> was<00:03:19.919> trying<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.190> do<00:03:20.250> some

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
because when I was trying to do some

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.890 
because when I was trying to do some
research<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.880> really<00:03:21.120> didn't<00:03:21.359> see<00:03:21.389> anybody

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
research I really didn't see anybody

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.050 
research I really didn't see anybody
work<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.620> new<00:03:22.769> butter<00:03:23.010> blends<00:03:23.310> formula

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
work you the new butter blends formula

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.360 
work you the new butter blends formula
so<00:03:24.620> hopefully<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.680> can<00:03:25.769> get<00:03:26.040> around<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.340> doing

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
so hopefully I can get around to doing

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.729 
so hopefully I can get around to doing
that<00:03:26.760> soon<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.989> yeah<00:03:28.109> that<00:03:28.319> was<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.530> three

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
that soon so yeah that was the three

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.589 
that soon so yeah that was the three
reasons<00:03:29.099> why<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.639> took<00:03:29.790> me<00:03:29.849> so<00:03:30.000> long<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.269> relax

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
reasons why it took me so long to relax

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.940 
reasons why it took me so long to relax
my<00:03:30.720> hair<00:03:32.450> yeah<00:03:33.450> probably<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.410> fourth<00:03:34.709> reason

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
my hair yeah probably a fourth reason

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.150 
my hair yeah probably a fourth reason
would<00:03:35.250> be<00:03:35.310> because<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.700> was<00:03:35.849> lazy<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:37.139> I<00:03:37.919> just

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
would be because I was lazy and I just

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.280 
would be because I was lazy and I just
didn't<00:03:38.459> feel<00:03:38.609> like<00:03:38.849> it<00:03:38.910> but<00:03:39.780> yeah<00:03:39.959> that's<00:03:40.079> not

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
didn't feel like it but yeah that's not

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.259 
didn't feel like it but yeah that's not
gonna<00:03:40.440> be<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:41.069> hope<00:03:41.430> that's<00:03:41.700> not<00:03:41.819> gonna<00:03:42.000> be<00:03:42.150> my

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
gonna be I hope that's not gonna be my

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.800 
gonna be I hope that's not gonna be my
norm<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.870> probably<00:03:43.739> will<00:03:44.280> go<00:03:44.940> back<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.329> relaxing

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
norm I probably will go back to relaxing

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.430 
norm I probably will go back to relaxing
every<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:47.489> know<00:03:47.519> three<00:03:47.940> or<00:03:47.970> four<00:03:48.030> months<00:03:48.440> that

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
every you know three or four months that

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.240 
every you know three or four months that
is<00:03:49.739> where<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.430> am<00:03:50.970> most<00:03:51.269> comfortable<00:03:51.599> so<00:03:52.319> yeah<00:03:52.919> I

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
is where I am most comfortable so yeah I

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.580 
is where I am most comfortable so yeah I
relaxed<00:03:54.030> my<00:03:54.120> hair<00:03:54.269> today<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:56.669> mean<00:03:56.849> um<00:03:57.590> um

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
relaxed my hair today and I mean um um

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.059 
relaxed my hair today and I mean um um
um<00:03:59.340> there<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.819> go<00:04:00.000> again<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.389> would<00:04:01.260> say<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:01.620> my

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
um there I go again I would say that my

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.970 
um there I go again I would say that my
hair<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.370> grazing<00:04:03.120> waist<00:04:03.959> length<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.889> you

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
hair is grazing waist length and you

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.619 
hair is grazing waist length and you
know<00:04:05.099> it's<00:04:05.370> not<00:04:05.639> full<00:04:06.629> full<00:04:07.049> waist<00:04:07.410> length<00:04:07.739> but

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
know it's not full full waist length but

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.610 
know it's not full full waist length but
grazing<00:04:09.629> and<00:04:09.780> it's<00:04:09.870> probably<00:04:10.139> only<00:04:10.259> gonna<00:04:10.440> be

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
grazing and it's probably only gonna be

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.210 
grazing and it's probably only gonna be
grazing<00:04:10.919> for<00:04:11.400> another<00:04:11.880> day

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
grazing for another day

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.940 
grazing for another day
or<00:04:12.370> two<00:04:12.580> because<00:04:12.910> I<00:04:13.000> do<00:04:13.060> plan<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.570> cut<00:04:13.870> off<00:04:14.020> a

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
or two because I do plan to cut off a

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.560 
or two because I do plan to cut off a
good<00:04:15.700> inch<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.959> half<00:04:16.989> maybe<00:04:17.709> two<00:04:18.459> off<00:04:19.269> the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
good inch and a half maybe two off the
