thought I would make this video about a
hidden<00:00:08.519> room<00:00:08.550> because<00:00:09.090> etho<00:00:09.780> had<00:00:10.740> recently

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
hidden room because etho had recently

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
come out with his bud switch which

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.210 
come out with his bud switch which
allows<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.450> use<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.560> fact<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.980> blocks

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
allows you to use the fact that blocks

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.420 
allows you to use the fact that blocks
want<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> block<00:00:20.490> updates<00:00:21.949> next<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:25.400> piece<00:00:26.400> of

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
want to block updates next to a piece of

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.380 
want to block updates next to a piece of
water<00:00:26.849> block<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:29.689> like<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:32.390> c/o

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
water block that is like this c/o

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
water block that is like this c/o
instant<00:00:34.110> minds<00:00:34.290> off<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.190> when<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.430> block

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
instant minds off so when I block

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.470 
instant minds off so when I block
updates<00:00:45.450> or<00:00:46.610> let's<00:00:47.610> say<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> block<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.239> placed

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
updates or let's say a block is placed

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.180 
updates or let's say a block is placed
like<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.360> water<00:00:51.629> then<00:00:52.350> moves<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
like so then the water then moves it

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.459 
like so then the water then moves it
updates<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.300> moves<00:00:54.480> into<00:00:54.660> another<00:00:54.989> channel

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
updates and moves into another channel

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.799 
updates and moves into another channel
and<00:00:55.789> using<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.199> he<00:00:58.199> was<00:00:58.320> able<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.770> create<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
and using this he was able to create a

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
and using this he was able to create a
switch<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:03.920> knowing<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.100> i<00:01:05.309> recreated<00:01:06.000> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
switch so knowing that i recreated this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.370 
switch so knowing that i recreated this

little secret room now there's a to
flip-flop<00:02:22.390> hooked<00:02:22.930> up<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.620> which<00:02:24.130> I'll

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
flip-flop hooked up to it which I'll

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.520 
flip-flop hooked up to it which I'll
show<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.420> guys<00:02:25.569> here<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.959> second<00:02:26.319> what<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
show you guys here in a second what the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.940 
show you guys here in a second what the
mechanisms<00:02:27.100> look<00:02:27.280> like<00:02:27.520> but<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:29.590> problem

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
mechanisms look like but the the problem

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.009 
mechanisms look like but the the problem
is<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.520> technically<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.630> block<00:02:31.870> is

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
is that that technically the block is

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.410 
is that that technically the block is
going<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.230> update<00:02:32.380> twice<00:02:32.980> once<00:02:33.850> when<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
going to update twice once when the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.140 
going to update twice once when the
redstone<00:02:37.950> flashes<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.760> know<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:39.910> gives<00:02:40.030> that

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
redstone flashes you know it gives that

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.289 
redstone flashes you know it gives that
little<00:02:40.530> graphical<00:02:41.530> deep<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:43.630> graphics<00:02:45.299> just

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
little graphical deep the graphics just

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.890 
little graphical deep the graphics just
show<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.600> guys<00:02:46.840> again<00:02:47.230> oops<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:49.450> should<00:02:49.750> make

again<00:02:58.269> when<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:58.900> turns<00:02:59.170> off<00:02:59.530> like<00:03:00.370> right<00:03:00.610> there

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
again when it turns off like right there

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.270 
again when it turns off like right there
so<00:03:01.900> on<00:03:02.760> turns<00:03:03.760> on<00:03:04.080> opens<00:03:05.080> up<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.500> then<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
so on turns on opens up and then the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.759 
so on turns on opens up and then the
moment<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.640> turns<00:03:06.819> off<00:03:07.060> cheers<00:03:07.900> again<00:03:08.019> it's<00:03:08.650> a

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
moment it turns off cheers again it's a

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.039 
moment it turns off cheers again it's a
random<00:03:08.980> amount<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.580> time<00:03:09.850> that<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.660> does<00:03:11.019> that

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
random amount of time that it does that

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.229 
random amount of time that it does that
so<00:03:13.410> that's<00:03:14.410> hard<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.920> control<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.609> can<00:03:15.790> set<00:03:16.120> up

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
so that's hard to control you can set up

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.800 
so that's hard to control you can set up
mechanisms<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:16.959> make<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.350> stay<00:03:18.220> on<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.970> then

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
mechanisms to make it stay on and then

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.770 
mechanisms to make it stay on and then
when<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.350> go<00:03:20.530> in<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.010> bedroom<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.670> can<00:03:21.880> use

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
when you go in the bedroom you can use

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.830 
when you go in the bedroom you can use
the<00:03:23.340> switch<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.489> there<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.850> turn<00:03:25.090> off<00:03:25.269> your<00:03:25.480> RS

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
the switch in there to turn off your RS

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.449 
the switch in there to turn off your RS
nor<00:03:26.079> latch<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.910> then<00:03:27.970> put<00:03:28.570> an<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.890> gate<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.310> it

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
nor latch and then put an and gate to it

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.080 
nor latch and then put an and gate to it
like<00:03:30.730> if<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.209> RS<00:03:31.540> nor<00:03:31.750> latch<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:32.170> already<00:03:33.090> on

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
like if the RS nor latch is already on

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.590 
like if the RS nor latch is already on
then<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:37.660> hook<00:03:37.810> up<00:03:38.019> an<00:03:38.200> an<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.130> gate<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:40.239> RS

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
then you hook up an an and gate the RS

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.630 
then you hook up an an and gate the RS
nor<00:03:41.079> latch<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:44.079> button<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:45.250> if<00:03:45.400> both

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
nor latch and the the button and if both

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.750 
nor latch and the the button and if both
are<00:03:45.670> on<00:03:45.970> then<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.810> door<00:03:47.019> will<00:03:47.049> open<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:48.549> kind

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
are on then the door will open that kind

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.000 
are on then the door will open that kind

this<00:04:26.770> bug<00:04:27.520> where<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:27.880> water<00:04:28.120> doesn't<00:04:28.530> fall

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
this bug where the water doesn't fall

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.279 
this bug where the water doesn't fall
down<00:04:29.560> until<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.280> block<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.699> updated<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.479> then

down until the block is updated and then

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:38.490 
down until the block is updated and then
another<00:04:32.800> bug<00:04:33.729> where<00:04:36.539> read<00:04:37.539> when<00:04:37.870> two<00:04:38.139> pieces

retract<00:04:50.289> so<00:04:51.160> that's<00:04:51.340> two<00:04:51.880> bugs<00:04:52.180> he's<00:04:52.419> using<00:04:52.889> to

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
retract so that's two bugs he's using to

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.570 
retract so that's two bugs he's using to
make<00:04:54.009> his<00:04:54.310> which<00:04:54.820> works<00:04:55.410> fine<00:04:56.410> don't<00:04:57.370> get<00:04:57.490> me

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
make his which works fine don't get me

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.689 
make his which works fine don't get me
wrong<00:04:58.500> however<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.590> think<00:04:59.710> the<00:05:00.009> less<00:05:00.190> bugs<00:05:00.520> the

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
wrong however I think the less bugs the

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:07.010 
wrong however I think the less bugs the
better<00:05:03.509> so<00:05:04.509> it<00:05:05.259> goes<00:05:05.500> from<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.889> blood<00:05:06.250> switch

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
better so it goes from the blood switch

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:14.730 
better so it goes from the blood switch
into<00:05:08.020> my<00:05:09.210> t<00:05:10.210> flip-flop<00:05:10.659> here<00:05:12.300> out<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.750> into

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
power the door I will also put a link up

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.950 
power the door I will also put a link up
for<00:05:19.990> the<00:05:20.409> t<00:05:21.099> flip-flop<00:05:21.699> so<00:05:22.180> you<00:05:22.240> guys<00:05:22.509> if<00:05:22.840> you

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
for the t flip-flop so you guys if you

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.960 
for the t flip-flop so you guys if you
wanted<00:05:23.259> to<00:05:23.349> recreate<00:05:23.740> this<00:05:24.039> you<00:05:24.820> guys

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
wanted to recreate this you guys

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.040 
wanted to recreate this you guys
wouldn't<00:05:25.150> have<00:05:25.539> any<00:05:25.780> issues<00:05:27.690> right<00:05:28.690> behind

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
wouldn't have any issues right behind

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.029 
wouldn't have any issues right behind
here's<00:05:29.560> where<00:05:29.889> I<00:05:29.949> put<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:30.310> switch<00:05:31.710> why<00:05:32.710> it's

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
here's where I put the switch why it's

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.550 
here's where I put the switch why it's
open<00:05:33.669> by<00:05:33.820> default<00:05:34.320> is<00:05:35.320> because<00:05:36.009> when<00:05:36.909> I<00:05:37.690> was

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
open by default is because when I was

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.320 
open by default is because when I was
setting<00:05:39.009> things<00:05:39.190> up<00:05:39.460> here<00:05:39.729> I<00:05:39.759> accidentally

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
setting things up here I accidentally

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.200 
setting things up here I accidentally
pushed<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.229> button<00:05:41.979> so<00:05:42.340> it's<00:05:42.520> my<00:05:42.729> fault<00:05:45.210> this

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
pushed the button so it's my fault this

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:55.180 
pushed the button so it's my fault this
is<00:05:46.389> what<00:05:46.570> I<00:05:46.630> did<00:05:46.719> right<00:05:47.020> here<00:05:47.259> I<00:05:47.289> had<00:05:47.620> a

some redstone and I was just testing my

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.190 
some redstone and I was just testing my
t<00:06:04.590> flip-flop<00:06:05.450> so<00:06:06.450> it's<00:06:07.200> that<00:06:07.350> simple<00:06:08.510> so<00:06:09.510> just

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
t flip-flop so it's that simple so just

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.670 
t flip-flop so it's that simple so just
to<00:06:10.380> kind<00:06:10.560> of<00:06:10.650> show<00:06:10.890> you<00:06:10.950> guys<00:06:12.440> let's<00:06:13.440> tear<00:06:13.650> this

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
to kind of show you guys let's tear this

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.030 
to kind of show you guys let's tear this
down<00:06:13.890> a<00:06:14.160> little<00:06:14.310> bit<00:06:14.900> oops<00:06:15.900> I<00:06:16.290> don't<00:06:16.800> think<00:06:16.860> I

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
down a little bit oops I don't think I

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.520 
down a little bit oops I don't think I
wanted<00:06:17.340> to<00:06:17.460> destroy<00:06:17.820> that<00:06:20.240> this<00:06:21.240> is<00:06:21.480> the<00:06:21.720> block

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
wanted to destroy that this is the block

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.890 
wanted to destroy that this is the block
that<00:06:22.800> when<00:06:22.980> it<00:06:23.100> gets<00:06:23.250> updated<00:06:23.700> it<00:06:24.240> triggers

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
that when it gets updated it triggers

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.870 
that when it gets updated it triggers
all<00:06:25.080> of<00:06:25.200> this<00:06:26.000> I<00:06:28.130> just<00:06:29.130> need<00:06:29.310> to<00:06:29.430> make<00:06:29.580> sure<00:06:29.640> i

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
all of this I just need to make sure i

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.740 
all of this I just need to make sure i
have<00:06:30.060> no<00:06:31.550> parts<00:06:32.550> in<00:06:32.670> there<00:06:32.820> as<00:06:32.940> you<00:06:33.090> see<00:06:33.300> uses<00:06:33.720> a

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
have no parts in there as you see uses a

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.160 
have no parts in there as you see uses a
pressure<00:06:34.500> plate<00:06:34.710> so<00:06:34.980> if<00:06:35.040> you<00:06:35.160> have<00:06:35.280> little

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
pressure plate so if you have little

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.630 
pressure plate so if you have little
items<00:06:37.170> falling<00:06:37.740> down<00:06:38.010> in<00:06:38.160> there<00:06:38.310> that

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
items falling down in there that

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.290 
items falling down in there that
wouldn't<00:06:38.910> go<00:06:39.360> well<00:06:40.790> alright<00:06:41.790> so<00:06:41.970> you<00:06:42.060> could

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
wouldn't go well alright so you could

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.390 
wouldn't go well alright so you could
trigger<00:06:42.510> this<00:06:42.720> by<00:06:42.900> stepping<00:06:43.200> on<00:06:43.380> it<00:06:43.440> or<00:06:43.710> left

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
trigger this by stepping on it or left

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.830 
trigger this by stepping on it or left
clicking<00:06:44.700> or<00:06:44.910> right-clicking<00:06:45.300> i'm<00:06:45.630> just

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
clicking or right-clicking i'm just

clicking or right-clicking i'm just
going<00:06:45.990> to<00:06:46.020> right-click<00:06:46.860> know<00:06:47.460> that<00:06:47.760> works<00:06:47.970> to

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.290 

see<00:06:57.630> it's<00:06:57.780> on<00:06:57.990> at<00:06:58.320> the<00:06:58.440> moment<00:06:58.590> and<00:06:59.520> when<00:07:00.270> I

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
see it's on at the moment and when I

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.410 
see it's on at the moment and when I
deep<00:07:00.570> when<00:07:01.020> it<00:07:01.140> now<00:07:01.350> the<00:07:02.220> effects<00:07:02.640> a<00:07:02.820> lighting

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.420 
deep when it now the effects a lighting

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.050 
deep when it now the effects a lighting
turn<00:07:03.810> off<00:07:04.110> then<00:07:05.040> it<00:07:05.610> will<00:07:06.320> change<00:07:07.320> back<00:07:08.060> in

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
turn off then it will change back in

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.390 
turn off then it will change back in
