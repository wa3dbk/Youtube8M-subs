00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.470
 in this video I'll tell you how 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.289
 we can in a very simple way 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.779
 replace our old shower faucet 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.640
 by a hydromassage column the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.610
 Hydromassage columns are both for 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.989
 bathtub or for dishes the only thing that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.699
 the bath will identify very 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.280
 simply because they have a spout 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.890
 lower to fill the bathtub in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.780
 As for the plate columns there are two 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.149
 large groups the corner columns 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.120
 that usually come with a dish 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.309
 semicircular and straight columns that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.160
 usually carry square or 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.360
 rectangular 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.790
 this type of apparatus 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.920
 work a certain pressure so that the 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.050
 pressure is not excessive and breaks all the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.530
 internal mechanism usually come gifted 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.020
 of a pressure reducer plus the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.210
 correct flow is usually between 10 and 15 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.620
 liters per minute if you do not know what the 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.570
 flow that you have at home is so 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.850
 simple how to place a container of 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.790
 one liter under any tap and 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.870
 count the time it takes to fill 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.700
 generally you do not need to change 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.920
 position hydrants especially 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.560
 for this column model but for 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.780
 the corner columns the intakes should 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.310
 to be at a certain distance that 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.930
 You can find it in the distance 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.240
 installation manual before performing 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.890
 any type of operation is necessary 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.540
 we cut the stopcock the room 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.250
 of bathroom if we do not have a stopcock 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.920
 in the bathroom we will cut the 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.990
 general of the whole house to start 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.890
 remove the tap let's start with 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.890
 withdraw our flex 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.780
 next we are going to withdraw our 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.430
 tap and for that we're going to use a 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.430
 30 number fixed wrench 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.369
 The next thing we're going to do is remove 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.369
 Shields 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.550
 and then the eccentrics 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.770
 once removed our tap and the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.720
 eccentric and we only have left 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.000
 mark the position where you are going to go 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.950
 our column 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.330
 but first of all we have to withdraw 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.330
 the handle rest 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.610
 Not all models come with a 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.020
 template to be able to mark the drills 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.370
 of the supports but in this case 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.409
 we are lucky to have a template 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.020
 to mark the supports we are going to 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:55.090
 be worth of pencil meter the level 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.590
 The first thing we are going to do is take the 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.890
 intermediate measure between our intakes 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.990
 to have our column centered 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.610
 once we have that brand we're going to 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.610
 extend with the level down 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.380
 we take our template 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.819
 and we align the brand with the center of 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.900
 the water inlets 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.900
 from there 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.900
 Once the marks are made and before 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.020
 start to place our column let's 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:43.819
 to put some strands and we're going to 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:45.800
 apply some sealant thread now 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.180
 what we are going to do is mark the 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.180
 points of the supports 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.110
 disconnects the hammer from the drill 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.110
 when you go to drill in ceramics 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.989
 We present the column and we can 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.989
 screw 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.980
 first we fix all the screws and 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.540
 Now is when we can squeeze and move 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.350
 the column so that it fits perfectly 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.350
 adjusted 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.940
 once this is done we will check that 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.940
 we have preserved the level 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.949
 and we have made a small cajeado in 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.840
 our plastic housing so that 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.400
 Asome in the shots we have done it in a 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.229
 very simply we have simply 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.539
 marked and we have cut him with a 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.650
 cutting pliers or with pliers and 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.349
 now let's talk about the supports 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.550
 this cylindrical part is the one that will go 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.380
 screwed 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.480
 in the screws that we have placed but 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.480
 It also has a trim nut to 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.080
 once all the nuts have been removed 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.080
 we are going to screw the supports 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:33.409
 we take the hoses and insert them 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:35.419
 these filters that are so they do not pass 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.519
 the impurities of the water inside the 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.809
 column system we first squeeze 

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:41.679
 a little bit with your hand and then 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:41.679
 we will press with a key 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.110
 once connected the hoses we go 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.480
 to place the duct on top as 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.250
 You see the luchon has some nuts that 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.850
 let's unscrew to be able to place 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.850
 in the column 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:20.840
 now it is very important that we do the 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.840
 water connection 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:33.349
 once prepared this we can already 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.349
 bring the column to your operant site 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.079
 let's put the nuts 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:41.469
 up here so that they are not later 

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:41.469
 simple 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.970
 It is very important that you remember 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.890
 connect the hot water hose 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.420
 in the hot water intake and the 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.720
 cold water hose in the socket of the 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.720
 cold water 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.729
 we have already placed the question now 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.180
 we only have to place the rest of 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.180
 accessories 

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:52.940
 have you seen what simpler way to 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.290
 change the decoration of your bathroom and about 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.290
 all gain well-being
