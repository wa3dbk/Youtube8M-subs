00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
name so with most free website builders

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.260 
name so with most free website builders
you're<00:00:46.320> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.860> use<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.370> sub<00:00:48.059> domain

you're going to have to use a sub domain

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.569 
you're going to have to use a sub domain
so<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> created<00:00:49.289> websites<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:50.070> Weebly<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
so I created websites with Weebly and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.990 
so I created websites with Weebly and
Yola<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.600> example<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.289> Weebly<00:00:52.829> my<00:00:53.489> site

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
Yola and for example on Weebly my site

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.430 
Yola and for example on Weebly my site
would<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.449> web<00:00:54.809> eminence<00:00:55.579> weebly.com<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
would be web eminence weebly.com so the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.200 
would be web eminence weebly.com so the
fact<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.770> you're<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> sub<00:00:59.640> domain<00:00:59.789> means

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
fact that you're on a sub domain means

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.340 
fact that you're on a sub domain means
your<00:01:00.449> site<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.840> always<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> be

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
