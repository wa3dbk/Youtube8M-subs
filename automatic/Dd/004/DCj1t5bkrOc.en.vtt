personally have no problem with this

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.570 
personally have no problem with this
cover<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.590> think<00:02:45.800> it's<00:02:45.890> really<00:02:46.070> high<00:02:46.310> but<00:02:46.519> I

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
cover I think it's really high but I

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.190 
cover I think it's really high but I
think<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:46.940> cool<00:02:47.150> really<00:02:47.480> deserves<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.900> be<00:02:48.050> on<00:02:48.170> a

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
think so cool really deserves to be on a

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.870 
think so cool really deserves to be on a
cover<00:02:48.470> because<00:02:48.950> he<00:02:49.130> hasn't<00:02:49.280> really<00:02:49.580> been<00:02:49.700> on

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
cover because he hasn't really been on

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.210 
cover because he hasn't really been on
covers<00:02:50.269> in<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.840> long<00:02:51.050> time<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.530> don't<00:02:51.890> think<00:02:52.069> I've

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
covers in a long time I don't think I've

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.550 
covers in a long time I don't think I've
seen<00:02:52.280> him<00:02:52.640> on<00:02:52.700> MTV<00:02:53.209> cover<00:02:53.420> in<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.750> last<00:02:53.959> 10

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
seen him on MTV cover in the last 10

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.140 
seen him on MTV cover in the last 10
years<00:02:54.590> or<00:02:55.040> maybe<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.400> is<00:02:55.550> his<00:02:55.670> first<00:02:55.850> time

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150
