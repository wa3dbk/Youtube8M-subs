00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello friends with you valery 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.970
 Rudenko 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.120
 and today I will tell you about the miracle 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.710
 Soviet- era technique 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.500
 once did the units do not know those 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.430
 made a hole somewhere else 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.380
 probably in the gulag tore this one 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:29.519
 a bed with a cast iron lid 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:33.600
 which is upstairs she is ten and I know 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.300
 but how much they raise and the four don't speak 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.489
 already about the country itself did not find it in 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.290
 scrap metal 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.480
 there was no filling and made from it 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:52.379
 milling machine ordered from a turner here 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:59.370
 such a shaft I carved put 4 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:05.760
 kilo watt motor over here on 3000 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:09.150
 turns and he turns fast enough 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:15.920
 not recalculated to thousands around 7 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.920
 mine made just such a moving carriage 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:26.009
 here are small bearings they stand 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:33.090
 closed so as not to gather dust such slides 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:34.850
 its such an adjustment mechanism 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.700
 departure cutters 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:45.920
 made an ordinary worm rotate the handle 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:50.000
 and he moves this whole mechanism 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.009
 such a simple phrase is regulated 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.320
 height prizes 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:00.979
 washers lifting mechanism thought to do 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.039
 somehow very much hard thing and there 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.399
 must be served over time probably 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:13.040
 made about such a milling machine can 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:20.239
 do any quarter-door grooves of the hive 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:22.550
 Frames such a terrible technique to 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.230
 new meetings go to the site homemade 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.110
 beekeeper. room subscribe to the channel 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.730
 write in the comments who wants 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.730
 I will tell in more detail
