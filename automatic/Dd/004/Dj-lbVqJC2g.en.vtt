00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
just like our bolts so what's the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.139 
just like our bolts so what's the
difference<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.370> function<00:00:50.550> with<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
difference in the function with a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.080
