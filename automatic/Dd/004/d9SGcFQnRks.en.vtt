00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.550 

that's<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.560> too<00:01:55.710> bad<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.430> how

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
that's not too bad you can see how

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.280 
that's not too bad you can see how
directional<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.920> light<00:01:59.160> is<00:01:59.840> we<00:02:00.840> still<00:02:01.110> have

lighting the umbrella trying to move it
closer<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.820> center<00:02:09.479> right<00:02:10.350> now<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.679> coming

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
closer to center right now it's coming

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.130 
closer to center right now it's coming
pretty<00:02:11.340> strongly<00:02:11.760> one<00:02:12.120> side<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.480> my<00:02:12.600> face

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.980 
pretty strongly one side of my face
let's<00:02:13.590> see<00:02:13.709> how<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.890> changes<00:02:14.370> things<00:02:14.990> okay

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
let's see how that changes things okay

spilling<00:03:38.670> out<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.660> sides<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.080> this<00:03:40.200> kind

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
spilling out to the sides of this kind

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.210 
spilling out to the sides of this kind
of<00:03:40.980> goes<00:03:41.790> in<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.000> common<00:03:42.630> light<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:43.740> also<00:03:43.830> see

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
it's really exaggerating all of the

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.530 
it's really exaggerating all of the
texture<00:03:46.860> in<00:03:46.950> my<00:03:47.070> face<00:03:47.370> all<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.000> little<00:03:48.240> hairs

and the pores it's not so much harsh it
just<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.620> really<00:03:52.670> exaggerating<00:03:53.670> or<00:03:53.880> really

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
just is really exaggerating or really

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.880 
just is really exaggerating or really
showing<00:03:55.290> all<00:03:55.700> any<00:03:56.700> blemish<00:03:57.590> just<00:03:58.590> something

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
showing all any blemish just something

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.130 
showing all any blemish just something
to<00:03:58.950> be<00:03:59.040> aware<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.340> when<00:03:59.610> it's<00:03:59.760> coming<00:04:00.480> directly

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140

to be aware of when it's coming directly
at<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.500> I'm<00:04:01.680> going<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:01.890> do<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> similar<00:04:02.310> thing

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
at this I'm going to do a similar thing

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.910 
at this I'm going to do a similar thing
that<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.850> think<00:04:02.910> with<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.270> softbox<00:04:03.810> I'm<00:04:04.800> going

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
that I think with the softbox I'm going

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.190 
that I think with the softbox I'm going
to<00:04:04.980> keep<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.280> facing<00:04:05.490> directly<00:04:06.180> sideways<00:04:06.840> but

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
to keep it facing directly sideways but

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.130 
to keep it facing directly sideways but
I'm<00:04:07.290> going<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.470> move<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.010> back<00:04:08.490> edge<00:04:08.820> of<00:04:09.360> the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
I'm going to move the back edge of the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:18.430 
I'm going to move the back edge of the
umbrella<00:04:10.500> along<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:12.690> my<00:04:12.840> face<00:04:13.220> yeah<00:04:16.370> yeah

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
umbrella along to my face yeah yeah

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.409 
umbrella along to my face yeah yeah
can't<00:04:19.440> wanted<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.769> say<00:04:19.919> hi<00:04:20.870> yes

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.899 

so<00:04:25.050> now<00:04:25.199> instead<00:04:25.349> of<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.919> flash<00:04:26.280> head<00:04:26.580> being

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
so now instead of the flash head being

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:29.029 
so now instead of the flash head being
aligned<00:04:27.389> with<00:04:27.479> my<00:04:27.689> face<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.530> back<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:28.949> the

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
aligned with my face the back of the

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.589 
aligned with my face the back of the
umbrella<00:04:29.340> is<00:04:29.520> aligned<00:04:29.759> with<00:04:29.879> my<00:04:29.999> face<00:04:30.240> this

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
umbrella is aligned with my face this

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.080 
umbrella is aligned with my face this
should<00:04:30.780> allow<00:04:30.990> some<00:04:31.379> more<00:04:32.129> light<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.729> wrap

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
should allow some more light to wrap

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.119 
should allow some more light to wrap
around<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.599> fill<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.990> dark<00:04:34.439> side<00:04:36.860> so<00:04:37.860> with<00:04:38.009> my

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
around and fill the dark side so with my

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.830 
around and fill the dark side so with my
head<00:04:38.400> being<00:04:38.580> aligned<00:04:39.150> with<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.479> back<00:04:39.629> of<00:04:39.779> the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
head being aligned with the back of the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.749 
head being aligned with the back of the
umbrella<00:04:40.169> it<00:04:40.439> seems<00:04:40.889> to<00:04:41.129> produce<00:04:41.400> a<00:04:41.639> better

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
umbrella it seems to produce a better

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.140 
umbrella it seems to produce a better
type<00:04:41.999> of<00:04:42.180> light<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:43.349> light<00:04:43.680> does<00:04:44.279> wrap<00:04:44.819> around

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
type of light the light does wrap around

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.640 
type of light the light does wrap around
me<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.419> fills<00:04:45.659> in<00:04:45.810> some<00:04:45.840> of<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.139> shadows<00:04:46.469> on

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
me it fills in some of the shadows on

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.209 
me it fills in some of the shadows on
the<00:04:46.680> side<00:04:47.120> typically<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.539> would<00:04:49.110> use<00:04:49.319> a<00:04:49.349> bounce

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:50.219 
the side typically I would use a bounce

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.300 
the side typically I would use a bounce
card<00:04:50.550> or<00:04:50.759> something<00:04:50.969> on<00:04:51.629> the<00:04:51.810> side<00:04:52.159> in<00:04:53.159> fact

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
card or something on the side in fact

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.730 
card or something on the side in fact
let<00:04:53.580> me<00:04:53.610> show<00:04:53.699> you<00:04:53.849> what<00:04:53.969> that<00:04:53.999> looks<00:04:54.210> like<00:04:54.300> so

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
let me show you what that looks like so

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.339 
let me show you what that looks like so
just<00:04:55.740> a<00:04:55.860> simple<00:04:56.009> foam<00:04:56.460> core<00:04:57.169> sure<00:04:58.169> the

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
just a simple foam core sure the

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.110 
just a simple foam core sure the
difference<00:04:58.680> between<00:04:59.009> the<00:04:59.129> two<00:04:59.310> I'll<00:04:59.939> just

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
difference between the two I'll just

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.300 
difference between the two I'll just
hold<00:05:00.419> this<00:05:00.659> right<00:05:00.960> up<00:05:01.379> here<00:05:01.620> it<00:05:01.740> should<00:05:01.919> fill

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
hold this right up here it should fill

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.050 
hold this right up here it should fill
in<00:05:02.340> a<00:05:02.639> lot<00:05:02.849> of<00:05:02.879> the<00:05:03.120> dark<00:05:03.990> side<00:05:04.259> shadows

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
in a lot of the dark side shadows

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.559 
in a lot of the dark side shadows
same-same<00:05:06.060> your<00:05:06.180> shadows<00:05:06.449> previous<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:11.610> then

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
same-same your shadows previous and then

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.149 
same-same your shadows previous and then
you<00:05:12.629> can<00:05:12.750> see<00:05:12.900> what<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:13.050> huge<00:05:13.110> difference<00:05:13.469> just

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
you can see what a huge difference just

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:22.519 
you can see what a huge difference just
having<00:05:14.639> a<00:05:14.729> white<00:05:15.509> foam<00:05:15.779> core<00:05:15.949> can<00:05:16.949> make<00:05:21.499> so<00:05:22.499> I

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
having a white foam core can make so I

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:24.019 
having a white foam core can make so I
hope<00:05:22.770> this<00:05:22.919> will<00:05:23.099> give<00:05:23.279> you<00:05:23.400> a<00:05:23.430> good<00:05:23.639> idea<00:05:23.669> of

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:24.029 
hope this will give you a good idea of

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:25.820 
hope this will give you a good idea of
the<00:05:24.060> type<00:05:24.300> of<00:05:24.330> light<00:05:24.689> that<00:05:25.020> a<00:05:25.050> reflective

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
the type of light that a reflective

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.510 
the type of light that a reflective
umbrella<00:05:26.279> produces<00:05:27.139> as<00:05:28.139> it<00:05:28.589> changes<00:05:28.979> distance

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
umbrella produces as it changes distance
