00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.000
Yo, I'm Juicy, Giler Battle Crew from Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I came to Kuala Lumpur in 2000. I started dancing after watching some b-boy performed at KLCC. Dance calls for instinct. If you don't have the instinct deep within you, you won't be interested at all.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.069
I've been a b-boy for a long time. So I felt that I needed to join Red Bull BC One. It takes a while for Malaysians to gain the recognition we deserve in the b-boy scene since the dance itself originated from another country. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:51.069
With Red Bull BC One in Malaysia, I finally have the opportunity to expand overseas. Thank God, I won the Malaysian cypher last year and was able to go to Singapore.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I felt privileged to represent the nation at Singapore for the first time. Thankfully, I won this cypher again and managed to proceed to the next round. Although I didn't win the following stage in New Zealand, at least Malaysia finally has hit international standards in the eyes of the people.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.399
I have 15 siblings altogether and there are five b-boys among us. The first b-boy is Kujo, second Wes, and then there'e me, Juicy. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.399
Khenobu comes after me, and lastly, there's Fir. Whenever the five of us enter a competition together, everyone knows that we will dominate.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:45.399
As for Khenobu and I, our competition is really tight. We can't enter a battle representing different crews unless it's a one-on-one battle. That would be one heck of a fight!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Yo what up? I'm B-Boy Khenobu, Giler Battle Crew, The Last Hustler, Dem Lepak Boys. Peace.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Actually, it is my biggest dream to join Red Bull BC One after joining Battle of The Year Asia. Juicy really wants to beat me and claim the title as the best b-boy in Malaysia.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
People say that our first round against each other in a battle will practically be the finals.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
During our daily training, we still question ourselves if we can beat each other.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Yes, he was Malaysia's bets b-boy when he won last year's Red Bull BC One Cypher. But I wasn't there at the time. So, he hasn't really earned the title yet.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Everything I do comes from my heart.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:47.000
If we go head-to-head at the finals, it will be a fight among the best in Malaysia. I say this with total confidence. I know people want to see this because Malaysia has waited a long time to watch these two brothers battle.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
If I meet Khenobu in the battle, I hope he will be fully prepared.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We are both ready. I know his weaknesses, and he knows mine. Now, we're just waiting for the moment.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I will do whatever he does.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I really can't wait.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
This is the first time I'm here with Khenobu. There are a lot more people compared to last year's cypher. I'm so excited to be here.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The stage and the entire set up looks good. The crowd is awesome.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
All the b-boys in Malaysia have really stepped up their game this year. They finally understand the true meaning of battle and how important it is to save energy. I feel really confident about this.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I made it into the Top 16 and also won the following battles, same goes with Khenobu. 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
All the line-up for top 16 are considered some of tegh strongest in Malaysia. I felt that it will be a great battle.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And then, Khenobu and I had to battle each other in the Top 8.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It felt weird because I expected us to only face each other in the finals. But since we're both battling in the Top 8, I thought, "Alright, I'm ready!"

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
When I was battling against Khenobu, it felt like second nature.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I memorized all his steps. I could do everything he did from A to Z. I could even repeat his entire routine, and I did just that at the end. It was smooth and I'm sure it hit a chord among the judges. The song did it for me. You see, Juicy &amp; I are different. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
He battles with choreographed routines, but I prefer freestyle. So I'll just move with the music.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Both of us were really in the zone and we couldn't tell who won or lost. But suddenly, all three judges pointed at me. I was like, "Wow, I beat last year's BC One Champion. This is totally dope!"

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
He really deserves to go out and see the world.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000
When I met Pitt Den, I wasn't worried or scared. My confidence to beat him was at its peak. 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
But he looked like he didn't want to battle. If the other party doesn't want to battle, I'll just do my thing.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I was still very hyped up before the announcement of the results because three rounds weren't enough for me. I wanted five! I have so much more that I forgot to show. Wow, the one disclosing the results was B-Boy Roxrite, he is like the best in the world. 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:17.000
When he held up my hand to indicate my win, I felt like I just woke up from a dream. But everything was real. I was ecstatic about the outcome after training so hard. People don't understand how difficult it is to go out and represent Malaysia in foreign countries, like Japan. So I really appreciate this.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It's me, B-boy Juicy, giving you the spirit. Don't end up like your brother here when you're in Japan. Show them what you got! Don't hold back. You've got style and you have plenty of talent. So I want you to go all out.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I just want to prove that with all the intense training I've been through, I can make it to the semi-finals, or even the finals! And when I return to Malaysia, I will tell people, "Don't stop. Don't quit. Just keep doing what you're doing." Don't give up. And once you reach the top, don't just stay there. 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Share your talent and set the bar for others to beat so everyone can improve together. That's the b-boy family.
