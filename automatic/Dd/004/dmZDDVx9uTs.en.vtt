00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
super simple grow tent and a lot of

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.030 
super simple grow tent and a lot of
people<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.040> seen<00:00:32.430> those<00:00:33.320> metallic<00:00:34.320> little

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
people have seen those metallic little

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.299 
people have seen those metallic little
tents<00:00:35.780> usually<00:00:36.780> made<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.200> foil<00:00:37.590> tin<00:00:38.010> foil

tents usually made of like foil tin foil
some<00:00:38.850> type<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.379> very<00:00:40.379> thin<00:00:40.940> reflective

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
some type of very thin reflective

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.450 
some type of very thin reflective
material<00:00:42.539> that<00:00:43.079> they<00:00:43.260> will<00:00:43.440> drape<00:00:43.739> over<00:00:44.219> some

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
material that they will drape over some

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
material that they will drape over some
lights<00:00:44.699> to<00:00:45.359> increase<00:00:46.019> the<00:00:46.230> reflective

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
lights to increase the reflective

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.549 
lights to increase the reflective
properties<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.539> increase<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> power<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
properties and increase the power of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.840 
properties and increase the power of
their<00:00:49.710> lights<00:00:49.949> will<00:00:50.249> not<00:00:50.280> really<00:00:50.609> increase

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
their lights will not really increase

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.840 
their lights will not really increase
the<00:00:50.969> power<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.390> more<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:51.719> less<00:00:52.519> not<00:00:53.519> allowing

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the power but more or less not allowing

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
the power but more or less not allowing
you<00:00:53.909> like<00:00:54.089> to<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.300> wasted<00:00:54.749> and<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.499> basically

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
you like to be wasted and so basically

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.709 
you like to be wasted and so basically
what<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.190> behind<00:00:56.550> me<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.999> makeshift

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
what I have behind me is a makeshift

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.899 
what I have behind me is a makeshift
grow<00:00:58.079> tent<00:00:58.409> and<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.920> made<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> for<00:00:59.460> three

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
grow tent and I made it for three

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.910 
grow tent and I made it for three
dollars<00:01:00.510> yet<00:01:01.019> three<00:01:01.260> dollars<00:01:01.589> I'm<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
dollars yet three dollars I'm going to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.319 
dollars yet three dollars I'm going to
go<00:01:01.979> through<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.760> got<00:01:02.909> to<00:01:02.999> show<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> the

go through it got to show you the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.530 
go through it got to show you the
materials<00:01:04.129> actually<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.820> only<00:01:06.060> material

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
materials actually the only material

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660 
materials actually the only material
that<00:01:07.050> you'll<00:01:07.290> need<00:01:07.409> other<00:01:08.010> than<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> lights

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that you'll need other than the lights

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.660 
that you'll need other than the lights
now<00:01:09.330> we'll<00:01:09.570> post<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.930> link<00:01:09.960> down<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
now we'll post a link down here to the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.730 
now we'll post a link down here to the
lights<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:12.690> it<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.140> kind<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.409> crucial

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
lights up because it is kind of crucial

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.640 
lights up because it is kind of crucial
to<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.970> type<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.240> lights<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.810> otherwise

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
to have this type of lights up otherwise

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.020 
to have this type of lights up otherwise
you're<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.010> to<00:01:17.100> need<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.370> construct<00:01:17.730> some

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you're going to need to construct some

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.360 
you're going to need to construct some
form<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.330> frame<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:18.990> using<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.740> lights<00:01:20.100> up

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
form of frame but using this lights up

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.080 
form of frame but using this lights up
that<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.600> actually<00:01:21.990> enables<00:01:22.470> me<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
that I have it actually enables me to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.140 
that I have it actually enables me to
simply<00:01:24.090> hang<00:01:24.510> my<00:01:25.410> reflective<00:01:26.010> material<00:01:26.610> right

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
simply hang my reflective material right

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.840 
simply hang my reflective material right
on<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.480> lights<00:01:27.750> versus<00:01:28.650> build<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.190> frame<00:01:29.550> which

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
on the lights versus build a frame which

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.520 
on the lights versus build a frame which
is<00:01:29.880> also<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.660> run<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.350> bit

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
is also going to run you up a little bit

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.410 
is also going to run you up a little bit
more<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.370> still<00:01:32.550> you<00:01:32.880> should<00:01:33.060> probably<00:01:33.270> be

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
more but still you should probably be

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.490 
more but still you should probably be
able<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.690> it<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:33.930> maybe<00:01:34.020> two<00:01:34.350> or<00:01:34.380> three

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
able to do it for maybe two or three

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.260 
able to do it for maybe two or three
dollars<00:01:34.710> maybe<00:01:35.190> even<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.610> some<00:01:35.760> materials

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
dollars maybe even have some materials

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.780 
dollars maybe even have some materials
laying<00:01:36.480> around<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> house<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.490> this

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
laying around the house to do it so this

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.170 
laying around the house to do it so this
is<00:01:38.850> simply<00:01:39.390> how<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.020> make<00:01:40.440> a<00:01:40.650> very<00:01:41.400> simple<00:01:41.970> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
is simply how to make a very simple and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.840 
is simply how to make a very simple and
very<00:01:42.210> cheap<00:01:42.930> grow<00:01:43.500> tent<00:01:43.830> for<00:01:44.160> your<00:01:44.280> plants<00:01:44.700> as

will actually reflect the sunlight out

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.620 
will actually reflect the sunlight out
to<00:03:02.020> keep<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.320> heat<00:03:02.500> out<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.770> your<00:03:03.220> car<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:03.850> so

panels here which is what you see all

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.490 
panels here which is what you see all
these<00:03:43.900> these<00:03:44.440> folds<00:03:44.830> here<00:03:45.299> now<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.260> hard

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
these these folds here now the the hard

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.960 
these these folds here now the the hard
part<00:03:47.799> is<00:03:48.040> getting<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:49.060> panels<00:03:49.410> flat<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:51.190> chose

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
part is getting the panels flat I chose

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.960 
part is getting the panels flat I chose
to<00:03:52.150> just<00:03:52.390> use<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.840> weight<00:03:53.019> of<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.760> pot

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
to just use the weight of the of the pot

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.210 
to just use the weight of the of the pot
and<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.750> just<00:03:56.019> folded<00:03:56.410> them<00:03:56.590> up<00:03:56.709> put<00:03:57.040> them<00:03:57.070> on

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
and I just folded them up put them on

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.860 
and I just folded them up put them on
the<00:03:57.310> ground<00:03:57.549> and<00:03:57.850> obviously<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:58.540> reflects

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the ground and obviously that reflects

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.660 
the ground and obviously that reflects
some<00:03:58.989> light<00:03:59.260> back<00:03:59.470> up<00:03:59.530> as<00:03:59.890> well<00:04:00.130> so<00:04:00.430> it's<00:04:00.579> kind

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
some light back up as well so it's kind

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.910 
some light back up as well so it's kind
of<00:04:00.880> enclosed<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.930> also<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.350> have<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.530> fourth

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
of enclosed and also if I have a fourth

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.620 
of enclosed and also if I have a fourth
one<00:04:03.160> I'd<00:04:03.340> put<00:04:03.549> a<00:04:03.579> fourth<00:04:03.850> one<00:04:04.030> right<00:04:04.150> here<00:04:04.480> and

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
one I'd put a fourth one right here and

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.890 
one I'd put a fourth one right here and
hanging<00:04:05.380> on<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:05.709> one<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.280> this<00:04:06.970> one<00:04:07.030> facing

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
hanging on this one and this one facing

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.140 
hanging on this one and this one facing
in<00:04:08.110> so<00:04:08.350> it<00:04:08.410> would<00:04:08.500> be<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.620> complete<00:04:09.160> square<00:04:09.970> but

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
in so it would be a complete square but

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.640 
in so it would be a complete square but
I<00:04:10.180> don't<00:04:10.360> have<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.540> fourth<00:04:10.870> one<00:04:11.110> I'm<00:04:11.290> working<00:04:11.440> on

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
I don't have a fourth one I'm working on

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.039

second but I just wanted to show you
guys<00:05:15.789> that<00:05:16.440> that<00:05:17.440> this<00:05:17.590> can<00:05:17.800> definitely<00:05:17.949> be

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
guys that that this can definitely be

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.610 
guys that that this can definitely be
done<00:05:18.580> and<00:05:18.850> it<00:05:18.940> can<00:05:18.970> definitely<00:05:19.240> increase<00:05:19.870> the

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
done and it can definitely increase the

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.580 
done and it can definitely increase the
reflective<00:05:21.340> capabilities<00:05:21.880> of<00:05:22.000> your<00:05:22.030> light

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
reflective capabilities of your light

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.840 
reflective capabilities of your light
you<00:05:23.590> know<00:05:23.680> it<00:05:23.830> makes<00:05:23.979> these<00:05:24.130> things<00:05:24.520> so

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
you know it makes these things so

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.089 
you know it makes these things so
versatile<00:05:25.539> is<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:25.870> fact<00:05:26.110> that<00:05:26.320> not<00:05:26.470> only<00:05:26.650> are

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
versatile is the fact that not only are

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.250 
versatile is the fact that not only are
they<00:05:27.430> really<00:05:27.880> cheap<00:05:28.270> but<00:05:28.810> they're<00:05:28.960> very

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
they really cheap but they're very

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.040 
they really cheap but they're very
flexible<00:05:30.099> so<00:05:30.669> if<00:05:30.940> you<00:05:31.090> don't<00:05:31.960> necessarily

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
flexible so if you don't necessarily

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.900 
flexible so if you don't necessarily
need<00:05:32.620> such<00:05:32.860> a<00:05:32.889> big<00:05:33.160> one<00:05:33.310> or<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:33.610> want<00:05:33.789> to

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
need such a big one or you want to

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.450 
need such a big one or you want to
extend<00:05:34.360> them<00:05:34.630> or<00:05:34.840> lower<00:05:35.050> them<00:05:35.380> they're<00:05:35.949> very

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
extend them or lower them they're very

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.999 
extend them or lower them they're very
versatile<00:05:37.120> with<00:05:37.389> the<00:05:37.660> shape<00:05:38.229> they<00:05:38.500> can<00:05:38.650> form

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
versatile with the shape they can form

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.490 
versatile with the shape they can form
in<00:05:39.190> there<00:05:39.760> you<00:05:40.510> know<00:05:40.630> they<00:05:40.810> don't<00:05:40.960> rip<00:05:41.260> very

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
in there you know they don't rip very

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.409 
in there you know they don't rip very
easily<00:05:41.650> there<00:05:41.919> are<00:05:42.010> very<00:05:42.340> thick<00:05:42.820> material

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
easily there are very thick material

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.409 
easily there are very thick material
they're<00:05:43.870> very<00:05:44.260> well<00:05:44.500> made<00:05:44.530> and<00:05:45.099> so<00:05:45.910> not<00:05:46.240> only

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
they're very well made and so not only

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.260 
they're very well made and so not only
are<00:05:46.690> they<00:05:47.070> flexible<00:05:48.070> in<00:05:48.280> that<00:05:48.310> sense<00:05:48.760> but<00:05:49.060> they

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
are they flexible in that sense but they

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.300 
are they flexible in that sense but they
can<00:05:49.449> be<00:05:49.599> sewn<00:05:49.930> together<00:05:50.169> if<00:05:50.530> you<00:05:50.650> need<00:05:50.800> larger

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
can be sewn together if you need larger

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.210 
can be sewn together if you need larger
panels<00:05:51.760> so<00:05:52.690> they're<00:05:52.900> just<00:05:53.110> an<00:05:53.380> all-around

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
panels so they're just an all-around

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.180 
panels so they're just an all-around
amazing<00:05:55.180> material<00:05:55.720> to<00:05:55.840> use<00:05:56.020> for<00:05:56.050> these<00:05:56.590> for

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
amazing material to use for these for

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.219 
amazing material to use for these for
these<00:05:57.340> grow<00:05:57.580> tents<00:05:58.030> and<00:05:58.510> I<00:05:58.599> know<00:05:58.659> a<00:05:58.780> lot<00:05:59.050> of

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
these grow tents and I know a lot of

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.520 
these grow tents and I know a lot of
times<00:05:59.500> you<00:05:59.770> can<00:05:59.949> actually<00:06:00.400> also<00:06:00.610> get<00:06:01.530> larger

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
times you can actually also get larger

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.550 
times you can actually also get larger
rolls<00:06:02.800> of<00:06:03.010> these<00:06:03.190> for<00:06:04.289> insulation<00:06:05.289> they<00:06:05.440> have

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
rolls of these for insulation they have

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.980 
rolls of these for insulation they have
big<00:06:05.949> rolls<00:06:06.400> of<00:06:06.729> them<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.270> I'll<00:06:07.419> see<00:06:07.630> if<00:06:07.750> I<00:06:07.810> can

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
big rolls of them and I'll see if I can

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.930 
big rolls of them and I'll see if I can
find<00:06:08.139> the<00:06:08.320> link<00:06:08.620> if<00:06:08.800> I<00:06:09.250> can<00:06:09.400> find<00:06:09.639> a<00:06:09.760> link

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
find the link if I can find a link

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.460 
find the link if I can find a link
somewhere<00:06:10.150> on<00:06:10.449> Google<00:06:10.900> to<00:06:11.020> place<00:06:11.199> where<00:06:11.349> you

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
somewhere on Google to place where you

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.379 
somewhere on Google to place where you
can<00:06:11.620> buy<00:06:11.949> them<00:06:12.190> I<00:06:12.280> think<00:06:12.340> Lowe's<00:06:12.760> probably<00:06:13.240> has

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
can buy them I think Lowe's probably has

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.629 
can buy them I think Lowe's probably has
them<00:06:13.659> or<00:06:13.870> Home<00:06:14.050> Depot<00:06:14.460> some<00:06:15.460> do-it-yourself

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
them or Home Depot some do-it-yourself

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.360 
them or Home Depot some do-it-yourself
store<00:06:16.620> probably<00:06:17.620> of<00:06:17.800> your<00:06:17.889> local<00:06:18.070> hardware

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
store probably of your local hardware

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.939 
store probably of your local hardware
store<00:06:18.610> might<00:06:18.729> even<00:06:18.909> have<00:06:19.090> them<00:06:19.500> there<00:06:20.500> big

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
store might even have them there big

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.129 
store might even have them there big
rolls<00:06:21.370> of<00:06:21.610> these<00:06:22.240> it's<00:06:22.449> almost<00:06:22.630> like<00:06:22.780> bubble

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
rolls of these it's almost like bubble

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:25.110 
rolls of these it's almost like bubble
wrap<00:06:23.169> actually<00:06:24.039> if<00:06:24.190> I<00:06:24.400> think<00:06:24.430> it<00:06:24.729> is<00:06:24.820> bubble

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
wrap actually if I think it is bubble

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.089 
wrap actually if I think it is bubble
wrap<00:06:25.270> to<00:06:25.419> be<00:06:25.510> honest<00:06:25.840> because<00:06:26.169> it's<00:06:26.349> it

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
wrap to be honest because it's it

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:29.339 
wrap to be honest because it's it
creates<00:06:27.430> a<00:06:27.550> air<00:06:28.120> gap<00:06:28.449> in<00:06:28.900> between<00:06:29.020> here<00:06:29.320> and

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
creates a air gap in between here and

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:31.170 
creates a air gap in between here and
air<00:06:29.560> is<00:06:29.680> a<00:06:29.710> good<00:06:29.889> insulator<00:06:30.190> so<00:06:30.699> they<00:06:30.849> have<00:06:31.030> the

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
air is a good insulator so they have the

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.839 
air is a good insulator so they have the
reflective<00:06:32.070> capabilities<00:06:33.070> of<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.340> foil<00:06:33.639> and

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
reflective capabilities of the foil and

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.550 
reflective capabilities of the foil and
then<00:06:34.060> also<00:06:34.479> they<00:06:34.599> have<00:06:34.780> bubble<00:06:35.139> wrap<00:06:35.289> in

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
then also they have bubble wrap in

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.779 
then also they have bubble wrap in
between<00:06:36.220> here<00:06:36.430> so<00:06:36.460> um<00:06:37.000> I<00:06:37.690> think<00:06:38.169> that<00:06:38.800> that

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
between here so um I think that that

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.490 
between here so um I think that that
that's<00:06:39.909> what<00:06:40.030> that<00:06:40.120> material<00:06:40.330> is<00:06:40.720> and<00:06:40.960> if<00:06:41.289> so

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
that's what that material is and if so

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.050 
that's what that material is and if so
I'll<00:06:41.770> post<00:06:42.039> a<00:06:42.130> link<00:06:42.159> down<00:06:42.460> there<00:06:42.699> so<00:06:42.880> you<00:06:42.970> guys

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
I'll post a link down there so you guys

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.370 
I'll post a link down there so you guys
can<00:06:43.270> see<00:06:43.360> what<00:06:43.449> I'm<00:06:43.570> talking<00:06:43.990> about

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
can see what I'm talking about

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.730 
can see what I'm talking about
and<00:06:44.469> um<00:06:45.219> that<00:06:45.880> would<00:06:46.000> be<00:06:46.150> for

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
and um that would be for

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.680 
and um that would be for
large<00:06:46.919> applications<00:06:47.669> I<00:06:47.849> only<00:06:48.000> need<00:06:48.180> this<00:06:48.330> for

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
large applications I only need this for

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.120 
large applications I only need this for
you<00:06:49.110> know<00:06:49.229> a<00:06:49.259> couple<00:06:49.470> plants<00:06:49.889> and<00:06:49.979> I'll<00:06:50.039> be

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
you know a couple plants and I'll be

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.740 
you know a couple plants and I'll be
getting<00:06:50.340> some<00:06:50.370> more<00:06:50.550> as<00:06:50.849> well<00:06:51.060> and<00:06:51.360> you<00:06:51.720> can

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
getting some more as well and you can

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.480 
getting some more as well and you can
get<00:06:52.020> these<00:06:52.139> in<00:06:52.199> the<00:06:52.440> small<00:06:52.770> size<00:06:53.039> and<00:06:53.250> the

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
get these in the small size and the

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.700 
get these in the small size and the
jumbo<00:06:53.789> size<00:06:54.000> these<00:06:54.509> are<00:06:54.569> the<00:06:54.780> jumbo<00:06:55.080> size<00:06:55.289> here

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
jumbo size these are the jumbo size here

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.870 
jumbo size these are the jumbo size here
and<00:06:57.169> so<00:06:58.169> now<00:06:58.289> comes<00:06:58.889> the<00:06:58.979> fun<00:06:59.220> part<00:06:59.370> I'm<00:06:59.639> going

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:02.849 
to harvest the bounties of micro roam

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:09.339 
to harvest the bounties of micro roam
and<00:07:03.770> I<00:07:04.770> have<00:07:05.550> three<00:07:06.360> beautiful<00:07:06.720> lines<00:07:07.259> here

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:09.349 
and I have three beautiful lines here

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:14.300 
and I have three beautiful lines here
there's<00:07:10.349> one<00:07:11.150> full-size<00:07:12.150> lemon<00:07:13.069> and<00:07:14.069> I<00:07:14.130> never

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
there's one full-size lemon and I never

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.290 
there's one full-size lemon and I never
thought<00:07:14.550> I'd<00:07:14.699> see<00:07:14.849> the<00:07:14.970> day<00:07:15.000> these<00:07:15.240> things

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
thought I'd see the day these things

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.320 
thought I'd see the day these things
took<00:07:15.810> literally<00:07:16.530> hundreds<00:07:17.520> of<00:07:17.759> days<00:07:18.000> this

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
took literally hundreds of days this

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.909 
took literally hundreds of days this
probably<00:07:18.930> took<00:07:19.080> at<00:07:19.229> least<00:07:19.380> a<00:07:19.500> hundred<00:07:19.620> days

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 
probably took at least a hundred days

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.860 
probably took at least a hundred days
for<00:07:20.130> this<00:07:20.190> to<00:07:20.250> ripen<00:07:20.490> because<00:07:21.150> we<00:07:21.449> don't<00:07:21.630> have

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
for this to ripen because we don't have

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.110 
for this to ripen because we don't have
hot<00:07:22.530> weather<00:07:22.800> oh<00:07:23.099> and<00:07:23.669> there's<00:07:24.060> another

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
hot weather oh and there's another

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.219 
hot weather oh and there's another

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
and the third lemon right there three

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.120 
and the third lemon right there three
lemons<00:07:35.300> from<00:07:36.300> my<00:07:36.509> indoor<00:07:36.870> grow<00:07:37.139> tent<00:07:37.530> so<00:07:38.099> I

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.130 
lemons from my indoor grow tent so I

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.469 
lemons from my indoor grow tent so I
hope<00:07:38.430> you<00:07:38.550> guys<00:07:38.699> enjoyed<00:07:39.120> this<00:07:39.300> episode
