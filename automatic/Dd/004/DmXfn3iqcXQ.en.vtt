00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
of an overdrive in this experiment we're

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.319 
of an overdrive in this experiment we're
going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.849> answer<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.510> age-old<00:00:31.050> question<00:00:32.329> and

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
going to answer the age-old question and

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.350 
going to answer the age-old question and
installing<00:00:33.750> an<00:00:33.930> overdrive<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.590> your<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
do in this experiment is me in general

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.639 
do in this experiment is me in general
or<00:00:42.809> park<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> street<00:00:44.030> Ramsey<00:00:45.030> Illinois<00:00:45.649> and

or park on a street Ramsey Illinois and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.459 
or park on a street Ramsey Illinois and
as<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.950> girls<00:00:47.280> come<00:00:47.550> by<00:00:47.840> I'm<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> hit<00:00:49.350> on

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
as the girls come by I'm going to hit on

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.290 
as the girls come by I'm going to hit on
the<00:00:49.649> first<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:50.480> in<00:00:51.480> direct<00:00:52.050> drive<00:00:52.969> and<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.210> if

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the first one in direct drive and see if

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
the first one in direct drive and see if
it<00:00:54.390> makes<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.690> difference<00:00:55.079> not<00:00:55.289> obviously<00:00:55.890> for

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
it makes a difference not obviously for

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.580 
it makes a difference not obviously for
this<00:00:56.250> experiment<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.149> cannot<00:00:57.960> remove<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
this experiment I cannot remove the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.380 
this experiment I cannot remove the
overdrive<00:00:59.070> from<00:00:59.280> generalities<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.300> I'm

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
overdrive from generalities so what I'm

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.670 
overdrive from generalities so what I'm
going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.809> I'm<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> put<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> Jeep

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
going to do is I'm going to put the Jeep

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.410 
going to do is I'm going to put the Jeep
in<00:01:02.390> direct<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.379> cover<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.890> shifter<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.729> that

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
in direct and cover the shifter so that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.350 
in direct and cover the shifter so that
the<00:01:06.540> young<00:01:06.750> lady<00:01:07.080> cannot<00:01:07.590> see<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.150> Jeep

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the young lady cannot see that the Jeep

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.020 
the young lady cannot see that the Jeep
has<00:01:09.540> an<00:01:09.720> overdrive<00:01:10.400> let's<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.729> makes<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
has an overdrive let's see if it makes a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.460 
has an overdrive let's see if it makes a
difference

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.969 

hey<00:01:18.470> baby<00:01:19.960> how<00:01:20.960> would<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.320> like<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.710> take<00:01:21.950> a

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
ride in my Jeep this Jeep don't need an

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:38.859 
ride in my Jeep this Jeep don't need an
overdrive<00:01:30.020> I've<00:01:30.440> got<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:30.979> video<00:01:31.430> rocket<00:01:37.869> what

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
overdrive I've got a video rocket what

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.270 
overdrive I've got a video rocket what
are<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.020> laughing<00:01:39.350> at<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:40.040> aint<00:01:40.220> funny<00:01:40.430> I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
are you laughing at that aint funny I

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:54.880 
are you laughing at that aint funny I
did<00:01:43.280> not<00:01:43.549> go<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.090> way<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:47.289> next<00:01:48.289> time

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.219 

and<00:01:55.890> see<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.700> improves<00:01:57.180> my<00:01:57.390> chances<00:01:58.020> of

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and see if this improves my chances of

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.789 
and see if this improves my chances of
picking<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.130> young<00:01:59.549> late<00:02:00.649> here<00:02:01.649> comes

picking up a young late here comes

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:19.490 
picking up a young late here comes
another<00:02:16.550> not<00:02:17.550> only<00:02:18.120> does<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.540> Jeep<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:19.200> an

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
another not only does this Jeep have an

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.259 
another not only does this Jeep have an
overdrive<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:21.030> Jeep<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.599> in<00:02:21.810> overdrive<00:02:26.269> you

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
overdrive this Jeep is in overdrive you

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.280 
overdrive this Jeep is in overdrive you
see<00:02:28.280> some<00:02:29.280> people<00:02:29.670> would<00:02:29.849> argue<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
see some people would argue that the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.160 
see some people would argue that the
it's<00:02:31.500> actually<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> overdrive<00:02:32.870> gives<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
it's actually the overdrive gives the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.009 
it's actually the overdrive gives the
male<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.769> selfish<00:02:35.489> higher<00:02:35.790> self-esteem<00:02:36.299> and

male a selfish higher self-esteem and

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.930 
male a selfish higher self-esteem and
it's<00:02:37.349> actually<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:38.040> which<00:02:38.459> attracts<00:02:38.849> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
it's actually that which attracts the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.020 
it's actually that which attracts the
lane<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:39.569> in<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.900> experiment<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.700> same

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
lane but in this experiment the same
