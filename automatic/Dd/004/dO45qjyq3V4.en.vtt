 you have to have little storage 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.320
 internal and you want to install those 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.660
 applications that come by default as 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.369
 some games on 1 or vice and uncle not 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.250

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.250
 my video that I made a long time ago and go 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.079
 to also need a browser 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.329
 files if you wish so or a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.430
 good application for this we are going to 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.070
 Remove any file explorer 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.750
 that allows us to root this part without 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 application first is the part without 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 application let's go to the folder of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.949
 cell root after we go to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.020
 go to the system folder once 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.460
 being here we are going to give you in app and here 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.750
 we come all the applications that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.690
 they come by default as it comes 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.430
 calculator calendar and all that in my 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.190
 case I do not have many because I've 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.110
 uninstalled several as the TV 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.670
 google search all these parts what 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.410
 only the jr file browser does not 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.840
 it works because with anybody we can 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.290
 get to put the root folder we 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.100
 let's go to what they exist 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.600

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.240
 applications that come by default to 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.670
 our cell phone and I forgot how the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.100
 installed since obviously it is obvious 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.310
 only the selections and eliminates 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.430
 only select delete 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.100
 and we press that if you ask me here 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.930
 user permission as we're going to finish 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.570
 we say yes and this is all good 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.970
 now we go with what he unite the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.130
 brou that this is the prom version can 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.200
 download the free version on the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.780
 google place thor but how much you 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.179
 lets you download 3 and uninstall three 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.070
 applications and the pro version so no 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.960

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.850
 it does not work 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.290
 to see that it is an application that 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.479
 brings the system and does not allow it 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.430

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.040
 forgetting 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.780
 you have to patch the application come on and 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.519
 we unloaded the place to be the same as 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.709

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.099
 the version for today is not running 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.769
 you still just have to select the 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.450
 application open less than patches 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.920
 remove license check modes 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.129
 automatic and here we are going to select 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.159
 only two other other patches and 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.409
