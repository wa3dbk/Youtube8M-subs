00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
to worry about pre-recording seven

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.440

thought that if I just uploaded once a

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.950 
thought that if I just uploaded once a
week<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.880> would<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.150> fine<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.780> guys
