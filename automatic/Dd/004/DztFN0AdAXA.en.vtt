00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.740 

all<00:02:43.819> right<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.090> know<00:02:44.120> what<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.390> did<00:02:44.569> wrong

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
all right you know what you did wrong

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.860 
all right you know what you did wrong
that<00:02:44.959> time<00:02:45.610> well<00:02:46.610> what<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.120> did<00:02:47.330> is<00:02:47.510> when<00:02:47.750> you

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
that time well what you did is when you

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.530 
that time well what you did is when you
swung<00:02:48.459> you<00:02:49.459> turn<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:50.090> foot<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:53.090> squash<00:02:53.330> the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
swung you turn this foot the squash the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.390 
swung you turn this foot the squash the
bug<00:02:53.660> wasn't<00:02:54.080> too<00:02:54.200> bad<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.770> lifted<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
bug wasn't too bad but you lifted the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.850 
bug wasn't too bad but you lifted the
toe<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.269> guess<00:02:56.690> where<00:02:56.870> all<00:02:57.080> your<00:02:57.350> weight<00:02:57.560> went

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
toe and guess where all your weight went

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.300 
toe and guess where all your weight went
on<00:02:58.130> your<00:02:59.090> front<00:02:59.330> leg<00:02:59.630> right<00:02:59.989> so<00:03:00.650> what<00:03:00.830> we<00:03:01.040> want

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
on your front leg right so what we want

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.850 
on your front leg right so what we want
to<00:03:01.400> do<00:03:01.580> is<00:03:01.790> when<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.090> squash<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.780> bug<00:03:02.989> you

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
to do is when you squash the bug you

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.800 
to do is when you squash the bug you
want<00:03:04.100> to<00:03:04.220> be<00:03:04.340> able<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.820> be<00:03:04.970> in<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.150> position<00:03:05.330> that

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
want to be able to be in a position that

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.900 
want to be able to be in a position that
like<00:03:06.050> this<00:03:06.320> where<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.830> weight<00:03:07.070> is<00:03:07.310> still<00:03:07.550> on

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
like this where the weight is still on

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.390 
like this where the weight is still on
the<00:03:08.060> ball<00:03:08.239> of<00:03:08.420> your<00:03:08.569> foot<00:03:08.900> not<00:03:09.709> on<00:03:09.920> your<00:03:10.069> toe

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
the ball of your foot not on your toe

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.509 
the ball of your foot not on your toe
and<00:03:11.170> we<00:03:12.170> don't<00:03:12.350> want<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.800> because<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.340> not

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
and we don't want that because that not

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.729 
and we don't want that because that not
only<00:03:13.640> raises<00:03:14.120> your<00:03:14.269> eye<00:03:14.300> level<00:03:14.690> but<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.590> also

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
only raises your eye level but it also

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.350 
only raises your eye level but it also
puts<00:03:15.980> all<00:03:16.250> your<00:03:16.459> weight<00:03:16.640> on<00:03:16.760> your<00:03:16.790> front<00:03:17.180> leg

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
puts all your weight on your front leg

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.020 
puts all your weight on your front leg
so<00:03:18.019> when<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:18.380> squash<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:19.010> bug<00:03:19.190> it's<00:03:19.610> better

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
so when you squash the bug it's better

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.120 
so when you squash the bug it's better
to<00:03:20.269> have<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.690> weight<00:03:20.930> on<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.470> still<00:03:21.860> on<00:03:22.010> the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
to have the weight on the still on the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.340 
to have the weight on the still on the
ball<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.489> your<00:03:22.640> foot<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.569> what<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:23.900> does<00:03:24.080> is

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
ball of your foot and what that does is

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.740 
ball of your foot and what that does is
that<00:03:24.380> doesn't<00:03:24.830> raise<00:03:25.040> your<00:03:25.310> eye<00:03:25.340> level<00:03:25.730> up<00:03:26.060> it

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
that doesn't raise your eye level up it

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.330 
that doesn't raise your eye level up it
also<00:03:26.959> puts<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.500> majority<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.190> weight

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
also puts the majority of the weight

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.430 
also puts the majority of the weight
still<00:03:28.730> back<00:03:28.940> on<00:03:28.970> this<00:03:29.420> back<00:03:29.630> leg<00:03:29.930> here<00:03:30.230> and

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
still back on this back leg here and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.840 
still back on this back leg here and
that<00:03:30.860> you're<00:03:31.040> going<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.190> swing<00:03:31.519> a<00:03:31.640> more

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
powerful swing okay so let's try it okay

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.610 
powerful swing okay so let's try it okay
the<00:03:36.110> proper<00:03:36.560> way<00:03:36.790> all<00:03:37.790> right

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:50.600 

nice<00:03:41.220> much<00:03:42.120> better
