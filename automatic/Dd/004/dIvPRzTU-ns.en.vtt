00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
sharp and all that stuff so to me this

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.890 
sharp and all that stuff so to me this
is<00:02:24.260> just<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.890> easy<00:02:25.280> now<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.030> lot<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.630> people

is just so easy now a lot of people

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.979 
is just so easy now a lot of people
probably<00:02:27.140> don't<00:02:27.590> think<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:28.099> this<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:29.690> you

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
probably don't think that this it you

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.170 
probably don't think that this it you
get<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.230> close-up<00:02:30.620> shave<00:02:31.190> with<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.910> cordless

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
get a close-up shave with the cordless

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.420 
get a close-up shave with the cordless
razor<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:33.140> find<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.709> be<00:02:33.739> true<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.400> a

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
razor and I find that to be true to a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.460 
razor and I find that to be true to a
certain<00:02:34.489> extent<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.569> also<00:02:35.840> think<00:02:36.349> it

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
certain extent and I also think it

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.070 
certain extent and I also think it
depends<00:02:36.830> on<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.580> razor<00:02:37.790> itself<00:02:38.510> that's<00:02:38.900> why<00:02:39.049> I

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
depends on the razor itself that's why I

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.100 
depends on the razor itself that's why I
said<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:39.590> one<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.610> much<00:02:41.180> better<00:02:41.450> than<00:02:41.810> the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
said this one is much better than the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.830 
said this one is much better than the
first<00:02:42.200> one<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:42.920> originally<00:02:43.250> had<00:02:43.819> so<00:02:44.540> I

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
first one that I originally had so I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.559 
first one that I originally had so I
really<00:02:45.200> like<00:02:45.380> this<00:02:45.590> one<00:02:45.829> a<00:02:46.069> lot<00:02:46.340> now<00:02:46.849> what<00:02:47.540> I

leg hair or anything on it let's take
the<00:03:16.130> cap<00:03:16.340> off<00:03:16.579> um<00:03:17.380> basically<00:03:18.380> this<00:03:19.069> right<00:03:19.370> here

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
the cap off um basically this right here

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.319 
the cap off um basically this right here
it<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.299> can<00:03:20.480> move<00:03:21.109> it<00:03:21.260> up<00:03:21.350> like<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:22.239> but<00:03:23.239> if

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
it you can move it up like that but if

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.729 
it you can move it up like that but if
you<00:03:23.450> just<00:03:23.569> leave<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.989> down<00:03:24.019> in<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.500> position

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
you just leave it down in this position

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.170 
you just leave it down in this position
I<00:03:25.100> think<00:03:25.160> when<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.519> move<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.790> up<00:03:25.940> like<00:03:26.150> that

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
I think when you move it up like that

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.660 
I think when you move it up like that
it's<00:03:26.569> like<00:03:26.870> bikini<00:03:27.200> area<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:27.980> underarms<00:03:28.430> or

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
it's like bikini area and underarms or

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.250 
it's like bikini area and underarms or
something<00:03:29.090> but<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.540> would<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:29.780> leave<00:03:30.109> it<00:03:30.139> like

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
something but I would just leave it like

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.520 
something but I would just leave it like
this<00:03:30.380> but<00:03:31.220> this<00:03:31.370> extra<00:03:32.030> little<00:03:32.180> bit<00:03:32.600> here<00:03:33.170> will

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
this but this extra little bit here will

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.250 
this but this extra little bit here will
pick<00:03:33.859> up<00:03:34.130> those<00:03:34.639> baby<00:03:34.970> fine<00:03:35.239> hairs<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.810> always
