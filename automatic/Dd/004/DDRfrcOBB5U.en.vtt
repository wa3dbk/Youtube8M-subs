Stephen<00:00:08.790> was<00:00:08.880> helping<00:00:09.269> me<00:00:09.360> set<00:00:09.570> up<00:00:09.599> this

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
Stephen was helping me set up this

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.959 
Stephen was helping me set up this
camera<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.410> focusing<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.309> me<00:00:11.370> so<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:11.940> I

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
camera and focusing in on me so that I

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.640 
camera and focusing in on me so that I
could<00:00:12.059> make<00:00:12.300> videos<00:00:12.599> whenever<00:00:12.809> he's<00:00:13.110> not<00:00:13.290> here

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
could make videos whenever he's not here

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.770 
could make videos whenever he's not here
and<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:14.309> just<00:00:14.580> SAT<00:00:14.790> here<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.210> said<00:00:15.269> aren't

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
and I just SAT here and said aren't

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.400 
and I just SAT here and said aren't
digital<00:00:16.680> cameras<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.520> mind-blowing<00:00:18.510> just

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
digital cameras just mind-blowing just

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.320 
digital cameras just mind-blowing just
sitting<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.189> coming<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
sitting here and coming to the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.050 
sitting here and coming to the
realization<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:22.410> he's<00:00:22.949> focusing<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.850> me

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
realization that he's focusing on me

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.660 
realization that he's focusing on me
while<00:00:24.570> watching<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.080> live<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.859> screen<00:00:26.250> it

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
while watching it live on the screen it

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.179 
while watching it live on the screen it
just<00:00:27.180> blows<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.840> mind<00:00:27.900> could<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> imagine

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
just blows your mind could you imagine

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.279 
just blows your mind could you imagine
what<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> forefathers<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.539> photography

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
what the forefathers of photography

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.889 
what the forefathers of photography
would<00:00:31.439> think<00:00:31.740> today<00:00:32.219> if<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:33.360> they<00:00:33.510> were<00:00:33.570> here

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
would think today if if they were here

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.900 
would think today if if they were here
today<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:35.010> happening<00:00:35.489> just

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
today to see what is happening just

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.720 
today to see what is happening just
think<00:00:36.210> about<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.260> lens<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.920> gathering

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
think about it the lens is gathering

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.610 
think about it the lens is gathering
light<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:40.260> focusing<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.620> CCD

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
light and it's focusing it on to a a CCD

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.920 
light and it's focusing it on to a a CCD
or<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> CMOS<00:00:44.730> sensor<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.149> focusing<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
or a CMOS sensor it's focusing it on to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.319 
or a CMOS sensor it's focusing it on to
a<00:00:45.960> sensor<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.680> sensor<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.670> converting<00:00:48.210> that

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
a sensor that sensor is converting that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.660 
a sensor that sensor is converting that
light<00:00:48.629> into<00:00:48.989> ones<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.410> freaking<00:00:49.890> zeros<00:00:50.399> and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
light into ones and freaking zeros and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.490 
light into ones and freaking zeros and
then<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> computer's<00:00:51.660> processing<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.469> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
then the computer's processing it and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.290 
then the computer's processing it and
then<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.100> putting<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.489> onto<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.760> screen<00:00:54.030> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
then it's putting it onto a screen so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.720 
then it's putting it onto a screen so
that<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.840> see<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:56.129> take<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.550> for

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that you can see it we take it for

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.209 
that you can see it we take it for
granted<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.719> stop<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.559> about<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.980> for

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
granted to stop and think about that for

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.240 
granted to stop and think about that for
a<00:00:59.280> minute<00:00:59.489> how<00:00:59.910> amazing<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:01.109> technology<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
a minute how amazing is technology and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.460 
a minute how amazing is technology and
how<00:01:02.340> amazing<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:03.000> these<00:01:03.030> digital<00:01:03.660> cameras<00:01:04.260> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
how amazing are these digital cameras I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.500 
how amazing are these digital cameras I
think<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.700> many<00:01:05.790> people<00:01:06.119> shooting

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
think with so many people shooting

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810 
think with so many people shooting
photos<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:06.990> their<00:01:07.140> phones<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.830> cell<00:01:08.130> cell

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
photos with their phones and cell cell

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.760 
photos with their phones and cell cell
phones<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.479> everything<00:01:10.170> else<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.650> don't

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
phones and and everything else we don't

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.560 
phones and and everything else we don't
stop<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.369> think<00:01:11.400> about<00:01:11.670> what<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.270> actually

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
stop to think about what is actually

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.020 
stop to think about what is actually
going<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.260> under<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> hood<00:01:13.950> now<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> want<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
going on under the hood now I want to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.399 
going on under the hood now I want to
take<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> deeper<00:01:15.600> look<00:01:15.630> at<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.049> into<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
take a deeper look at that into the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.200 
take a deeper look at that into the
future<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.890> maybe<00:01:17.189> come<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:18.090> some

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
future and maybe come up with some

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.590 
future and maybe come up with some
science<00:01:18.689> type<00:01:19.020> shows<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:20.040> holy<00:01:20.310> jesus<00:01:20.970> isn't

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
science type shows but holy jesus isn't

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.749 
science type shows but holy jesus isn't
it<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.170> mind-blowing<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.460> sit<00:01:23.729> here

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
it just mind-blowing that I can sit here

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.380 
it just mind-blowing that I can sit here
right<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:25.530> image<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.670> flipped<00:01:27.150> on

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
right now have my image get flipped on

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.230 
right now have my image get flipped on
to<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> CMOS<00:01:28.200> sensor<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.430> ones<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.909> zeroes

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to a CMOS sensor the ones and zeroes

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.870 
to a CMOS sensor the ones and zeroes
processed<00:01:30.840> converted<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.310> turned<00:01:32.579> into

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
processed converted and then turned into

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.300 
processed converted and then turned into
a<00:01:32.909> signal<00:01:33.420> screen<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.320> video<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> back<00:01:35.280> of

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
a signal screen a video on the back of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.270 
a signal screen a video on the back of
this<00:01:35.549> camera<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.390> know<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.680> excited<00:01:37.979> for

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
this camera I know I get excited for

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
this camera I know I get excited for
little<00:01:38.549> things<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.960> just

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
little things like that but I just just

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.109 
little things like that but I just just
think<00:01:40.740> about<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.250> slow<00:01:41.579> down<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
think about it just slow down for a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.080 
think about it just slow down for a
second<00:01:42.570> think<00:01:43.110> about<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
second think about what that is in the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.609 
second think about what that is in the
technology<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.990> around<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
technology that is around you and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.399 
technology that is around you and
appreciate<00:01:47.369> how<00:01:47.579> far<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.149> come<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.869> don't

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
appreciate how far we have come I don't

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.139 
appreciate how far we have come I don't
know<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.680> type<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.890> video<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.640> it's

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
know what type of video this is it's

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.850 
know what type of video this is it's
just<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.780> those<00:01:51.930> quick<00:01:52.380> ones<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.829> I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
just one of those quick ones that I
