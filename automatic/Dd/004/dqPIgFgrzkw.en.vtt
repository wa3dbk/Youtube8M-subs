 device that I have of that brand 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:44.310
 and for those who want an appliance with 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:47.029
 a screen is reasonable but wants to escape 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.550
 of those canvas baselines 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:53.039
 7-inch mechanical I recommend a 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.969
 device is the same here as the 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:59.099
 3 inches is a very good size is the 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:00.719
 over one of the devices that only have one 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:03.840
 3 inch screen 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:06.080
 This is a hug to everyone and even the 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.080
