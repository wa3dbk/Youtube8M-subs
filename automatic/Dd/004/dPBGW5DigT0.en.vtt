about<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:35.440> about<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:36.010> questing<00:01:36.460> was<00:01:37.090> that<00:01:37.300> it

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
about it about the questing was that it

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.850 
about it about the questing was that it
could<00:01:37.540> have<00:01:37.630> been<00:01:37.720> a<00:01:37.780> bit<00:01:38.110> slow<00:01:38.350> and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
could have been a bit slow and

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.070 
could have been a bit slow and
repetitive<00:01:39.340> or<00:01:39.460> for<00:01:39.640> time<00:01:39.820> since<00:01:40.720> he<00:01:40.840> just

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
repetitive or for time since he just

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.620 
repetitive or for time since he just
basically<00:01:41.320> could<00:01:41.950> kill<00:01:42.640> monsters<00:01:42.909> over<00:01:43.540> and

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
basically could kill monsters over and

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.480 
basically could kill monsters over and
over<00:01:43.690> again<00:01:43.930> so<00:01:44.320> that<00:01:44.560> was<00:01:45.010> a<00:01:45.070> bit<00:01:45.250> repetitive

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
over again so that was a bit repetitive

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.670 
over again so that was a bit repetitive
but<00:01:46.030> some<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.720> really<00:01:46.930> good<00:01:47.110> quest<00:01:47.410> I

and<00:02:45.910> get<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.329> plan<00:02:46.660> out<00:02:46.810> everything<00:02:47.079> so<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.739> like

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
and get to plan out everything so I like

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.069 
and get to plan out everything so I like
the<00:02:48.400> fact<00:02:48.549> that<00:02:48.700> they<00:02:49.060> had<00:02:49.269> actual<00:02:49.450> rate<00:02:49.810> art

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
the fact that they had actual rate art

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.300 
the fact that they had actual rate art
not<00:02:50.350> rebus<00:02:50.709> is<00:02:50.920> actual

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
not rebus is actual

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.830 
not rebus is actual
ah<00:02:55.130> rares<00:02:56.130> but<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.910> could<00:02:57.090> kill<00:02:57.270> under<00:02:57.599> open

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
ah rares but you could kill under open

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.520 
ah rares but you could kill under open
if<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.680> had<00:02:59.489> enough<00:02:59.840> skills<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:01.170> do<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.290> I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
if you had enough skills to do it I

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.850 
if you had enough skills to do it I
guess<00:03:01.709> or<00:03:01.980> Clips<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:03.300> um<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:04.290> was<00:03:04.440> really<00:03:04.470> nice

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
guess or Clips so um it was really nice

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.670 
guess or Clips so um it was really nice
and<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.459> thought<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.030> having<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.750> rares<00:03:06.959> no

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
and I thought that having the rares no

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.009 
and I thought that having the rares no
thing<00:03:08.220> back<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.790> actually<00:03:09.030> being<00:03:09.390> able<00:03:09.540> to

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
thing back and actually being able to

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.259 
thing back and actually being able to
solo<00:03:10.200> them<00:03:10.470> like<00:03:10.650> I'm<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.519> poor<00:03:11.760> innocent<00:03:11.970> a

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
solo them like I'm a poor innocent a

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.850 
solo them like I'm a poor innocent a
surah<00:03:12.569> I<00:03:12.930> thought<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.349> was<00:03:13.470> really<00:03:13.680> awesome

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
surah I thought that was really awesome

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.190 
surah I thought that was really awesome
and<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.400> did<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.670> drop<00:03:14.880> pretty<00:03:15.150> cool<00:03:15.900> items

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
and it did you drop pretty cool items

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.070 
and it did you drop pretty cool items
that<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:16.950> get<00:03:17.550> more<00:03:17.760> upgrades<00:03:18.480> for<00:03:18.930> your

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
that I get more upgrades for your

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.720 
that I get more upgrades for your
character<00:03:19.349> so<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.860> was<00:03:20.160> really<00:03:20.190> nice<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.519> it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
character so that was really nice and it

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.610 
character so that was really nice and it
to<00:03:20.849> give<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.030> lot<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.330> experience<00:03:21.840> probably

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
to give a lot of experience probably

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.229 
to give a lot of experience probably
more<00:03:22.800> than<00:03:22.860> questing<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.120> was<00:03:24.209> really

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
more than questing so that was really

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.130 
more than questing so that was really
awesome<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:26.150> just<00:03:27.150> thought<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:27.540> was<00:03:27.660> an

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
awesome and I just thought it was an

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.520 
awesome and I just thought it was an
amazing<00:03:28.440> experience<00:03:29.330> I<00:03:30.330> think<00:03:30.989> what<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.290> did

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
amazing experience I think what it did

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.309 
amazing experience I think what it did
it<00:03:31.620> really<00:03:31.650> did<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.069> while<00:03:32.280> job<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.030> this<00:03:33.319> and

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
it really did a while job and this and

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.690
