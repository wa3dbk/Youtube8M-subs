00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
and now we have the cube I'll link a

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.450 
and now we have the cube I'll link a
video<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.550> how<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.730> how<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.030> find<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.389> cube<00:00:13.460> but

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
video on how to how to find the cube but

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.010 
video on how to how to find the cube but
let's<00:00:14.790> say<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.059> know<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.330> trying<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.839> find

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
that so open up your cube you got your

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.269 
that so open up your cube you got your
recipe<00:00:25.199> book<00:00:25.230> here<00:00:25.560> till<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> only<00:00:26.039> different

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
recipes so good way to to find that is

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.080 
recipes so good way to to find that is
to<00:00:30.210> use<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.840> upgrade<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.619> rare<00:00:31.769> items<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
basically just plop plop it's got to be

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.770 
basically just plop plop it's got to be
yellow<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.180> blue<00:00:36.300> see

yellow it out of blue see
floppy<00:00:37.050> yellow<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.340> then<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.520> plop<00:00:38.730> in

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
floppy yellow in and then you plop in

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.229 
floppy yellow in and then you plop in
you<00:00:39.120> know<00:00:39.210> each<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.899> these<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.559> know<00:00:41.239> from

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you know each of these you know from

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.819 
you know each of these you know from
yellow<00:00:42.450> items<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.780> white<00:00:45.960> items<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.590> also

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
yellow items to the white items and also

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.819 
yellow items to the white items and also
the<00:00:47.100> des<00:00:47.879> prés<00:00:48.149> from<00:00:48.539> elites<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:49.770> you

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the des prés from elites and then you

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.520 
the des prés from elites and then you
say<00:00:50.010> transmute<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.600> bam<00:00:52.110> there<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.410> go

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
say transmute and bam there you go

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.080 
say transmute and bam there you go
you've<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.280> turns<00:00:53.460> into<00:00:53.550> legendary

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you've got it just turns into legendary

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:10.929 
you've got it just turns into legendary
so<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.750> many<00:00:54.989> weapons<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.890> game<00:00:56.039> so

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.289 

it's<00:01:11.939> really<00:01:13.100> but<00:01:14.100> actually<00:01:15.060> there's<00:01:15.180> no

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it's really but actually there's no

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.289 
it's really but actually there's no
thing<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.720> let's<00:01:15.960> let's<00:01:16.380> say<00:01:16.560> you've<00:01:16.770> got

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
thing to do let's let's say you've got

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.760 
thing to do let's let's say you've got
so<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.360> don't<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.380> know<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
so you don't have you know one of the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.240 
so you don't have you know one of the
fists<00:01:20.130> right<00:01:20.659> well<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> cube<00:01:22.409> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
fists right well this in the cube and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.740 
fists right well this in the cube and
you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:25.460> convert<00:01:26.460> set<00:01:26.729> items<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.450> just

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
you can do convert set items so you just

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.999 
you can do convert set items so you just
plop<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:29.600> need<00:01:32.900> these<00:01:33.900> out<00:01:36.439> pop<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.829> there

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
plop I need these out pop that in there

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.870 
plop I need these out pop that in there
slip<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> recipe<00:01:39.060> again<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:41.280> disc<00:01:41.520> breath

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
slip the recipe again you disc breath

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.789 
slip the recipe again you disc breath
this<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:42.960> gonna<00:01:43.079> convert<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
this this is gonna convert it to the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.920 
this this is gonna convert it to the
other<00:01:43.950> other<00:01:44.220> fist<00:01:44.520> Idol<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:47.659> yeah<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> guess

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
other other fist Idol so yeah I guess

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.840 
other other fist Idol so yeah I guess
they<00:01:49.110> change<00:01:49.350> only<00:01:49.560> works<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.950> items<00:01:50.729> with

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
they change only works on items with

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.060 
they change only works on items with
three<00:01:50.970> pieces<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.600> good<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> know

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
three pieces so that's good to know

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.510 
three pieces so that's good to know
so<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.149> go<00:01:54.240> back<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.750> keep<00:01:54.899> doing<00:01:55.229> our

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
so we can go back just keep doing our

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.590 
so we can go back just keep doing our
our<00:01:56.520> tricks<00:01:56.880> here

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
our tricks here

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.820 
our tricks here
trying<00:01:59.230> to<00:01:59.290> get<00:01:59.410> them<00:01:59.560> justice<00:01:59.890> ass<00:02:01.830> probably

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
trying to get them justice ass probably

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.570 
trying to get them justice ass probably
won't<00:02:03.100> work<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.590> probably<00:02:06.010> set<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.460> be

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
won't work and probably set it to be

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:39.630 
won't work and probably set it to be
super<00:02:06.790> rare<00:02:26.100> chances<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:38.010> max<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.190> needed<00:02:39.459> that

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
super rare chances of max I needed that

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.960 
super rare chances of max I needed that
so<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.830> other<00:02:41.980> thing<00:02:42.130> too<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.730> no<00:02:42.820> longer

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
so the other thing too is you no longer

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.449 
so the other thing too is you no longer
have<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.270> worry<00:02:43.510> about

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
have to worry about

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.830 
have to worry about
you<00:02:45.459> always<00:02:45.610> run<00:02:45.820> out<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:46.060> these<00:02:46.150> blue<00:02:46.390> ones<00:02:46.420> no

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
you always run out of these blue ones no

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.690 
you always run out of these blue ones no
white<00:02:47.020> walk<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.560> now<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:47.770> can<00:02:48.070> merge<00:02:48.490> them

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
white walk so now you can merge them

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.990 
white walk so now you can merge them
