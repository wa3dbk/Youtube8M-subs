00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
called the bar increase and this is

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.330 
called the bar increase and this is
where<00:00:06.359> you're<00:00:06.600> going<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.870> knit<00:00:07.259> into<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
stitches off the needle and then you're

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.410 
stitches off the needle and then you're
going<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.190> go<00:00:14.370> into<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.700> back<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.179> stitch

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
going to go into the back of the stitch

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.710 
going to go into the back of the stitch
and<00:00:15.890> knit<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.460> increase<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> visible

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
and knit it this increase is a visible

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.290 
and knit it this increase is a visible
increase<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:20.100> there<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.430> got<00:00:20.580> my<00:00:20.760> extra<00:00:21.180> one

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
increase but there have got my extra one

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.320 
increase but there have got my extra one
the<00:00:22.289> next<00:00:22.680> kind<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.279> called<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.580> lifted<00:00:23.970> strand

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330

and<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.430> an<00:00:42.030> invisible<00:00:43.579> increase<00:00:45.110> so

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
and this is an invisible increase so

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.810 
and this is an invisible increase so
you'll<00:00:46.289> finish<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.100> row<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.370> I'll<00:00:47.579> show<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
you'll finish this row and I'll show you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.500 
you'll finish this row and I'll show you
the<00:00:48.090> difference<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:50.510> further

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the difference you can see it further

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.209 
the difference you can see it further
down<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.809> look<00:00:55.020> over<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:57.020> by<00:00:58.020> this

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
down so if you look over here by this

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.709 
down so if you look over here by this
you<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.399> see<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.180> my<00:01:00.629> original

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you can see that there is my original

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.470 
you can see that there is my original
stitch<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.770> there's<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.760> base<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
stitch and there's the base of the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.690 
stitch and there's the base of the
stitch<00:01:03.719> i<00:01:03.870> made<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.860> that's<00:01:05.010> quite<00:01:05.189> visible

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
stitch i made so that's quite visible

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.830 
stitch i made so that's quite visible
you<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.060> there's<00:01:06.240> always<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you know there's always going to be a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.070 
you know there's always going to be a
little<00:01:07.020> bit<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.799> hole<00:01:07.979> underneath<00:01:09.049> with<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
little bit of a hole underneath with the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.000 
little bit of a hole underneath with the
lifted<00:01:11.010> strand<00:01:11.400> increase<00:01:12.229> this<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.470> where<00:01:13.740> i

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
lifted strand increase this is where i

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.710 
lifted strand increase this is where i
made<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> right<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.060> there's<00:01:15.299> no<00:01:15.509> hole

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
made it right here there's no hole

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.530 
made it right here there's no hole
underneath<00:01:16.340> where<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.000> wasn't<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
underneath where there was it wasn't a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.450 
underneath where there was it wasn't a
stitch<00:01:18.780> before<00:01:19.520> now<00:01:20.520> there<00:01:20.729> was<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.310> can

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
stitch before now there was so you can

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.130 
stitch before now there was so you can
see<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> difference<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.450> one's<00:01:24.659> visible

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
see the difference this one's visible

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.270 
see the difference this one's visible
and<00:01:25.729> this<00:01:26.729> one's<00:01:26.939> invisible<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.159> then<00:01:29.159> you

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and this one's invisible and then you

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.060 
and this one's invisible and then you
would<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.579> work<00:01:29.820> those<00:01:30.090> stitches<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.900> your

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
would just work those stitches on your

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.609 
would just work those stitches on your
reverse<00:01:32.070> row<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.869> if<00:01:33.869> they<00:01:34.049> had<00:01:34.140> always<00:01:34.290> been

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
reverse row as if they had always been

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:58.390 
reverse row as if they had always been
there<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.009> pearl<00:01:35.909> them<00:01:36.090> across

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.600 

so<00:01:59.000> now<00:01:59.180> I've<00:01:59.270> got<00:01:59.450> my<00:01:59.570> increases<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.800> you<00:02:01.400> can

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
so now I've got my increases and you can

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.180 
so now I've got my increases and you can
see<00:02:01.940> right<00:02:02.350> here<00:02:03.350> your<00:02:03.530> i<00:02:03.560> can<00:02:03.830> go<00:02:03.950> immediately

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
see right here your i can go immediately

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.990 
see right here your i can go immediately
to<00:02:04.460> where<00:02:04.760> i<00:02:04.790> did<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.300> bar<00:02:05.510> increase<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.380> you

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
to where i did the bar increase and you

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.580 
to where i did the bar increase and you
really<00:02:08.000> can't<00:02:08.210> tell<00:02:08.330> where<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:08.930> did<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.290> lifted

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
really can't tell where I did the lifted

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.280 
really can't tell where I did the lifted
strand<00:02:09.890> increase
