00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
seems like there's this huge evolution

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.189 
seems like there's this huge evolution
they<00:00:59.280> go<00:00:59.579> from<00:00:59.699> big<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> small<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.420> waves<00:01:00.780> yep

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
they go from big to small and waves yep

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.869 
they go from big to small and waves yep
you've<00:01:01.440> got<00:01:01.680> these<00:01:01.859> phablets<00:01:02.430> which<00:01:02.670> are

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
you've got these phablets which are

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.270 
you've got these phablets which are
really<00:01:03.390> hot<00:01:03.600> right<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:04.890> you've<00:01:05.070> got

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
really hot right now but then you've got

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.880 
really hot right now but then you've got
Apple<00:01:06.150> introducing<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.110> tiniest<00:01:07.619> of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
Apple introducing the tiniest of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
Apple introducing the tiniest of
displays<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.610> Apple<00:01:09.060> watch<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> see

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
displays in the Apple watch and I see

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.200 
displays in the Apple watch and I see
you<00:01:09.960> wearing<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.439> right<00:01:10.470> now<00:01:10.710> yes<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.640> what

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
you wearing one right now yes so what

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.359 
you wearing one right now yes so what
exactly<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.750> happening<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.740> does<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.220> make

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
exactly is happening here does it make

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
exactly is happening here does it make
sense<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.970> both<00:01:15.360> sides<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
sense to have both sides of this kind of

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.560 
sense to have both sides of this kind of
a<00:01:16.320> market<00:01:16.790> it's<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> dumbbell<00:01:18.299> approach

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
a market it's the dumbbell approach

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.910 
a market it's the dumbbell approach
right<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> got<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> massive<00:01:19.439> screens<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
right you got the massive screens on the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.929 
right you got the massive screens on the
phablet's<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.549> get<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> tiny

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
phablet's and then you get the tiny

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.550 
phablet's and then you get the tiny
screens<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.390> watch<00:01:21.570> what's<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> dynamic

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
screens on the watch what's the dynamic

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.890 
screens on the watch what's the dynamic
between<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.220> two<00:01:23.400> well<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.150> think<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> dynamic

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
between the two well I think the dynamic

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.539 
between the two well I think the dynamic
between<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.380> two<00:01:25.530> well<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.920> know<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.369> whole

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
between the two well you know the whole

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.600 
between the two well you know the whole
you<00:01:27.150> know<00:01:27.270> one<00:01:27.450> size<00:01:27.689> doesn't<00:01:27.990> fit<00:01:28.110> all

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
you know one size doesn't fit all

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.300 
you know one size doesn't fit all

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.120 
what to put on there the phablet though
is<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.600> know<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.740> compare

that is these days and I do think that

again people want to be able to see

which ones are going to be around five

years ten years from now and which ones

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.819 
years ten years from now and which ones
are<00:02:55.450> going<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.629> kind<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.870> died<00:02:56.079> away<00:02:56.440> as<00:02:56.799> the

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
are going to kind of died away as the

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.800 
are going to kind of died away as the
years<00:02:57.129> go<00:02:57.190> by<00:02:57.310> well<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.730> do<00:02:57.849> think<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.359> watch<00:02:58.569> is

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
years go by well I do think the watch is

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.599 
years go by well I do think the watch is
here<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:59.079> stay<00:02:59.379> it's<00:02:59.650> very<00:02:59.890> early<00:03:00.099> but<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.489> do

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
here to stay it's very early but I do

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.099 
here to stay it's very early but I do
think<00:03:00.849> we're<00:03:01.030> going<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.209> see<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.480> watches<00:03:01.900> and

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
think we're going to see the watches and

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.569 
think we're going to see the watches and
you<00:03:02.230> know<00:03:02.349> those<00:03:02.739> screens<00:03:03.099> will<00:03:03.310> evolve

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
you know those screens will evolve

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.580 
you know those screens will evolve
certainly<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:04.510> phablet's<00:03:05.019> we're<00:03:05.200> talking

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
certainly the phablet's we're talking

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.920 
certainly the phablet's we're talking
about<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.579> know<00:03:06.700> people<00:03:07.209> define

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
about you and you know people define

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.660 
about you and you know people define
them<00:03:08.109> differently<00:03:08.470> but<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.680> think<00:03:08.920> smartphones

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
them differently but I think smartphones

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.210 
them differently but I think smartphones
generally<00:03:10.150> five<00:03:10.540> inches<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.470> above<00:03:11.980> are

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
generally five inches and above are

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.830 
generally five inches and above are
gonna<00:03:12.310> are<00:03:12.609> going<00:03:12.819> to<00:03:12.910> stay<00:03:13.120> there<00:03:13.299> how<00:03:13.480> big

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
gonna are going to stay there how big

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.220 
gonna are going to stay there how big
will<00:03:14.049> they<00:03:14.200> get<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:15.549> know<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.750> know<00:03:16.900> at<00:03:17.079> some

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
will they get you know you know at some

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.349 
will they get you know you know at some
point<00:03:17.290> it's<00:03:17.889> it's<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.340> matter<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.639> comfort<00:03:19.120> it's

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
point it's it's a matter of comfort it's

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.659 
point it's it's a matter of comfort it's
all<00:03:19.480> those<00:03:19.660> things<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.169> don't<00:03:21.130> think<00:03:21.549> the

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
all those things I don't think the

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.770 
all those things I don't think the
smaller<00:03:22.060> display<00:03:22.660> phone<00:03:22.989> goes<00:03:23.349> away<00:03:24.120> all<00:03:25.120> you

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
smaller display phone goes away all you

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.080 
smaller display phone goes away all you
know<00:03:25.900> all<00:03:26.109> together<00:03:26.500> but<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.340> do<00:03:27.489> think<00:03:27.940> that

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
know all together but I do think that

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.539 
know all together but I do think that
maybe<00:03:28.930> is<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.349> one<00:03:29.560> that's<00:03:29.769> sort<00:03:30.099> of<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.519> know

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
maybe is the one that's sort of you know

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.150 
maybe is the one that's sort of you know
at<00:03:30.880> risk<00:03:31.419> here<00:03:31.810> if<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.109> will<00:03:32.319> so<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.829> middle

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
at risk here if you will so the middle

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.159 
at risk here if you will so the middle
grounds<00:03:33.519> at<00:03:33.639> you<00:03:33.760> ask<00:03:33.910> but<00:03:34.480> it's<00:03:34.780> gonna<00:03:34.900> take

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
grounds at you ask but it's gonna take

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.000 
grounds at you ask but it's gonna take
time<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:35.739> mean<00:03:36.069> you<00:03:36.459> know<00:03:36.579> so<00:03:36.819> we<00:03:37.019> used<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.230> poke

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
time I mean you know so we used to poke

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.740 
time I mean you know so we used to poke
fun<00:03:39.040> at<00:03:39.220> Samsung<00:03:39.819> because<00:03:40.090> they<00:03:40.239> had<00:03:40.359> so<00:03:40.389> many

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
fun at Samsung because they had so many

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.449 
fun at Samsung because they had so many
devices<00:03:41.109> you<00:03:41.470> couldn't<00:03:41.769> keep<00:03:41.889> trying<00:03:42.310> you

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
devices you couldn't keep trying you

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.789 
devices you couldn't keep trying you
need<00:03:42.609> a<00:03:42.760> scorecard<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.440> think<00:03:44.650> they're

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
need a scorecard and I think they're

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.170 
need a scorecard and I think they're
really<00:03:45.069> trying<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.430> hit<00:03:45.579> what's<00:03:45.880> right<00:03:46.150> and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
really trying to hit what's right and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.839 
really trying to hit what's right and
the<00:03:46.750> answer<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:47.109> what<00:03:47.950> may<00:03:48.220> be<00:03:48.280> right<00:03:48.549> for<00:03:48.819> you

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
the answer is what may be right for you

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.490 
the answer is what may be right for you
isn't<00:03:49.150> right<00:03:49.450> for<00:03:49.480> me<00:03:49.720> all<00:03:50.079> right<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:50.319> maybe

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
isn't right for me all right so maybe

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.589 
isn't right for me all right so maybe
the<00:03:50.859> bottom<00:03:51.190> line<00:03:51.340> here<00:03:51.609> is<00:03:51.639> your<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.269> barbell

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
the bottom line here is your the barbell

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.569 
the bottom line here is your the barbell
approach<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.139> smaller<00:03:53.530> sized<00:03:53.859> ones<00:03:54.220> really

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
approach the smaller sized ones really

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.039 
approach the smaller sized ones really
kind<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.849> hang<00:03:55.000> around<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.540> large<00:03:55.750> loans

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
kind of hang around and the large loans

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.809 
kind of hang around and the large loans
really<00:03:56.349> hang<00:03:56.500> around<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.430> gives<00:03:57.639> at

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
really hang around and that gives at

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.550 
really hang around and that gives at
least<00:03:57.849> at<00:03:58.269> least<00:03:58.329> a<00:03:58.629> bit<00:03:58.750> of<00:03:58.870> spectrum<00:03:59.379> for

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
least at least a bit of spectrum for

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.379 
least at least a bit of spectrum for
consumer<00:03:59.919> I<00:04:00.010> think<00:04:00.250> so<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.609> the<00:04:00.669> tablets<00:04:01.239> is

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
consumer I think so and the tablets is

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.150 
consumer I think so and the tablets is
we<00:04:01.569> know<00:04:01.720> them<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.169> they're<00:04:02.769> we're<00:04:02.980> going<00:04:03.099> to

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
we know them that they're we're going to

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.789 
we know them that they're we're going to
see<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.370> think<00:04:03.700> some<00:04:04.180> you<00:04:04.599> know<00:04:04.720> this<00:04:05.379> some<00:04:05.709> of

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
see I think some you know this some of

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:06.960 
see I think some you know this some of
them<00:04:05.859> will<00:04:06.040> disappear<00:04:06.519> all<00:04:06.639> right<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:06.819> there's

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
them will disappear all right so there's

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.430 
them will disappear all right so there's
prediction<00:04:07.359> tablets<00:04:07.750> kind<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:07.959> go<00:04:08.049> away<00:04:08.260> well

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
prediction tablets kind of go away well

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.750 
prediction tablets kind of go away well
