show you the LCD glasses and go over a
bit<00:00:10.610> of<00:00:10.730> about<00:00:11.059> how<00:00:11.300> they<00:00:11.419> work

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:12.009 
bit of about how they work

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.799 
bit of about how they work
these<00:00:13.009> are<00:00:13.129> the<00:00:13.219> expand'<00:00:13.669> glasses<00:00:14.179> these<00:00:14.539> are

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.859 
these are the expand' glasses these are
the<00:00:14.900> old<00:00:15.079> ones<00:00:15.379> and<00:00:15.679> the<00:00:16.580> very<00:00:16.820> recent<00:00:17.300> newly

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
the old ones and the very recent newly

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.750 
the old ones and the very recent newly
released<00:00:18.020> version<00:00:18.680> of<00:00:18.860> the<00:00:19.070> expand<00:00:19.490> 3d

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
released version of the expand 3d

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.509 
released version of the expand 3d
glasses<00:00:20.060> much<00:00:20.720> more<00:00:21.050> stylish<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:21.830> actually

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
glasses much more stylish and actually

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.429 
glasses much more stylish and actually
quite<00:00:22.789> a<00:00:22.820> much<00:00:23.269> better<00:00:23.449> design<00:00:23.750> in<00:00:24.080> many<00:00:24.230> ways

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
quite a much better design in many ways

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.700 
quite a much better design in many ways
just<00:00:25.480> quickly<00:00:26.480> over<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:26.990> main<00:00:27.140> advantage<00:00:27.560> of

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
just quickly over the main advantage of

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.770 
just quickly over the main advantage of
them<00:00:28.330> is<00:00:29.330> that<00:00:29.650> these<00:00:30.650> ones<00:00:30.919> are<00:00:31.580> also<00:00:31.820> on<00:00:32.450> off

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
them is that these ones are also on off

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.810 
them is that these ones are also on off
so<00:00:33.470> you<00:00:33.530> don't<00:00:33.800> have<00:00:33.860> to<00:00:33.980> do<00:00:34.070> anything<00:00:34.280> all

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
so you don't have to do anything all

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.819 
so you don't have to do anything all
these<00:00:35.090> ones<00:00:35.329> you<00:00:35.840> still<00:00:36.050> need<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:36.320> hold<00:00:36.649> them

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
these ones you still need to hold them

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.270 
these ones you still need to hold them
very<00:00:36.860> firmly<00:00:37.600> here<00:00:38.649> have<00:00:39.649> to<00:00:39.770> hold<00:00:39.920> them<00:00:40.070> quite

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
very firmly here have to hold them quite

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.729 
very firmly here have to hold them quite
tightly<00:00:40.579> go<00:00:41.570> up<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.930> me<00:00:42.110> watch<00:00:42.230> similar<00:00:42.559> turn

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
tightly go up to me watch similar turn

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.569 
tightly go up to me watch similar turn
won't<00:00:42.920> hold<00:00:43.190> it<00:00:43.340> very<00:00:43.430> tightly<00:00:44.289> and<00:00:45.289> then<00:00:45.579> they

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
won't hold it very tightly and then they

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.900 
won't hold it very tightly and then they
go<00:00:46.730> they<00:00:46.879> start<00:00:47.149> flying<00:00:47.390> around<00:00:47.629> away<00:00:48.910> these

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
go they start flying around away these

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.700 
go they start flying around away these
ones<00:00:50.180> turn<00:00:50.539> on<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:50.899> off<00:00:50.930> automatically<00:00:51.469> so

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
ones turn on and off automatically so

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.010 
ones turn on and off automatically so
you<00:00:51.739> can't<00:00:52.039> really<00:00:52.160> test<00:00:52.850> them<00:00:53.000> like<00:00:53.180> that<00:00:53.359> but

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
you can't really test them like that but

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.340 
you can't really test them like that but
you<00:00:54.170> do<00:00:54.320> have<00:00:55.629> this<00:00:56.629> device<00:00:57.019> that<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:57.230> get

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
you do have this device that you get

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.290 
you do have this device that you get
from<00:00:57.469> expand<00:00:57.859> for<00:00:58.070> testing<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.550> glasses<00:00:58.760> for

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
from expand for testing the glasses for

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.340 
from expand for testing the glasses for
of<00:00:59.660> course<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:01.070> old<00:01:01.219> ones<00:01:01.690> didn't<00:01:02.690> have<00:01:02.840> the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
of course the old ones didn't have the

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.840 
of course the old ones didn't have the
battery<00:01:03.649> was<00:01:03.769> built-in<00:01:04.129> while<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.489> new<00:01:04.640> ones

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
battery was built-in while the new ones

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.399 
battery was built-in while the new ones
you<00:01:05.300> can<00:01:06.200> see<00:01:06.440> here<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:08.210> can<00:01:08.360> replace<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
you can see here you can replace the

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.730 
you can see here you can replace the
battery<00:01:09.590> through<00:01:10.220> this<00:01:10.450> section<00:01:11.450> here<00:01:11.810> and

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
battery through this section here and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.859 
battery through this section here and
this<00:01:13.549> is<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.759> test<00:01:14.060> system<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:14.509> you<00:01:14.600> can<00:01:14.659> make

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
this is a test system so you can make

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.080 
this is a test system so you can make
sure<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.049> glasses<00:01:15.590> are<00:01:15.710> okay<00:01:16.100> before<00:01:16.820> you

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
sure that glasses are okay before you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.960 
sure that glasses are okay before you
give<00:01:17.360> them<00:01:17.509> to<00:01:17.659> your<00:01:17.689> customers<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:19.670> push<00:01:19.880> the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
give them to your customers you push the

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.160 
give them to your customers you push the
little<00:01:20.030> button<00:01:20.180> here<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.869> red<00:01:21.020> light

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
little button here and the red light

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.780 
little button here and the red light
goes<00:01:21.380> on<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:24.220> actually<00:01:25.220> there<00:01:25.490> they<00:01:25.579> go<00:01:25.729> you

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
goes on and actually there they go you

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.499 
goes on and actually there they go you
can<00:01:26.000> start<00:01:26.240> seeing<00:01:26.479> flashing<00:01:27.079> I'm<00:01:27.710> sure<00:01:28.509> that

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
can start seeing flashing I'm sure that

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.749 
can start seeing flashing I'm sure that
maybe<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:30.350> can<00:01:30.500> see<00:01:30.680> them<00:01:30.829> flashing<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.369> they

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
maybe you can see them flashing and they

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.870 
maybe you can see them flashing and they
flash<00:01:32.000> it<00:01:32.149> a<00:01:32.240> very<00:01:32.570> nice<00:01:32.869> full<00:01:33.350> rate<00:01:33.850> then<00:01:34.850> you

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
flash it a very nice full rate then you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.330 
flash it a very nice full rate then you
can<00:01:34.970> probably<00:01:35.210> sit<00:01:35.390> through<00:01:35.600> my<00:01:35.720> head<00:01:35.899> there

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
can probably sit through my head there

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.219 
can probably sit through my head there
there<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.460> go

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
there you go

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.950 
there you go
we're<00:01:39.229> gonna<00:01:39.350> go<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:41.240> that's<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.479> testing

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
we're gonna go and that's the testing

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.609 
we're gonna go and that's the testing
system<00:01:42.140> for<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:42.619> for<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.070> glasses<00:01:44.439> put<00:01:45.439> them

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
system for that for the glasses put them

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.030 
system for that for the glasses put them
down<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.810> these<00:01:47.810> ones<00:01:48.110> like<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.350> four<00:01:48.740> I

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
down and these ones like a four I

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.080 
down and these ones like a four I
probably<00:01:50.000> turned<00:01:50.299> off<00:01:50.420> already<00:01:50.719> like<00:01:51.409> to

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
probably turned off already like to

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.490 
probably turned off already like to
squeeze<00:01:53.090> them<00:01:53.329> to<00:01:53.420> turn<00:01:53.600> them<00:01:53.719> on<00:01:53.840> there<00:01:54.380> they

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
squeeze them to turn them on there they

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.310 
squeeze them to turn them on there they
go

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.020 

yeah<00:01:59.320> well<00:01:59.740> they<00:01:59.950> worked<00:02:00.340> for<00:02:00.460> me<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.700> put<00:02:00.909> that

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
yeah well they worked for me to put that

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.690 
yeah well they worked for me to put that
out<00:02:01.180> how<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.630> all<00:02:01.780> works<00:02:02.400> push<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.520> button

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
out how that all works push the button

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.600 
out how that all works push the button
on<00:02:03.759> this<00:02:03.880> again<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.299> turn<00:02:04.420> it<00:02:04.479> off<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:06.549> the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
on this again to turn it off now the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.050 
on this again to turn it off now the
main<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:08.200> main<00:02:08.349> advantage<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.009> these<00:02:09.789> ones

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
main the main advantage of these ones

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.970 
main the main advantage of these ones
apart<00:02:10.360> from<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.599> Auto<00:02:10.720> turn<00:02:10.989> off<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.770> these

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
apart from the Auto turn off is these

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.120 
apart from the Auto turn off is these
are<00:02:12.130> much<00:02:12.250> more<00:02:12.459> suited<00:02:12.730> for<00:02:12.760> children<00:02:13.300> which

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
are much more suited for children which

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.070 
are much more suited for children which
is<00:02:15.130> probably<00:02:15.700> one<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.120> most<00:02:16.270> common

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
is probably one of the most common

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.650 
is probably one of the most common
clients<00:02:18.069> or<00:02:18.310> customer<00:02:18.730> you'll<00:02:18.940> have<00:02:19.090> 3d<00:02:19.569> in

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
clients or customer you'll have 3d in

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.260 
clients or customer you'll have 3d in
the<00:02:19.750> future<00:02:20.520> they're<00:02:21.520> much<00:02:21.640> more<00:02:21.760> flexible

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
the future they're much more flexible

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.620 
the future they're much more flexible
here<00:02:22.540> etc<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:23.769> hopefully<00:02:24.459> hold<00:02:25.120> onto<00:02:25.360> the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
here etc to hopefully hold onto the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.680 
here etc to hopefully hold onto the
children's<00:02:26.500> heads<00:02:26.769> or<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.400> old<00:02:27.550> ones<00:02:27.790> didn't

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
children's heads or the old ones didn't

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.050 
children's heads or the old ones didn't
seem<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.870> work<00:02:28.989> as<00:02:29.110> well<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.380> our<00:02:29.470> experience

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
seem to work as well in our experience

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.470 
seem to work as well in our experience
in<00:02:31.060> these<00:02:31.209> ones<00:02:31.420> look<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.870> whole<00:02:32.410> lot<00:02:32.440> better

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
in these ones look a whole lot better

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.590 
in these ones look a whole lot better
so<00:02:34.480> yeah<00:02:34.630> that's<00:02:34.810> expanding<00:02:35.260> 3d<00:02:35.620> now<00:02:36.600> quickly

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
so yeah that's expanding 3d now quickly

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.780 
so yeah that's expanding 3d now quickly
I'll<00:02:38.560> go<00:02:38.890> over<00:02:39.010> my<00:02:39.220> opinion<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
I'll go over my opinion of the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.330 
I'll go over my opinion of the
experience<00:02:40.150> system<00:02:40.480> my<00:02:41.230> opinion<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.680> it's<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
experience system my opinion is it's the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.120 
experience system my opinion is it's the
best<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.790> 3d<00:02:43.360> systems<00:02:43.750> mainly<00:02:44.560> because<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.950> has

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
best of 3d systems mainly because it has

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.400 
best of 3d systems mainly because it has
the<00:02:48.280> least<00:02:48.459> amount<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.790> light<00:02:49.000> loss<00:02:49.410> for

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
the least amount of light loss for

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.920 
the least amount of light loss for
example<00:02:50.470> Dobies<00:02:51.100> 40%<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.480> light<00:02:52.510> from<00:02:52.810> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
example Dobies 40% of the light from the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.690 
example Dobies 40% of the light from the
projector<00:02:53.019> gets<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.680> eye<00:02:53.709> it's<00:02:54.220> very<00:02:54.400> very

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
projector gets to the eye it's very very

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.309 
projector gets to the eye it's very very
low<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:55.150> course<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.569> can<00:02:55.720> start<00:02:55.900> with<00:02:55.989> 50

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
low of course you can start with 50

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.360 
low of course you can start with 50
because<00:02:56.530> your<00:02:56.739> two<00:02:57.459> eyes<00:02:58.890> through<00:02:59.890> through

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
because your two eyes through through

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.849 
because your two eyes through through
one<00:03:00.549> projector<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.360> split<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.140> in<00:03:02.230> half<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.560> 50

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
one projector so split it in half of 50

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.890 
one projector so split it in half of 50
and<00:03:03.070> then<00:03:03.400> you've<00:03:03.640> got<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.060> extra<00:03:04.359> loss<00:03:04.600> for

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
and then you've got the extra loss for

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.090 
and then you've got the extra loss for
each<00:03:05.079> system<00:03:05.739> has<00:03:05.799> a<00:03:05.980> certain<00:03:06.340> amount<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.609> loss

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
each system has a certain amount of loss

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.479 
each system has a certain amount of loss
you<00:03:09.100> have<00:03:09.450> polarizing<00:03:10.799> linear<00:03:11.799> polarizing<00:03:12.250> is

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
you have polarizing linear polarizing is

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.330 
you have polarizing linear polarizing is
pretty<00:03:12.700> good<00:03:12.970> then<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.900> circular<00:03:14.769> polarizing

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
pretty good then the circular polarizing

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.009 
pretty good then the circular polarizing
is<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> bit<00:03:15.579> worse<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.180> Dolby's<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.720> worst<00:03:16.870> of

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
is a bit worse and Dolby's the worst of

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.830 
is a bit worse and Dolby's the worst of
all<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.530> this<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.280> best<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.609> all<00:03:18.760> in<00:03:19.600> terms

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
all and this is the best of all in terms

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.780 
all and this is the best of all in terms
of<00:03:20.019> light<00:03:20.170> loss<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:21.220> don't<00:03:21.400> really<00:03:21.609> need

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
of light loss so you don't really need

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.550 
of light loss so you don't really need
to<00:03:21.940> buy<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.120> nearly<00:03:22.510> as<00:03:22.600> big<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.810> projector<00:03:23.260> and

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
to buy a nearly as big a projector and

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.720 
to buy a nearly as big a projector and
spend<00:03:23.859> nearly<00:03:24.010> as<00:03:24.160> much<00:03:24.310> money<00:03:24.489> on<00:03:24.609> your

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
spend nearly as much money on your

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.830 
spend nearly as much money on your
projector<00:03:24.880> but<00:03:26.130> currently<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.760> glasses<00:03:28.000> cost

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
projector but currently the glasses cost

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.560 
projector but currently the glasses cost
a<00:03:28.989> killer<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:30.030> that's<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.150> biggest<00:03:31.329> problem

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
a killer and that's the biggest problem

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.240 
a killer and that's the biggest problem
but<00:03:31.930> then<00:03:32.049> again<00:03:32.140> Bowlby's<00:03:32.590> glasses<00:03:33.070> aren't

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
but then again Bowlby's glasses aren't

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.949 
but then again Bowlby's glasses aren't
cheap<00:03:33.730> either<00:03:33.880> but<00:03:34.480> these<00:03:34.630> are<00:03:34.750> still

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
cheap either but these are still

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.370 
cheap either but these are still
considerably<00:03:35.410> more<00:03:35.560> than<00:03:35.620> Dobby<00:03:36.900> but<00:03:37.900> quality

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
considerably more than Dobby but quality

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.539 
considerably more than Dobby but quality
wise<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:40.140> find<00:03:41.140> this<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:41.380> probably<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.769> best<00:03:41.920> in

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
wise I find this is probably the best in

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.000 
wise I find this is probably the best in
terms<00:03:42.850> of<00:03:43.120> for<00:03:43.569> example<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:44.019> Dolby<00:03:44.260> because

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
terms of for example the Dolby because

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.150 
terms of for example the Dolby because
it's<00:03:45.190> uses<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.239> special<00:03:46.859> system<00:03:47.859> where<00:03:48.010> it

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
it's uses that special system where it

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.120 
it's uses that special system where it
filters<00:03:49.079> certain<00:03:50.079> frequencies<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.590> light<00:03:50.739> out

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
filters certain frequencies of light out

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.250 
filters certain frequencies of light out
from<00:03:51.340> each<00:03:51.489> eye<00:03:51.819> so<00:03:52.510> basically<00:03:52.810> each<00:03:53.019> eyes

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
from each eye so basically each eyes

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.009 
from each eye so basically each eyes
actually<00:03:54.069> seeing<00:03:54.540> different<00:03:55.540> frequencies

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
actually seeing different frequencies

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.860 
actually seeing different frequencies
from<00:03:56.230> red<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.590> blue<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:56.889> green<00:03:57.090> but<00:03:58.090> roughly

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
from red and blue and green but roughly

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.050 
from red and blue and green but roughly
to<00:03:59.530> make<00:03:59.709> up<00:03:59.859> the<00:03:59.980> picture<00:04:00.340> but<00:04:00.819> it's

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
to make up the picture but it's

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.490 
to make up the picture but it's
something<00:04:01.269> that<00:04:01.600> your<00:04:01.720> brain<00:04:01.870> is<00:04:02.079> never<00:04:02.200> dealt

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
something that your brain is never dealt

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.680 
something that your brain is never dealt
with<00:04:02.620> before<00:04:02.739> it's<00:04:03.639> probably<00:04:03.910> more<00:04:04.180> likely<00:04:04.540> to

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
with before it's probably more likely to

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.930 
with before it's probably more likely to
give<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:05.019> headache<00:04:05.290> than<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.549> system

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
give you a headache than this system

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.250 
give you a headache than this system
which<00:04:07.060> is<00:04:07.209> basically

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
which is basically

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.150 
which is basically
just<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:11.960> downgrade<00:04:12.960> in<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.200> light<00:04:13.410> now<00:04:13.980> they

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
just a downgrade in the light now they

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.860 
just a downgrade in the light now they
all<00:04:14.280> have<00:04:14.460> flashing<00:04:14.910> so<00:04:15.120> flashing<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:15.840> a

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
all have flashing so flashing is a

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.740 
all have flashing so flashing is a
common<00:04:16.430> reason<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.580> have<00:04:17.760> had<00:04:18.300> the<00:04:18.450> headaches

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
common reason you have had the headaches

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.830 
common reason you have had the headaches
and<00:04:19.020> the<00:04:19.110> all<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.590> systems<00:04:19.920> do<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.280> so

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
and the all the systems do that so

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.470 
and the all the systems do that so
there's<00:04:21.840> not<00:04:21.930> much<00:04:21.989> about<00:04:22.320> that

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
there's not much about that

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.950 
there's not much about that
although<00:04:25.230> Dolby<00:04:26.190> with<00:04:26.490> two<00:04:26.700> projectors<00:04:27.450> would

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
although Dolby with two projectors would

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.250

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
the bulb 3d film as you can see you can

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.680 
the bulb 3d film as you can see you can
see<00:04:37.110> both<00:04:37.350> images<00:04:37.560> for<00:04:38.010> two<00:04:38.160> eyes<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.910> then<00:04:39.570> I

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
see both images for two eyes and then I

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.200 
see both images for two eyes and then I
put<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.110> expand<00:04:40.710> glasses<00:04:41.220> in<00:04:41.370> front<00:04:41.400> of<00:04:41.790> the

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
put the expand glasses in front of the

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.540 
put the expand glasses in front of the
video<00:04:42.360> camera<00:04:42.560> it<00:04:43.560> takes<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.890> while<00:04:44.070> for<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.460> to

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
video camera it takes a while for it to

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.760 
video camera it takes a while for it to
adjust<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.300> new<00:04:45.330> light<00:04:45.630> levels<00:04:45.990> but<00:04:46.620> you

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
adjust to the new light levels but you

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.800 
adjust to the new light levels but you
can<00:04:46.920> now<00:04:47.100> see<00:04:47.370> only<00:04:47.790> one<00:04:47.970> of<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.420> two<00:04:48.570> pictures

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
can now see only one of the two pictures

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.320 
can now see only one of the two pictures
and<00:04:49.410> you'll<00:04:49.770> also<00:04:49.980> note<00:04:50.310> that<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.760> crosstalk

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
and you'll also note that the crosstalk

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.890 
and you'll also note that the crosstalk
is<00:04:51.570> very<00:04:52.170> low<00:04:52.380> if<00:04:52.530> if<00:04:52.880> nonexistence<00:04:53.880> it<00:04:54.570> is<00:04:54.780> the

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
is very low if if nonexistence it is the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.990 
is very low if if nonexistence it is the
best<00:04:55.080> crosstalk<00:04:55.590> I've<00:04:56.070> seen<00:04:56.370> out<00:04:56.520> of<00:04:56.640> all<00:04:56.850> the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
best crosstalk I've seen out of all the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.810 
best crosstalk I've seen out of all the
3d<00:04:57.360> systems
