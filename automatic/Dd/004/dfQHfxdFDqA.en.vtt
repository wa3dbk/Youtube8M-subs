00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
button and then on the crunch channel

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.660 
button and then on the crunch channel
you<00:01:45.020> have<00:01:45.170> normal<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:45.740> crunch<00:01:46.069> and<00:01:46.280> super

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
you have normal of crunch and super

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.529 
you have normal of crunch and super
crunch<00:01:48.280> finally<00:01:49.280> on<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.729> power<00:01:49.970> end<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.450> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.169 
crunch finally on the power end of the
amp<00:01:50.690> we<00:01:50.929> have<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.979> master<00:01:52.399> volume<00:01:52.550> control

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
amp we have the master volume control

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.109 
amp we have the master volume control
which<00:01:53.679> covers<00:01:54.679> the<00:01:54.860> overall<00:01:55.340> global<00:01:55.640> volume

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
which covers the overall global volume

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.850 
which covers the overall global volume
you<00:01:56.569> also<00:01:56.750> have<00:01:56.929> the<00:01:57.050> additional<00:01:57.140> EQ<00:01:57.830> of

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
you also have the additional EQ of

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.380 
you also have the additional EQ of
resonance<00:01:58.429> and<00:01:58.640> presence<00:01:59.179> obviously

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
resonance and presence obviously

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.359 
resonance and presence obviously
resonance<00:02:00.289> for<00:02:00.470> bottom<00:02:00.739> and<00:02:00.890> presents<00:02:01.340> for

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
resonance for bottom and presents for

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.029 
resonance for bottom and presents for
top-end<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.119> over<00:02:02.690> here<00:02:02.899> is<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.170> magic<00:02:03.349> knob

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
top-end and over here is the magic knob

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.820 
top-end and over here is the magic knob
for<00:02:04.509> power<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:05.929> you<00:02:06.020> can<00:02:06.289> get<00:02:06.440> anywhere<00:02:06.770> from

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
for power so you can get anywhere from

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.219 
for power so you can get anywhere from
20<00:02:07.399> watt<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.789> 20<00:02:08.179> watts<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.509> power<00:02:08.660> all<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.200> way

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
20 watt of 20 watts of power all the way

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.619 
20 watt of 20 watts of power all the way
up<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.649> full<00:02:09.890> 200<00:02:10.369> watts<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.910> power<00:02:11.270> of

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
dynamics of this particular amp let's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.420 
dynamics of this particular amp let's
begin<00:02:18.200> with<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.530> clean<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:18.920> crunch<00:02:19.160> channel

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
begin with the clean and crunch channel

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.280 
begin with the clean and crunch channel
which<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:19.849> share<00:02:20.150> channel<00:02:20.569> I'll<00:02:20.930> let<00:02:21.170> you

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
which is a share channel I'll let you

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.630 
which is a share channel I'll let you
hear<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.590> two<00:02:21.709> different<00:02:22.010> modes<00:02:22.129> from<00:02:22.370> bright

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
hear the two different modes from bright

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.280 
hear the two different modes from bright
to<00:02:22.790> warm<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.120> clean<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.900> crunch<00:02:24.140> and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
to warm on clean and the crunch and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.630 
to warm on clean and the crunch and
super<00:02:24.620> crunch<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.069> you'll<00:02:25.160> definitely<00:02:25.310> hear

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
super crunch and you'll definitely hear

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.339 
super crunch and you'll definitely hear
the<00:02:25.670> difference<00:02:26.060> now<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.660> clean<00:02:26.930> channel<00:02:27.290> of

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
the difference now the clean channel of

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.199 
the difference now the clean channel of
course<00:02:27.530> gets<00:02:27.739> all<00:02:27.950> those<00:02:28.129> really<00:02:28.340> nice<00:02:28.819> tones

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
course gets all those really nice tones

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.199 
course gets all those really nice tones
for<00:02:29.599> clean<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.080> on<00:02:30.680> crunch<00:02:31.209> certainly

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
for clean and on crunch certainly
