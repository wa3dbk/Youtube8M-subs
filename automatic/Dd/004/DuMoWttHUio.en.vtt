relative to a lobster or shrimp they
actually<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.240> gills<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.049> got<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.380> keep

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
actually have gills so you got to keep

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.770 
actually have gills so you got to keep
the<00:01:14.420> their<00:01:15.420> environment<00:01:16.320> somewhat<00:01:16.710> moist<00:01:17.780> and

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
place I shelf someplace and just kind of

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.220

a<00:03:19.380> storm<00:03:20.180> come<00:03:21.180> out<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.510> water<00:03:21.720> remember<00:03:22.079> one

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
a storm come out and water remember one

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.940 
a storm come out and water remember one
small<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.700> give<00:03:24.329> them<00:03:24.450> some<00:03:24.660> new<00:03:25.230> food<00:03:25.530> and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
small and give them some new food and

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.339 
small and give them some new food and
especially<00:03:28.950> when<00:03:29.519> they<00:03:29.639> have<00:03:29.959> young<00:03:30.959> the

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
especially when they have young the

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.129 
especially when they have young the
females<00:03:32.420> basically<00:03:33.420> kind<00:03:33.599> of<00:03:33.780> brewed<00:03:34.109> the

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
females basically kind of brewed the

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.520 
females basically kind of brewed the
young<00:03:34.560> on<00:03:34.889> them<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:36.170> after<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> couple<00:03:37.440> weeks

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
young on them and after a couple weeks

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.839 
young on them and after a couple weeks
or<00:03:37.920> hatch<00:03:38.160> they<00:03:38.489> look<00:03:38.639> just<00:03:38.880> like<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.480> adults

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
or hatch they look just like the adults

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.930 
or hatch they look just like the adults
only<00:03:41.849> their<00:03:42.239> tiny<00:03:42.630> they<00:03:43.530> molt<00:03:43.859> then<00:03:44.549> they<00:03:44.700> eat

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
only their tiny they molt then they eat

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.349 
only their tiny they molt then they eat
their<00:03:45.269> shells<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:47.489> they<00:03:47.609> don't<00:03:48.000> lose<00:03:48.060> any

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
their shells and so they don't lose any

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:49.970 
their shells and so they don't lose any
calcium<00:03:48.599> they're<00:03:49.019> constantly<00:03:49.410> eating<00:03:49.680> more

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
calcium they're constantly eating more

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.740 
calcium they're constantly eating more
calcium<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.329> know<00:03:52.790> maybe<00:03:53.790> not<00:03:54.389> like<00:03:54.690> a

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
calcium so you know maybe not like a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.159 
calcium so you know maybe not like a
mill<00:03:55.620> worms<00:03:55.889> or<00:03:56.190> something<00:03:56.459> where<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:57.019> end<00:03:58.019> up

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
mill worms or something where you end up

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.020 
mill worms or something where you end up
with<00:03:58.730> thousands<00:03:59.730> of<00:03:59.880> them<00:04:00.060> but<00:04:02.030> definitely

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
with thousands of them but definitely

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.379 
with thousands of them but definitely
can<00:04:03.209> probably<00:04:03.780> have<00:04:04.250> treats<00:04:05.250> here<00:04:05.549> and<00:04:05.669> there

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.809 

so

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
so

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.720 
so
find<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.599> place<00:04:11.810> for<00:04:11.840> I'm<00:04:12.170> here<00:04:12.409> and<00:04:12.549> we'll<00:04:13.549> come

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
find a place for I'm here and we'll come

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.629 
find a place for I'm here and we'll come
back<00:04:13.909> and<00:04:14.090> check<00:04:14.239> on<00:04:14.420> them<00:04:14.569> every<00:04:14.629> couple<00:04:15.139> days

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
back and check on them every couple days

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.879 
back and check on them every couple days
see<00:04:16.639> how<00:04:16.789> progress<00:04:17.299> goes<00:04:17.780> till<00:04:18.440> next<00:04:18.650> time<00:04:18.739> is

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
see how progress goes till next time is

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.130
