00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
played as we see in this to replay the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.089 
played as we see in this to replay the
deepest<00:02:06.420> attack<00:02:06.720> on<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.020> left<00:02:07.200> side<00:02:07.409> does<00:02:07.860> not

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
deepest attack on the left side does not

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.460 
deepest attack on the left side does not
occupy<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.909> guard<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:09.989> want<00:02:10.200> him<00:02:10.259> to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
occupy that guard like we want him to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.250 
occupy that guard like we want him to
his<00:02:10.649> slant<00:02:11.069> which<00:02:11.909> to<00:02:12.569> me<00:02:12.689> that<00:02:12.870> means<00:02:12.989> its

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
his slant which to me that means its

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.089 
his slant which to me that means its
lands<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.799> little<00:02:14.040> bit<00:02:14.129> too<00:02:15.170> significant<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.500> we

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
lands a little bit too significant so we

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.890 
lands a little bit too significant so we
need<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.340> kind<00:02:17.519> of<00:02:17.610> adjust<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.180> slants<00:02:18.689> of<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
need to kind of adjust the slants of the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.680 
need to kind of adjust the slants of the
lineman<00:02:19.379> so<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.340> tackle<00:02:20.880> will<00:02:21.390> occupy

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
lineman so that the tackle will occupy

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.280 
lineman so that the tackle will occupy
that<00:02:21.840> guard<00:02:22.260> now<00:02:22.530> my<00:02:22.680> first<00:02:23.010> idea<00:02:23.310> here

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
that guard now my first idea here

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.140 
that guard now my first idea here
I'm<00:02:24.439> just<00:02:24.560> going<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.769> read<00:02:25.010> less<00:02:25.310> Williams<00:02:25.879> and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
I'm just going to read less Williams and

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.390 
I'm just going to read less Williams and
we'll<00:02:26.329> see<00:02:26.510> here<00:02:26.780> now<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.829> pressure<00:02:28.040> loops

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
we'll see here now that pressure loops

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.740 
we'll see here now that pressure loops
around<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.760> edge<00:02:28.879> now<00:02:29.060> does<00:02:29.269> it<00:02:29.420> come<00:02:29.540> at<00:02:29.719> a

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
around the edge now does it come at a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.360 
around the edge now does it come at a
hundred<00:02:29.900> percent<00:02:30.079> clean<00:02:30.530> as<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:30.739> guys<00:02:30.920> notice

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
hundred percent clean as you guys notice

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.339 
hundred percent clean as you guys notice
so<00:02:31.849> we<00:02:31.939> can<00:02:32.090> always<00:02:32.329> take<00:02:32.540> something<00:02:32.989> from<00:02:33.109> we

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
so we can always take something from we

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.020 
so we can always take something from we
can<00:02:33.469> always<00:02:33.709> go<00:02:34.040> back<00:02:34.069> a<00:02:34.280> look<00:02:34.489> at<00:02:34.609> the<00:02:34.730> replay

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
can always go back a look at the replay

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.750 
can always go back a look at the replay
and<00:02:35.569> you<00:02:36.290> know<00:02:36.409> how<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.950> course<00:02:37.189> NFL<00:02:37.549> teams

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
and you know how of course NFL teams

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.580 
and you know how of course NFL teams
they<00:02:37.969> look<00:02:38.120> at<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.390> tape<00:02:38.629> you<00:02:38.840> know<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.170> then

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
they look at the tape you know and then

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.380 
they look at the tape you know and then
you<00:02:39.829> look<00:02:39.950> at<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.219> replay<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.760> kind<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.150> see

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
you look at the replay to kind of see

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.360 
you look at the replay to kind of see
where<00:02:41.689> you<00:02:41.900> went<00:02:42.049> wrong<00:02:42.290> some<00:02:42.920> different<00:02:43.250> ways

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
where you went wrong some different ways

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.979 
where you went wrong some different ways
you<00:02:43.400> could<00:02:43.790> do<00:02:43.909> the<00:02:44.060> play<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.659> make<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.930> a

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
you could do the play to make it a

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.390 
you could do the play to make it a
little<00:02:45.109> bit<00:02:45.290> more<00:02:45.439> effective<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.069> that<00:02:46.189> time

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
little bit more effective and that time

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.670 
little bit more effective and that time
we<00:02:46.549> see<00:02:46.760> that's<00:02:47.569> slam<00:02:47.959> does<00:02:48.200> we<00:02:48.379> want<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.650> to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
we see that's slam does we want it to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.750 
we see that's slam does we want it to
come<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.159> big<00:02:49.310> app<00:02:49.459> because<00:02:49.640> that's

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
come to the big app because that's

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.849 
come to the big app because that's
probably<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.299> cleanest<00:02:50.510> Avenue<00:02:51.109> because<00:02:51.650> it

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
probably the cleanest Avenue because it

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.619 
probably the cleanest Avenue because it
loops<00:02:52.069> around<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.700> doesn't<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.239> doesn't<00:02:53.269> quite

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
loops around it doesn't it doesn't quite

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.509 
loops around it doesn't it doesn't quite
get<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:53.959> as<00:02:54.139> well<00:02:54.349> so<00:02:54.560> now<00:02:55.010> we're<00:02:55.189> going<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.340> try

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
get it as well so now we're going to try

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.460 
get it as well so now we're going to try
to<00:02:55.579> contain<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.450> defensive<00:02:56.930> tackle<00:02:57.290> and

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
to contain that defensive tackle and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.589 
to contain that defensive tackle and
there<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.519> see<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.879> blitz<00:02:59.090> comes<00:02:59.329> through

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
there you see that blitz comes through

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.240 
there you see that blitz comes through
but<00:02:59.810> then<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.079> guard<00:03:00.290> sides<00:03:00.560> over<00:03:00.829> so<00:03:01.069> once

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
but then the guard sides over so once

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.890 
but then the guard sides over so once
again<00:03:01.400> there's<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:01.970> all<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.329> that<00:03:02.510> stuff<00:03:02.750> and

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
again there's it's all of that stuff and

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.270 
again there's it's all of that stuff and
this<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.049> what<00:03:03.349> the<00:03:03.439> process<00:03:03.680> was<00:03:03.980> when<00:03:04.129> I<00:03:04.189> was

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
this is what the process was when I was

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.789 
this is what the process was when I was
laughing<00:03:04.519> this<00:03:04.730> up<00:03:04.909> so<00:03:05.569> then<00:03:06.439> we're<00:03:06.650> going<00:03:06.739> to

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
laughing this up so then we're going to

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.110 
laughing this up so then we're going to
slant<00:03:07.129> a<00:03:07.250> line<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.609> left<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.030> right

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
slant a line to the left to the right

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.539 
slant a line to the left to the right
and<00:03:08.709> there<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:09.829> see<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.040> Blitz<00:03:10.340> comes

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
and there you see the Blitz comes

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.960 
and there you see the Blitz comes
through<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.879> B<00:03:11.000> gap<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.389> little<00:03:11.419> bit<00:03:11.780> there<00:03:12.019> and

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
through the B gap a little bit there and

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.780 
through the B gap a little bit there and
so<00:03:14.260> everything<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.500> try<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.739> do<00:03:15.919> to<00:03:16.129> change<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
so everything we try to do to change the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.059 
so everything we try to do to change the
Blitz<00:03:17.030> angle<00:03:17.389> has<00:03:17.510> failed<00:03:17.840> us<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:18.680> now<00:03:18.859> we're

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
Blitz angle has failed us so now we're

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.800 
Blitz angle has failed us so now we're
going<00:03:19.159> to<00:03:19.220> try<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.400> spy<00:03:19.790> guy<00:03:20.090> some<00:03:20.419> as<00:03:20.629> we<00:03:20.780> saw

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
going to try to spy guy some as we saw

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.839 
going to try to spy guy some as we saw
on<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.139> mic<00:03:21.260> Sam<00:03:21.470> crash<00:03:21.739> video<00:03:22.069> that<00:03:22.639> does<00:03:22.819> a

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
on the mic Sam crash video that does a

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.490 
on the mic Sam crash video that does a
lot<00:03:22.939> better<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.480> then<00:03:23.569> AC<00:03:23.720> everyone<00:03:24.230> kind<00:03:24.409> of

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
lot better and then AC everyone kind of

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.289 
lot better and then AC everyone kind of
gets<00:03:24.680> in<00:03:24.859> but<00:03:25.159> he<00:03:25.250> he<00:03:25.609> kind<00:03:25.849> of<00:03:25.909> gets<00:03:26.000> bottled

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
gets in but he he kind of gets bottled

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.849 
gets in but he he kind of gets bottled
up<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:26.930> we're<00:03:27.079> going<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.260> continue<00:03:27.439> on

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
up and so we're going to continue on

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.009 
up and so we're going to continue on
with<00:03:27.980> this<00:03:28.069> process<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:28.970> now<00:03:29.750> we're<00:03:29.870> going<00:03:29.959> to

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
with this process and now we're going to

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.869 
with this process and now we're going to
do<00:03:30.199> you<00:03:30.739> know<00:03:30.829> just<00:03:30.979> kind<00:03:31.159> of<00:03:31.190> repeat<00:03:31.579> went

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
do you know just kind of repeat went

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.189 
do you know just kind of repeat went
rinse<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:32.329> repeat<00:03:32.419> over<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:32.900> over<00:03:33.019> again

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:33.199 
rinse and repeat over and over again

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.539 
rinse and repeat over and over again
until<00:03:33.319> we<00:03:33.560> find<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.949> krabby<00:03:34.250> patty<00:03:34.459> formula

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
until we find the krabby patty formula

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.110 
until we find the krabby patty formula
that<00:03:35.000> works<00:03:35.859> so<00:03:36.859> another<00:03:37.430> thing<00:03:37.519> we<00:03:37.790> could<00:03:37.940> do

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
that works so another thing we could do

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.939 
that works so another thing we could do
you<00:03:38.629> know<00:03:38.750> potentially<00:03:38.930> if<00:03:39.379> you're<00:03:39.560> when

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:39.949 
you know potentially if you're when

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:40.990 
you know potentially if you're when
you're<00:03:40.040> alive<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.459> blitzes<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:40.879> could

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
you're alive the blitzes you could

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.339 
you're alive the blitzes you could
spread<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.389> line<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.750> could<00:03:41.840> crash<00:03:42.109> it<00:03:42.260> to

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
spread the line you could crash it to

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.589 
spread the line you could crash it to
the<00:03:42.470> right<00:03:42.620> do<00:03:43.489> two<00:03:43.729> things<00:03:43.970> instead<00:03:44.419> of<00:03:44.479> just

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
the right do two things instead of just

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.180 
the right do two things instead of just
one<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.109> they<00:03:45.199> see<00:03:45.349> ever<00:03:45.620> been<00:03:45.829> starting<00:03:46.129> to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
one and they see ever been starting to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.369 
one and they see ever been starting to
come<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.489> as<00:03:46.609> well<00:03:46.760> there<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:48.169> problem

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
come in as well there and the problem

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.250 
come in as well there and the problem
I've<00:03:48.680> noticed<00:03:49.099> with<00:03:49.159> this<00:03:49.729> blitz<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.389> is<00:03:50.540> it's

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
I've noticed with this blitz is is it's

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.020 
I've noticed with this blitz is is it's
just<00:03:51.349> like<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:51.799> can't<00:03:52.099> get<00:03:52.280> my<00:03:52.430> guy<00:03:52.639> to<00:03:52.699> come

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
just like I can't get my guy to come

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.219 
just like I can't get my guy to come
through<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.329> B<00:03:53.479> gap<00:03:53.690> because<00:03:53.989> of<00:03:54.109> his

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:54.229 
through the B gap because of his

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.409 
through the B gap because of his
blitzing<00:03:54.739> go<00:03:54.859> so<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.069> could<00:03:55.310> maybe<00:03:55.549> try<00:03:55.790> free

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
blitzing go so I could maybe try free

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.119 
blitzing go so I could maybe try free
blitzing<00:03:56.810> just<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.169> linebacker<00:03:57.709> or

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
blitzing just the linebacker or

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.469 
blitzing just the linebacker or
something<00:03:58.519> different<00:03:58.819> things<00:03:59.000> you<00:03:59.239> want<00:03:59.419> to

00:03:59.469 --> 00:03:59.479 
something different things you want to

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.780 
something different things you want to
do<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.870> find<00:04:00.049> your<00:04:00.260> boots<00:04:00.440> but<00:04:00.709> overall<00:04:01.519> this

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
do to find your boots but overall this

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.399 
do to find your boots but overall this
is<00:04:01.849> what<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.120> came<00:04:02.209> up<00:04:02.389> with<00:04:02.540> works<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.019> best<00:04:03.199> I

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
is what I came up with works the best I

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.390 
is what I came up with works the best I
would<00:04:03.669> do<00:04:05.109> just<00:04:06.109> spread<00:04:06.680> your<00:04:06.859> line<00:04:06.979> and<00:04:07.010> crash

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
would do just spread your line and crash

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.670 
would do just spread your line and crash
the<00:04:07.430> line<00:04:07.819> to<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.060> right<00:04:08.329> side<00:04:08.599> that<00:04:09.439> works

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
the line to the right side that works

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.369 
the line to the right side that works
best<00:04:09.949> for<00:04:10.220> me<00:04:10.329> another<00:04:11.329> setup<00:04:11.810> that<00:04:12.049> I<00:04:12.079> really

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
best for me another setup that I really

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.069 
best for me another setup that I really
like<00:04:12.560> out<00:04:12.769> of<00:04:12.859> this<00:04:12.979> is<00:04:13.220> just<00:04:13.519> to<00:04:13.729> maybe<00:04:14.629> spread

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
like out of this is just to maybe spread

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.110 
like out of this is just to maybe spread
the<00:04:15.229> line<00:04:15.439> and<00:04:15.709> contain<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.609> defensive

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
the line and contain that defensive

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.110 
the line and contain that defensive
tackle<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:18.370> sometimes<00:04:19.370> that<00:04:19.699> works<00:04:19.849> a<00:04:20.060> little

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
tackle and sometimes that works a little

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.290 
tackle and sometimes that works a little
bit<00:04:20.299> better<00:04:20.449> than<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.959> just<00:04:21.199> saw<00:04:21.409> but<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:23.150> way

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
bit better than you just saw but the way

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.330 
bit better than you just saw but the way
blessing<00:04:23.750> works<00:04:23.900> in<00:04:24.080> madden<00:04:24.259> 25<00:04:24.500> is<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.039> can't

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
blessing works in madden 25 is you can't

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.950 
blessing works in madden 25 is you can't
quite<00:04:25.610> predict<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.210> hundred<00:04:26.419> percent<00:04:26.599> you

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
quite predict it a hundred percent you

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.320 
quite predict it a hundred percent you
just<00:04:27.139> have<00:04:27.259> to<00:04:27.380> kind<00:04:27.560> of<00:04:27.620> use<00:04:27.860> your<00:04:28.009> knowledge

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
just have to kind of use your knowledge

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.080 
just have to kind of use your knowledge
of<00:04:29.409> what<00:04:30.409> normally<00:04:31.039> works<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.639> help<00:04:31.669> you<00:04:31.970> out

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
of what normally works to help you out

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.250 
of what normally works to help you out
as<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.330> see<00:04:32.510> that's<00:04:32.750> probably<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.169> most

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
as you see that's probably the most

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.830 
as you see that's probably the most
consistent<00:04:33.620> is<00:04:34.099> to<00:04:34.669> just<00:04:34.849> slant<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.450> line<00:04:35.630> to

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
consistent is to just slant the line to

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.760 
consistent is to just slant the line to
the<00:04:35.990> right

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
the right

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.440

like<00:05:19.050> a<00:05:19.080> fly<00:05:19.380> zone<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.040> that<00:05:20.970> does<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:21.180> really

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
like a fly zone and that does a really

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.850 
like a fly zone and that does a really
good<00:05:21.600> job<00:05:21.660> it<00:05:22.020> also<00:05:22.260> does<00:05:22.410> a<00:05:22.440> really<00:05:22.650> good<00:05:22.800> job

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
good job it also does a really good job

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.860 
good job it also does a really good job
for<00:05:23.220> left<00:05:24.030> side<00:05:24.180> run<00:05:24.360> offense<00:05:24.600> but<00:05:24.780> the

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
for left side run offense but the

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.720 
for left side run offense but the
problem<00:05:25.230> with<00:05:25.320> it<00:05:25.500> again<00:05:25.770> is<00:05:25.980> as<00:05:26.460> we<00:05:26.610> were

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
problem with it again is as we were

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.870 
problem with it again is as we were
saying<00:05:26.970> before<00:05:27.950> there's<00:05:28.950> one<00:05:29.340> thing<00:05:29.610> missing

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
from this and so we're going to have to

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.600 
from this and so we're going to have to
go<00:05:31.650> ahead<00:05:31.710> and<00:05:31.920> change<00:05:32.040> those<00:05:32.250> boots<00:05:32.490> size

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
we're gonna have to crash the line to

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.900 
we're gonna have to crash the line to
the<00:05:34.080> right<00:05:34.260> before<00:05:34.500> we<00:05:34.770> do<00:05:34.890> this<00:05:35.040> and<00:05:35.280> now<00:05:35.850> you

loops<00:05:37.980> around<00:05:38.130> like<00:05:38.520> that<00:05:38.730> that's<00:05:39.090> perfectly

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
loops around like that that's perfectly

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.260 
loops around like that that's perfectly
executed<00:05:40.350> exactly<00:05:41.100> how<00:05:41.610> we<00:05:41.670> wanted<00:05:41.970> to<00:05:42.030> play

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270

executed exactly how we wanted to play
out<00:05:42.450> and<00:05:42.720> it's<00:05:43.110> easier<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:44.910> do<00:05:45.060> than<00:05:45.210> some<00:05:45.420> of

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
out and it's easier to do than some of

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.820 
out and it's easier to do than some of
the<00:05:45.600> other<00:05:45.750> blitz<00:05:46.020> as<00:05:46.170> we've<00:05:46.290> talked<00:05:46.530> about<00:05:46.650> in

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
the other blitz as we've talked about in

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.680 
the other blitz as we've talked about in
the<00:05:46.860> past<00:05:47.070> and<00:05:47.370> you<00:05:47.790> see<00:05:47.970> urban<00:05:48.300> just<00:05:48.480> puts

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
the past and you see urban just puts

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.670 
the past and you see urban just puts
that<00:05:48.810> pressure<00:05:48.870> on<00:05:49.260> it<00:05:49.380> makes<00:05:49.530> the

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
that pressure on it makes the

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.470 
that pressure on it makes the
quarterback<00:05:50.070> feel<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.340> pressure<00:05:50.550> okay<00:05:51.240> guys

so I know it took a long time to get to

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.770 
so I know it took a long time to get to
the<00:05:53.370> main<00:05:53.670> point<00:05:53.970> of<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.090> video<00:05:54.300> I<00:05:54.360> wanted<00:05:54.690> to
