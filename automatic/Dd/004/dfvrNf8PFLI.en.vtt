faster<00:00:56.250> mix-up<00:00:56.969> do<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> heavies<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
faster mix-up do a heavies you can do a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.520 
faster mix-up do a heavies you can do a
figure<00:00:59.309> eight<00:00:59.460> which<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.850> very<00:01:00.180> effective

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
figure eight which is very effective

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.950 
figure eight which is very effective
because<00:01:01.530> when<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> figure<00:01:02.430> eight

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
because when you do a figure eight

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.420 
because when you do a figure eight
instead<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.140> doing<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.589> traditional<00:01:05.070> circle

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
instead of doing all traditional circle

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.910 
instead of doing all traditional circle
jerk<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.260> am<00:01:07.260> right<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
jerk like you know am right here and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.260 
jerk like you know am right here and
you're<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> stance<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you're right there that the stance in a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.330 
you're right there that the stance in a
circle<00:01:09.710> video<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.700> gives<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> enemy<00:01:13.340> more

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
circle video it gives the enemy more

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
circle video it gives the enemy more
time<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.880> aim<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:16.500> you're

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
time to aim and it's because you're

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
time to aim and it's because you're
moving<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.130> predictable<00:01:17.580> pattern<00:01:17.869> you

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
moving in a predictable pattern you

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
moving in a predictable pattern you
don't<00:01:18.900> want<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:20.220> want<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.460> move

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
don't want to do that you want to move

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.730 
don't want to do that you want to move
in<00:01:20.759> are<00:01:20.880> unpredictable<00:01:21.210> pattern<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.590> this

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
in are unpredictable pattern and this

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
in are unpredictable pattern and this
works<00:01:22.950> great<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.640> got<00:01:23.729> jump<00:01:24.000> test<00:01:24.180> oh<00:01:24.360> my

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
works great if you got jump test oh my

shoot and on it all over again now this
is<00:02:20.370> wide<00:02:20.610> open<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.630> one<00:02:21.870> let's<00:02:22.770> start

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
is wide open so this one let's start

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.500 
is wide open so this one let's start
making<00:02:23.040> example<00:02:23.610> now<00:02:23.790> if<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.940> have<00:02:24.060> buildings

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
making example now if you have buildings

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.740 
making example now if you have buildings
Oh<00:02:24.720> use<00:02:25.230> them<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.740> around<00:02:26.070> them<00:02:26.420> run<00:02:27.420> if

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
Oh use them you go around them run if

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.680 
Oh use them you go around them run if
you<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.590> cool<00:02:28.800> off<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.250> mean<00:02:29.550> jump<00:02:30.210> many

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
you have to to cool off I mean jump many

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.230 
you have to to cool off I mean jump many
things<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.050> can<00:02:31.200> do<00:02:31.610> another<00:02:32.610> example<00:02:33.210> of

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
things you can do another example of

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.480 
things you can do another example of
movement<00:02:34.020> tip<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:35.000> gonna<00:02:37.100> uphill<00:02:38.100> right<00:02:38.340> here

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
movement tip is gonna uphill right here

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.210 
movement tip is gonna uphill right here
they<00:02:38.610> can<00:02:38.790> go<00:02:38.910> now<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.780> got<00:02:40.050> I'm<00:02:40.980> next

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
they can go now you got I'm next

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.590 
they can go now you got I'm next
somewhere<00:02:41.550> around<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.239> water<00:02:42.480> is

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
somewhere around here the water is

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.140 
somewhere around here the water is
trying<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.930> shoot<00:02:43.020> at<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.700> use<00:02:45.000> this

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
trying to shoot at you you can use this

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.850 
trying to shoot at you you can use this
elevation<00:02:45.690> difference<00:02:46.140> as<00:02:46.260> your<00:02:46.380> advantage

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
elevation difference as your advantage

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.460 
elevation difference as your advantage
because<00:02:47.340> not<00:02:48.120> only<00:02:48.150> when<00:02:49.110> you're<00:02:49.230> climbing

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
because not only when you're climbing

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.949 
because not only when you're climbing
not<00:02:50.010> only<00:02:50.130> you're<00:02:50.370> moving<00:02:51.330> sideways<00:02:51.720> but

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
not only you're moving sideways but

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.020 
not only you're moving sideways but
you're<00:02:52.080> also<00:02:52.200> moving<00:02:52.500> vertically<00:02:53.040> now<00:02:53.880> it's

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
you're also moving vertically now it's

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.660 
you're also moving vertically now it's
also<00:02:54.420> same<00:02:54.720> thing<00:02:54.930> if<00:02:55.110> you're<00:02:55.260> coming<00:02:55.500> down

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
also same thing if you're coming down

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.120 
also same thing if you're coming down
what<00:02:56.670> they'll<00:02:56.820> do<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.180> would<00:02:57.330> make<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:58.130> shots

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
what they'll do is would make the shots

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.890 
what they'll do is would make the shots
lot<00:02:59.370> harder<00:02:59.610> for<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.940> enemies<00:03:00.239> because<00:03:00.420> now

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
lot harder for the enemies because now

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.810 
lot harder for the enemies because now
they<00:03:01.110> might<00:03:01.320> hit<00:03:02.010> your<00:03:02.160> leg<00:03:02.370> as<00:03:02.520> you're<00:03:02.670> going

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
they might hit your leg as you're going

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.479 
they might hit your leg as you're going
up<00:03:03.060> because<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.200> AC<00:03:04.350> 20s<00:03:04.800> little<00:03:05.130> bit<00:03:05.220> slow

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
up because it's AC 20s little bit slow

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.370 
up because it's AC 20s little bit slow
and<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:06.300> might<00:03:06.510> hit<00:03:06.630> your<00:03:06.780> leg<00:03:06.930> instead<00:03:07.140> your

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
and just might hit your leg instead your

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.070 
and just might hit your leg instead your
serrator<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:08.940> use<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:10.050> your

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
serrator so you can use that to your

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.610 
serrator so you can use that to your
advantage<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:12.239> take<00:03:12.420> damage<00:03:13.290> all

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
advantage so that you take damage all

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.100 
advantage so that you take damage all
runs<00:03:13.890> your<00:03:14.100> Mecca<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.670> spread<00:03:15.630> them<00:03:15.900> it's
