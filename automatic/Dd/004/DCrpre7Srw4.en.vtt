00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.699
 The role play also does not annoy Divinity 2 Flames of Vengeance 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.920
 the humor that we already know from the main game, they are right 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.980
 that's when early, when their alter ego the Dragon Knight remembered 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.130
 in the capital of Ravel on shows up 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.059
 for the galleries do not shy away from even the famous 2 2 scores when 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.239
 to operate the Terminator and in a permanent wink against 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:37.850
 throw 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.100
 we think it's great that could happen that could only happen that that 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.379
 Main game Divinity 2 1 o'clock 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.300
 Let's wait and see the unsatisfactory ending had the answer to Augustus question 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.120
 quite simple 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.250
 or that percent unsatisfactory end of iGo Draguhn is money the other 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.730
 not at least not in shape and the form looks like this 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.190
 are no longer a dragon Sulser 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.590
 Past around after the Hessin besieged by flying fortresses 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.790
 is pitched everywhere without clever armor and without clever 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.150
 The man or woman should first buy weapons 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.020
 45,000 gold pieces have been given to him by the developers 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.390
 already start something 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.090
 m if you keep it as in the main game and do not give up mind reading 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.390
 to learn secrets or just the prices at the numerous dealers 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.710
 to press Ska the crib Rheine AFP 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.850
 and then it can start already. The main task is the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.520
 cursed magician Berlin in the catacombs deep among others 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.499
 ferret out 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.399
 the means to kill the flying fortresses at the end of the year 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.729
 have heard correctly Berlin is looking forward to then you can do that 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.729
 also on the top hits 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.500
 the mechanisms are the same in Flames of Vengeance as they were in the past 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.619
 Main game only that the whole does not give up the dragon all the time 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:04.929
 To send a figure 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.909
 only towards the end are you flying the majority of the game they are on or 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.380
 under the streets or in the houses of Arno Trossingen 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.200
 and heating 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.900
 Moorrege and Heist quite tricky quest a brand 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.580
 but to solve my gray cells May be with Klopperei on through times 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.110
 the combination of useful info and chatty I have something interesting 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.110
 read and when we say that much 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.609
 if you want to get rid of me you have to try that for yourself 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.859
 my diary 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.909
 but that was not serious meant a fantasy 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.489
 I knew you did not see 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.979
 we would finish the speech 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.999
 it does not mean anything further for eu promotion 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.590
 that's the most important thing while i'm around this sneaky school of 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.459
 Crime 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.769
 has not all areas of work can be operated the same but 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.370
 you have to be unlocked, so to speak 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.559
 Here, for example, a huge tree blocks access to so-called doom 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:03.379
 in which it presented and offered only stuff so mathematically a child 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.510
 Today in Frankfurt we will be the final destination for the invaders 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.590
 make up for it 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.890
 only if they manage to milk each other's vegetables 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.309
 they are allowed to decorate 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:14.249
 kick back 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.799
 No one has to look at this tree anymore, but he is with him 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.210
 to deal with minor injuries 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.480
 had about with this 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.929
 Avoc speaking tomato My name is to Mars 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:28.379
 and I was turned into a tomato by a sorceress at the zoo 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.539
 Basically, in the first hours of Flames of Vengeance Gastein 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.409
 They may seldom be knock-out, instead they will be a lot 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.390
 entertaining and very well running conversations 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.590
 but no worry 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.709
 Even fighters come Alonso Divinity 2 ego Draconis fully on their 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.000
 Cost at the latest when they have passed the tree the ten a natural and
