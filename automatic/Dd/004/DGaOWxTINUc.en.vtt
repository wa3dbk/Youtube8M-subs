reason<00:01:43.619> he<00:01:43.679> goes<00:01:43.830> for<00:01:44.009> natural<00:01:44.369> gift<00:01:44.580> I<00:01:44.729> was

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
reason he goes for natural gift I was

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.100 
reason he goes for natural gift I was
pretty<00:01:45.030> surprised<00:01:45.420> though<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:45.929> just

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
pretty surprised though it's really just

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.589 
pretty surprised though it's really just
expecting<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.679> double<00:01:47.009> hit<00:01:47.190> or<00:01:47.340> something

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:47.599 
expecting like double hit or something

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:51.109 
expecting like double hit or something
but<00:01:48.599> it<00:01:49.080> it's<00:01:49.800> not<00:01:50.039> very<00:01:50.310> effective<00:01:50.849> I<00:01:50.970> don't

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
but it it's not very effective I don't

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.490 
but it it's not very effective I don't
really<00:01:51.239> know<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.569> berry<00:01:51.780> he<00:01:52.020> was<00:01:52.140> using<00:01:52.319> for

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
really know what berry he was using for

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.320 
really know what berry he was using for
that

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.930 
that
so<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.290> go<00:01:54.590> for<00:01:54.740> Dragon<00:01:54.890> Claw<00:01:55.190> do<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.460> little<00:01:55.820> bit

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
so I go for Dragon Claw do a little bit

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.300 
so I go for Dragon Claw do a little bit
below<00:01:56.420> half<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.230> that<00:01:57.380> sort<00:01:57.680> of<00:01:57.740> sucked<00:01:58.040> you

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
below half so that sort of sucked you

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.340 
below half so that sort of sucked you
know<00:01:58.400> because<00:01:58.670> even<00:01:58.700> amber<00:01:59.600> plum<00:01:59.900> has<00:02:00.050> pretty

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
know because even amber plum has pretty

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.700 
know because even amber plum has pretty
bad<00:02:00.560> defenses<00:02:01.870> so<00:02:02.870> it<00:02:02.990> kind<00:02:03.140> of<00:02:03.200> sucked<00:02:03.440> that<00:02:03.590> I

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
bad defenses so it kind of sucked that I

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.190 
bad defenses so it kind of sucked that I
wasn't<00:02:04.070> even<00:02:04.310> able<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.730> do<00:02:04.910> half<00:02:05.270> he<00:02:05.810> goes<00:02:05.990> for

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
wasn't even able to do half he goes for

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.030 
wasn't even able to do half he goes for
fling<00:02:06.440> and<00:02:06.770> he<00:02:07.190> didn't<00:02:07.610> have<00:02:08.030> an<00:02:08.240> item<00:02:08.650> so<00:02:09.650> that

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
fling and he didn't have an item so that

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.990 
fling and he didn't have an item so that
was<00:02:10.250> pretty<00:02:10.940> retarded<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.810> him<00:02:11.960> to<00:02:12.110> do<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:13.000> so

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
was pretty retarded of him to do that so

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.840 
was pretty retarded of him to do that so
I<00:02:14.330> said<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.110> sandstorm<00:02:15.680> they<00:02:16.040> take<00:02:16.280> they<00:02:16.610> both

be<00:02:41.670> worth<00:02:41.910> my<00:02:42.150> time<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> upload<00:02:42.900> them<00:02:43.140> so

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
be worth my time to upload them so

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.660 
be worth my time to upload them so
anyway<00:02:45.000> he<00:02:45.690> swaps<00:02:45.930> out<00:02:46.080> ample<00:02:46.470> pom<00:02:46.650> for<00:02:47.040> anita

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
anyway he swaps out ample pom for anita

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.090 
anyway he swaps out ample pom for anita
queen<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.300> then<00:02:48.900> he<00:02:49.050> also<00:02:49.290> swaps<00:02:49.770> out<00:02:49.920> his

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
queen and then he also swaps out his

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.030 
queen and then he also swaps out his
Snorlax<00:02:50.700> for<00:02:50.940> his<00:02:51.060> Nidoking<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.050> he<00:02:52.830> was

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
Snorlax for his Nidoking and he was

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.220 
Snorlax for his Nidoking and he was
obviously<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.910> don't<00:02:54.450> know<00:02:54.600> really<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.960> don't

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
obviously I don't know really I don't

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.440 
obviously I don't know really I don't
really<00:02:55.380> know<00:02:55.560> why<00:02:55.740> he<00:02:56.030> did<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.210> he<00:02:57.360> was

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
really know why he did that he was

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.150 
really know why he did that he was
probably<00:02:57.630> just<00:02:57.810> trying<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.140> evade<00:02:58.440> sandstorm

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
probably just trying to evade sandstorm

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.460 
probably just trying to evade sandstorm
damage<00:02:59.550> which<00:03:00.210> really<00:03:00.450> was<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> pretty<00:03:01.170> stupid

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
damage which really was a pretty stupid

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.390 
damage which really was a pretty stupid
move<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.540> go<00:03:03.690> for<00:03:03.840> protect<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.500> then<00:03:05.220> I

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
move so I go for protect and then I

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.090 
move so I go for protect and then I
earthquake<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.240> then<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.140> protect<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.710> and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
earthquake and then I protect it and

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.410 
earthquake and then I protect it and
come<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.120> protected<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.900> then<00:03:11.420> earthquake

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
come on protected and then earthquake

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
come on protected and then earthquake
kaboom

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
kaboom

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.730 
kaboom
does<00:03:14.370> over<00:03:14.700> half<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.390> both<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.990> them<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.380> that's

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
does over half to both of them so that's

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.040 
does over half to both of them so that's
freaking<00:03:17.190> awesome<00:03:17.370> no<00:03:18.000> sandstorm<00:03:18.420> damage<00:03:18.900> to

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
freaking awesome no sandstorm damage to

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.600 
freaking awesome no sandstorm damage to
anybody

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
anybody

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.550 
anybody
and<00:03:20.970> one<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.690> main<00:03:21.870> reasons<00:03:22.260> why<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.470> have

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
and one of the main reasons why I have

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.680 
and one of the main reasons why I have
sandstorm<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.640> all<00:03:23.760> my<00:03:23.910> Giblin<00:03:24.270> for<00:03:24.420> my<00:03:24.540> cable

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
sandstorm for all my Giblin for my cable

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.380 
sandstorm for all my Giblin for my cable
team<00:03:24.990> it's<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:25.740> because<00:03:26.190> his<00:03:26.700> ability<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:27.360> a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
team it's just because his ability is a

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.290 
team it's just because his ability is a
sand<00:03:27.960> veil<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.560> that'll<00:03:29.460> boost<00:03:29.610> my<00:03:29.850> accurate

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
sand veil and that'll boost my accurate

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.810 
sand veil and that'll boost my accurate
not<00:03:30.810> my<00:03:30.930> accuracy<00:03:31.260> my<00:03:31.680> evasive<00:03:32.130> miss<00:03:32.550> and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
not my accuracy my evasive miss and

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.960 
not my accuracy my evasive miss and
sandstorms<00:03:34.520> so<00:03:35.520> I<00:03:35.580> go<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:35.820> another

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
sandstorms so I go for another

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.640 
sandstorms so I go for another
earthquake<00:03:36.210> without<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.780> protect<00:03:37.230> cuz<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.590> don't

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
earthquake without a protect cuz I don't

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.800 
earthquake without a protect cuz I don't
want<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.100> fail<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.790> check<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.600> out<00:03:39.780> I

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
want it to fail and check this out I

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.260 
want it to fail and check this out I
just<00:03:40.080> out<00:03:40.230> sped<00:03:40.770> an<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.280> Oh<00:03:41.310> king<00:03:41.640> in<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.060> NATO

clean with a gibble and I don't kill my
own<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:46.820> don't<00:03:47.820> kill<00:03:48.270> my<00:03:48.480> own<00:03:48.630> gibble<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:49.490> I

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
own I don't kill my own gibble and I

Nidoking<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.150> was<00:03:54.270> really<00:03:54.540> freaking

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
Nidoking so that was really freaking

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.990 
Nidoking so that was really freaking

awesome

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.600 
awesome
so<00:03:57.320> Ghibli<00:03:58.320> uses<00:03:58.590> dragon<00:03:58.920> pulse<00:03:59.100> because<00:03:59.490> it

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
so Ghibli uses dragon pulse because it

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.830 
so Ghibli uses dragon pulse because it
wasn't<00:03:59.880> really<00:04:00.060> anything<00:04:00.150> else<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.630> could<00:04:00.690> have

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
wasn't really anything else I could have

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.080 
wasn't really anything else I could have
done<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.340> missed<00:04:02.340> because<00:04:02.550> there's<00:04:02.820> no<00:04:02.940> one

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
done I missed because there's no one

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.300 
done I missed because there's no one
there<00:04:03.270> to<00:04:03.420> kill<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.900> then<00:04:04.770> they<00:04:04.950> send<00:04:05.190> out

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
there to kill and then they send out

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.420 
there to kill and then they send out
Snorlax<00:04:05.880> again<00:04:06.240> and<00:04:06.800> outcomes<00:04:07.800> and<00:04:08.130> Bapaume

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
Snorlax again and outcomes and Bapaume

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.940 
Snorlax again and outcomes and Bapaume
again

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
again

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.970 
again
so<00:04:10.640> now<00:04:11.150> it's<00:04:11.599> just<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.959> process<00:04:12.170> of<00:04:12.620> killing

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
so now it's just the process of killing

nothing<00:05:01.550> he<00:05:02.120> goes<00:05:02.300> for<00:05:02.510> earthquake

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
nothing he goes for earthquake

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.189 
nothing he goes for earthquake
and<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:04.800> protected<00:05:05.280> myself<00:05:05.569> the<00:05:06.569> earthquakes

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
and I protected myself the earthquakes

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.340 
and I protected myself the earthquakes
and<00:05:07.610> then<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:09.210> doesn't<00:05:09.630> even<00:05:09.720> kill<00:05:10.020> my<00:05:10.169> kibble

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
and then it doesn't even kill my kibble

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.219 
and then it doesn't even kill my kibble
so<00:05:10.979> that<00:05:11.130> was<00:05:11.250> really<00:05:11.460> pathetic<00:05:11.669> I<00:05:12.240> mean<00:05:13.080> from

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.420 
a Snorlax I really expected it to kill
him<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.630> then<00:05:15.930> one<00:05:16.530> funny<00:05:16.830> thing<00:05:16.919> I'm<00:05:17.160> just

this he would have killed his own guy
with<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:21.630> earthquake<00:05:22.639> so<00:05:23.639> it's<00:05:24.000> it's<00:05:24.690> nice

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
with the earthquake so it's it's nice

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.920 
with the earthquake so it's it's nice
it's<00:05:26.490> good<00:05:26.759> to<00:05:26.910> know<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.180> hidden<00:05:27.330> effects<00:05:27.750> of

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
it's good to know the hidden effects of

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.070 
it's good to know the hidden effects of
moves<00:05:28.199> seriously<00:05:29.099> because<00:05:29.849> he<00:05:30.840> would<00:05:30.990> have

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
moves seriously because he would have

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.570 
moves seriously because he would have
killed<00:05:31.229> his<00:05:31.410> own<00:05:31.530> guy<00:05:31.770> with<00:05:31.979> that<00:05:32.130> earthquake

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
killed his own guy with that earthquake

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.320 
killed his own guy with that earthquake
had<00:05:33.150> I<00:05:33.180> not<00:05:33.509> done<00:05:33.780> it<00:05:33.930> first<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.970> I<00:05:36.000> go<00:05:36.180> for

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
had I not done it first so I go for

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.620 
had I not done it first so I go for
Dragon<00:05:36.509> Claw<00:05:36.810> and<00:05:37.169> Dragon<00:05:37.770> pulse<00:05:38.009> and<00:05:38.490> then<00:05:39.449> on

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
Dragon Claw and Dragon pulse and then on

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.020 
Dragon Claw and Dragon pulse and then on
this<00:05:39.780> turn<00:05:39.990> he<00:05:40.139> just<00:05:40.349> gives<00:05:40.530> in<00:05:40.800> which<00:05:41.759> is<00:05:42.000> a

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
this turn he just gives in which is a

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.060 
this turn he just gives in which is a
little<00:05:42.479> bit<00:05:42.570> weird<00:05:42.870> I<00:05:43.110> think<00:05:43.320> he<00:05:43.440> could<00:05:43.620> I<00:05:43.889> mean

little bit weird I think he could I mean
maybe<00:05:44.759> he<00:05:44.940> just<00:05:45.180> did<00:05:45.300> it<00:05:45.330> because<00:05:45.690> he<00:05:45.870> didn't

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
maybe he just did it because he didn't

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.080 
maybe he just did it because he didn't
have<00:05:46.289> any<00:05:46.349> leftovers<00:05:47.070> and<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:47.610> sandstorm
