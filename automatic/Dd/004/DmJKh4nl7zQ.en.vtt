struggled<00:00:16.119> with<00:00:16.570> color<00:00:17.140> casts<00:00:17.500> in<00:00:17.590> an<00:00:17.710> image

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
struggled with color casts in an image

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.980 
struggled with color casts in an image
and<00:00:18.310> in<00:00:18.700> this<00:00:18.820> particular<00:00:19.030> image<00:00:19.510> is<00:00:19.690> a<00:00:19.720> blue

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
and in this particular image is a blue

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.810 
and in this particular image is a blue
color<00:00:20.170> cast<00:00:20.500> we<00:00:21.010> want<00:00:21.250> to<00:00:21.310> get<00:00:21.430> rid<00:00:21.550> of<00:00:21.670> that

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
color cast we want to get rid of that

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.610 
color cast we want to get rid of that
but<00:00:22.270> you've<00:00:22.390> never<00:00:22.540> been<00:00:22.780> able<00:00:22.900> to<00:00:23.050> find<00:00:23.320> the

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
but you've never been able to find the

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.640 
but you've never been able to find the
accurate<00:00:24.460> midpoint<00:00:25.270> in<00:00:25.450> order<00:00:25.870> to<00:00:25.990> adjust<00:00:26.440> the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
accurate midpoint in order to adjust the

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.590 
accurate midpoint in order to adjust the
curves<00:00:26.950> let<00:00:27.610> me<00:00:27.700> show<00:00:27.850> you<00:00:27.910> in<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.150> few<00:00:28.390> simple

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
curves let me show you in a few simple

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.780 
curves let me show you in a few simple
steps<00:00:28.750> that<00:00:29.080> you<00:00:29.200> can<00:00:29.410> do<00:00:29.620> that<00:00:29.830> find<00:00:30.640> the

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
steps that you can do that find the

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.549 
steps that you can do that find the
midpoint<00:00:30.970> remove<00:00:31.600> the<00:00:31.720> color<00:00:31.930> cast<00:00:32.200> and<00:00:32.469> get

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
midpoint remove the color cast and get

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.470 
midpoint remove the color cast and get
happy<00:00:32.859> with<00:00:32.980> your<00:00:33.190> image<00:00:33.399> let's<00:00:33.940> start<00:00:34.269> that

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
happy with your image let's start that

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:45.250 
happy with your image let's start that
and<00:00:34.780> we'll<00:00:35.050> do<00:00:35.199> that<00:00:35.350> right<00:00:35.679> away

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.810 

all<00:00:46.260> right<00:00:46.410> welcome<00:00:46.590> back<00:00:46.740> okay<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.520> image

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
all right welcome back okay your image

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.430 
all right welcome back okay your image
is<00:00:47.970> obviously<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.540> to<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.750> different<00:00:48.840> but

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
is obviously going to be different but

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.290 
is obviously going to be different but
the<00:00:49.740> technique<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.280> applies<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.000> may<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the technique so applies you may have a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.270 
the technique so applies you may have a
different<00:00:51.690> color<00:00:51.720> cast<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.440> doesn't<00:00:52.890> matter

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
different color cast it doesn't matter

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.130 
different color cast it doesn't matter
obviously<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> best<00:00:54.060> way<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.330> remove<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.930> color

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
obviously the best way to remove a color

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.810 
obviously the best way to remove a color
cast<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.740> shoot<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> grey<00:00:56.310> card<00:00:56.610> but

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
cast is to shoot with a grey card but

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.250 
cast is to shoot with a grey card but
when<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.180> don't<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.540> gray<00:00:57.720> card<00:00:58.020> or<00:00:58.170> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
when you don't have a gray card or you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.590 
when you don't have a gray card or you
can't<00:00:58.530> shoot<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:58.950> one<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.450> be

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
can't shoot with one this is going to be

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.410 
can't shoot with one this is going to be
a<00:01:00.630> better<00:01:01.050> way<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.470> doing<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.040> post<00:01:02.420> alright

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
a better way of doing it in post alright

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.240 
a better way of doing it in post alright
so<00:01:03.600> let's<00:01:03.810> start<00:01:03.900> off<00:01:04.170> by<00:01:04.440> creating<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:05.010> blank

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
so let's start off by creating a blank

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.520 
so let's start off by creating a blank
layer<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.760> want<00:01:05.940> to<00:01:06.180> go<00:01:06.300> down<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:06.870> the<00:01:07.020> new

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
layer we want to go down here to the new

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.740 
layer we want to go down here to the new
layer<00:01:07.740> icon<00:01:07.979> click<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.940> once<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
layer icon click that once and that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.330 
layer icon click that once and that
creates<00:01:10.050> a<00:01:10.170> blank<00:01:10.380> layer<00:01:10.590> we're<00:01:10.830> looking<00:01:11.130> for

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
creates a blank layer we're looking for

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.130 
creates a blank layer we're looking for
we<00:01:11.880> essentially<00:01:12.240> want<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.600> fill<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.960> with

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
we essentially want to fill this with

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.310 
we essentially want to fill this with
complete<00:01:13.620> gray<00:01:14.570> 50%<00:01:15.570> black<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:17.030> 128

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
complete gray 50% black and that's 128

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.950 
complete gray 50% black and that's 128
value<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.700> red<00:01:20.700> green<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.119> blue<00:01:21.270> which<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
value of red green and blue which is the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.010 
value of red green and blue which is the
midpoint<00:01:22.410> between<00:01:22.470> 0<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:24.060> darkest<00:01:24.660> point<00:01:24.869> on

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
midpoint between 0 the darkest point on

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.710 
midpoint between 0 the darkest point on
the<00:01:25.170> histogram<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.890> 255<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.240> brightest

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the histogram and 255 the brightest

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
the histogram and 255 the brightest
point<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.050> the<00:01:28.140> histogram<00:01:28.410> so<00:01:29.190> let's<00:01:29.340> go<00:01:29.430> ahead

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
point on the histogram so let's go ahead

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.560 
point on the histogram so let's go ahead
and<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.880> edit<00:01:30.860> fill<00:01:31.970> make<00:01:32.970> sure<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.390> have

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and go to edit fill make sure we have

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.040 
and go to edit fill make sure we have
50%<00:01:34.350> gray<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:35.030> normal<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.540> your<00:01:36.690> percent

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
50% gray here normal and on your percent

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.930 
50% gray here normal and on your percent
opacity<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.740> preserve<00:01:38.040> transparency<00:01:38.310> leave

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
opacity and preserve transparency leave

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.460 
opacity and preserve transparency leave
that<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> default<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.290> here

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that as a default as you see it here

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.780 
that as a default as you see it here
click<00:01:41.250> OK

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
click OK

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
click OK
that<00:01:42.420> filled<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> entire<00:01:43.170> image<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.710> grey

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that filled the entire image with grey

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.700 
that filled the entire image with grey
let's<00:01:44.940> go<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.660> blending<00:01:46.050> mode<00:01:46.229> change

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
let's go up to the blending mode change

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.420 
let's go up to the blending mode change
that<00:01:47.010> to<00:01:47.970> difference<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.590> let's<00:01:49.770> go<00:01:49.920> down<00:01:50.130> here

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
that to difference so let's go down here

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.710 
that to difference so let's go down here
again<00:01:50.550> to<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.940> adjustment<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.479> we're<00:01:51.600> going

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
again to the adjustment and we're going

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.110 
again to the adjustment and we're going
to<00:01:51.750> find<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> threshold<00:01:52.620> command<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:54.030> we

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
to find the threshold command there we

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.180 
to find the threshold command there we
go<00:01:54.270> now<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.080> want<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.440> move<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.710> little<00:01:56.040> icon

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
go now we want to move this little icon

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.310 
go now we want to move this little icon
this<00:01:56.700> pointer<00:01:57.150> all<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.540> way<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.810> left<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
this pointer all the way to the left and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.920 
this pointer all the way to the left and
while<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.460> numbers<00:01:59.970> selected<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.630> want<00:02:00.840> to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
while the numbers selected we want to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.590

dropper now we want to kind of zoom in a
little<00:03:17.740> bit<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.130> get<00:03:18.460> a<00:03:18.490> little<00:03:18.550> better

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
little bit and get a little better

closer<00:03:19.690> look<00:03:19.990> at<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:22.980> alright<00:03:23.980> go<00:03:24.130> back<00:03:24.160> to

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
closer look at that alright go back to

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.670 
closer look at that alright go back to
the<00:03:24.610> eyedropper<00:03:25.300> now<00:03:25.690> what<00:03:25.930> we<00:03:26.050> want<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.350> do<00:03:26.470> is

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
the eyedropper now what we want to do is

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.310 
the eyedropper now what we want to do is
be<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> little<00:03:27.520> bit<00:03:27.760> more<00:03:27.910> selective<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.660> we

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
be a little bit more selective and we

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.430 
be a little bit more selective and we
use<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.460> caps<00:03:31.120> lock<00:03:31.270> key<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:31.930> changes

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
use the caps lock key and that changes

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.390 
use the caps lock key and that changes
the<00:03:32.500> pointer<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:33.730> this<00:03:34.030> little<00:03:34.800> target<00:03:35.800> and<00:03:35.980> we

the pointer to this little target and we

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.300 
the pointer to this little target and we
want<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.790> find<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.210> exact<00:03:37.600> same<00:03:37.810> spot<00:03:38.310> click
