three millimeters on here we need to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
relationship I'm going to make sure this
is<00:01:22.350> construction<00:01:23.009> geometry<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.119> don't

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
is construction geometry because I don't

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.810 
is construction geometry because I don't
want<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.659> impact<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.380> design<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.189> make

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
want it to impact on the design so make

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.160 
want it to impact on the design so make
that<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.180> construction<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.689> then<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.020> add

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that for construction and then just add

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.960 
that for construction and then just add
some<00:01:28.409> simple<00:01:28.619> dimensions<00:01:34.640> now<00:01:35.640> we've<00:01:35.820> done

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
some simple dimensions now we've done

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.069 
some simple dimensions now we've done
that<00:01:36.119> I'm<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.659> trim<00:01:36.810> away<00:01:36.930> the

that I'm just going to trim away the
excess<00:01:39.259> that<00:01:40.259> leaves<00:01:40.500> us<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> nice<00:01:41.070> region

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.850 
excess that leaves us with a nice region
here<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> model<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:43.049> unfolded<00:01:43.439> from

here that the model can be unfolded from
now<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.790> finish<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.180> model<00:01:45.420> I'm<00:01:45.509> going<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
now that I finish the model I'm going to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.679 
now that I finish the model I'm going to
exit<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.350> sketch<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.210> need<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> start

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
exit out the sketch so I need to start

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.359 
exit out the sketch so I need to start

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.520 
constructing the second profile in here
in<00:01:53.970> order<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.600> I'm<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> create

in order to do that I'm going to create

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.469 
in order to do that I'm going to create
a<00:01:55.740> new<00:01:56.009> plane<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.060> offset<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
a new plane and I'm going to offset that

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.350 
a new plane and I'm going to offset that
from<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:57.960> top<00:01:58.170> plane<00:01:58.439> by<00:01:59.430> holding<00:01:59.759> ctrl<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> can

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
from my top plane by holding ctrl I can

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.190 
from my top plane by holding ctrl I can
just<00:02:00.540> drag<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> new<00:02:00.990> plane<00:02:01.229> directly<00:02:01.680> upwards

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
just drag a new plane directly upwards

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.709 
just drag a new plane directly upwards
on<00:02:04.610> this<00:02:05.610> new<00:02:05.759> plane<00:02:06.030> I'm<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.600> do<00:02:06.689> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
on this new plane I'm going to do a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.130 
on this new plane I'm going to do a
sketch<00:02:08.060> for<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.179> profile<00:02:09.599> I'm<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.020> do

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
sketch for this profile I'm going to do

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:21.190 
sketch for this profile I'm going to do
another<00:02:10.379> smaller<00:02:11.129> Center<00:02:11.730> rectangle

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.110 

again<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.500> want<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.710> put<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.010> some<00:02:23.280> sketch

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
again you want to put on some sketch

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.460 
again you want to put on some sketch
Phil<00:02:24.390> it's<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.630> these<00:02:24.810> corners<00:02:25.140> but<00:02:25.230> I'm<00:02:25.350> going

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
Phil it's on these corners but I'm going

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.020 
Phil it's on these corners but I'm going
to<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> larger<00:02:26.040> sketch<00:02:26.280> Phil<00:02:26.520> at<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.760> time

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
to do a larger sketch Phil at this time

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.580 
to do a larger sketch Phil at this time
I'm<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.540> go<00:02:27.630> for<00:02:27.810> 30<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.470> these<00:02:28.680> pens<00:02:31.250> and

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
I'm going to go for 30 on these pens and

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.440 
I'm going to go for 30 on these pens and
I'm<00:02:34.590> going<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.770> accept<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.190> change<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:36.300> now

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
I'm going to accept that change and now

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.100 
I'm going to accept that change and now
I<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.630> go<00:02:36.750> ahead

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
I can go ahead

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.990 
I can go ahead
putting<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.590> gap<00:02:37.800> again<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.760> allow<00:02:38.940> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
putting that gap again to allow the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.920 
putting that gap again to allow the
model<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.510> unfold<00:02:46.640> use<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.670> trim<00:02:47.970> tool<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:48.840> we

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
model to unfold use the trim tool so we

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.800 
model to unfold use the trim tool so we
can<00:02:49.080> just<00:02:49.200> trim<00:02:49.380> away<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.620> excess<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:51.600> once

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
can just trim away the excess and once

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.240 
can just trim away the excess and once
again<00:02:51.930> I'll<00:02:52.260> finish<00:02:52.560> with<00:02:52.770> this<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.130> can

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
again I'll finish with this so I can

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.340 
again I'll finish with this so I can
exit<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.670> sketch<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.720> we<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.050> have<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> look

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
exit the sketch and we just have a look

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.370 
exit the sketch and we just have a look
at<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:56.690> now<00:02:57.690> we've<00:02:57.900> done<00:02:58.020> all<00:02:58.230> the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
at it now we've done all the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.020 
at it now we've done all the
construction<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.310> sketches<00:02:59.550> we're<00:02:59.850> ready

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
construction of the sketches we're ready

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.730 
construction of the sketches we're ready
to<00:03:00.210> actually<00:03:00.390> insert<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.200> loft<00:03:01.380> at<00:03:01.560> Bend

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
to actually insert the loft at Bend

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.500 
to actually insert the loft at Bend
feature<00:03:02.010> you'll<00:03:02.700> find<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.270> sheetmetal

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
feature you'll find it in the sheetmetal

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.410 
feature you'll find it in the sheetmetal
toolbar<00:03:04.230> at<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.740> top<00:03:04.910> in<00:03:05.910> order<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.150> insert

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
toolbar at the top in order to insert

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.690 
toolbar at the top in order to insert
the<00:03:06.480> lofted<00:03:06.870> Bend<00:03:07.140> all<00:03:07.530> we<00:03:07.830> do<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.520> just

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
the lofted Bend all we do is we just

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.210 
the lofted Bend all we do is we just
select<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.120> different<00:03:09.420> profiles<00:03:09.870> now<00:03:10.560> unlike

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
select the different profiles now unlike

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.400 
select the different profiles now unlike
the<00:03:11.280> normal<00:03:11.790> off<00:03:12.150> feature<00:03:12.420> we<00:03:12.900> don't<00:03:13.110> have<00:03:13.290> to

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
the normal off feature we don't have to

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.290 
the normal off feature we don't have to
select<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.800> starting<00:03:14.250> point<00:03:14.460> for<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
select a starting point for this the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.180 
select a starting point for this the
starting<00:03:15.630> point<00:03:15.900> just<00:03:15.990> becomes<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.980> bend

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
starting point just becomes the bend

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.700 
starting point just becomes the bend
region<00:03:17.610> where<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.060> unfolds<00:03:18.570> from<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:19.560> do

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
region where it unfolds from we do

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.560 
region where it unfolds from we do
however<00:03:19.920> have<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.430> make<00:03:20.730> sure<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.420> these

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
however have to make sure that these

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.360 
however have to make sure that these
sketches<00:03:22.140> have<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.740> same<00:03:22.980> amount<00:03:23.310> of

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
sketches have the same amount of

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.550 
sketches have the same amount of
vertexes<00:03:24.090> just<00:03:24.660> like<00:03:24.840> with<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.110> normal<00:03:25.230> off

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
vertexes just like with the normal off

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.980 
vertexes just like with the normal off
feature<00:03:26.030> now<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.240> I've<00:03:27.300> constructed<00:03:27.600> this

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
feature now that I've constructed this

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.580

all<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.320> need<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.620> do<00:03:28.710> is<00:03:28.860> put<00:03:29.100> in<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.310> thickness

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
all I need to do is put in the thickness

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.990 
all I need to do is put in the thickness
this<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.650> particularly<00:03:32.220> off<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.460> bend<00:03:32.670> we<00:03:32.850> can

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
this is particularly off the bend we can

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.390 
this is particularly off the bend we can
put<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.270> number<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.960> bends<00:03:34.380> for<00:03:34.530> each<00:03:34.710> Bend

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
put in number of bends for each Bend

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.990 
put in number of bends for each Bend
region<00:03:35.730> or<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> maximum<00:03:36.930> deviation<00:03:37.730> each<00:03:38.730> time

region or a maximum deviation each time
the<00:03:39.120> values<00:03:39.480> above<00:03:39.780> this<00:03:39.960> deviation<00:03:40.380> another

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
the values above this deviation another

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.730 
the values above this deviation another
bend<00:03:41.460> line<00:03:41.640> will<00:03:41.820> be<00:03:41.940> inserted<00:03:42.500> I'm<00:03:43.500> going<00:03:43.650> to

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
bend line will be inserted I'm going to

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.050 
bend line will be inserted I'm going to
go<00:03:43.860> for<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.130> number<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.400> Bend<00:03:44.610> lines<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.000> I'm

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
go for a number of Bend lines and I'm

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.820 
go for a number of Bend lines and I'm
going<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.270> put<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:45.570> four<00:03:46.230> in<00:03:46.440> here<00:03:48.470> I'll<00:03:49.470> accept

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
going to put in four in here I'll accept

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.830 
going to put in four in here I'll accept
that<00:03:49.980> in<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.220> model<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:50.610> then<00:03:51.510> we<00:03:51.570> can<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.810> a

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
that in the model and then we can have a

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.540 
that in the model and then we can have a
look<00:03:51.990> at<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.140> flat<00:03:52.350> pattern

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.370 

okay<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:58.480> there's<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.780> flat<00:03:58.990> pattern<00:03:59.170> for

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
okay so there's the flat pattern for

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.380 
okay so there's the flat pattern for
this<00:03:59.470> particular<00:03:59.740> design<00:04:00.250> okay<00:04:01.030> that<00:04:01.270> gives

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
this particular design okay that gives

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.410 
this particular design okay that gives
you<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.570> good<00:04:01.720> idea<00:04:02.050> if<00:04:02.470> I<00:04:02.590> construct<00:04:02.980> it<00:04:03.420> before

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
you a good idea if I construct it before

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.640

and<00:04:20.410> again<00:04:20.620> I'm<00:04:20.770> going<00:04:20.860> to<00:04:20.920> sketch<00:04:21.160> on<00:04:21.340> this

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
and again I'm going to sketch on this

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.370 
and again I'm going to sketch on this
this<00:04:21.820> time<00:04:22.030> rather<00:04:22.300> than<00:04:22.420> sketching<00:04:22.960> out<00:04:23.110> a

this time rather than sketching out a

this time rather than sketching out a
rectangle<00:04:24.370> I'm<00:04:24.550> going<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.820> sketch<00:04:25.000> out<00:04:25.150> a

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
circle it works the same for circles we

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.610 
circle it works the same for circles we
do<00:04:33.640> have<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.910> make<00:04:34.030> sure<00:04:34.300> we<00:04:34.450> leave<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.630> gap<00:04:34.900> for

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
do have to make sure we leave a gap for

do have to make sure we leave a gap for
the<00:04:35.680> model<00:04:35.920> to<00:04:35.950> unfold<00:04:36.430> from

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.200 

now<00:04:40.770> that<00:04:41.159> I<00:04:41.310> do<00:04:41.400> need<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.639> make<00:04:41.849> sure<00:04:42.060> again

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
now that I do need to make sure again

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.749 
now that I do need to make sure again
these<00:04:43.080> sketches<00:04:43.379> have<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.159> same<00:04:44.370> amount<00:04:44.639> of

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
these sketches have the same amount of

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.119 
these sketches have the same amount of
vertices<00:04:45.150> so<00:04:45.960> in<00:04:46.319> order<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.590> do<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.860> we<00:04:46.979> need

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
vertices so in order to do that we need

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.219 
vertices so in order to do that we need
to<00:04:47.219> right-click<00:04:47.430> on<00:04:47.759> this<00:04:47.939> circle<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.449> split

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
to right-click on this circle and split

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.219 
to right-click on this circle and split
entities<00:04:49.819> that<00:04:50.819> allows<00:04:51.000> me<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.330> split<00:04:51.569> it<00:04:51.810> into

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
entities that allows me to split it into

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.980 
entities that allows me to split it into
a<00:04:52.469> number<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.919> different<00:04:53.280> items<00:04:53.430> now<00:04:53.990> normally

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
a number of different items now normally

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.529 
a number of different items now normally
when<00:04:55.139> you<00:04:55.259> do<00:04:55.469> this<00:04:55.620> you'd<00:04:55.889> probably<00:04:56.419> do<00:04:57.419> it

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
when you do this you'd probably do it

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.990 
when you do this you'd probably do it
quite<00:04:57.750> precisely<00:04:58.169> with<00:04:58.800> construction<00:04:59.699> lines

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
quite precisely with construction lines

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.760 
quite precisely with construction lines
but<00:05:00.270> just<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:00.539> show<00:05:00.689> an<00:05:00.810> example<00:05:00.930> I'm<00:05:01.740> just

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
but just to show an example I'm just

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.439 
but just to show an example I'm just
going<00:05:02.009> to<00:05:02.039> do<00:05:02.189> it<00:05:02.219> roughly<00:05:02.810> like<00:05:03.810> so<00:05:05.330> so<00:05:06.330> now

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
going to do it roughly like so so now

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.089 
going to do it roughly like so so now
we've<00:05:06.599> got<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:06.780> different<00:05:06.990> sketch<00:05:07.469> entity

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
we've got a different sketch entity

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.580 
we've got a different sketch entity
between<00:05:08.610> each<00:05:08.729> of<00:05:08.759> these<00:05:09.000> lines<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.629> a<00:05:10.199> co

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
between each of these lines and a co

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.230 
between each of these lines and a co
radial<00:05:11.129> relationship<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:11.849> keep<00:05:12.030> them<00:05:12.150> in

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
radial relationship to keep them in

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.700 
radial relationship to keep them in
place<00:05:12.560> I'm<00:05:13.560> going<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:13.740> exit<00:05:14.009> this<00:05:14.099> sketch<00:05:14.340> now

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
place I'm going to exit this sketch now

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.839 
place I'm going to exit this sketch now
so<00:05:16.710> there's<00:05:16.919> our<00:05:17.039> two<00:05:17.069> sketches<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:17.639> I've

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
so there's our two sketches that I've

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.520 
so there's our two sketches that I've
got<00:05:18.000> created<00:05:18.449> and<00:05:18.599> we<00:05:18.690> create<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:18.990> loft<00:05:19.169> to<00:05:19.319> bend

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
got created and we create a loft to bend

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.020 
got created and we create a loft to bend
before<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.860> between<00:05:20.280> these<00:05:20.520> two<00:05:22.580> you<00:05:23.580> see<00:05:23.789> the

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
before it between these two you see the

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.670 
before it between these two you see the
only<00:05:24.210> difference<00:05:24.539> here<00:05:24.629> is<00:05:24.990> that<00:05:25.409> we<00:05:25.500> don't

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
only difference here is that we don't

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.980 
only difference here is that we don't
have<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:26.430> values<00:05:26.789> for<00:05:26.940> maximum<00:05:27.300> deviation<00:05:27.479> or

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
have the values for maximum deviation or

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.649 
have the values for maximum deviation or
Bend<00:05:28.199> lines<00:05:28.440> because<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.310> top<00:05:30.120> profile<00:05:30.569> is

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
Bend lines because the top profile is

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.640 
Bend lines because the top profile is
entirely<00:05:30.990> circular<00:05:33.229> one<00:05:34.229> of<00:05:34.319> the<00:05:34.409> things<00:05:34.560> you

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
entirely circular one of the things you

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.809 
entirely circular one of the things you
aren't<00:05:34.830> able<00:05:34.949> to<00:05:35.099> do<00:05:35.250> when<00:05:35.370> you're<00:05:35.490> creating<00:05:35.669> a

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
aren't able to do when you're creating a

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:39.110 
aren't able to do when you're creating a

lofted Bend is inserting a gauge table

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.260 
lofted Bend is inserting a gauge table
to<00:05:39.689> measure<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.229> material<00:05:40.849> in<00:05:41.849> order<00:05:42.029> to<00:05:42.180> do

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
to measure the material in order to do

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.939 
to measure the material in order to do
that<00:05:42.449> we<00:05:42.779> need<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:42.930> actually<00:05:43.319> edit<00:05:43.529> the<00:05:43.770> sheet

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
that we need to actually edit the sheet

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.029 
that we need to actually edit the sheet
metal<00:05:44.129> feature<00:05:44.460> afterwards<00:05:45.919> within<00:05:46.919> the

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
metal feature afterwards within the

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:48.469 
metal feature afterwards within the
sheet<00:05:47.219> metal<00:05:47.340> feature<00:05:47.639> we<00:05:47.849> can<00:05:48.000> then<00:05:48.150> enter<00:05:48.300> a

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
sheet metal feature we can then enter a

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.420 
sheet metal feature we can then enter a
gauge<00:05:48.690> table<00:05:51.469> okay<00:05:52.469> and<00:05:52.710> we<00:05:52.949> can<00:05:53.099> put<00:05:53.310> in

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
gauge table okay and we can put in

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.619 
gauge table okay and we can put in
whatever<00:05:53.759> values<00:05:54.240> were<00:05:54.389> looking<00:05:54.659> for<00:05:56.629> so

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:57.629 
whatever values were looking for so

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:58.939 
whatever values were looking for so
hopefully<00:05:57.900> that<00:05:58.050> gives<00:05:58.080> you<00:05:58.349> a<00:05:58.379> good<00:05:58.560> idea<00:05:58.650> of

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
hopefully that gives you a good idea of

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.980 
hopefully that gives you a good idea of
some<00:05:59.129> of<00:05:59.159> the<00:05:59.279> settings<00:05:59.669> and<00:06:00.029> some<00:06:00.839> of<00:06:00.930> the

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
some of the settings and some of the

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.980 
some of the settings and some of the
things<00:06:01.169> associated<00:06:01.440> with<00:06:01.800> lofted<00:06:02.460> bends

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
things associated with lofted bends

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.790 
things associated with lofted bends
