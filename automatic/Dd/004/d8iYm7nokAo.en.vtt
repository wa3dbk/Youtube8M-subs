preference<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.630> guess<00:01:58.190> all<00:01:59.190> right<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.760> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
preference I guess all right this is the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.820 
preference I guess all right this is the
trickiest<00:02:00.240> part<00:02:00.570> here<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.470> this<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.650> not

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
trickiest part here because this is not

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.620 
trickiest part here because this is not
as<00:02:02.010> in<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.670> an<00:02:02.760> extreme<00:02:03.030> issue<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.479> not

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
as in this is an extreme issue of not

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.820 
as in this is an extreme issue of not
dying<00:02:03.870> or<00:02:04.140> losing<00:02:04.470> your<00:02:04.619> broom<00:02:06.440> because<00:02:07.440> those

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
dying or losing your broom because those

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.470 
dying or losing your broom because those
blue<00:02:08.100> fuzzies<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.670> not<00:02:08.820> make<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.119> very<00:02:09.360> easy<00:02:09.479> on

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
blue fuzzies do not make it very easy on

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.300 
blue fuzzies do not make it very easy on
now<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:12.690> want<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:14.040> try<00:02:14.220> to

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
now if you want you can you can try to

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.980 
now if you want you can you can try to
spin<00:02:14.550> jump<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.940> kill<00:02:15.150> them<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.570> middle<00:02:15.870> of

spin jump and kill them in the middle of
the<00:02:16.050> area<00:02:16.500> because<00:02:16.980> there<00:02:17.220> will<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.760> red
