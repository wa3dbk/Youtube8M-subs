00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.339
 welcome to gone in life here os 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.379
 I bring another video and this time guys for 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:15.110
 tell you about update 182 of 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.580
 our xbox 360 minecraft and good more 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.100
 well that to speak to you is for 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.870
 tell a couple of things about everything 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.940
 because these days it is being rumored already 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.280
 too much with the issue of the date of 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.680
 update and well I the truth is 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.300
 I'm very busy when the week 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.210
 last they confirmed that they already sent the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.730
 version 182 to the final test I estimated 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.980
 that would take about 10 days is to say that 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.289
 for October 12 is tomorrow 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.239
 Friday should have the 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.269
 update practically finished and 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.429
 revised with that test but I'm doubting 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.370
 a lot because because I'm doubting guys 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:52.309
 much with that test because the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.890
 update 173 which is what your test 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.199
 lasted 10 days was an update the 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.079
 truth is that very small so in 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.800
 I've actually been thinking a lot 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.239
 in which version 182 is much more 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.830
 big itself I think you have to perform 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.200
 a lot more tests and I think the 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.000
 Test period may be longer and 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.250
 why have I been thinking all this? 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.960
 by a tweet that published 4j studies yesterday 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.610
 I'll put it down here so that 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.860
 you see and what he's saying is what 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.380
 next the reason why we are not 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.470
 tweeting more news about the test 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.070
 of version 182 is because there is not yet 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.929
 news still that means what 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.470
 next what they end up saying in the 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.450
 tweet we are waiting patiently 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.630
 just like you that's what they say in that 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.360
 tweet and that leads me to think a lot 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.700
 things because today let's say that it is 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.190
 Thursday yesterday was Wednesday and if the 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.440
 Wednesday they said that the test has not yet 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.840
 there was news microsoft had not 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.369
 given any news to 4j studies that 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.049
 means that the test can not be 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.850
 finished unless they want us 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.130
 trolling or making us some kind of 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.080
 surprise so good guys cross the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.860
 fingers let's hope that tomorrow October 12 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.209
 put us now the update I'm 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.860
 I'm tired of waiting 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.170
 creative I want all those things 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.330
 You expect to see the boy if I'm going to bring you 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.190
 to the channel but the truth is that I'm 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.110
 pretty desperate to go out and for 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.880
 that I wanted to bring this video to 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.100
 comment that tweet of 4 jota studies 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.760
 that he published yesterday and to know about everything 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.950
 your opinion 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.720
 I hope you guys leave comments a 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.660
 Porra species a kind of bet 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.550
 to see who guesses the date let's wait 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.230
 let it be tomorrow but as I say nothing 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.750
 confirmed every time I'm doubting 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.510
 much more because I do not know if in the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.040
 version 173 yes they warned with days of 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.290
 advance when the test finished 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.940
 they said two or three days and it's coming 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.860
 in the update but in this version 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.200
 He has not said anything yet, I do not know what is going 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.600
 happen and I do not know if you 're finished 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.489
 or they are finishing it or the week will come out 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.330
 next I have no idea how I say 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.489
 from day 12 is let's say a term 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.830
 very broad could decide as it is worth 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.810
 out on the 20th or next week 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.310
 Friday I do not know I have no idea guys 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.530
 I hope you leave your opinions and 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.720
 Well, I just hope that you lay 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.430
