00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.260 

I'm<00:00:02.280> going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.580> show<00:00:02.790> you<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.179> use<00:00:05.270> gravity

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
I'm going to show you how to use gravity

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.220 
I'm going to show you how to use gravity
field<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.899> affect<00:00:07.230> objects<00:00:08.780> first<00:00:09.780> we'll<00:00:10.050> make

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
field to affect objects first we'll make

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:21.460 
field to affect objects first we'll make
a<00:00:10.260> plane<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:12.230> polygon<00:00:13.230> plane<00:00:14.089> stretch<00:00:15.089> node<00:00:19.609> get

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
a plane a polygon plane stretch node get

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.730 
a plane a polygon plane stretch node get
reasonably<00:00:22.470> large<00:00:22.710> size<00:00:23.480> just<00:00:24.619> give<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.710> some

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
reasonably large size just give it some

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:35.569 
reasonably large size just give it some
shading<00:00:29.330> now<00:00:30.590> make<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> sphere<00:00:34.219> now<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.280> idea

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
shading now make a sphere now the idea

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.360 
shading now make a sphere now the idea
is<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.210> sphere<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.770> bounce<00:00:37.980> off<00:00:38.340> of

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
is the sphere is going to bounce off of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.950 
is the sphere is going to bounce off of
the<00:00:38.670> plane

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.260 

so<00:00:42.890> move

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.420 

I'll<00:00:46.230> create<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.620> gravity<00:00:47.510> field<00:00:48.510> first

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:01:01.240 

and<00:00:52.000> then<00:00:52.180> connect<00:00:52.540> it<00:00:52.660> to<00:00:52.810> the<00:00:52.960> sphere

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:11.110 

next<00:01:03.220> I'll<00:01:04.220> take<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.360> plane<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:10.090> convert<00:01:11.090> it

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
next I'll take the plane and convert it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.860 
next I'll take the plane and convert it
into<00:01:11.360> a<00:01:12.040> rigid<00:01:13.040> object<00:01:13.190> because<00:01:14.030> as<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.690> can

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
into a rigid object because as you can

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.340 
into a rigid object because as you can
see<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:16.610> ball<00:01:16.850> was<00:01:17.120> affected<00:01:17.750> by<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:17.990> at<00:01:18.200> all

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
see the ball was affected by it at all

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.500 
see the ball was affected by it at all
spear<00:01:19.190> just<00:01:19.400> went<00:01:19.610> right<00:01:19.790> through<00:01:20.150> it<00:01:22.360> so<00:01:23.360> now

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
spear just went right through it so now

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.890 
spear just went right through it so now
we<00:01:23.570> turn<00:01:23.930> it<00:01:24.140> into<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.700> passive<00:01:25.700> object<00:01:26.240> because

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
we turn it into a passive object because

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.300 
we turn it into a passive object because
it's<00:01:27.080> not<00:01:27.320> going<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.560> be<00:01:27.650> affected<00:01:28.130> by<00:01:28.250> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
it's not going to be affected by the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.600 
it's not going to be affected by the
gravity<00:01:28.880> field<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:33.590> ball<00:01:33.770> bounces<00:01:34.340> with

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
gravity field and the ball bounces with

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.149 
gravity field and the ball bounces with
it

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.489 

now<00:01:39.149> we'll<00:01:39.329> change<00:01:39.600> some<00:01:39.810> properties<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.469> the

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:40.499 
now we'll change some properties on the

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:45.919 
now we'll change some properties on the
ball<00:01:41.869> make<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> little<00:01:43.319> bounce<00:01:43.499> here<00:01:44.899> will<00:01:45.899> make

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
ball make a little bounce here will make

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:52.850 
ball make a little bounce here will make
the<00:01:46.259> lock<00:01:46.439> balance<00:01:46.890> here

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.100 

still<00:01:53.610> needs<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.150> more<00:01:54.180> bounce<00:01:54.660> to<00:01:54.870> be

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
still needs to have more bounce to be

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:05.050 
still needs to have more bounce to be
entertaining

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.650 

we'll<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.240> shove<00:02:06.510> it<00:02:06.540> right<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:08.420> now<00:02:09.420> it's

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
we'll just shove it right up to now it's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.650 
we'll just shove it right up to now it's
actually<00:02:10.110> bouncing<00:02:11.100> more<00:02:11.910> there's<00:02:12.540> more

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
actually bouncing more there's more

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.720 
actually bouncing more there's more
energy<00:02:13.260> coming<00:02:13.500> off<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.980> ball<00:02:14.250> than<00:02:14.520> was

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
energy coming off of the ball than was

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.780 
energy coming off of the ball than was
initially<00:02:17.120> created<00:02:18.120> by<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.660> original<00:02:19.319> fall

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
initially created by the original fall

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.830 
initially created by the original fall
and<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.510> gone<00:02:23.240> too<00:02:24.240> bouncy<00:02:26.480> we'll<00:02:27.480> take<00:02:27.690> it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
and it's gone too bouncy we'll take it

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.880 
and it's gone too bouncy we'll take it
down<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.530> twice<00:02:29.310> root-mean-square<00:02:33.590> not<00:02:34.590> ship

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
down to twice root-mean-square not ship

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.290 
down to twice root-mean-square not ship
burger<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.459> perspective<00:02:40.550> now<00:02:41.550> she's<00:02:41.850> bouncing

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
burger in perspective now she's bouncing

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.440 
burger in perspective now she's bouncing
up<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.540> down<00:02:42.660> quite<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> bit<00:02:43.230> but<00:02:44.269> not<00:02:45.269> on

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
up and down quite a bit but not on

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.280 
up and down quite a bit but not on
control<00:02:50.209> this<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.360> where<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.690> fun<00:02:51.930> start

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
control this is where the fun start

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.740 
control this is where the fun start
begins<00:02:52.739> fun<00:02:53.370> fun<00:02:53.700> part<00:02:54.000> begins

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.209 

I'm<00:02:58.750> just<00:02:58.930> angled<00:02:59.470> playing<00:02:59.800> a<00:02:59.980> bit

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.729 

and<00:03:03.219> the<00:03:03.760> ball<00:03:03.969> bounced<00:03:04.750> its<00:03:05.140> way<00:03:05.319> off<00:03:05.500> the

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
and the ball bounced its way off the

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.990 
and the ball bounced its way off the
plane

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:23.740 

now<00:03:14.000> here's<00:03:14.240> something<00:03:14.540> cool<00:03:22.570> change<00:03:23.570> it<00:03:23.720> over

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
now here's something cool change it over

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:35.220 
now here's something cool change it over
two<00:03:23.990> phases<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:25.030> deform<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.270> little<00:03:26.390> bit

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.390 

and<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.530> ball<00:03:36.560> hit<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.250> newly<00:03:37.640> formed<00:03:38.030> face

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
and the ball hit the newly formed face

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.110 
and the ball hit the newly formed face
because<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.430> connection<00:03:40.790> was<00:03:41.480> updated<00:03:43.120> it

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
because the connection was updated it

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:53.350 
because the connection was updated it
will<00:03:44.240> change<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.780> little<00:03:44.900> bit<00:03:45.020> more<00:03:52.090> looks<00:03:53.090> like

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
will change a little bit more looks like

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.020 
will change a little bit more looks like
the<00:03:53.480> ball<00:03:53.600> found<00:03:53.990> a<00:03:54.080> nice<00:03:54.230> flat<00:03:55.010> spot<00:03:55.280> again<00:03:55.850> to

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
the ball found a nice flat spot again to

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.130 
the ball found a nice flat spot again to
bounce<00:03:56.210> on<00:03:56.800> even<00:03:57.800> though<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.190> whole<00:03:58.340> table<00:03:58.700> is

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
bounce on even though the whole table is

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:08.400 
bounce on even though the whole table is
tilted<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:03.770> was<00:04:03.920> just<00:04:04.100> a<00:04:04.190> coincidence

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:16.699 

we'll<00:04:09.410> just<00:04:09.560> tilt<00:04:09.860> her<00:04:10.070> a<00:04:10.100> little<00:04:10.250> bit<00:04:10.460> more

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:26.909 

and<00:04:17.340> ratios

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.770 

sometimes<00:04:27.919> I<00:04:28.130> just<00:04:28.190> like<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.729> play<00:04:29.150> for<00:04:29.240> hours

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
sometimes I just like to play for hours

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.600 
sometimes I just like to play for hours
with<00:04:30.050> this<00:04:30.729> bouncing<00:04:31.729> ball<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:34.310> drawing

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
with this bouncing ball and drawing

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.790 
with this bouncing ball and drawing
different<00:04:35.060> shapes<00:04:35.360> and<00:04:35.570> objects<00:04:36.139> for<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:36.650> to

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
different shapes and objects for it to

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:45.999 
different shapes and objects for it to
bounce<00:04:37.009> off<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:42.759> increasing<00:04:43.759> the<00:04:44.620> bounce<00:04:45.620> and

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
bounce off of increasing the bounce and

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.450 
bounce off of increasing the bounce and
how<00:04:46.520> much<00:04:46.729> spin<00:04:47.150> there<00:04:47.389> is<00:04:47.570> initially<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:52.310> can

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
how much spin there is initially you can

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:06.020 
how much spin there is initially you can
get<00:04:52.610> some<00:04:52.789> pretty<00:04:53.000> strange<00:04:53.330> results

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.080 

I've<00:05:06.900> just<00:05:07.200> duplicated<00:05:07.920> the<00:05:07.950> plane<00:05:10.310> so<00:05:11.310> as<00:05:11.520> to

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
I've just duplicated the plane so as to

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.910 
I've just duplicated the plane so as to
get<00:05:12.270> try<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.630> get<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:13.020> ball<00:05:13.140> bounced<00:05:13.530> off<00:05:13.890> of

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
get try to get the ball bounced off of

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.370 
get try to get the ball bounced off of
them<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.550> second<00:05:14.970> plane<00:05:15.210> after<00:05:15.510> it's<00:05:16.050> been<00:05:16.260> on

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
them the second plane after it's been on

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.310 
them the second plane after it's been on
the<00:05:16.410> first<00:05:16.680> plane<00:05:17.630> when<00:05:18.630> you<00:05:18.720> duplicate<00:05:19.290> a

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
the first plane when you duplicate a

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.180 
the first plane when you duplicate a
plane<00:05:19.740> that's<00:05:20.130> already<00:05:21.590> assigned<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:22.830> a<00:05:22.860> field

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
plane that's already assigned to a field

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:33.000 
plane that's already assigned to a field
it<00:05:23.400> that<00:05:23.700> also<00:05:23.910> gets<00:05:24.180> duplicated

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.180 

oops<00:05:34.120> totally<00:05:35.120> missed

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
oops totally missed

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.520 
oops totally missed
okay<00:05:37.790> we'll<00:05:38.090> just<00:05:38.270> change<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:38.870> properties<00:05:39.170> a

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
okay we'll just change the properties a

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:49.270 
okay we'll just change the properties a
little<00:05:39.860> bit<00:05:46.210> playing<00:05:47.210> also<00:05:47.720> can<00:05:48.140> be<00:05:48.170> made<00:05:48.950> more

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
little bit playing also can be made more

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.160 
little bit playing also can be made more
or<00:05:49.460> less<00:05:49.640> lousy<00:05:50.210> that's<00:05:50.630> changing<00:05:51.080> the

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
or less lousy that's changing the

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.470 
or less lousy that's changing the
material<00:05:51.710> attributes<00:05:52.370> of<00:05:52.550> it<00:05:52.730> I<00:05:53.890> suppose

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
material attributes of it I suppose

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.430 
material attributes of it I suppose
going<00:05:56.480> from<00:05:56.890> steel<00:05:57.890> to<00:05:58.220> rubber<00:05:59.440> bounciness

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
going from steel to rubber bounciness

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:08.530 
going from steel to rubber bounciness
would<00:06:01.150> make<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.360> ball<00:06:02.540> bounce<00:06:02.810> even<00:06:03.230> more<00:06:07.540> try

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
would make the ball bounce even more try

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.159 
would make the ball bounce even more try
that<00:06:08.750> again

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:19.070 

oh<00:06:14.300> there<00:06:15.300> it<00:06:15.449> goes

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.080 

come<00:06:20.080> on

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.900 

prove<00:06:23.720> me<00:06:23.990> right

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.560 

oh<00:06:26.970> it's<00:06:27.960> not<00:06:28.260> going<00:06:28.770> to<00:06:29.100> happen<00:06:29.490> we<00:06:29.910> go<00:06:30.120> off<00:06:30.330> on

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
oh it's not going to happen we go off on

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:36.860 
oh it's not going to happen we go off on
door<00:06:30.900> the<00:06:31.170> other<00:06:31.200> planes<00:06:31.650> ah<00:06:33.500> there<00:06:34.500> it<00:06:34.650> goes
