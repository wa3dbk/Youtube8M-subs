00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
just as much drama and then as women I

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.320 
just as much drama and then as women I
think<00:01:39.920> it's<00:01:40.100> more<00:01:40.220> of<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:40.549> understanding

think it's more of just understanding

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.580 
think it's more of just understanding
the<00:01:41.479> way<00:01:42.110> men<00:01:42.409> or<00:01:42.680> women<00:01:43.040> are

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the way men or women are

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.099 
the way men or women are
that<00:01:44.100> there's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> reason<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.689> as

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
that there's a reason for that and as

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
exactly women are more competitive and

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.509

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.950 
women and a lot of times they feel
threatened<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:22.400> is<00:04:22.580> basically<00:04:23.480> in<00:04:23.750> some

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
threatened and it is basically in some

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.310 
threatened and it is basically in some
industries<00:04:24.290> still<00:04:24.890> a<00:04:24.919> man's<00:04:25.280> world<00:04:25.930> so<00:04:26.930> they

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
industries still a man's world so they

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.470 
industries still a man's world so they
either<00:04:27.470> have<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.890> fit<00:04:28.100> into<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.550> culture<00:04:28.940> of

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
either have to fit into the culture of

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.450 
either have to fit into the culture of
the<00:04:29.680> men's<00:04:30.680> world<00:04:31.190> in<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.700> business<00:04:33.040> or<00:04:34.040> you

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
the men's world in that business or you

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.680 
the men's world in that business or you
know<00:04:34.610> they<00:04:34.850> all<00:04:35.150> fail<00:04:35.450> so<00:04:36.080> it's<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.830> tough<00:04:37.070> tough

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
know they all fail so it's a tough tough

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.630 
know they all fail so it's a tough tough
situation<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:39.230> think<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.650> know<00:04:39.800> for<00:04:39.830> when

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
situation and I think you know for when

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.230 
situation and I think you know for when
you<00:04:40.760> say<00:04:40.910> sabotage<00:04:42.250> they<00:04:43.250> look<00:04:43.940> at<00:04:44.090> other

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
you say sabotage they look at other

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.540 
you say sabotage they look at other
women<00:04:44.360> who<00:04:44.870> succeeded<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:46.070> there<00:04:46.370> is

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
women who succeeded and there is

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.920 
women who succeeded and there is
definitely<00:04:47.410> resentment<00:04:48.410> there<00:04:49.630> so<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:50.660> think

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
definitely resentment there so I think

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.870 
definitely resentment there so I think
that's<00:04:51.080> quite<00:04:51.260> a<00:04:51.500> problem<00:04:51.800> that<00:04:52.460> they<00:04:52.580> have<00:04:52.760> to

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
that's quite a problem that they have to

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:04.190 
that's quite a problem that they have to
overcome<00:04:53.330> it's<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.630> behavioral<00:04:54.320> problem

do<00:05:32.680> in<00:05:32.830> general<00:05:33.160> I<00:05:33.190> think<00:05:33.220> men<00:05:33.580> equally<00:05:34.090> screw

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
do in general I think men equally screw

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.560 
do in general I think men equally screw
up<00:05:34.690> their<00:05:34.810> careers<00:05:35.520> they<00:05:36.520> do<00:05:36.580> a<00:05:37.000> lot<00:05:37.270> of<00:05:37.300> stupid

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
up their careers they do a lot of stupid

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.390 
up their careers they do a lot of stupid
things<00:05:37.720> also<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.560> it's<00:05:38.680> not<00:05:38.830> i<00:05:38.860> think<00:05:38.980> it's<00:05:39.190> not

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
things also so it's not i think it's not

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.330 
things also so it's not i think it's not
gender<00:05:39.790> specific<00:05:40.350> i<00:05:41.350> think<00:05:41.710> there<00:05:41.860> are<00:05:42.040> some

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
gender specific i think there are some

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.710 
gender specific i think there are some
things<00:05:42.550> that<00:05:42.760> women<00:05:43.770> have<00:05:44.770> you<00:05:45.190> know<00:05:45.490> i<00:05:45.520> can<00:05:46.390> do

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
things that women have you know i can do

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.360 
things that women have you know i can do
that<00:05:46.750> might<00:05:47.260> affect<00:05:47.680> their<00:05:47.830> career<00:05:48.130> but<00:05:48.340> i

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
that might affect their career but i

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.910 
that might affect their career but i
think<00:05:48.670> in<00:05:48.790> general<00:05:49.000> it<00:05:49.600> comes<00:05:49.870> down<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.440> if<00:05:50.740> you

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
think in general it comes down to if you

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.850 
think in general it comes down to if you
want<00:05:51.190> to<00:05:51.280> get<00:05:51.400> ahead<00:05:51.730> in<00:05:52.000> business<00:05:52.530> it's<00:05:53.530> just

as a male or a female thing but I think

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.620

women<00:06:38.350> bring<00:06:38.740> some<00:06:39.070> very<00:06:39.460> unique<00:06:39.790> skill<00:06:40.330> sets

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
to the workplace and to the extent that

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.180 
to the workplace and to the extent that
they<00:06:43.420> don't<00:06:43.630> try<00:06:44.170> to<00:06:44.200> suppress<00:06:44.650> those<00:06:44.890> and

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
they don't try to suppress those and

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.310 
they don't try to suppress those and
they<00:06:45.370> let<00:06:45.580> them<00:06:45.730> come<00:06:45.910> out<00:06:46.090> that's<00:06:46.870> where<00:06:47.170> they

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
they let them come out that's where they

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:56.530
