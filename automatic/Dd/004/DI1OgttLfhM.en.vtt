of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> session<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.340> started<00:00:38.640> loosening<00:00:38.940> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
of the session and started loosening it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299 
of the session and started loosening it
up<00:00:39.270> when<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> table<00:00:39.899> got<00:00:39.989> short-handed<00:00:40.739> okay

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
up when the table got short-handed okay

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.680 
up when the table got short-handed okay

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
this is one of those situations where

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.840 
this is one of those situations where
the<00:02:04.380> flop<00:02:04.649> was<00:02:04.829> totally<00:02:05.130> standard<00:02:05.549> the

for
ever<00:02:12.810> we'll<00:02:13.380> probably<00:02:13.590> look<00:02:13.860> at<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
ever we'll probably look at this and the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.170 
ever we'll probably look at this and the
first<00:02:14.670> thing<00:02:14.820> they're<00:02:14.910> going<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.090> ask

themselves is okay what is this bet
accomplished<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.640> if<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.540> look<00:02:18.780> at<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.990> bet

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
accomplished and if you look at a bet

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.650 
accomplished and if you look at a bet
like<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:20.220> one<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.580> those<00:02:20.700> where<00:02:21.060> you're

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
like this it's one of those where you're

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.060 
like this it's one of those where you're
probably<00:02:21.960> not<00:02:22.260> getting<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.590> better<00:02:22.770> handle

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
probably not getting a better handle

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.340 
probably not getting a better handle
fold<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.610> you're<00:02:24.180> probably<00:02:24.480> not<00:02:24.780> getting<00:02:25.080> a

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
fold and you're probably not getting a

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.900 
fold and you're probably not getting a
tremendous<00:02:25.590> amount<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.280> second-best<00:02:26.700> hands

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
tremendous amount of second-best hands

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.520 
tremendous amount of second-best hands
to<00:02:27.000> continue<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.990> even<00:02:28.230> if<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.440> have

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
to continue and even if you have

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.800 
to continue and even if you have
something<00:02:28.740> like<00:02:28.890> say<00:02:29.160> seven<00:02:30.030> eight

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
something like say seven eight

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.960 
something like say seven eight
you<00:02:31.080> know<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:31.410> chalk<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.010> now<00:02:32.220> now<00:02:32.700> that

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you know we chalk with that now now that

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.420 
you know we chalk with that now now that
we<00:02:33.180> have<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.720> king<00:02:34.170> kicker<00:02:34.440> chopping<00:02:35.070> both<00:02:35.250> of

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.580 
we have the king kicker chopping both of
us<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.600> one<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.930> those<00:02:37.080> where<00:02:37.350> it's

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
us so this is one of those where it's

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.550 
us so this is one of those where it's
not<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.580> fat<00:02:39.030> value<00:02:39.510> by<00:02:39.690> any<00:02:39.900> stretch<00:02:40.110> and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
anything like that so it's one of those

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.550 
anything like that so it's one of those
like<00:02:44.130> gray<00:02:44.370> zone<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.730> it's<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.090> said<00:02:45.560> so

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
just simply aren't very many second best

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.110 
just simply aren't very many second best
hands<00:03:13.140> in<00:03:13.380> here<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:14.610> we're<00:03:14.760> definitely<00:03:14.850> never

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
hands in here and we're definitely never

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.670 
hands in here and we're definitely never
holding<00:03:15.480> out<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.600> better<00:03:15.810> hand<00:03:16.080> but<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.500> being

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
holding out a better hand but that being

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.890 
holding out a better hand but that being
said<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:17.160> don't<00:03:17.220> really<00:03:17.490> think<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.880> 5x<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.660> in

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
said I don't really think that 5x is in

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.680 
said I don't really think that 5x is in
here<00:03:19.200> ever<00:03:19.380> if<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:20.040> big<00:03:20.190> blind<00:03:20.430> had<00:03:20.790> 5x<00:03:21.450> I

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
here ever if the big blind had 5x I

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.120 
here ever if the big blind had 5x I
think<00:03:21.900> we<00:03:22.020> would<00:03:22.170> have<00:03:22.260> heard<00:03:22.380> from<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.800> by<00:03:22.920> now

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
think we would have heard from it by now

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.970 
think we would have heard from it by now
at<00:03:23.400> least<00:03:23.910> by<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.270> turn<00:03:24.630> simply<00:03:25.470> because<00:03:25.740> why

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
at least by the turn simply because why

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.040 
at least by the turn simply because why
would<00:03:26.220> he<00:03:26.370> take<00:03:26.550> this<00:03:26.760> line<00:03:27.000> with<00:03:27.240> 5x<00:03:27.750> when

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
would he take this line with 5x when

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.810 
would he take this line with 5x when
like<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.500> best<00:03:28.740> thing<00:03:29.040> he's<00:03:29.190> gonna<00:03:29.340> do<00:03:29.550> is<00:03:29.700> be

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
like the best thing he's gonna do is be

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.790 
like the best thing he's gonna do is be
able<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.000> check<00:03:30.240> his<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.570> river<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:31.020> like<00:03:31.170> 200

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
able to check his the river to like 200

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.040 
able to check his the river to like 200
and<00:03:31.980> get<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.100> call<00:03:32.400> right<00:03:33.060> he<00:03:33.210> has<00:03:33.300> no<00:03:33.510> chance<00:03:33.870> of

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
and get a call right he has no chance of

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.780 
and get a call right he has no chance of
getting<00:03:34.140> stacks<00:03:34.620> inside<00:03:35.130> which<00:03:35.490> is<00:03:35.640> why<00:03:35.760> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
getting stacks inside which is why I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.750 
getting stacks inside which is why I
don't<00:03:35.940> think<00:03:36.300> he<00:03:36.450> ever<00:03:36.480> has<00:03:36.840> 5x<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.700> think

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
don't think he ever has 5x so I think

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.340 
don't think he ever has 5x so I think
he's<00:03:39.180> gonna<00:03:39.300> have<00:03:39.540> some<00:03:39.780> sort<00:03:39.990> of<00:03:40.140> like

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
he's gonna have some sort of like

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.890 
he's gonna have some sort of like
middling<00:03:41.160> pocket<00:03:41.670> pair<00:03:41.910> sometimes<00:03:42.540> he's

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
middling pocket pair sometimes he's

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.980 
middling pocket pair sometimes he's
gonna<00:03:43.020> have<00:03:43.350> 7x<00:03:44.250> as<00:03:44.490> well<00:03:44.670> he's<00:03:45.480> going<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.810> have

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
gonna have 7x as well he's going to have

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.350 
gonna have 7x as well he's going to have
busted<00:03:46.290> Club<00:03:46.740> drawers<00:03:47.010> busted<00:03:47.550> gut<00:03:47.760> shots<00:03:48.090> and

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
busted Club drawers busted gut shots and

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.180 
busted Club drawers busted gut shots and
all<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.600> kind<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.900> stuff<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.440> think<00:03:50.010> that's

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
all that kind of stuff I think that's

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.530 
all that kind of stuff I think that's
kind<00:03:50.580> of<00:03:50.640> what<00:03:50.760> we're<00:03:50.850> gonna<00:03:50.910> be<00:03:51.120> looking<00:03:51.450> at

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
kind of what we're gonna be looking at

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.840 
kind of what we're gonna be looking at
in<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.720> situation<00:03:52.230> like<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:52.640> and<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.760> be

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
in a situation like this and to be

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.790 
in a situation like this and to be
honest<00:03:54.209> when<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.450> bet<00:03:54.690> this<00:03:54.870> river<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.350> lot<00:03:55.680> of

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
honest when I bet this river a lot of

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.980 
honest when I bet this river a lot of
that<00:03:55.920> is<00:03:56.040> gonna<00:03:56.190> fold<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.300> be<00:03:57.420> honest<00:03:57.750> I'm

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
that is gonna fold and to be honest I'm

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.410 
that is gonna fold and to be honest I'm
okay<00:03:58.440> with<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.650> because<00:03:59.430> think<00:03:59.760> about<00:04:00.000> what

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
okay with that because think about what

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.540 
okay with that because think about what
happens<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.200> other<00:04:01.230> way<00:04:01.440> okay<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:02.250> let's<00:04:02.490> just

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
happens the other way okay so let's just

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.100 
happens the other way okay so let's just
say<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.760> we<00:04:02.940> checked<00:04:03.240> this<00:04:03.390> behind<00:04:03.810> instead

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
say that we checked this behind instead

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.470 
say that we checked this behind instead
of<00:04:04.320> betting<00:04:04.620> what<00:04:05.220> do<00:04:05.280> we<00:04:05.400> have<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.730> do<00:04:05.850> we<00:04:06.450> have

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
of betting what do we have to do we have

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.260 
of betting what do we have to do we have

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
not betting the river with so you don't

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.030 
not betting the river with so you don't
want<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.600> get<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.930> river<00:04:31.140> in<00:04:31.500> like<00:04:31.770> only

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
want to get to the river in like only

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.310 
want to get to the river in like only
bet<00:04:32.550> if<00:04:32.730> you<00:04:32.880> somehow<00:04:33.450> showed<00:04:33.840> up<00:04:33.990> with<00:04:34.140> like<00:04:34.230> a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
bet if you somehow showed up with like a

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.640 
bet if you somehow showed up with like a
king<00:04:34.620> or<00:04:35.040> five<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:36.060> then<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.200> rest<00:04:37.410> of<00:04:37.530> your

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
king or five and then the rest of your

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.650 
king or five and then the rest of your
range<00:04:37.800> is<00:04:37.950> just<00:04:38.070> Bluffs<00:04:38.400> right<00:04:39.240> because

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
range is just Bluffs right because

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.970 
range is just Bluffs right because
that's<00:04:40.080> not<00:04:40.290> very<00:04:40.410> good

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
that's not very good
