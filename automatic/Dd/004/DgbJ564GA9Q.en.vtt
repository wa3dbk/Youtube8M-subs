00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.390
 with corey jean christophe jersey 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.700
 choreographer director of ballets 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.719
 monte carlo leaves momentarily 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.000
 the world of great narrative ballets 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.639
 to offer us a show composed of 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.410
 five contrasting sections imagine with 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.449
 the collaboration of the writer jean roux 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.789
 the idea is to make a show 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.900
 around the american musical 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.430
 knowing that this is what 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.109
 interested me some musical mini 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.140
 dense above the chasms if they 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.000
 return 1932-33 and 56 57 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.619
 it's the great depression it's not a 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.619
 art stock market and war it's hiroshima 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.239
 we had an awareness that comedy 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.590
 musical is very representative 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.030
 finally of what happened in 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.449
 the history of dance especially 20th 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.360
 century this fight this conflict between 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.180
 the aerial it earthly how fred 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.339
 astaire that represents the aristocracy of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.989
 the dance this elegance someone who 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.090
 floated above the stage a little 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.740
 as we could compare the equivalent 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.180
 of classical dance or ballet flats 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.430
 are just above floats above 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.920
 the scene and then what jane kelly that is 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.530
 someone who brought the dance back to the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.550
 reality of the world the one who danced under 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.780
 the rain that danced out the urban who 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.069
 made aware that the soil 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.470
 also had a force know a 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.000
 power and finally the dance at 27 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.399
 it's a little bit like a walk between 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.259
 these two extremes 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.130
 this academic classical dance that 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.770
 hovered and then this dance 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.860
 more radical hard contemporary that has 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.950
 brought the body back to the ground and we start from 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.450
 this principle we tried to make a 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.350
 kind of trip in the history of the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.640
 dance tell a certain way 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.050
 obviously not just for those who 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.119
 know the dance because otherwise the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.700
 public would be too limited but 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.069
 show that finally the dance can 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.289
 to have a relationship with with elegance 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.060
 with something very superficial 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.709
 sometimes from time to time she can 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.940
 tell stories from time to time 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.590
 she can get closer to the music 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.929
 sometimes she can become detached 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.429
 totally abstract even times we have 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.590
 saw a dance that was non dance 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.099
 that is, the movement was 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.440
 minimal and then where also places 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.170
 vital function of dance in humans 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.489
 when we can not resist 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.120
 this desire to dance that is what 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.540
 causes in the dancer this need 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.540
 irremediable to move 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.790
 corey is an amazing sight where 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.830
 sometimes the words of jean rouaud said by 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.230
 jean rouaud crosses with dance and 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.190
 music musics of composers 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.110
 surprising in their diversity 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.600
 daniel hofmann the great musician 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.180
 hollywood bertrand jersey yann marez 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.490
 john cage and daniel turp pollini height 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:59.940
 of the body and final a magnificent solo of 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:03:02.070
 battery think that in the end it took 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.110
 that there remains only the rhythm that the 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.640
 melody and missing and that finally this 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.920
 which is vital to dance what is 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.510
 vital to the dancers is the rhythm 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.800
 that's what always causes this 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.900
 want to move 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.100
 so it's really a pretty trip 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.680
 incredible in the history of music 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.420
 in the history of dance and all that 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.130
 by analogy with what happened 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.630
 in the history of the world through 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.370
 the musical because we do not forget 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.120
 that in that period there was the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.580
 great Depression 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.410
 obviously pearl harbor hiroshima 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.990
 there are things that have made that the 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.340
 world has rocked and that once the 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.660
 world is rocking into universes like 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.020
 that one there can not be any more to 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.020
 make the buzz
