00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.350
 Hi, I'm adrid and today this is the seventh 

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:07.509
 mythical terra chapter is going to be not so 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.610
 long as the others and I will show you 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.910
 syncope and a few mechanisms of 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.910
 straight 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.039
 The first thing is that I replaced the 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.839
 metal bars that were here in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.480
 at the door is for a few 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.519
 abyssal that by giving this a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.990
 mechanism of redd this that underneath that 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.930
 open up 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.940
 what's in the park will sound to you is what 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.940
 that would have to be the output of 5 p 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.760
 this is at night it looks good 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.980
 and here I have already done the syncope this 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.850
 I've worked with a friend is out there 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.850
 but says hello 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.750
 well it's helping me a lot to do the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.930
 map made all that is the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.900
 minotaur from behind what helped me 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.780
 and now let's go to the 5 p input I still 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.980
 is missing a lot by general but the 5 p ya 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.260
 is done and what is the entry 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.040
 as well 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.040
 here 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.460
 in action for at night 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.180
 and what is the attraction 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.200
 here are the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.289
 what would be the chests the sites 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.170
 to leave things when we ride 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:39.600
 a control cabinet there is another 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.610
 I can not make it move but it 's 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.490
 a few mechanisms that are 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.049
 pretty cool 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.700
 in the first cabin that is the one 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.180
 I was near the lines we have a 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.330
 mechanism 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.030
 found what they will have 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.880
 the bars to enter as for 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.810
 control that among people 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.570
 barriers between the region 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.149
 and the other one that is for the platform that 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.460
 we have the grace if below 5 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.090
 so you do not split your legs if 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.090
 we go down 2 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.000
 gone down 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.000
 right now 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.670
 but 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.459
 and we upload them 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.469
 what comes up 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.380
 and again until this stuff is good 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:34.050
 apart 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.850
 in this cabin it 's nothing to open and close 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.650
 doors 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.470
 with this 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.120
 we control that the bars open but 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.240
 these are common barriers of 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.540
 these rare 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.620
 open and down here to the mechanism 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.860
 Rest 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.640
 that makes the whole attraction work 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.269
 good platforms and so on and now we're going 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.640
 to the outside 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.650
 well here is ginÃ©s working in 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.510
 the beginning of the nile with the progress 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.510
 aside it does not matter a delegate 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.110
 the horror is a channel 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.770
 with the egg 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.040
 good 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:24.019
 good this part of itself 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.019
 he dies he dies he fraps 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.879
 I have put a lot of trees a well 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.569
 all of this decoration here is never 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.090
 pass 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.090
 minecraft and so how does it matter 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.420
 let's see if there is anything left and good until 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.480
 here today's chapter is not there either 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.739
 This has been a lot because 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.650
 a long time without doing I'm getting ahead 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.610
 the map from here you see the walk from 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.350
 above an emergency exit 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.600
 of syncope 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.020
 and well nothing else now we will do another 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.700
 video will probably upload it in a few days 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:06.520
 like subscribe if you like the series and 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.520
 little more so come on until later
