more<00:03:43.890> about<00:03:44.040> forest<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:45.090> know<00:03:45.240> making<00:03:45.840> your

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
more about forest you know making your

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.890 
more about forest you know making your
own<00:03:46.140> rain<00:03:46.950> forests<00:03:47.490> is<00:03:47.730> why<00:03:48.090> science<00:03:50.240> is<00:03:51.240> so

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
own rain forests is why science is so

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.930 
own rain forests is why science is so
