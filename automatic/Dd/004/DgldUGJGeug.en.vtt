00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
isn't a game with scorestreaks now it

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.809 
isn't a game with scorestreaks now it
might<00:02:26.769> not<00:02:27.010> be<00:02:27.069> in<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.430> game<00:02:27.610> there's

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.009 
might not be in the game there's
actually<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> good<00:02:28.209> chance<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.599> won't<00:02:28.780> be

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
actually a good chance it won't be

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.559 
actually a good chance it won't be
because<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:30.010> more<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.430> an<00:02:30.760> infinity<00:02:31.330> ward

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569
