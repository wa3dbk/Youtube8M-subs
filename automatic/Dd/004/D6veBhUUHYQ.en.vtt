00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
when the phone is locked all you see is

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.219 
when the phone is locked all you see is
just<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.500> date<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.010> time<00:03:32.389> that's<00:03:33.389> it<00:03:33.599> a<00:03:33.840> lot

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
just the date and time that's it a lot

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.659 
just the date and time that's it a lot
of<00:03:34.319> empty<00:03:34.470> space<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.949> middle<00:03:35.159> better<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.459> put

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
of empty space in middle better I put

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.099 
of empty space in middle better I put
the<00:03:35.729> Apple<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.060> take<00:03:36.209> advantage<00:03:36.599> of<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:36.810> it

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
the Apple to take advantage of that it

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.869 
the Apple to take advantage of that it
almost<00:03:37.229> as<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> default<00:03:37.829> home<00:03:38.250> screen<00:03:38.280> showing

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
almost as a default home screen showing

almost as a default home screen showing
an<00:03:39.060> upcoming<00:03:39.359> appointment<00:03:39.959> possibly<00:03:40.889> one<00:03:41.069> or

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
an upcoming appointment possibly one or

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.699 
an upcoming appointment possibly one or
two<00:03:41.310> lines<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.639> text<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.030> email<00:03:42.359> i<00:03:42.599> only<00:03:43.560> make

two lines of text and email i only make

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.039 
two lines of text and email i only make
logical<00:03:44.099> sense<00:03:44.159> the<00:03:45.060> next<00:03:45.329> thing<00:03:45.419> i'll<00:03:45.540> expect

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049

logical sense the next thing i'll expect
is<00:03:46.829> easily<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.280> run<00:03:47.430> background<00:03:47.849> applications

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
is easily to run background applications

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.629 
is easily to run background applications
that's<00:03:49.349> something<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.739> people<00:03:50.489> been

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
that's something that people been

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.129 
that's something that people been
promising<00:03:51.239> an<00:03:51.359> apple<00:03:51.569> has<00:03:51.659> been<00:03:51.750> promising

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
promising an apple has been promising

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.869 
promising an apple has been promising
for<00:03:52.169> a<00:03:52.379> while<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.889> lot<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.370> other<00:03:53.519> operating

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
for a while a lot of other operating

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.909 
for a while a lot of other operating
systems<00:03:53.940> have<00:03:54.419> it<00:03:54.569> so<00:03:55.049> what<00:03:55.169> that<00:03:55.319> means<00:03:55.560> let's

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
systems have it so what that means let's

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.710 
systems have it so what that means let's
say<00:03:56.069> you're<00:03:56.250> using<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.669> i<00:03:56.729> am<00:03:56.939> application<00:03:57.540> and

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
say you're using a i am application and

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.210 
say you're using a i am application and
you<00:03:57.780> want<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.019> go<00:03:58.049> check<00:03:58.319> your<00:03:58.409> email<00:03:58.680> we<00:03:59.040> have

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
you want to go check your email we have

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.699 
you want to go check your email we have
to<00:03:59.340> close<00:03:59.699> out<00:03:59.939> a<00:03:59.970> an<00:04:00.359> application<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.409> open

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
to close out a an application and open

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.800 
to close out a an application and open
up<00:04:01.769> safari<00:04:01.979> but<00:04:02.879> this<00:04:03.000> allow<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.510> do<00:04:03.629> is

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
up safari but this allow you to do is

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.890 
up safari but this allow you to do is
actually<00:04:04.019> just<00:04:04.530> minimize<00:04:05.189> AI<00:04:06.000> n<00:04:06.269> application

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
actually just minimize AI n application

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.089 
actually just minimize AI n application
and<00:04:07.079> they'll<00:04:07.169> still<00:04:07.349> look<00:04:07.530> like<00:04:07.560> it's<00:04:07.859> closed

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
and they'll still look like it's closed

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.830 
and they'll still look like it's closed
on<00:04:08.310> your<00:04:08.430> phone<00:04:08.669> but<00:04:09.299> i'll<00:04:09.389> still<00:04:09.479> be<00:04:09.659> running

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
on your phone but i'll still be running

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.660 
on your phone but i'll still be running
so<00:04:10.139> you<00:04:10.229> can<00:04:10.349> still<00:04:10.500> get<00:04:10.739> i<00:04:10.979> am

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
so you can still get i am

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.100 
so you can still get i am
else<00:04:11.940> you<00:04:12.090> were<00:04:12.209> doing<00:04:12.540> while<00:04:12.780> you're<00:04:12.959> doing

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
else you were doing while you're doing

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.960 
else you were doing while you're doing
other<00:04:13.500> things<00:04:13.670> it's<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.760> little

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
other things it's a little

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.699 
other things it's a little
processor-intensive<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:16.079> certainly<00:04:16.320> memory

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
processor-intensive and certainly memory

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.900 
processor-intensive and certainly memory
intensive<00:04:17.130> but<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.430> iphone<00:04:17.730> has<00:04:17.880> a

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
intensive but the iphone has a

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.420 
intensive but the iphone has a
horsepower<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.510> handle<00:04:18.780> things<00:04:18.989> like<00:04:19.079> that

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
horsepower to handle things like that

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.470 
horsepower to handle things like that
that's<00:04:20.430> something<00:04:20.730> that<00:04:20.760> really<00:04:21.120> would<00:04:21.329> make

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
that's something that really would make

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.040 
that's something that really would make
it<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.720> more<00:04:22.010> robust<00:04:23.240> workhorse<00:04:24.240> for<00:04:24.540> the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
it a more robust workhorse for the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.560 
it a more robust workhorse for the
business<00:04:25.440> or<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.710> personal<00:04:26.490> user<00:04:26.700> so<00:04:27.360> i<00:04:27.419> would

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
business or the personal user so i would

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.140 
business or the personal user so i would
i'm<00:04:28.110> not<00:04:28.290> expecting<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:29.010> but<00:04:29.820> i<00:04:29.910> was<00:04:30.030> going

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
i'm not expecting that but i was going

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.670 
i'm not expecting that but i was going
to<00:04:30.270> be<00:04:30.330> hopeful<00:04:30.720> that<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.990> will<00:04:31.020> be<00:04:31.169> in<00:04:31.500> there

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
to be hopeful that it will be in there

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.310 
to be hopeful that it will be in there
now<00:04:32.639> one<00:04:32.850> other<00:04:32.880> thing<00:04:33.240> I'm<00:04:33.360> expecting<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.080> a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
now one other thing I'm expecting is a

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.650 
now one other thing I'm expecting is a
new<00:04:34.680> addition<00:04:34.919> to<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.310> app<00:04:35.490> store<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:36.450> I<00:04:36.480> think

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
new addition to the app store so I think

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.850 
new addition to the app store so I think
this<00:04:36.900> would<00:04:37.050> be<00:04:37.080> able<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.410> premium

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
this would be able to premium

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.220 
this would be able to premium
application<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:38.639> not<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:38.940> 99<00:04:39.450> three<00:04:39.990> dollar

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
application so not the 99 three dollar

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.500 
application so not the 99 three dollar
