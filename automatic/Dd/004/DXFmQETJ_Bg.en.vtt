00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.580
 very powerful the film practically a 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.759
 moving paint you freeze a 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.340

 animation is more traditional 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.500
 You do not have digital resources at the end. 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.460

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.060
 a key to impressionism is one thing 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.730
 like this 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.100
 too hoarse the result is so beautiful and 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.250
