be<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> masses<00:01:50.790> I'm<00:01:51.420> not<00:01:51.659> sure<00:01:51.899> how<00:01:52.140> big

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
be to the masses I'm not sure how big

the online community for NCAA is after

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.389 
the online community for NCAA is after
the<00:01:54.960> madden<00:01:55.259> release<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.740> I'm<00:01:55.829> sure<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.250> dies

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the madden release but I'm sure it dies

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.700 
the madden release but I'm sure it dies
down<00:01:56.460> quite<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> bit<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.689> mean<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.229> never<00:01:58.500> Lee

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
down quite a bit I mean I have never Lee

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.990 
down quite a bit I mean I have never Lee
played<00:01:59.009> at<00:01:59.159> outside<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.700> first<00:01:59.880> couple

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
played at outside of the first couple

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.149 
played at outside of the first couple
weeks<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.479> game<00:02:00.659> being<00:02:00.869> out<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:01.979> far

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
weeks of the game being out but as far

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.450 
weeks of the game being out but as far
as<00:02:02.219> ultimate<00:02:02.759> team<00:02:02.909> goes

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
as ultimate team goes

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.240 
as ultimate team goes
14<00:02:04.360> he<00:02:04.930> obviously<00:02:05.020> can't<00:02:05.560> have<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.979> names

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
14 he obviously can't have the names

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.760 
14 he obviously can't have the names
there<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.570> would<00:02:07.750> totally<00:02:08.080> detract

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
there and so that would totally detract

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.440 
there and so that would totally detract
from<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.950> experience<00:02:09.520> having<00:02:09.819> hey<00:02:10.030> look<00:02:10.270> it's

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
from the experience having hey look it's

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.050 
from the experience having hey look it's
quarterback<00:02:10.869> number<00:02:11.170> 7<00:02:11.200> from<00:02:11.770> X<00:02:12.010> school<00:02:12.459> like

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
quarterback number 7 from X school like

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.250 
quarterback number 7 from X school like
you<00:02:13.209> have<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.780> names<00:02:13.990> there

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
you have to have the names there

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.380 
you have to have the names there
otherwise<00:02:14.470> there's<00:02:14.950> no<00:02:15.010> connection<00:02:16.000> being

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
otherwise there's no connection being

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.449 
otherwise there's no connection being
made<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:16.990> think<00:02:17.170> they<00:02:17.530> would<00:02:17.680> possibly<00:02:17.950> do

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
made so I think they would possibly do

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.979 
made so I think they would possibly do
and<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.880> just<00:02:19.060> complete<00:02:19.390> speculation<00:02:19.630> on

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
and this is just complete speculation on

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.809 
and this is just complete speculation on
my<00:02:20.080> own<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:20.860> think<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.280> would<00:02:21.459> just<00:02:21.489> have

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
my own but I think that would just have

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.120 
my own but I think that would just have
it<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.150> if<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.420> have<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.780> rosters<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.530> affects

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
it so if you have the rosters it affects

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.830 
it so if you have the rosters it affects
the<00:02:24.280> names<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.760> cards<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.209> see<00:02:25.480> what<00:02:25.810> I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
the names of the cards you see what I

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.800 
the names of the cards you see what I
really<00:02:26.560> don't<00:02:26.800> know<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.370> SCC<00:02:28.330> conference

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
really don't know the SCC conference

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
patki sec players what could this mean I

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.390
