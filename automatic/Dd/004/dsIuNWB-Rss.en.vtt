00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
onto my skin so what I did is I went to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.940 
onto my skin so what I did is I went to
the<00:01:06.900> website<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.409> did<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> little<00:01:07.740> bit<00:01:07.920> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the website and I did a little bit of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
the website and I did a little bit of
reading<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.360> was<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
reading on there because what was on the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.179 
reading on there because what was on the
bottle<00:01:09.900> was<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.380> enough<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.890> me<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
bottle was just not enough for me to

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.039 
bottle was just not enough for me to
feel<00:01:11.369> safe<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.880> put<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> onto<00:01:12.270> my<00:01:12.390> face<00:01:12.689> so

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
feel safe to put it onto my face so

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.420 
feel safe to put it onto my face so
pretty<00:01:13.260> much<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:14.070> what<00:01:14.250> the
