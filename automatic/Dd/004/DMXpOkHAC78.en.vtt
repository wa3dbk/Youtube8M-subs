interesting<00:00:58.649> thing<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.340> create

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
interesting thing is that if you create

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
interesting thing is that if you create
a<00:00:59.640> proper<00:01:00.120> ledge<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.690> game<00:01:00.840> lets<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.140> select

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
a proper ledge the game lets you select

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.959 
a proper ledge the game lets you select
if<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.649> want<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.039> ledge<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.550> grab<00:01:02.760> them

all<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> little<00:01:04.290> confused<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
all or not I was a little confused of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.230 
all or not I was a little confused of
some<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.100> my<00:01:05.189> first<00:01:05.430> stages<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.970> built

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
some of my first stages that I built

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.940 
some of my first stages that I built
because<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.659> didn't<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.020> selectable<00:01:07.470> ledges

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
because I didn't have selectable ledges

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.620 
because I didn't have selectable ledges
but<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.520> turns<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.970> your<00:01:09.119> ledge<00:01:09.299> must

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
but it turns out that your ledge must

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.570 
but it turns out that your ledge must
have<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:09.960> least<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.409> ninety<00:01:10.830> degree<00:01:10.950> angle<00:01:11.100> or

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
have at least a ninety degree angle or

the gamepad makes creating stages very
simple<00:01:21.119> once<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> figure<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
simple once you figure out the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.210 
simple once you figure out the
parameters<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.770> need<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.009> work<00:01:23.189> with

parameters that you need to work with

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.039 
parameters that you need to work with
there's<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.939> limit<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.299> how<00:01:24.420> much<00:01:24.509> terrain<00:01:24.900> you

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
there's a limit to how much terrain you

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
there's a limit to how much terrain you
can<00:01:25.200> put<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> stage<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.159> how<00:01:26.310> much<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.520> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
can put on a stage and how much of a

can put on a stage and how much of a
platform<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> minimum

for<00:01:28.500> starting<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.460> actually<00:01:29.820> pretty

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
for starting but it's actually pretty

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.050
