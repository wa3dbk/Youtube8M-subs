00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.930 
and I'm going to use him to call in some
other<00:03:00.959> birds<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:02.010> idea<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.519> is<00:03:02.550> that<00:03:02.850> you

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
other birds the idea of it is that you

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.090 
other birds the idea of it is that you
rotate<00:03:03.840> birds<00:03:04.230> from<00:03:04.470> one<00:03:04.590> area<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:04.950> another

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
rotate birds from one area to another

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.590 
rotate birds from one area to another
and<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.890> attack<00:03:07.970> kind<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.150> thing<00:03:09.450> that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
and it's the attack kind of a thing that

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.670 
and it's the attack kind of a thing that
they<00:03:09.690> have<00:03:09.840> gone<00:03:10.049> on<00:03:10.170> therefore<00:03:10.380> their

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
they have gone on therefore their

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.710 
they have gone on therefore their
territory<00:03:11.190> its<00:03:11.370> territorial<00:03:11.970> thing<00:03:12.180> that

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
territory its territorial thing that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.570 
territory its territorial thing that
makes<00:03:12.930> them<00:03:13.110> try<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.440> attack<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.040> bird<00:03:14.220> that's

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
makes them try to attack the bird that's

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.670 
makes them try to attack the bird that's
inside<00:03:15.260> in<00:03:16.260> your<00:03:16.470> trap<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:18.110> as<00:03:19.110> such<00:03:19.350> they<00:03:19.530> get

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
inside in your trap and as such they get

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.430 
inside in your trap and as such they get
caught<00:03:19.890> now<00:03:20.280> one<00:03:20.459> thing<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.700> will<00:03:20.880> notice<00:03:21.440> about

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
caught now one thing I will notice about

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.309 
caught now one thing I will notice about
this<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:23.069> that<00:03:23.690> all<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.140> other<00:03:26.780> traps<00:03:27.780> have

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
this is that all of the other traps have

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.740 
this is that all of the other traps have
gone<00:03:28.530> off<00:03:28.670> so<00:03:29.670> maybe<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.060> was<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.269> disturbance

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
gone off so maybe it was the disturbance

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.199 
gone off so maybe it was the disturbance
from<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.049> one<00:03:31.230> bird<00:03:31.760> let's<00:03:32.760> set<00:03:32.940> off<00:03:33.060> those

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
from that one bird let's set off those

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.500 
from that one bird let's set off those
other<00:03:33.420> traps<00:03:34.070> but<00:03:35.070> whatever<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.519> is<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.970> have

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
other traps but whatever it is I have

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.490 
other traps but whatever it is I have
won<00:03:36.720> anyway<00:03:37.609> so<00:03:38.609> that's<00:03:38.670> good<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.230> I'm<00:03:40.230> going

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.770 
won anyway so that's good and I'm going
to<00:03:40.560> make<00:03:41.459> sure<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.730> deck<00:03:41.880> idea<00:03:42.269> has<00:03:42.570> got

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
to make sure the deck idea has got

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.509 
to make sure the deck idea has got
plenty<00:03:42.930> food<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.350> water<00:03:43.470> I'm<00:03:43.709> going<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.370> just

eventually is I will move this part here

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.550 
eventually is I will move this part here
to<00:05:05.780> someplace<00:05:05.990> else

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
to someplace else

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.920 
to someplace else
once<00:05:06.860> I<00:05:07.010> filled<00:05:07.340> up<00:05:07.430> there<00:05:07.640> he's<00:05:08.510> not<00:05:08.540> calling

boats<00:05:11.270> anymore<00:05:11.570> and<00:05:11.960> I<00:05:12.800> try<00:05:13.070> him<00:05:13.220> someplace

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
boats anymore and I try him someplace

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.250 
boats anymore and I try him someplace
else<00:05:13.760> and<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.330> just<00:05:14.360> will<00:05:14.630> have<00:05:14.660> notes<00:05:14.960> on<00:05:15.110> this

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
else and I just will have notes on this

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.700 
else and I just will have notes on this
grass<00:05:15.530> here<00:05:16.720> so<00:05:17.720> zero<00:05:18.020> birds<00:05:18.260> can<00:05:18.440> see<00:05:18.620> in

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
grass here so zero birds can see in

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:53.540 
grass here so zero birds can see in
communities<00:05:18.890> so<00:05:27.100> fast

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550
