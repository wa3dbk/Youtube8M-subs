their head so ya know this straight out
there<00:04:22.640> I<00:04:22.670> guess<00:04:22.910> how<00:04:23.090> it<00:04:23.150> goes<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:23.600> way<00:04:23.870> and

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
there I guess how it goes this way and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.800 
there I guess how it goes this way and
it's<00:04:26.810> going<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.050> be<00:04:27.170> like<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:31.810> because

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
sometimes if you glue it on wrong that's

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.680 
sometimes if you glue it on wrong that's
going<00:04:37.730> to<00:04:37.790> be<00:04:37.880> crooked<00:04:38.060> when<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.390> put<00:04:38.510> it<00:04:38.600> on

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690
