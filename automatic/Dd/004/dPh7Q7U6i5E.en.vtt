00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 germany tour welcome back to me 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.400
 channel in this short video we're going to do 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.570
 the first ignition of what is the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.450
 huawei of 360 let's then put the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.330
 battery for the first time here I have it to 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.710
 my left we are going to uncover by 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.420
 first time and take out the battery 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.660
 Normally the batteries do not come 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.180
 completely charged when they come from 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.189
 Factory comes with a small charge of 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.580
 storage that is called that is the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.590
 batteries is never completely stored 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.649
 loaded by security simply it 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.840
 gives them an initial charge with which they 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.410
 store and can be preserved from that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:46.160
 this way we throw the back cover if 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.040
 it's easy to install the battery 50 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.930
 and that here in this way in this 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.510
 at the moment I have no imposed nor 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.220
 neither does any microsd so it's very 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.940
 likely to start the baby phone 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:02.020

 First time we turn on this cell phone 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.800
