00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.410
 computer difference and we always 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 wants to show what 's best for 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.520

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.710
 interesting for your use 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.080
 but it 's no use you having a super pc 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.570
 high end to play for example and sit 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.140
 on a board that is why this time the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.400
 people are going to show a chair and also 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.529
 because we got a chair then 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.280
 We 'll show her that one here. 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.890
 jack freer is manufactured by 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.020
 ex max model is how you can see a 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.379
 All bold design is the proposal 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.239
 of the company that has several models 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.000
 this one is more for use in 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.030
 office and it's called the sos has several 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.699
 color options even she has 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.550
 all the settings you expect to occupy 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.079
 The same chair is this lever that the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.070
 people define while the backrest 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.730
 to lay 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.930
 here we have a button that rotates 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.990
 You can have the arm but not 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.659
 had this stop is this button goes 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.450
 forwards behind the backrest and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.729
 last setting goes up and down 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.470
 the settings you need to 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.090
 and of course you can define 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.189
 Chair height on lever here 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.350
 underneath the common settings of a 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.970
 chair but then it's cool to show 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.110
 What are the differentials you have here? 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.600
 in this model 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.180
 one of them for example is that the backrest 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.400
 lie down to 170 degrees 170 degrees if you 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.560
 Can not imagine without your head. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.329
 This is not enough to sleep in here. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.790
 Chair I think gave up more than 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.829
 180 degrees I'm afraid of falling 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.560
 She is as comfortable as she looks and is 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.659
 polyurethane coated 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.630
 material that imitates leather but does not kill 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.060
 kitty is all synthetic and this is the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.399
 Fairy head and lumbar 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.640
 are accessories are not all models 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.409
 who have the max come with them 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.710
 something else that can not be shown beyond 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.440
 from her comfort 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.539
 structure here in this chair 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.280
 is all built in aluminum is 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.680
 different from some that sometimes have the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.290
 components of the wood infection sometimes 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.510
 even thought and you can not trust 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.600
 how much does the chair hold annexins? 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.569
 promises to hold up to 150 kilograms 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.090
 diego already settled here she did not break 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.660
 aluminum inside out it is 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.760
 jeffrey resistant she always follows 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.830
 this line in all the models of it that 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.959
 it seems that this seat has been torn from 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.060
 a racing car by school has this 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.489
 name including she has models 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.500
 specific games and this one is 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.570
 more for office but that this design 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.840
 bold and everything else prevents 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.550
 You spend a few hours playing here. 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.800
 maxwell and mainly because of this 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.360
 Here, do not underestimate how 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.610
 comfortable enough to ensure 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.459
 What are you going to spend hours working on? 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.100
 playing in front of the pc and console without 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.989
 feel back pain that will end 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.030
 aching a little is the pocket the chair does not 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.660
 It's very cheap are $ 429 out there 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.700
 1,799 reais 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.310
 here in Brazil direct by deck fraser 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.980
 in the suggested value the investment is a 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.590
 little salty but then it's worth you 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.880
 consider what will bring more hours 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.739
 happy game 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.500
 a video card that guarantees two 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.540
 films for a second plus a chair that 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.860
 guarantees two hours more of gaming 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.329
 on two backs 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.329
 it is a matter of deciding the priorities 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.599
 do not shake me 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.599
 the action to the area
