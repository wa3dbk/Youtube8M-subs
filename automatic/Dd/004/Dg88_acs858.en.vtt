and then the combination exercise where

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.759 
and then the combination exercise where
we're<00:00:27.630> going<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> take<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.260> first<00:00:28.529> two

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
we're going to take the first two

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.310 
we're going to take the first two
exercises<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.820> combine<00:00:30.449> them<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:31.019> really

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
exercises and combine them to really

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.040 
exercises and combine them to really
just<00:00:31.529> finish<00:00:31.920> off<00:00:32.099> those<00:00:32.309> chest<00:00:32.700> muscles<00:00:33.050> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
just finish off those chest muscles the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.299 
just finish off those chest muscles the
exercise<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.770> pretty<00:00:35.010> simple

exercise is going to be pretty simple

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.389 
exercise is going to be pretty simple
we're<00:00:35.969> gonna<00:00:36.090> try<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.660> 15<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.469> 20<00:00:37.890> reps<00:00:38.190> of

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
we're gonna try and do 15 to 20 reps of

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.910 
we're gonna try and do 15 to 20 reps of
each<00:00:38.640> exercise<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.469> second

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
each exercise and as you do the second

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.650 
each exercise and as you do the second
and<00:00:41.010> third<00:00:41.430> circuit<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.300> want<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.510> make<00:00:42.629> sure

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and third circuit you want to make sure

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.779 
and third circuit you want to make sure
you<00:00:42.840> bring<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.200> down<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> ten<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.070> then<00:00:44.129> eight

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
you bring it down to ten and then eight

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.330 
you bring it down to ten and then eight
either<00:00:45.329> by<00:00:45.660> using<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.379> shorter<00:00:46.829> resistance

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
either by using a shorter resistance

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.400 
either by using a shorter resistance
band<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.760> make<00:00:47.789> sure<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.180> harder<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:48.899> heavier

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
band to make sure it's harder or heavier

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.189 
band to make sure it's harder or heavier
dumbbells<00:00:50.039> let's<00:00:51.000> check<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.480> out<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.930> you're

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
dumbbells let's check it out and you're

push-up but we're gonna bring their
resistance<00:01:05.189> bands<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:06.479> always<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> make<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
resistance bands in as always I make a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.500 
resistance bands in as always I make a
little<00:01:07.500> place<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.340> my<00:01:08.430> hand<00:01:08.670> at<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> side<00:01:09.180> on

handles<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.700> stuff<00:01:14.939> no<00:01:15.659> need<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.229> you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
handles and stuff no need for that you

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
handles and stuff no need for that you
just<00:01:16.979> pay<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> extra<00:01:17.670> handle<00:01:18.090> that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
just pay for the extra handle that

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.760 
just pay for the extra handle that
you're<00:01:18.840> never<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> use<00:01:19.380> anyway<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
you're never going to use anyway and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.550 
you're never going to use anyway and
then<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.210> gonna<00:01:21.360> make<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> bit

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
then you're just gonna make it a bit

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.469 
then you're just gonna make it a bit
shorter<00:01:22.590> may<00:01:23.130> choose<00:01:23.310> more<00:01:23.520> resistance<00:01:24.030> then

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
shorter may choose more resistance then

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.170 
shorter may choose more resistance then
put<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.200> behind<00:01:25.380> your<00:01:25.650> back<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
put that behind your back and just do a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.539 
put that behind your back and just do a
normal<00:01:27.270> push<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.600> from<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:28.130> nice<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.400> easy

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
normal push up from there nice and easy

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.660 
normal push up from there nice and easy
nice<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.360> wide<00:01:30.750> if<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.829> comes<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.159> close<00:01:32.430> we

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
nice and wide if it comes in close we

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.280 
nice and wide if it comes in close we
work<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.180> triceps<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.810> their<00:01:33.930> arms<00:01:34.140> too

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
work in the triceps in their arms too

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.840 
work in the triceps in their arms too
much<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.070> we're<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.189> gonna<00:01:35.340> start<00:01:35.640> off<00:01:35.729> a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
much so we're just gonna start off a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.840 
much so we're just gonna start off a
nice<00:01:36.060> wide<00:01:37.020> push-up<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> resistance

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
nice wide push-up with the resistance

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.359 
nice wide push-up with the resistance
band

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.069 

it's<00:01:43.369> too<00:01:43.549> easy<00:01:43.659> we<00:01:44.659> just<00:01:44.869> make<00:01:44.990> the

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
it's too easy we just make the

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.620 
it's too easy we just make the
resistance<00:01:45.500> bands<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.979> little<00:01:46.579> bit<00:01:46.750> shorter

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630
