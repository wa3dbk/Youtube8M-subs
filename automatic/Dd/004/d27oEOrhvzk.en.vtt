00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.810
 today we compare two types of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.920
 ovens we say for better than a2 brands of 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:20.700
 marsili forni 12 May 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:24.150
 sf tract one while the other is the 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.390
 hd movie 21 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.050
 let's start from the smeg oven first of all 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.180
 let's look at the structural features 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.440
 this oven to the main 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.859
 feature of having a cake with a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.109
 glass mounted without any screws 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.840
 which makes it much easier to clean 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.940
 and certainly also very trigiani co 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.120
 glass can even be taken apart in 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.469
 so you can clean it a lot more 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.969
 easily even under running water 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.780
 but let's say the features 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.310
 the main ones of this oven are six 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.570
 types of 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:10.320
 cooking then as you can see a 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.370
 between knobs one to adjust the timer 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.780
 to adjust the temperature then up 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.640
 at most 250 degrees and these instead 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.750
 in which it is divided into six functions 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.190
 main 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.440
 then one is the pizza function that 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.990
 matches the fan and resistance to 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.440
 cricket plus resistance then the sole 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.240
 resistance that is down here on 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.490
 operation of the fan precisely 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.100
 combined both the grill and the resistance 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.940
 lower ensures homogeneous cooking 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.680
 even for complex ideal recipes not 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.520
 only for pizzas but also for 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.380
 for biscuits and cakes 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.020
 then we have cooking this kind of 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.300
 cooking that is static cooking that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.729
 that in short is the most classic and the 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.880
 heat comes both from above and from 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.610
 low and makes this system suitable for 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.140
 cook any kind of food we say 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.259
 but unlike other types of 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.800
 culture that we saw then indicated for 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:18.360
 one dish at a time for example for 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:22.160
 roasted stuffed bread cakes 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.380
 or especially for meat 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.380
 then we have the resistance 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.480
 then grill the heat that comes from 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.640
 green allows you to get excellent 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.170
 grilling results above all 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.430
 precisely with medium and small meats 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.770
 thickness and in combination with others 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.020
 functions where these are provided as 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:48.750
 for example some types of always 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:52.260
 smog oven provided for the rotisserie after 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.600
 green culture we have the fan more 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.410
 the sole resistance and then a cooking 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:02.430
 delicate and in short, to choose 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.870
 especially in case you don't 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.940
 want to warm the surface superficially 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.730
 let's say the food but maybe you need to 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.820
 warm it up and not wanting to increase it 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.340
 top cooking comes 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.230
 is lit on the underside and the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.930
 fan which therefore makes a little more 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.760
 uniform heat within the del 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:34.050
 oven then we have the fan plus the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:36.760
 green resistance and this is above all 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.590
 we say recommended for a tour grill 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.050
 optimal even for large foods 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.370
 thick especially large cuts of 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:48.070
 meat and sweetens the I sell it 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.840
 fan turning the sweets conceals the wave of 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.160
 heat coming from the grill and then 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.950
 makes it a little more tenuous 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.560
 the last one is the fan with the most resistance 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.810
 sky and sole resistance and the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.790
 operation of the combined fan 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.350
 to traditional culture ensures 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.020
 homogeneous culture also in recipes 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.990
 complex ideal especially for i 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.610
 then leavened biscuits and cakes that 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.930
 can be cooked in this case 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.940
 even more on more levels 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.040
 precisely because the heat comes from 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.380
 from top to bottom and with the fan there 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.090
 just an absolute homogeneity of 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.090
 temperature inside the oven 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.240
 about the cooking and pizza mode 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.680
 this oven in particular to like 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.890
 optional and inside the stone 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.280
 refractory then the special stone 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.800
 refractories plus pizza making do in 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.780
 so that in just three or four minutes or 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.060
 at most 5 if it is really 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.200
 much more stuffed pizzas much more 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.420
 challenging 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.170
 the product has a cooking reaches 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.900
 an optimal cooking supplied with 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:01.370
 this product you will find a basin 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.620
 40 mm deep often a grid the 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.050
 refractory stone which is this that yes 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.900
 sees knox here writes the 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.230
 refractory stone and a scoop for 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.230
 Pizza 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.370
 now we analyze more in detail 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.860
 instead the siemens hd 21 oven before 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.400
 we all say that it is a class except the 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.350
 20 percent and an internal volume of 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.360
 67 liters 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.240
 the main feature of this 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:37.850
 oven are the five cooking functions 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:40.790
 in fact with multilevel cooking that 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.520
 you see here that inside open at 5 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:47.180
 different heights with cooking 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.790
 multilevel relation of the united fan 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.680
 to the circular resistance it creates a jet 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.540
 hot air that spreads every iron 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.430
 evenly inside the oven 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.310
 thus ensuring a temperature 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.590
 homogeneous of each level and with rosita 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.540
 then really cooking results 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.330
 very good 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.700
 in this way they can also be cooked 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.800
 you can even think of cooking different 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:15.680
 flat and simultaneously without 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.630
 mixture of smells and tastes a 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.540
 another feature that is that of 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.760
 rapid heating 15 you get to 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.380
 depending on the temperatures up to a 40 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.220
 percent savings 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.950
 in terms of time for heating 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.410
 as for the interior also in 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.540
 this case the walls and the oven are 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.730
 coated with an electrified enamel 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.740
 which makes cleaning much easier 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:44.490
 of the oven and in the same case precisely 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.700
 as in the smog 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.340
 also in this case the door ea 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:53.640
 all glass and then with a simple one 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:56.120
 movement take off this part and the 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.280
 glass can be removed and washed 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.380
 separately in order to clean it better 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.980
 and to be able to treat it also in a way 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:09.050
 best in the box below you will find 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.310
 the link to these two products in which 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:15.680
 you will be able to see them again 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.680
 features and know the prices
