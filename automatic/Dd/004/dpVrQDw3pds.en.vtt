essentially<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.880> boils<00:00:15.059> down<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.480> getting<00:00:16.170> an

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
essentially it boils down to getting an

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.890 
essentially it boils down to getting an
uplink<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.670> building<00:00:18.180> four<00:00:18.390> satellites

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
uplink and building four satellites

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.630 
uplink and building four satellites
that's<00:00:19.170> expensive<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.070> need<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.369> follow<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
that's expensive you need to follow a

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.000 
that's expensive you need to follow a
strict<00:00:20.939> strategy<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:22.439> I'm<00:00:22.619> going<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.859> show

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
strict strategy but I'm going to show

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.179 
strict strategy but I'm going to show
you<00:00:23.039> how<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:24.439> okay<00:00:25.439> once<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.890> begin

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
you how to do it okay once you begin

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.820 
you how to do it okay once you begin
you'll<00:00:27.090> want<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.449> take<00:00:27.660> your<00:00:27.869> PES<00:00:28.199> base<00:00:28.439> it's

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
you'll want to take your PES base it's

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.139 
you'll want to take your PES base it's
not<00:00:29.010> necessary<00:00:30.380> but<00:00:31.380> since<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.700> random

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
not necessary but since this is random

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.380 
not necessary but since this is random
as<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:34.320> don't<00:00:34.500> want<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.890> depend<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
as it is you don't want to depend on the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
as it is you don't want to depend on the
counsel<00:00:36.840> mission<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.350> reduce<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.890> panic

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
counsel mission to reduce the panic

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.420 
counsel mission to reduce the panic
level<00:00:38.989> because<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.410> don't<00:00:40.620> get<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.860> council

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
level because if you don't get a council

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.190 
level because if you don't get a council
mission<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.030> country<00:00:42.420> where<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.870> need<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
mission in a country where you need the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.590 
mission in a country where you need the
panic<00:00:43.590> reduction<00:00:44.160> then<00:00:44.940> you're<00:00:45.210> probably

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
panic reduction then you're probably

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.490 
panic reduction then you're probably
going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.899> get<00:00:45.989> flagged<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.640> yeah<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.940> satellite

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
going to get flagged so yeah a satellite

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.590 
going to get flagged so yeah a satellite
costs<00:00:49.500> 100<00:00:50.070> credits<00:00:50.820> whatever<00:00:51.270> they<00:00:51.570> are

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
costs 100 credits whatever they are

costs 100 credits whatever they are
credits<00:00:52.289> dollars<00:00:52.710> whatever<00:00:53.180> but<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.360> can't

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
credits dollars whatever but this can't

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.900 
credits dollars whatever but this can't
will<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:54.989> reduced<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.590> 77<00:00:56.309> once<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.640> get<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
will be reduced to 77 once you get the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
will be reduced to 77 once you get the
first<00:00:57.149> first<00:00:57.660> batch<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.440> engineers<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
first first batch of for engineers you

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.990 
first first batch of for engineers you
need<00:00:59.609> one<00:01:00.600> engineer<00:01:01.219> besides<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.489> five<00:01:02.760> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
need one engineer besides the five you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.729 
need one engineer besides the five you
already<00:01:03.239> start<00:01:03.510> off<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> actually<00:01:04.290> get

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
already start off with to actually get

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.070 
already start off with to actually get
or<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.850> actually<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.299> able<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.540> build<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
or to actually be able to build a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.240 
or to actually be able to build a
workshop<00:01:08.960> but<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.170> know<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.619> four<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
workshop but you know you get four and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.850 
workshop but you know you get four and
they<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.430> reduce<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> cost<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.720> items<00:01:13.290> that

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
they do reduce the cost of items that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.700 
they do reduce the cost of items that
you<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.040> satellites<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.689> yeah<00:01:15.869> very

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
you have satellites so yeah very

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.770 
you have satellites so yeah very
difficult<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.549> impossible<00:01:17.700> means<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
difficult and impossible means that

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.510 
difficult and impossible means that
you'll<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> fight<00:01:19.590> 12<00:01:19.920> SEC<00:01:20.130> toads<00:01:20.430> I

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you'll have to fight 12 SEC toads I

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.160 
you'll have to fight 12 SEC toads I
don't<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.850> another<00:01:21.299> difficulties<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.140> be

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
don't know another difficulties to be

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.600 
don't know another difficulties to be
honest<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.560> haven't<00:01:22.799> played<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.310> any<00:01:23.460> other

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
honest I haven't played on any other

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.760 
honest I haven't played on any other
difficult<00:01:24.299> besides<00:01:24.600> impossible<00:01:25.200> Ironman<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
difficult besides impossible Ironman I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.109 
difficult besides impossible Ironman I
tried

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
tried

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.289 
tried
classical<00:01:28.049> once<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> tutorial<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
classical once with the tutorial it and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.359 
classical once with the tutorial it and
I<00:01:30.840> quit<00:01:31.549> it<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.880> seems<00:01:33.150> very<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.189> seemed

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
I quit it just seems very it just seemed

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.580 
I quit it just seems very it just seemed
very<00:01:35.460> easy<00:01:35.939> actually<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:37.229> shouldn't

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
very easy actually that shouldn't

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
very easy actually that shouldn't
surprise<00:01:37.680> me<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.180> yeah<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
surprise me really so yeah go to the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
surprise me really so yeah go to the
first<00:01:40.530> mission<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.899> within<00:01:44.600> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
first mission if you get it within the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
first mission if you get it within the
first<00:01:45.810> 5<00:01:46.020> days<00:01:46.320> once<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.770> begin<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> campaign

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
first 5 days once you begin the campaign

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.420 
first 5 days once you begin the campaign
as<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.450> 26<00:01:49.200> days<00:01:49.470> until<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.070> console

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
as in you have 26 days until the console

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.600 
as in you have 26 days until the console
report<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.740> though

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
report then you you can do this though

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.850 
report then you you can do this though
it's<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.060> very<00:01:54.600> close<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.710> edge

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it's going to be very close to the edge

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.880 
it's going to be very close to the edge
essentially<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:57.899> been<00:01:58.140> able<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.770> do

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
essentially I have not been able to do

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.520 
essentially I have not been able to do
it<00:01:59.009> at<00:01:59.430> least<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.880> was<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.090> me<00:02:00.390> here

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
it at least it was for me here

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.300 
it at least it was for me here
preferably<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.729> best<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.310> within

don't even bother you're not going to be
able<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.510> do<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.800> here<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.370> 25<00:02:26.910> days<00:02:27.180> I

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
able to do it so here I have 25 days I

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.000 
able to do it so here I have 25 days I
was<00:02:29.550> trying<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.940> sell<00:02:30.180> stuff<00:02:30.870> you're<00:02:31.140> thinking

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
was trying to sell stuff you're thinking

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.530 
was trying to sell stuff you're thinking
that<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.190> might<00:02:32.520> be<00:02:32.670> able<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.910> afford<00:02:33.270> four

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
that I might be able to afford four

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.510 
that I might be able to afford four
satellites<00:02:34.050> not<00:02:34.620> going<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.980> happen

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
satellites not going to happen

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.420 
satellites not going to happen
so<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.240> waited<00:02:37.020> for<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.440> first<00:02:37.590> UFO<00:02:38.070> mission

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
so I waited for the first UFO mission

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.840 
so I waited for the first UFO mission
when<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.720> day<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:39.959> get<00:02:40.230> these<00:02:40.440> mission<00:02:40.980> does

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
when the day you get these mission does

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.660 
when the day you get these mission does
vary<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.570> not<00:02:42.720> something<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:44.310> can<00:02:44.490> make

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
vary so it's not something you can make

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.110 
vary so it's not something you can make
a<00:02:44.700> guy<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.330> it's<00:02:45.450> completely<00:02:46.020> random<00:02:46.520> but<00:02:47.520> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
a guy for it's completely random but the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.120 
a guy for it's completely random but the
general<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.870> just<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.170> general<00:02:49.530> strategy

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
general this is just a general strategy

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.740 
general this is just a general strategy
on<00:02:50.220> what<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.520> should<00:02:50.550> do<00:02:50.940> get<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.540> four

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
on what you should do get the four

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.150 
on what you should do get the four
engineers<00:02:53.090> do<00:02:54.090> they<00:02:54.239> offer<00:02:54.630> mission<00:02:55.170> sell<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
engineers do they offer mission sell the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.580 
engineers do they offer mission sell the
components<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.989> have<00:02:58.110> enough<00:02:58.230> much

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
components so that you have enough much

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.360 
components so that you have enough much
money<00:02:59.250> for<00:03:00.380> well<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.410> start<00:03:01.830> off<00:03:01.980> with<00:03:02.130> enough

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
money for well you start off with enough

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.820 
money for well you start off with enough
money<00:03:02.640> for<00:03:02.940> workshop<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.780> use<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.200> once<00:03:04.739> you

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
money for workshop so use that once you

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
money for workshop so use that once you
get<00:03:04.920> four<00:03:05.190> engineers

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
get four engineers

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.150 
get four engineers
Denzil<00:03:06.660> components<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.470> be<00:03:07.680> able<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.890> build

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
Denzil components to be able to build

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.330 
Denzil components to be able to build
four<00:03:09.150> satellites<00:03:09.770> once<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:10.860> get<00:03:11.010> those<00:03:11.160> four

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
four satellites once you get those four

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.820 
four satellites once you get those four
engineers<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.000> cost<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.480> each<00:03:13.050> satellite<00:03:13.410> is

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
engineers the cost of each satellite is

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.140 
engineers the cost of each satellite is
77<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.390> comes<00:03:15.989> up<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.350> grand<00:03:16.590> total<00:03:16.680> of

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
77 so that comes up to a grand total of

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.320 
77 so that comes up to a grand total of
308<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.900> don't<00:03:19.140> necessarily<00:03:19.290> need<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.430> four

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
308 you don't necessarily need a four

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.690 
308 you don't necessarily need a four
satellites<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.290> might<00:03:22.920> want<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.340> add<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:25.700> does

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
satellites I might want to add that does

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.390 
satellites I might want to add that does
this<00:03:26.940> restrict<00:03:27.930> your<00:03:28.080> play<00:03:28.410> if<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:29.130> want<00:03:29.160> to

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
this restrict your play if you want to

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.979 
this restrict your play if you want to
get<00:03:29.580> this<00:03:29.730> yes<00:03:30.090> definitely<00:03:30.570> because<00:03:30.690> you're

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
get this yes definitely because you're

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.600 
get this yes definitely because you're
restricted<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.799> starting<00:03:32.280> off<00:03:32.459> with

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
restricted to you starting off with

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.880 
restricted to you starting off with
Europe<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.269> think<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.810> might<00:03:34.200> be<00:03:34.410> possible<00:03:34.590> to

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
Europe I think it might be possible to

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.310 
Europe I think it might be possible to
pull<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.340> off<00:03:35.580> not<00:03:35.910> with<00:03:36.120> four<00:03:36.420> satellites<00:03:37.049> but

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
pull it off not with four satellites but

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.870 
pull it off not with four satellites but
I<00:03:37.350> think<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.680> might<00:03:37.890> be<00:03:37.920> possible<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.519> pull<00:03:38.760> it

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
I think it might be possible to pull it

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.910 
I think it might be possible to pull it
off<00:03:39.060> with<00:03:39.239> at<00:03:39.390> least<00:03:39.540> three<00:03:40.019> satellites<00:03:40.620> if

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
off with at least three satellites if

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.460 
off with at least three satellites if
you<00:03:41.340> pick<00:03:41.519> another<00:03:41.549> country<00:03:42.360> but<00:03:43.080> yeah<00:03:43.260> this

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
you pick another country but yeah this

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.440 
you pick another country but yeah this
is<00:03:43.530> definitely<00:03:43.769> with<00:03:44.580> Europe<00:03:44.820> some<00:03:45.299> guy

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
is definitely with Europe some guy

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.140 
is definitely with Europe some guy
actually<00:03:45.690> made<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.140> guide<00:03:46.760> where<00:03:47.760> he<00:03:47.970> got

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
actually made the guide where he got

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.780 
actually made the guide where he got
where<00:03:51.150> he<00:03:51.330> was<00:03:51.480> able<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:52.220> complete<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> campaign

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
where he was able to complete a campaign

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.420 
where he was able to complete a campaign
without<00:03:54.090> losing<00:03:54.390> any<00:03:54.510> country<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.430> he

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
without losing any country and he

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.150 
without losing any country and he
suggested<00:03:57.090> using<00:03:57.269> North<00:03:57.570> America<00:03:58.200> hmm<00:03:58.739> might

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
suggested using North America hmm might

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.430 
suggested using North America hmm might
work<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.549> guess<00:04:00.680> anyway<00:04:02.870> salt<00:04:03.870> those<00:04:04.080> damaged

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
work I guess anyway salt those damaged

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.110 
work I guess anyway salt those damaged

saw<00:04:09.480> these<00:04:09.630> components<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.290> can<00:04:10.470> do<00:04:10.620> some

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
saw these components you can do some

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.440 
saw these components you can do some
research<00:04:11.070> do<00:04:11.489> research<00:04:11.880> with<00:04:12.060> weapon

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
research do research with weapon

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.270 
research do research with weapon
fragments<00:04:12.900> because<00:04:12.989> each<00:04:13.320> weapon<00:04:13.620> fragment

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
fragments because each weapon fragment

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.580 
fragments because each weapon fragment
is<00:04:14.400> only<00:04:14.579> worth<00:04:14.940> one<00:04:15.239> credit<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:15.989> you're<00:04:16.440> not

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
is only worth one credit so you're not

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.599 
is only worth one credit so you're not
going<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.859> miss<00:04:17.040> them<00:04:18.890> unless<00:04:19.890> you're<00:04:20.370> doing

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
going to miss them unless you're doing

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.279 
going to miss them unless you're doing
this<00:04:20.820> without<00:04:21.000> Europe<00:04:21.570> unless<00:04:21.810> you're<00:04:22.020> trying

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
this without Europe unless you're trying

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.870 
this without Europe unless you're trying
to<00:04:22.440> do<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:22.680> without<00:04:22.860> your<00:04:23.310> obtaining<00:04:23.729> might

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
to do this without your obtaining might

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.250 
to do this without your obtaining might
want<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.180> consider<00:04:24.660> whether<00:04:24.990> or<00:04:25.080> not<00:04:25.169> you

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
want to consider whether or not you

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.150 
want to consider whether or not you
actually<00:04:25.650> want<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:25.890> do<00:04:26.099> research<00:04:26.430> I

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
actually want to do research I

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.200 
actually want to do research I
personally<00:04:27.580> did<00:04:27.760> research<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:29.820> here<00:04:30.820> I<00:04:30.850> began

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
personally did research and here I began

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.940 
personally did research and here I began
building<00:04:31.420> satellites<00:04:31.840> so<00:04:32.380> that's<00:04:32.710> for

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
building satellites so that's for

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.950 
building satellites so that's for
satellites<00:04:33.490> but<00:04:33.760> keep<00:04:34.090> in<00:04:34.240> mind<00:04:34.270> you<00:04:34.540> do<00:04:34.750> need

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
satellites but keep in mind you do need

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.260 
satellites but keep in mind you do need
the<00:04:35.140> satellite<00:04:35.770> uplink<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:36.970> need<00:04:37.150> to

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
the satellite uplink and you need to

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.240 
the satellite uplink and you need to
build<00:04:37.390> it<00:04:37.630> next<00:04:38.170> to<00:04:38.290> the<00:04:38.470> satellite<00:04:38.890> uplink

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
build it next to the satellite uplink

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.270 
build it next to the satellite uplink
with<00:04:39.580> which<00:04:39.820> you<00:04:39.970> start<00:04:40.000> with<00:04:40.800> but<00:04:41.800> first<00:04:42.130> you

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
with which you start with but first you

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.120 
with which you start with but first you
need<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.460> workshop<00:04:42.940> obviously<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:44.740> yeah<00:04:44.860> I

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
need the workshop obviously so yeah I

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.480 
need the workshop obviously so yeah I
got<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.090> cut<00:04:46.270> a<00:04:46.450> console<00:04:47.230> mission<00:04:47.620> in<00:04:48.370> a

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
got to cut a console mission in a

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.430 
got to cut a console mission in a
country<00:04:48.910> which<00:04:49.210> actually<00:04:49.600> needed<00:04:49.990> panic

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
country which actually needed panic

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.800 
country which actually needed panic
reduction<00:04:51.340> which<00:04:51.760> was<00:04:51.970> very<00:04:52.390> useful<00:04:52.510> you

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
reduction which was very useful you

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.050 
reduction which was very useful you
don't<00:04:53.050> necessarily<00:04:53.200> get<00:04:53.830> council<00:04:54.640> mission<00:04:54.940> a

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
don't necessarily get council mission a

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.150 
don't necessarily get council mission a
country<00:04:55.420> which<00:04:55.660> does<00:04:56.140> need<00:04:56.440> parent<00:04:56.860> Accord

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
country which does need parent Accord

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.420 
country which does need parent Accord
action<00:04:57.550> so<00:04:58.360> so<00:04:58.780> that's<00:04:58.930> again<00:04:59.680> random<00:05:00.190> it's

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
action so so that's again random it's

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.790 
action so so that's again random it's
not<00:05:00.640> something<00:05:00.940> you<00:05:01.030> can<00:05:01.210> control

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
not something you can control

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.560 
not something you can control

gonna skip the alien abduction mission

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.909 
gonna skip the alien abduction mission
because<00:06:30.669> I<00:06:30.970> actually<00:06:31.180> didn't<00:06:31.780> actually<00:06:32.680> was

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
because I actually didn't actually was

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.370 
because I actually didn't actually was
going<00:06:33.160> to<00:06:33.250> get<00:06:33.340> four<00:06:33.520> satellites<00:06:34.060> and<00:06:34.300> and<00:06:35.080> I

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
going to get four satellites and and I

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.930 
going to get four satellites and and I
only<00:06:35.560> had<00:06:35.800> one<00:06:35.830> country<00:06:36.580> that<00:06:36.610> was

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
only had one country that was

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.060 
only had one country that was
threatening<00:06:37.180> to<00:06:37.360> leave<00:06:37.780> so<00:06:38.229> three<00:06:38.890> more

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070 
threatening to leave so three more

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.230 
threatening to leave so three more
countries<00:06:39.550> was<00:06:39.789> something<00:06:40.120> I<00:06:40.180> could<00:06:40.360> do

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
countries was something I could do

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.880 
countries was something I could do
again<00:06:43.240> this<00:06:43.420> can't<00:06:43.780> vary<00:06:44.080> because<00:06:44.350> the<00:06:44.710> game

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
again this can't vary because the game

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.030 
again this can't vary because the game
is<00:06:45.070> just<00:06:45.970> so<00:06:46.240> random<00:06:46.510> but<00:06:47.020> yeah<00:06:47.260> here<00:06:47.650> I<00:06:47.680> pulled

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
is just so random but yeah here I pulled

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.290 
is just so random but yeah here I pulled
it<00:06:48.220> off<00:06:49.410> yeah<00:06:50.410> it's<00:06:50.560> definitely<00:06:50.710> possible

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
it off yeah it's definitely possible

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.130 
it off yeah it's definitely possible
it's<00:06:52.300> definitely<00:06:52.720> doable

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
it's definitely doable

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.290 
it's definitely doable
to<00:06:53.740> finish<00:06:53.980> the<00:06:54.400> first<00:06:54.550> month<00:06:54.850> of<00:06:55.000> the<00:06:55.060> game

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
to finish the first month of the game

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.080 
to finish the first month of the game
without<00:06:55.630> losing<00:06:56.020> any<00:06:56.200> nation<00:06:56.860> and<00:06:57.100> this<00:06:57.910> is

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
without losing any nation and this is

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.710 
without losing any nation and this is
how<00:06:58.210> you<00:06:58.300> do<00:06:58.510> it<00:06:58.920> again<00:06:59.920> it<00:07:00.550> does<00:07:00.760> vary<00:07:01.120> I<00:07:01.390> can't

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
how you do it again it does vary I can't

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.390 
how you do it again it does vary I can't
stress<00:07:02.020> this<00:07:02.170> enough<00:07:02.230> and<00:07:02.770> you<00:07:02.830> can't<00:07:03.130> to<00:07:03.250> lose

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 
stress this enough and you can't to lose

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.000 
stress this enough and you can't to lose
any<00:07:03.550> of<00:07:03.670> the<00:07:03.790> first<00:07:04.000> missions<00:07:04.450> but<00:07:04.960> here<00:07:05.770> it<00:07:05.860> is
