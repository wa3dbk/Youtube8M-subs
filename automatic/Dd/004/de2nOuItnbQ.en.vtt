00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
anyway back to the point they brought

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.090 
anyway back to the point they brought
this<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:03.870> two<00:01:03.989> reasons<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.470> first<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.979> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this in for two reasons the first to it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.160 
this in for two reasons the first to it
firstly<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.030> player<00:01:06.330> prices<00:01:06.810> would<00:01:06.990> just

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
firstly the player prices would just

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.960 
firstly the player prices would just
keep<00:01:07.320> their<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.040> kept<00:01:08.220> rising<00:01:08.430> because

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
keep their you just kept rising because

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.310 
keep their you just kept rising because
the<00:01:09.180> coins<00:01:09.390> were<00:01:09.479> getting<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:09.869> cheap<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the coins were getting so cheap and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.649 
the coins were getting so cheap and
player<00:01:10.890> prices<00:01:11.400> were<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.790> extortionate<00:01:12.540> it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
player prices were just extortionate it

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.149 
player prices were just extortionate it
was<00:01:12.780> ridiculous<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> normal<00:01:13.979> average

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
was ridiculous like a normal average

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.070 
was ridiculous like a normal average
user<00:01:14.580> couldn't<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.420> able<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> play<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> game

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
but now a normal average user coming to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.660 
but now a normal average user coming to
play<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> game<00:01:19.560> still<00:01:20.130> can't<00:01:20.400> play<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.640 
every other game it's just terrible but
back<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.600> point<00:02:54.630> where<00:02:55.020> we<00:02:55.140> had<00:02:55.320> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
back to the point where we had the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.320 
back to the point where we had the
minimum<00:02:56.010> maximum<00:02:56.190> price<00:02:56.640> now<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.120> lot<00:02:57.300> of

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
minimum maximum price now a lot of

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.420 
minimum maximum price now a lot of
people<00:02:57.420> been<00:02:57.720> asking<00:02:57.840> me<00:02:58.080> okay<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.710> understand

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
people been asking me okay I understand

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.610 
people been asking me okay I understand
it's<00:02:59.730> one<00:02:59.850> of<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.000> maximum<00:03:00.420> price<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.350> feel

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
it's one of the maximum price and I feel

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.400 
it's one of the maximum price and I feel
that's<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.430> good<00:03:02.730> idea<00:03:02.910> i<00:03:03.180> guess<00:03:03.510> but<00:03:04.050> what<00:03:04.230> if

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
that's a good idea i guess but what if

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.660 
that's a good idea i guess but what if
they<00:03:04.530> brought<00:03:04.710> in<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.920> minimum<00:03:05.130> price<00:03:05.400> now

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
they brought in the minimum price now

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.190 
they brought in the minimum price now
the<00:03:06.060> reason<00:03:06.210> why<00:03:06.420> they<00:03:06.540> brought<00:03:06.660> in<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.900> minimum

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
the reason why they brought in a minimum

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.140 
the reason why they brought in a minimum
price<00:03:07.410> if<00:03:07.650> they<00:03:08.040> didn't<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
price if they didn't have that the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.880 
price if they didn't have that the
player<00:03:09.420> over<00:03:09.720> time<00:03:09.930> would<00:03:10.140> decrease<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.680> value

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
player over time would decrease in value

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.560 
player over time would decrease in value
and<00:03:11.280> he<00:03:11.490> probably<00:03:11.730> would<00:03:12.000> only<00:03:12.150> go<00:03:12.330> for

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
and he probably would only go for

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.120 
and he probably would only go for
discard<00:03:12.960> so<00:03:13.170> depending<00:03:13.530> on<00:03:13.590> if<00:03:13.710> it's<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.920> rare

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
discard so depending on if it's a rare

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.460 
discard so depending on if it's a rare
or<00:03:14.250> non<00:03:14.490> rare<00:03:14.700> 300<00:03:15.330> coins<00:03:15.480> are<00:03:15.720> worth<00:03:15.780> 650

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
or non rare 300 coins are worth 650

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.250 
or non rare 300 coins are worth 650
coins<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.100> now<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.880> gap<00:03:18.240> between<00:03:18.480> him<00:03:19.080> being

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
coins and now that gap between him being

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.770 
coins and now that gap between him being
discard<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.190> maximum<00:03:20.670> price<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.210> enough

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
discard to that maximum price is enough

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.720 
discard to that maximum price is enough
for<00:03:21.810> coin<00:03:22.110> sellers<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.620> use<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:23.100> actually<00:03:23.280> sell

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
for coin sellers to use to actually sell

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.160 
for coin sellers to use to actually sell
coins<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.390> that's<00:03:24.570> why<00:03:24.690> they're<00:03:24.870> putting<00:03:25.110> a

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
coins so that's why they're putting a

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.570 
coins so that's why they're putting a
minimum<00:03:25.500> maximum<00:03:25.650> price<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.250> they've<00:03:26.340> also

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
minimum maximum price and they've also

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.390 
minimum maximum price and they've also
brought<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.210> in<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.870> test<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.740> actual<00:03:29.040> sort

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
brought that in to test the actual sort

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.830 
brought that in to test the actual sort
of<00:03:29.460> restricted<00:03:29.940> market<00:03:30.300> for<00:03:30.480> when<00:03:30.600> they<00:03:30.690> can

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
of restricted market for when they can

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.690 
of restricted market for when they can
use<00:03:31.020> a<00:03:31.050> fixed<00:03:31.320> marketing<00:03:31.740> people<00:03:31.980> 15<00:03:32.280> that's

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
use a fixed marketing people 15 that's

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.510 
use a fixed marketing people 15 that's
honestly<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.270> way<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.690> game<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:33.900> going<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:34.860> in

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
honestly the way the game is going so in

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.250 
honestly the way the game is going so in
terms<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.210> user<00:03:36.540> picking<00:03:36.930> up<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.110> game
