00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.759
 opening intro epic and gap today I give you 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.130
 welcome to this top six of the 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.930
 best villains in video games 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.820
 we started the countdown with the infamous 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.379
 profile the twin brother of dante is a 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.270
 charismatic character like few 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.280
 one of those hard guys who spend everything 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.839
 and that they carry a big sword and sometimes 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.879
 in the bad days a different hairstyle 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.530
 but focusing on what really 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.150
 matter what is the rivalry between these 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.430
 two brothers could not be more 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.440
 fucking epic the two enjoy a 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.570
 different and devilish person never 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.909
 rather, by the way they are half demon 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.530
 and half human are the fucking masters 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.580
 in the underworld as in the real world and 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.170
 they also have personality 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.360
 developers that if there was not 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.220
 it is clear that personality is what 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.650
 makes a character big and not the size 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.330
 of his sword although good size 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.799
 it also matters so much the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.119
 repercussion has had this brother 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.430
 damn that the fans were screaming 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.260
 remakes with him and so they were granted 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.630
 having games exclusively of Verdi 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.369
 and a pity , however, is that it ended 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.979
 at the hands of worlds converted into the 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.570
 angelo with a thin armor that only 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.470
 we could describe in medieval style 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.470
 pretty tacky 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.880
 good good good number 5 if the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.380
 you have seen it infamous to wait 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.229
 see this because number 5 occupies it 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.759
 nothing less than albert wesker if it is 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.990
 truth is true it seems that capcom me 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.670
 I would have made an appeal but 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.530
 quiet has not been like that rather they are 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.570
 the fucking masters creating epic types in 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.039
 Japs generally wear them folded 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.350
 and the truth is that this is going well 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.630
 Albert Wesker is that infamous character 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.880
 that you always crack chaos destruction 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.310
 and death and even zombies and plagues by 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.869
 where does that happen if you always do it without 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.420
 lose a moment of chivalry 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.819
 being a true gentleman and always 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.009
 with some manners except clear with their 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.959
 grotesque transformations do not care 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.239
 how many times do you kill him either by grinding 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.920
 what sent him simply killing what 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.750
 my god who is always there to 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.660
 dedicate your best smile as 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.239
 telling you I am immortal and you do not like that 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.540
 what do you fuck bargela in short Alberto 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:25.250
 albertito a wesker is a blond possessor 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.250
 of the virus you with a lot of kind 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.780
 and stomping we get to number 4 and 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.930
 in this position we find ourselves with 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.850
 Andrew Ryan I know it should not be 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.590
 cataloged as a villain as such but in 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.780
 the bottom that's the idea that you have until 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.370
 that you find him he is the father of 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.680
 rapture the city gave you name and 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.760
 prestige in the bioshock saga 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.710
 possibly one of the best games 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.360
 of the previous generation we 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.010
 we move to his infamous world we 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.590
 we put in a mind of an authentic 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.690
 genius a creator of ideas a designer 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.730
 of dreams an authentic underwater city 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.460
 and a misunderstood idea and 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.920
 unfortunately manipulated his death not 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.750
 could be more unexpected by giving us a 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.400
 breath of fresh air and also we 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.990
 generated a 100 level molding face 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.820
 who recognized us on the street or from 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.920
 fuck to des summer its authentic history 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.870
 and the whole truth I do not want to do spoiler 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.670
 but believe me this gentleman deserves 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.690
 your andrew striptease attention 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.690
 Ryan Striptease 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.740
 and now we sneak into number 3 with 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.170
 a well-known villain who will be 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.360
 who will be obviously winning the 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.760
 kidnap illa the ball touches him 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.110
 Narigudo redhead Mr. Ganondorf is 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.750
 In short, the Lord of Darkness 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.360
 and the bad guy from the mythical chasm 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.950
 saga and masterpiece of the cell with a 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.360
 immense power and an evil mind and 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.370
 great this appearance monster 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.110
 stake out attacks our nerves in each 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.150
 sequence of the cells in each 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.740
 appearance and it also creates impotence and 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.750
 fear of knowing that we can not touch him 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.360
 to overcome the endless tests 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.850
 temples puzzles get the trifuerza 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.920
 of the damn cells we also 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.830
 wait to end up being witnesses 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.510
 present with our command of combats 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.790
 Ethics that are not erased from memory 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.650
 easily cell must always be 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.020
 saved and it's always because of this 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.640
 villain in my personal case my battle 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.200
 preferred is that of win dorff in the 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.200
 wind waker which is yours 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.750
 there is no 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.900
 no major problem hinders where the 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.360
 we already arrived at the silver with the number 2 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.910
 of the top who will occupy it because he could not 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.800
 be another that stir ocelot snake is 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.720
 he's really a good spy, maybe big boss 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.430
 it was not too why do not you look two 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.380
 times the best spy in the history of 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.990
 video games is and will always be the 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.120
 ovalote revolver remind you with it is and 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.620
 will always be ocelot a guy who will never 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.389
 he stood out for his combat skills 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.430
 as big boss or snake but yes for his 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.410
 intelligence its universal gray matter 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.449
 your devilish plans your false 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.190
 identities of course his cunning and his 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.300
 cold blood that take it to the max 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.699
 secrecy and what makes you think 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.440
 constantly as for example their 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.970
 brilliant performances replacing 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.560
 liquid and adopting his personality to 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.120
 finally win the battle of his life and 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.400
 carry out the dream of big boss and of 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.860
 your daimon dogs and if that 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.510
 definitely this is one of the 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.979
 countless villains that in the end you 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.630
 ends up winning as it meets its 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.270
 objectives and this the truth is that it 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.440
 thanks because it opens us every day 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.260
 definitely too epic to 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.090
 describe with words is also that 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.479
 perhaps you have seen better handling of a 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.479
 stir 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.010
 I do not think so 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.520
 you should say in which the boss does not 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.520
 stop talking 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:49.920
 special operations 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.920
 revolve ocelot 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.800
 loneliness 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.910
 now we will see if it is up to its 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.910
 legend 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.290
 I think with music I say everything 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.170
 truth could not be otherwise in 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.670
 my number one channel is requested number one 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.160
 number one the villain of the villains 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.840
 For my taste par excellence it's worth that 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.780
 I took the name of my channel, my name is 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.000
 sefi by sheffield and good really 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.770
 I thought I was not going to choose other than 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.480
 he carried his name on youtube with pride 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.640
 of course this villain marked a before 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.590
 and a later in my life as a gamer from 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.540
 the first moment I saw it in the game 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.280
 When I was 8 years old, the truth is that I 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.050
 I fell in love if I fell in love even though it sounds very 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.050
 king I guess it was the size of his 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.730
 katana at last this villain is the most 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.440
 epic of all the final fantasy and low 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.120
 my point of view tormented by its 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.250
 passed upon knowing his new reality of 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.810
 biotechnological condition is skin like 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.790
 be superior belonging to the elite 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.500
 soldiers which by the way were 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.750
 beings created biologically through 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.160
 genoa cells lashes out at the 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.560
 world obsessing about its destruction 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.510
 absolute will plunge the world destroy the 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.430
 lives of thousands of innocents and will use 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.050
 his genius and madness to summon a 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.480
 meteorite and destroy all the earth 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.190
 just cloud another soldiers experiment 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.169
 you can end your life and stop the 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.180
 imminent editor and madness to serve you 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.740
 God is that this payment is like a 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.240
 kind of god of destruction that 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.909
 enjoys doing evil and is happy 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.889
 watching others suffer if it is very 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:20.689
 raw everything is your personality so 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:23.210
 bestial and his charismatic image and power 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:28.539
 is what makes it unique and unrepeatable 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.539
 sheffield you are the number one devils 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.759
