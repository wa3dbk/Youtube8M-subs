00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.190
 6 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.320
 and that is kraft swing world 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.509
 that today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.120
 new tutorial to show you so 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.769
 how to make a clickable panel you 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.170
 see that behind there is no 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.120
 system it's just with a new 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.879
 command of the 1.8 so the command block 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.760
 data that I put in this block of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.320
 order so then I will go on 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.510
 a freeoffice 1 to meet a 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.710
 text document to show you the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.960
 command but first I show you a 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.970
 little how does it work so first you 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.409
 place a board with nothing on it where we 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.640
 can even be something on it 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.980
 then you put the how of the block 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.760
 then you take the button 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.440
 now the buttons are taxable 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.440
 on the ground you press the button 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.170
 the order but I 'll show you when 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.400
 even after good now that we are 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.900
 right click where you have and 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.210
 the diamond sword while for example 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.880
 never these periods just by doing a 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.250
 right click would happen and then that 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.930
 therefore works very useful system for 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.300
 servers if you want to do a little 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.650
 store so a store with some 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.780
 panels that Kabylie needs more of 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.420
 bother with plugins now 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.800
 possible to banish then so we get 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.360
 found immediately on a document 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.890
 text to show you how that 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.600
 market 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.630
 so here I am again for this tutorial 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.830
 we end up on my text editor 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.030
 so a text editor I you 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.890
 advise not to see a publisher of 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.149
 text that makes quotation marks like in 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.800
 the books there because it can be 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.500
 pretty annoying in minecraft that 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.869
 will not walk so so sorry if you 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.070
 have this little square with 1280 x 720 in 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.030
 in the middle I can not take it off 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.460
 I would have liked so it's because 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.140
 my software but it's going to happen 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.240
 finally me we'll go to auto 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.789
 so first we will put block 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.890
 data to change the date value of the 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.729
 strong block including vanilla but 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.620
 what does the block 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.470
 then the coordinates so about 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.240
 about 3 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.500
 which means the relative coordinates 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.550
 likewise x / y plus three same aids 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.480
 then we will open a hug in 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.800
 which one will put text 1.2 point 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.290
 coop on is nothing in quotation marks 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.330
 like that it's okay to put us on the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.330
 First line 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.460
 then we have a text 2.2 points we are going 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.840
 open the quotation marks and listen to me 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.730
 well we will open a new 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.420
 braces in which we will write 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.410
 text twice and there especially put a 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.900
 apostrophes 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.850
 otherwise it did not work then there we 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:55.709
 will put buy one to do like 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:03:00.190
 no sooner then hop but the color 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.380
 color of what a for example blanquer 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.810
 to blacken her 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.490
 once we've done that we'll put it 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.310
 in bold it is not obligatory 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.970
 m we will add the tag bold 2 points 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.230
 shower then we will put click event 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.730
 this is what interests us the most 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.460
 that's what will happen when we go 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.830
 click on the sign so click 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.290
 left or finally left click in survival 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.560
 adventure and right click and until the 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.960
 rights in creative so click event 2 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.240
 points does open a new hug 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.830
 Relay point actions we order 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.860
 which will allow us to execute a 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.000
 command comma value so the value of 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:49.210
 the two-point command between a 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.270
 postroff flash give ap minecraft the 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.720
 third in itself I do not type very 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.210
 quick 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:01.180
 sorry here I like it we close 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.730
 the accolade and we have our click vote 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.170
 but now we need to 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.570
 fight the lightning text in 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.819
 diamonds so we will close the 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:14.630
 quotation marks next but text 3 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.800
 two points in July 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.090
 text 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.070
 two dots ep in diamond 10th 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.960
 to do the apostrophe it works only on 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.780
 linux and with padlocks and the key 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.040
 they feel acute on windows it takes 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.960
 do with an insertion I do not think 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.460
 that it works in other words like that 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.880
 it's an aside so 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.880
 ep thiam 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:44.490
 so color of points to what and what 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:49.950
 it's the color of the diamond blue com 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:55.120
 com in the rate at which flight to take 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:05:00.580
 like that hop we close the accolade the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.470
 guinea p4 nothing and that's the command is 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.510
 ready to operate so I specify that 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.440
 the order will be in the description if 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.660
 you feel like it 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.160
 to copy paste then lo 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.530
