it's<00:00:15.699> a<00:00:15.789> 69<00:00:16.330> reissue<00:00:16.630> because<00:00:16.930> it's<00:00:17.109> got<00:00:17.260> the

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
it's a 69 reissue because it's got the

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.710 
it's a 69 reissue because it's got the
contours<00:00:17.920> on<00:00:18.189> the<00:00:18.220> tummy<00:00:18.880> cut<00:00:19.150> and<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:19.510> arm

contours on the tummy cut and the arm

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.840 
contours on the tummy cut and the arm
contour<00:00:20.290> so<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.930> was<00:00:23.200> a<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.980> off-white<00:00:24.460> color

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850

with the red tortoiseshell I turned

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.300 
with the red tortoiseshell I turned
around<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:28.140> refinished<00:00:29.140> it<00:00:29.380> it<00:00:29.949> was<00:00:30.100> pretty

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.880 
white base coat with a abalone flake
over<00:00:36.850> top<00:00:37.059> of<00:00:37.089> it<00:00:37.359> so<00:00:37.600> it's<00:00:37.809> got<00:00:38.739> a<00:00:38.769> little

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
over top of it so it's got a little

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.869 
over top of it so it's got a little
sparkle<00:00:39.429> to<00:00:39.579> it

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
sparkle to it

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.910 
sparkle to it
I<00:00:39.909> also<00:00:40.539> replaced<00:00:41.079> the<00:00:41.260> buttons<00:00:41.620> on<00:00:41.890> the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
I also replaced the buttons on the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.979 
I also replaced the buttons on the
loosen<00:00:42.579> tuners<00:00:42.999> to<00:00:43.239> white<00:00:43.449> to<00:00:43.479> match<00:00:43.929> the

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
loosen tuners to white to match the

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.259 
loosen tuners to white to match the
guitar<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.879> I<00:00:46.449> set<00:00:46.719> it<00:00:46.870> up<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:48.579> trim<00:00:48.850> up<00:00:48.999> real

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
guitar and I set it up the trim up real

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.660 
guitar and I set it up the trim up real
well<00:00:49.479> so<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:50.620> doesn't<00:00:50.979> really<00:00:51.069> go<00:00:51.280> out<00:00:51.399> of<00:00:51.519> tune

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
well so it doesn't really go out of tune

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.419 
well so it doesn't really go out of tune
whatsoever<00:00:52.300> under<00:00:52.960> normal<00:00:53.289> use<00:00:53.710> now<00:00:54.370> you

whatsoever under normal use now you

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.309 
whatsoever under normal use now you
can't<00:00:54.789> dive<00:00:55.059> on<00:00:55.359> with<00:00:55.629> it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.319 
can't dive on with it

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:57.959 
can't dive on with it
though<00:00:56.679> I'm<00:00:56.829> going<00:00:57.039> to<00:00:57.129> try<00:00:57.370> at<00:00:57.549> the<00:00:57.670> end<00:00:57.850> of

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
though I'm going to try at the end of

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.879 
though I'm going to try at the end of
the<00:00:58.059> video<00:00:58.359> to<00:00:58.629> see<00:00:58.839> if<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.109> knocks<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.559> guitar

00:00:59.879 --> 00:00:59.889 
the video to see if it knocks the guitar

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.039 
the video to see if it knocks the guitar
out<00:00:59.920> of<00:01:00.069> tune<00:01:00.190> or<00:01:00.460> not<00:01:00.609> but<00:01:00.819> I<00:01:00.850> really<00:01:01.239> wouldn't

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
out of tune or not but I really wouldn't

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:03.989 
out of tune or not but I really wouldn't
attempt<00:01:02.499> it<00:01:02.589> normally<00:01:03.039> I<00:01:03.069> just<00:01:03.190> use<00:01:03.519> it<00:01:03.729> like<00:01:03.879> a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
attempt it normally I just use it like a

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.399 
attempt it normally I just use it like a
big<00:01:04.269> speed<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:07.390> pickups<00:01:07.780> are<00:01:07.930> original

the<00:01:08.560> wiring<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.100> all<00:01:09.189> original<00:01:09.490> I<00:01:09.939> just

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
the wiring is all original I just

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.959 
the wiring is all original I just
touched<00:01:11.469> it<00:01:11.680> up<00:01:11.799> to<00:01:11.950> make<00:01:12.130> sure<00:01:12.159> that<00:01:12.549> all<00:01:12.820> the

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
touched it up to make sure that all the

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:16.319 
touched it up to make sure that all the
circuits<00:01:13.539> were<00:01:13.689> working<00:01:14.079> properly<00:01:15.329> leveled

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
circuits were working properly leveled

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.020

them<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.710> put<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.770> set<00:01:21.009> of<00:01:21.159> ten<00:01:21.399> fifty<00:01:21.939> two's

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
them and I put a set of ten fifty two's

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.039 
them and I put a set of ten fifty two's
on<00:01:22.509> it<00:01:22.689> I<00:01:22.810> think<00:01:22.869> there<00:01:23.170> slinkys<00:01:23.680> and<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.930> I'm

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
on it I think there slinkys and so I'm

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.569 
on it I think there slinkys and so I'm
going<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.289> run<00:01:26.409> it<00:01:26.530> through<00:01:26.560> its<00:01:26.740> paces<00:01:26.950> and
