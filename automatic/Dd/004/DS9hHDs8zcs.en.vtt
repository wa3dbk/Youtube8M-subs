00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
thrusters now these things have a very

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.810 
thrusters now these things have a very
bad<00:00:18.560> reputation<00:00:18.830> if<00:00:19.400> you<00:00:19.490> talk<00:00:19.640> to<00:00:19.730> other

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
bad reputation if you talk to other

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.460 
bad reputation if you talk to other
players<00:00:20.060> people<00:00:20.480> say<00:00:20.689> they<00:00:20.960> don't<00:00:21.080> like<00:00:21.170> homes

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
players people say they don't like homes

players people say they don't like homes
people<00:00:21.770> say<00:00:21.890> they<00:00:22.250> do<00:00:22.310> like<00:00:22.550> them<00:00:22.730> but<00:00:23.480> you

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
people say they do like them but you

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.910 
people say they do like them but you
really<00:00:23.780> got<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:24.050> finally<00:00:24.320> use<00:00:24.350> this<00:00:24.590> form<00:00:24.860> you

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
really got to finally use this form you

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.260 
really got to finally use this form you
can't<00:00:25.190> expect<00:00:25.550> them<00:00:25.640> to<00:00:25.880> make<00:00:26.000> you<00:00:26.030> move

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
can't expect them to make you move

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.730 
can't expect them to make you move
around<00:00:26.420> around<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.930> map<00:00:27.140> faster<00:00:27.620> because

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
around around the map faster because

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.200 
around around the map faster because
it's<00:00:27.920> not<00:00:28.010> what<00:00:28.160> they're<00:00:28.280> for<00:00:28.520> they're<00:00:29.000> more

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
it's not what they're for they're more

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.580 
it's not what they're for they're more
for<00:00:29.390> evading<00:00:29.869> if<00:00:29.990> you<00:00:30.080> play<00:00:30.320> league<00:00:30.560> of

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
for evading if you play league of

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.709 
for evading if you play league of
legends<00:00:31.039> you<00:00:31.130> know<00:00:31.280> what<00:00:31.400> the<00:00:31.520> flash<00:00:31.850> is<00:00:32.210> it's

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
legends you know what the flash is it's

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.389 
legends you know what the flash is it's
kind<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:32.960> like<00:00:33.079> a<00:00:33.140> little<00:00:33.500> sudden<00:00:33.710> teleport<00:00:34.309> to

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
kind of like a little sudden teleport to

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.860 
kind of like a little sudden teleport to
go<00:00:34.489> or<00:00:34.579> short<00:00:34.820> distance<00:00:35.180> this<00:00:35.449> is<00:00:35.660> exactly

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
go or short distance this is exactly

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.079 
go or short distance this is exactly
what<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.469> thrusters<00:00:36.949> are<00:00:37.190> it's<00:00:37.699> useful<00:00:38.059> for

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
what the thrusters are it's useful for

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:39.579 
what the thrusters are it's useful for
getting<00:00:38.269> away<00:00:38.480> from<00:00:38.539> grenades<00:00:39.019> getting<00:00:39.409> away

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:39.589 
getting away from grenades getting away

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.479 
getting away from grenades getting away
from<00:00:39.649> vehicles<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.449> getting<00:00:41.449> away<00:00:41.539> from<00:00:42.489> just

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
from vehicles and getting away from just

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:44.860 
from vehicles and getting away from just
different<00:00:43.789> kind<00:00:43.999> of<00:00:44.030> types<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.420> stuff<00:00:44.629> it's

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
different kind of types of stuff it's

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.950 
different kind of types of stuff it's
just<00:00:44.989> basically<00:00:45.710> all<00:00:45.979> for<00:00:46.280> evasion<00:00:46.809> if<00:00:47.809> you

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
just basically all for evasion if you

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.599 
just basically all for evasion if you
use<00:00:48.170> it<00:00:48.319> in<00:00:48.409> air<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:48.859> really<00:00:49.069> doesn't<00:00:49.280> help<00:00:49.399> you

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
use it in air it really doesn't help you

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.309 
use it in air it really doesn't help you
get<00:00:49.729> across<00:00:49.999> the<00:00:50.210> gaps<00:00:50.420> that<00:00:50.719> easy<00:00:50.960> it<00:00:51.289> just

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
get across the gaps that easy it just

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:53.500 
get across the gaps that easy it just
you<00:00:51.710> know<00:00:51.739> kind<00:00:52.100> of<00:00:52.129> thrust<00:00:52.489> you<00:00:52.699> down<00:00:52.940> so

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
you know kind of thrust you down so

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.389 
you know kind of thrust you down so
there's<00:00:53.690> really<00:00:53.780> no<00:00:54.139> use<00:00:54.170> for<00:00:54.620> that<00:00:54.739> but<00:00:55.039> I<00:00:55.190> did

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
there's really no use for that but I did

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.849 
there's really no use for that but I did
find<00:00:55.609> that<00:00:55.819> it<00:00:56.179> really<00:00:56.420> helps<00:00:56.839> when<00:00:57.469> you<00:00:57.620> like

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
find that it really helps when you like

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.950 
find that it really helps when you like
if<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:58.129> jump<00:00:58.519> off<00:00:58.729> a<00:00:58.760> ledge<00:00:59.179> maybe<00:00:59.569> like<00:00:59.839> an

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
if you jump off a ledge maybe like an

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.259 
if you jump off a ledge maybe like an
Atlantic<00:01:00.409> ledge<00:01:00.620> that<00:01:00.889> you<00:01:01.039> might<00:01:01.309> not<00:01:01.489> be

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
Atlantic ledge that you might not be

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:03.489 
Atlantic ledge that you might not be
didn't<00:01:02.600> know<00:01:02.719> that<00:01:02.989> there<00:01:03.109> wasn't<00:01:03.319> like

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:03.499 
didn't know that there wasn't like

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.350 
didn't know that there wasn't like
anything<00:01:03.859> below<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.370> you<00:01:04.820> can<00:01:05.030> turn<00:01:05.299> around

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
anything below it you can turn around

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.350 
anything below it you can turn around
really<00:01:05.720> fast<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.200> thrust<00:01:06.590> back<00:01:06.920> uh<00:01:07.159> if<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.240> do

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
really fast and thrust back uh if you do

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.270 
really fast and thrust back uh if you do
it<00:01:08.479> fast<00:01:08.750> enough<00:01:08.900> I<00:01:09.229> found<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.009> had<00:01:10.039> to

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
it fast enough I found that you had to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.249 
it fast enough I found that you had to
be<00:01:10.430> like<00:01:10.610> on<00:01:10.789> point<00:01:11.180> with<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.509> timing<00:01:11.780> for<00:01:12.020> it

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
be like on point with the timing for it

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.200 
be like on point with the timing for it
to<00:01:12.350> actually<00:01:12.469> even<00:01:12.860> work<00:01:13.100> well<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.759> the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
to actually even work well and the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.609 
to actually even work well and the
reason<00:01:14.479> it's<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:14.659> good<00:01:14.899> for<00:01:15.020> evading<00:01:15.469> is

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
reason it's so good for evading is

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:16.749 
reason it's so good for evading is
because<00:01:15.829> when<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.070> were<00:01:16.189> kind<00:01:16.369> of<00:01:16.430> run<00:01:16.520> away

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
because when you were kind of run away

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.969 
because when you were kind of run away
when<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:17.329> get<00:01:17.479> shot<00:01:17.750> your<00:01:18.020> Spartan<00:01:18.619> slows

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
when you get shot your Spartan slows

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.859 
when you get shot your Spartan slows
down<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.310> bit<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.060> don't<00:01:20.329> run<00:01:20.509> at<00:01:20.659> full

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
down a bit so you don't run at full

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.510 
down a bit so you don't run at full
speed<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:21.560> that's<00:01:21.740> why<00:01:21.890> thrusters<00:01:22.280> are<00:01:22.399> so

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
speed so that's why thrusters are so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.069 
speed so that's why thrusters are so
helpful<00:01:22.789> to<00:01:23.000> get<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:23.299> around<00:01:23.539> those<00:01:23.659> corners

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
helpful to get you around those corners

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.929 
helpful to get you around those corners
to<00:01:24.320> avoid<00:01:24.680> that<00:01:24.859> last<00:01:25.100> hit<00:01:25.430> on<00:01:25.579> your<00:01:25.700> head<00:01:25.909> or

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
to avoid that last hit on your head or

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.940 
to avoid that last hit on your head or
body<00:01:26.329> that<00:01:26.659> might<00:01:26.869> actually<00:01:27.109> cause<00:01:27.469> a<00:01:27.500> fatal

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
body that might actually cause a fatal

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.029

wound<00:01:28.729> our<00:01:28.909> death<00:01:29.649> next<00:01:30.649> we're<00:01:30.740> going<00:01:30.829> to<00:01:30.950> go

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
wound our death next we're going to go

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.770 
wound our death next we're going to go
with<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.189> jetpack<00:01:31.490> now<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:31.939> gatech<00:01:32.299> has<00:01:32.570> been

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
with a jetpack now the gatech has been

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.539 
with a jetpack now the gatech has been
in<00:01:32.899> halo<00:01:33.140> reach<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.560> was<00:01:33.770> useful<00:01:33.950> Venice's

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
in halo reach it was useful Venice's

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.160 
in halo reach it was useful Venice's
from<00:01:34.759> now<00:01:34.880> it's<00:01:35.119> useful<00:01:35.390> getting<00:01:35.539> a<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:35.990> higher

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
from now it's useful getting a to higher

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.260 
from now it's useful getting a to higher
places<00:01:36.439> maybe<00:01:36.920> for<00:01:37.189> sniping<00:01:37.609> or<00:01:38.030> maybe<00:01:38.210> just

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
places maybe for sniping or maybe just

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.569 
places maybe for sniping or maybe just
take<00:01:38.479> it<00:01:38.570> away<00:01:38.659> from<00:01:38.929> enemies<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.469> it's<00:01:40.310> also

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
take it away from enemies and it's also

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.359 
take it away from enemies and it's also
very<00:01:41.000> useful<00:01:41.119> for<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:42.740> know<00:01:42.829> grabbing<00:01:43.130> onto

very useful for you know grabbing onto

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.770 
very useful for you know grabbing onto
banshees<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:43.880> stuff<00:01:44.179> like<00:01:44.329> that<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:44.600> are

banshees and stuff like that that are

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.270 
banshees and stuff like that that are
high<00:01:44.990> up<00:01:45.020> in<00:01:45.289> the<00:01:45.320> air<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.920> don't<00:01:46.070> need<00:01:46.130> to

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
high up in the air and you don't need to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.359 
high up in the air and you don't need to
use<00:01:46.429> your<00:01:46.460> pleasant<00:01:47.149> pistol<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.600> EMP<00:01:47.960> them<00:01:48.369> but

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
use your pleasant pistol to EMP them but

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.580 
use your pleasant pistol to EMP them but
it<00:01:49.520> can<00:01:49.640> also<00:01:49.670> be<00:01:49.850> useful<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.659> firefights<00:01:51.439> as

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
it can also be useful and firefights as

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.349 
it can also be useful and firefights as
well<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:52.310> can<00:01:52.490> fly<00:01:52.759> straight<00:01:53.060> up<00:01:53.119> in<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.270> air

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
well you can fly straight up in the air

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:54.969 
well you can fly straight up in the air
and<00:01:53.420> back<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.079> kind<00:01:54.259> of<00:01:54.409> like<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.560> move<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:54.859> the

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
and back and kind of like a move in the

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.200 
and back and kind of like a move in the
air<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.130> little<00:01:55.219> bit<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.579> try<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.820> keep<00:01:55.999> them<00:01:56.119> out

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
air a little bit to try to keep them out

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.849 
air a little bit to try to keep them out
of<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.390> name<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.600> your<00:01:56.749> head<00:01:56.929> but<00:01:57.229> this<00:01:57.619> is<00:01:57.740> not

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
of the name of your head but this is not

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.469 
of the name of your head but this is not
the<00:01:57.920> best<00:01:58.159> way<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:58.460> keep<00:01:58.579> out<00:01:58.729> of<00:01:58.820> fire<00:01:58.999> because

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
the best way to keep out of fire because

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.330 
the best way to keep out of fire because
you<00:01:59.780> do<00:01:59.929> become<00:02:00.289> like<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.469> little<00:02:00.770> dangle<00:02:01.219> a

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
you do become like a little dangle a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.219 
you do become like a little dangle a
dangling<00:02:01.939> target<00:02:02.569> floating<00:02:02.960> through<00:02:03.109> the<00:02:03.140> air

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
dangling target floating through the air

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.230 
dangling target floating through the air
so<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:03.890> need<00:02:04.039> to<00:02:04.130> watch<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.340> how<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.729> use<00:02:04.999> it<00:02:05.030> a

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
so you need to watch it how you use it a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.520 
so you need to watch it how you use it a
lot<00:02:05.329> of<00:02:05.450> people<00:02:05.659> use<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.990> firefights<00:02:06.409> and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
lot of people use it of firefights and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.050 
lot of people use it of firefights and
end<00:02:06.770> up<00:02:06.920> failing<00:02:07.130> if<00:02:07.399> their<00:02:07.520> aim<00:02:07.670> isn't<00:02:07.880> good

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
end up failing if their aim isn't good

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.910 
end up failing if their aim isn't good
enough<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.990> best<00:02:09.140> way<00:02:09.319> I've<00:02:09.530> found<00:02:09.560> that

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
enough so the best way I've found that

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.620 
enough so the best way I've found that
you<00:02:10.069> know<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.220> survive<00:02:10.759> firefights<00:02:11.420> the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
you know to survive firefights the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.050 
you know to survive firefights the
jetpack<00:02:11.990> is<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.500> not<00:02:13.190> use<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.580> right<00:02:13.700> away<00:02:13.850> but

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
jetpack is to not use it right away but

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.660 
jetpack is to not use it right away but
maybe<00:02:14.600> you<00:02:14.990> know<00:02:15.140> like<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:15.740> half<00:02:16.010> way<00:02:16.190> into<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
maybe you know like in half way into the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.890 
maybe you know like in half way into the
firefight<00:02:17.090> if<00:02:17.570> you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
firefight if you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.080 
firefight if you
to<00:02:18.019> use<00:02:18.379> it<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.620> go<00:02:18.829> like<00:02:19.040> straight<00:02:19.370> back<00:02:19.909> and

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
to use it and go like straight back and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.149 
to use it and go like straight back and
up<00:02:20.180> or<00:02:20.390> straight<00:02:20.599> over<00:02:20.959> them<00:02:21.110> it's<00:02:21.860> actually

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
up or straight over them it's actually

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.369 
up or straight over them it's actually
better<00:02:22.549> to<00:02:22.670> probably<00:02:23.120> go<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:23.900> if<00:02:24.049> you're<00:02:24.200> like

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
better to probably go to if you're like

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.319 
better to probably go to if you're like
you<00:02:24.530> know<00:02:24.560> minor<00:02:25.159> close<00:02:25.489> quarter<00:02:25.730> battle<00:02:25.760> if

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
you know minor close quarter battle if

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.110 
you know minor close quarter battle if
you<00:02:26.569> go<00:02:26.930> over<00:02:27.140> them<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:28.519> might<00:02:28.790> be<00:02:28.939> better

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
you go over them it might be better

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.580 
you go over them it might be better
because<00:02:29.390> they<00:02:29.659> might<00:02:29.840> actually<00:02:30.200> not<00:02:30.439> get

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
because they might actually not get

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.050 
because they might actually not get
those<00:02:30.709> hits<00:02:30.920> on<00:02:31.010> your<00:02:31.129> head<00:02:31.310> as<00:02:31.549> if<00:02:31.849> you're

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
those hits on your head as if you're

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.910 
those hits on your head as if you're
going<00:02:32.360> straight<00:02:32.840> back<00:02:33.049> because<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.650> fit

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
going straight back because of the fit

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.229 
going straight back because of the fit
hits<00:02:34.189> on<00:02:34.370> your<00:02:34.459> head<00:02:34.549> it<00:02:34.640> might<00:02:34.730> be<00:02:34.879> easier

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
hits on your head it might be easier

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.759 
hits on your head it might be easier
there's<00:02:35.720> also<00:02:35.870> worth<00:02:36.049> mentioning<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.560> jet

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
there's also worth mentioning the jet

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.280 
there's also worth mentioning the jet
pack<00:02:36.950> only<00:02:37.159> last<00:02:37.609> 2.5<00:02:38.209> seconds<00:02:38.930> when<00:02:39.049> you<00:02:39.109> hold

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
pack only last 2.5 seconds when you hold

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.080 
pack only last 2.5 seconds when you hold
it<00:02:39.439> down<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:39.829> it's<00:02:40.010> when<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:40.579> want<00:02:40.909> to<00:02:41.000> go

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
it down so it's when you want to go

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.550 
it down so it's when you want to go
longer<00:02:41.420> distances<00:02:41.810> definitely<00:02:42.260> tap<00:02:42.409> the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
longer distances definitely tap the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.339 
longer distances definitely tap the
trigger<00:02:42.799> but<00:02:43.099> also<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:44.030> doesn't<00:02:44.239> recharge<00:02:45.049> as

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
trigger but also it doesn't recharge as

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.309 
trigger but also it doesn't recharge as
you<00:02:46.250> don't<00:02:47.060> use<00:02:47.299> it<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.659> takes<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.049> a<00:02:48.109> few

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
you don't use it it takes like a few

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.780 
you don't use it it takes like a few
seconds<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.620> actually<00:02:48.920> start<00:02:49.099> recharging<00:02:49.700> so

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
seconds to actually start recharging so

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.949 
seconds to actually start recharging so
it's<00:02:49.909> not<00:02:49.970> like<00:02:50.150> reach<00:02:50.389> where<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:50.659> let<00:02:50.810> go

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
it's not like reach where you let go

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.330 
it's not like reach where you let go
with<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.109> bumper<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.920> starts<00:02:52.129> charging

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
with the bumper and it starts charging

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.339 
with the bumper and it starts charging
automatically<00:02:53.090> next<00:02:54.019> we're<00:02:54.109> gonna<00:02:54.200> talk

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
automatically next we're gonna talk

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:55.690 
automatically next we're gonna talk
about<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.590> motion<00:02:54.889> sensor<00:02:55.190> now<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.549> has

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
about the motion sensor now this has

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.250 
about the motion sensor now this has
been<00:02:55.819> in<00:02:55.970> every<00:02:56.299> first-person<00:02:56.810> halo<00:02:57.079> game

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
been in every first-person halo game

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.110 
been in every first-person halo game
that<00:02:57.409> we<00:02:57.500> played<00:02:57.799> if<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.069> crouch<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.700> walk

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
that we played if you crouch and walk

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.759 
that we played if you crouch and walk
you<00:02:59.359> won't<00:02:59.540> be<00:02:59.690> able<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.959> be<00:03:00.139> seen<00:03:00.349> on<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.500> o2

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
you won't be able to be seen on the o2

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.589 
you won't be able to be seen on the o2
sensor<00:03:00.799> so<00:03:01.159> it's<00:03:01.310> really<00:03:01.489> good<00:03:01.670> or<00:03:02.209> you<00:03:02.569> know

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
sensor so it's really good or you know

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.660 
sensor so it's really good or you know
sneaking<00:03:03.349> up<00:03:03.560> on<00:03:03.680> bases<00:03:04.159> if<00:03:04.340> you're<00:03:04.519> playing

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
sneaking up on bases if you're playing

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.190 
sneaking up on bases if you're playing
capture<00:03:04.939> the<00:03:05.060> flag<00:03:05.150> or<00:03:05.599> dominion<00:03:05.989> or<00:03:06.049> some

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
capture the flag or dominion or some

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.960 
capture the flag or dominion or some
link<00:03:06.379> that<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.769> can<00:03:06.950> sneak<00:03:07.189> up<00:03:07.340> on<00:03:07.489> people<00:03:07.519> and

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
link that you can sneak up on people and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.179 
link that you can sneak up on people and
also<00:03:08.750> works<00:03:09.049> well<00:03:09.290> with<00:03:09.470> active<00:03:09.829> camel

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
also works well with active camel

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.039 
also works well with active camel
because<00:03:10.430> we<00:03:10.519> use<00:03:10.760> active<00:03:11.120> camo<00:03:11.329> it<00:03:11.569> puts<00:03:11.810> on

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
because we use active camo it puts on

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.530 
because we use active camo it puts on
these<00:03:12.349> little<00:03:12.939> little<00:03:13.939> blimps<00:03:14.299> on<00:03:14.420> your

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
these little little blimps on your

enemies map or that look like allies are

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.699 
enemies map or that look like allies are
just<00:03:17.510> little<00:03:17.870> blue<00:03:18.049> dots<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.409> the<00:03:18.470> motion

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
just little blue dots of the motion

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.589 
just little blue dots of the motion
sensors<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.189> it's<00:03:19.340> good<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.519> conceal<00:03:19.970> your<00:03:20.180> you

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599

sensor<00:03:25.879> has<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.060> pretty<00:03:26.389> big<00:03:26.629> range<00:03:26.900> as<00:03:27.230> well

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
sensor has a pretty big range as well

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.860 
sensor has a pretty big range as well
but<00:03:28.340> in<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:28.699> first<00:03:28.910> clip<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.180> saw<00:03:29.359> where<00:03:29.660> me

of each other the first clip you'll see

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.830 
of each other the first clip you'll see
is<00:03:33.290> with<00:03:33.500> me<00:03:33.739> using<00:03:34.239> sensor<00:03:35.239> which<00:03:35.599> is<00:03:35.750> an

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
is with me using sensor which is an

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.589 
is with me using sensor which is an
ability<00:03:36.109> and<00:03:36.590> then<00:03:37.129> movable<00:03:37.609> that<00:03:37.909> raises<00:03:38.449> the

ability and then movable that raises the
range<00:03:38.870> of<00:03:39.199> your<00:03:39.409> overall<00:03:39.620> motion<00:03:40.099> sensor<00:03:40.489> and

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
range of your overall motion sensor and

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.699 
range of your overall motion sensor and
actually<00:03:40.970> has<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.150> very<00:03:41.659> big<00:03:41.870> range<00:03:42.230> increases

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
actually has a very big range increases

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.770 
actually has a very big range increases
it<00:03:43.040> by<00:03:43.159> quite<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.519> few<00:03:43.579> feet<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.510> actually

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
it by quite a few feet it's actually

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.920 
it by quite a few feet it's actually
very<00:03:44.810> useful<00:03:45.319> for<00:03:46.120> defending<00:03:47.120> game<00:03:47.389> type<00:03:47.629> so<00:03:47.840> I

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
very useful for defending game type so I

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.360 
very useful for defending game type so I
capture<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.319> flag<00:03:48.530> if<00:03:48.739> you're<00:03:48.859> defending<00:03:49.129> the

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
capture the flag if you're defending the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.939 
capture the flag if you're defending the
flag<00:03:49.609> or<00:03:49.940> you're<00:03:50.150> defending<00:03:50.479> a<00:03:50.780> hat<00:03:51.409> point<00:03:51.739> I'm

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
flag or you're defending a hat point I'm

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.740 
flag or you're defending a hat point I'm
in<00:03:52.129> domain<00:03:52.459> it's<00:03:53.000> very<00:03:53.150> useful<00:03:53.359> for<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.720> i

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
in domain it's very useful for that i

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.629 
in domain it's very useful for that i
use<00:03:54.049> sensor<00:03:54.470> when<00:03:54.680> i'm<00:03:54.769> defending<00:03:55.069> or<00:03:55.459> playing

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
use sensor when i'm defending or playing

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.969 
use sensor when i'm defending or playing
a<00:03:55.760> defensive<00:03:56.209> role<00:03:56.389> or<00:03:56.870> i'd<00:03:57.139> use<00:03:57.349> a<00:03:57.620> sensor

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:57.979 
a defensive role or i'd use a sensor

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:59.710 
a defensive role or i'd use a sensor
when<00:03:58.129> I<00:03:58.159> don't<00:03:58.340> have<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.459> meeting<00:03:58.849> at<00:03:58.940> vision<00:03:59.209> on

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
when I don't have a meeting at vision on

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.270 
when I don't have a meeting at vision on
now<00:04:00.260> let's<00:04:00.410> talk<00:04:00.530> about<00:04:00.680> your<00:04:00.890> overall

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
now let's talk about your overall

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.790 
now let's talk about your overall
movement<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:02.000> strafe<00:04:02.510> in<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.930> game<00:04:03.200> it's

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
movement and strafe in the game it's

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.130 
movement and strafe in the game it's
really<00:04:04.220> important<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.760> stay<00:04:05.300> mobile<00:04:05.660> when

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
really important to stay mobile when

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.440 
really important to stay mobile when
firefights<00:04:06.890> especially<00:04:07.610> in<00:04:07.700> shorter<00:04:08.060> ranges

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
firefights especially in shorter ranges

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.080 
firefights especially in shorter ranges
and<00:04:08.660> long<00:04:09.260> ranges<00:04:09.680> strafing<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.370> jumping<00:04:10.820> can

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
and long ranges strafing and jumping can

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.300 
and long ranges strafing and jumping can
be<00:04:11.270> a<00:04:11.540> little<00:04:11.990> useless<00:04:12.440> because<00:04:12.770> you<00:04:13.160> have

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
be a little useless because you have

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.100 
be a little useless because you have
that<00:04:13.340> this<00:04:13.850> that<00:04:14.120> wide<00:04:14.360> range<00:04:14.690> between<00:04:14.870> the

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
that this that wide range between the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.360 
that this that wide range between the
two<00:04:15.260> characters<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.830> it's<00:04:15.950> easy<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.280> hit

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
two characters and it's easy to hit

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.920 
two characters and it's easy to hit
headshots<00:04:16.760> on<00:04:16.880> each<00:04:16.970> other<00:04:17.150> so<00:04:17.720> what<00:04:17.840> you

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
headshots on each other so what you

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.030 
headshots on each other so what you
really<00:04:18.049> want<00:04:18.230> to<00:04:18.260> do<00:04:18.380> is<00:04:18.530> just<00:04:18.560> keep<00:04:18.859> moving

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
really want to do is just keep moving

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.430 
really want to do is just keep moving
back<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.549> forth<00:04:19.640> and<00:04:19.970> don't<00:04:20.269> jump<00:04:20.750> when<00:04:21.320> you

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
back and forth and don't jump when you

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.070 
back and forth and don't jump when you
are<00:04:21.650> on<00:04:21.920> range<00:04:22.250> with<00:04:22.460> people<00:04:22.790> do<00:04:23.240> not<00:04:23.450> jump

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
are on range with people do not jump

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.690 
are on range with people do not jump
because<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:24.470> just<00:04:24.560> ruins<00:04:24.830> it<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:25.490> could

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
because it just ruins it and you could

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.400 
because it just ruins it and you could
not<00:04:25.880> actually<00:04:26.480> make<00:04:26.600> you<00:04:26.720> die<00:04:26.870> fat<00:04:27.170> a<00:04:27.200> lot

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
not actually make you die fat a lot

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.560 
not actually make you die fat a lot
faster<00:04:27.920> moving<00:04:28.490> back<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:28.970> forth<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.510> even

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
faster moving back and forth and even

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.750 
faster moving back and forth and even
crouching<00:04:30.290> is<00:04:30.410> that<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:30.650> lot<00:04:31.130> better<00:04:31.340> than

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
crouching is that a lot better than

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.360 
crouching is that a lot better than
jumping<00:04:32.570> on<00:04:32.900> your<00:04:33.050> acts<00:04:33.260> of<00:04:33.620> long<00:04:33.950> to<00:04:34.220> mid

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
jumping on your acts of long to mid

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.250 
jumping on your acts of long to mid
range<00:04:34.580> but<00:04:35.090> if<00:04:35.180> you're<00:04:35.330> in<00:04:35.450> short<00:04:35.840> range<00:04:36.050> and

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
range but if you're in short range and

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.620 
range but if you're in short range and
short<00:04:36.500> like<00:04:36.650> BRD<00:04:37.190> Mr<00:04:37.370> battles<00:04:37.700> jumping<00:04:38.510> is

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
short like BRD Mr battles jumping is

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.880 
short like BRD Mr battles jumping is
actually<00:04:38.900> very<00:04:38.930> useful<00:04:39.470> because<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:39.680> makes

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
actually very useful because it makes

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.650 
actually very useful because it makes
you<00:04:40.130> kind<00:04:40.490> of<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.640> bigger<00:04:40.820> target<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.480> it's<00:04:41.600> a

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
you kind of a bigger target and it's a

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.730 
you kind of a bigger target and it's a
lot<00:04:41.780> harder<00:04:41.930> than<00:04:42.080> hit<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.500> in<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.650> head

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
lot harder than hit you in the head

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.590 
lot harder than hit you in the head
especially<00:04:43.730> if<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:43.940> jump<00:04:44.180> towards<00:04:44.510> them

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
especially if you jump towards them

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.480 
especially if you jump towards them
because<00:04:44.840> your<00:04:45.080> target<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.650> your<00:04:46.010> body<00:04:46.160> gets

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
because your target and your body gets

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.310 
because your target and your body gets
bigger<00:04:46.730> and<00:04:47.090> as<00:04:47.480> they're<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.870> know<00:04:47.990> as<00:04:48.260> you

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
bigger and as they're you know as you

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.930 
bigger and as they're you know as you
get<00:04:48.530> closer<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.040> reticle<00:04:49.400> so<00:04:49.640> they<00:04:49.790> might

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
get closer to the reticle so they might

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.540 
get closer to the reticle so they might
be<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.090> little<00:04:50.300> bit<00:04:51.080> harder<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.590> hit<00:04:52.280> your

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
be a little bit harder to hit your

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.030 
be a little bit harder to hit your
actual<00:04:52.940> head<00:04:53.180> so<00:04:53.780> remember<00:04:54.590> when<00:04:54.800> you're<00:04:54.830> in

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
actual head so remember when you're in

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.670 
actual head so remember when you're in
range<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.700> minute<00:04:55.970> submit<00:04:56.540> you<00:04:56.870> want<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.260> go

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
range to minute submit you want to go

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.470 
range to minute submit you want to go
straight<00:04:57.919> back<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:58.220> forth<00:04:58.490> really<00:04:58.880> fast<00:04:59.000> and

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
straight back and forth really fast and

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.270 
straight back and forth really fast and
you<00:04:59.630> keep<00:04:59.930> lighting<00:05:00.169> your<00:05:00.410> toes<00:05:00.590> if<00:05:00.860> you're

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
you keep lighting your toes if you're

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.010 
you keep lighting your toes if you're
short<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:01.940> know<00:05:02.030> maybe<00:05:02.300> it's<00:05:02.540> like<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.720> little

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
short you know maybe it's like a little

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.050 
short you know maybe it's like a little
maybe<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.530> little<00:05:03.650> bit<00:05:03.830> mid-range<00:05:04.340> you<00:05:04.790> want<00:05:04.970> to

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
maybe a little bit mid-range you want to

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.330 
maybe a little bit mid-range you want to
jump<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.600> strafing<00:05:06.110> make<00:05:06.560> your<00:05:06.770> jumps<00:05:07.190> and

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
jump and strafing make your jumps and

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.040 
jump and strafing make your jumps and
straights<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.700> little<00:05:07.880> erratic<00:05:08.150> don't<00:05:08.870> go

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
straights a little erratic don't go

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.450 
straights a little erratic don't go
jumping<00:05:09.290> back<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.650> forth<00:05:09.860> because<00:05:10.250> that

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
jumping back and forth because that

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.100 
jumping back and forth because that
doesn't<00:05:10.580> really<00:05:10.790> work<00:05:10.880> all<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.210> time<00:05:11.240> me<00:05:11.990> you

assassinate amor beat them down this has
been<00:05:36.560> a<00:05:36.680> tactic<00:05:37.130> in<00:05:37.310> almost<00:05:37.550> every<00:05:37.880> halo<00:05:38.210> but

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
been a tactic in almost every halo but

you might guys not might know it and it
takes<00:05:40.460> a<00:05:40.520> little<00:05:40.610> while<00:05:40.760> it's<00:05:40.940> perfect

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
takes a little while it's perfect

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.090 
takes a little while it's perfect
because<00:05:41.390> you<00:05:41.690> got<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:41.900> know<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.650> distance<00:05:42.919> on

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
because you got to know the distance on
