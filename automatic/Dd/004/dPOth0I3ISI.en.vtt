00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
way the recording process we haven't

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.949

really<00:02:29.510> come<00:02:29.900> up<00:02:30.019> with<00:02:30.049> anything<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:31.959> like

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
really come up with anything that like

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.250 
really come up with anything that like
any<00:02:33.290> solid<00:02:33.799> method<00:02:34.250> yet<00:02:34.810> we've<00:02:35.810> learned<00:02:36.079> a<00:02:36.230> lot

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
any solid method yet we've learned a lot

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.199 
any solid method yet we've learned a lot
zone<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.459> think<00:02:37.670> one<00:02:37.790> thing<00:02:37.970> we've<00:02:38.120> learned

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
zone and I think one thing we've learned

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.740 
zone and I think one thing we've learned
is<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.660> important<00:02:39.110> play<00:02:39.349> as<00:02:40.280> live<00:02:40.670> as

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
is the important play as live as

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.570 
is the important play as live as

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
that result five six months recording

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.070

the<00:02:49.670> first<00:02:49.820> now<00:02:50.030> we<00:02:50.240> didn't<00:02:50.420> plan<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:50.660> doing<00:02:50.990> it

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
the first now we didn't plan on doing it

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.580 
the first now we didn't plan on doing it
that<00:02:51.200> long

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
that long

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.310 
that long
yeah<00:02:52.360> did<00:02:53.360> we<00:02:53.390> do<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.780> whole<00:02:53.930> thing<00:02:53.960> we

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
yeah did we do the whole thing we

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.570
