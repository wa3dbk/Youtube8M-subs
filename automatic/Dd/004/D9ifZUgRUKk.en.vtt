00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 we take back 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:11.649
 orange 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.119
 at least three months 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.589
 hello to all and welcome to this new episode of epi 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.640
 where I'm going to introduce the dynamic light mode which is a mode that you 

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:24.550
 lets you light up in the caves 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.179
 from luminous objects 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.359
 then there are three categories of objects 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.470
 we have the objects that is clear enormously like the turtles the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.700
 pumpkin 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.890
 the ceo of the advent are the clearest objectives the most then as for the agglo 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.750
 stone that lights up moderately well 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.920
 and then we have the star and its appearance the tangerines 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.659
 stone 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.120
 who is clear not milking hard 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.670
 merzak the comet 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.460
 while these objects you can 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.880
 either keep them in hand and recothrom other sector of vaud 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.060
 either you let go of them how holding 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.630
 and it lights up the area all around the ohl was china 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.140
 so it can be bought in practice so now you're scared who's 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.770
 mobs then down a cave and you know not go directly to this 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:05.530
 place there 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.400
 first you can see what happens there if you let go of objects from the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.950
 middle is there there 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.840
 you can also change setting would turn out this 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.260
 brightness from 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.630
 a file that we will see during the installation 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.500
 and you can also 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 make sure in shoot and objects as an example 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.920
 here you can see that j -m 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.120
 a diamond pick in the hands 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.290
 and for these clerics as if I had a torch in my hands 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.270
 but these 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.280
 but not there initially which is totally normal because normally 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.300
 another 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.920
 a pick not away 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.780
 but you can set 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.080
 make this bell more illuminated around you 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.120
 so let's put a brightness 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.640
 in the winged parameters 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.090
 so we'll see that in the station right away 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.320
 and we find ourselves under my desk we will see how installed dynamic 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.939
 light 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:53.910
 so 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.240
 let's see what to install 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.390
 so we have to install modelo players so they can work we're going 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.340
 download both modes on the site 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.350
 reassuring the respective officers look 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.500
 as for facilities will copy paste the contents of gold mauguio 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.609
 in my serious for a player who is in a lot of traces cabin 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.379
 for dynamic light 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.109
 we will copy paste the contents of complete patti smith or less serious 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:18.300
 that gears in 23 players that are in 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.849
 for alain graf of the ine

 we will copy paste the contents of conficker flaw no small signs 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:23.729
 tower 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:24.930
 for the spokesperson 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.230
 fold holmes in the folder still kraft and as usual we're going 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.670
 delete this shit file that's named but stabilized that lie 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.959
 in 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.609
 mann traces of three days here it is gone 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.969
 we realize on the tablet 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.819
 and we'll go to the official link of dynamic light 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.489
 I go through my blog 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.179
 list of patients here are the hinges december 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:47.390
 10 10 10 10 10 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.129
 the friendly secular officials have taken over 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.499
 this is it in the description you go down you go down you go down 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:58.269
 and where the strong fashion brands by his assistant 5% to 6 3 6 pc gaming mode 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.939
 the author wick kloten 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.939
 bayardo us 10% below you click on it 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.429
 want to save on your desktop 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:08.370
 here 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.640
 you do not click directly on ideas immolate me gold because we're going 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.549
 fall on the official website directly 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:14.659
 here 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:15.739
 and so it's done 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.969
 of unleaded santos 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.150
 and when burgundy or even bad to donors a six-point 6 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.059
 you clicked while passing on 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.549
 direct finally from the direct water 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.909
 Once you're done registering in your office 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.389
 we drive in a porsche or as you feel 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.579
 Once again it's done we can not wait to change what was needed 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.169
 we have dynamic light and upstream model smells 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.169
 you will have your file a lot of skulls 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:45.919
 so we'll start by installing order mode you open your folder 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:46.799
 mines 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.299
 which is in 3 min of kraft right click on mame kraft% 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.889
 rojas open with 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.759
 for an archive 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.839
 once doing this we'll already start by removing mats like 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.289
 not bored 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:00.789
 here 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:04.009
 he forced ferron new model smells to download it 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.199
 europe we aim the whole continuum 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.199
 so all the files not in class in less than three brothers 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.899
 here we have all moved we close the author of a new dynamic light 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.500
 open copy debt of thyssenkrupp any mann kraft in japan we want us 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.190
 folder 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.340
 and we will test all the files not in class forced to put the file for 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.790
 the text is quite rightly 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.860
 informative 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.970
 and we will leave everything in mannschaft of three players 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.840
 we can close even main players we do not need anymore 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.840
 we go back here here I went back 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:41.940
 we're going to reopen confide flaw small screenshots 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.680
 for me a kind of point of view 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.080
 and in it we posted that is called dynamic live for a sit-in this 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.330
 and if he displays he wanted to drop 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.090
 manne kraft so next to all records of conflict 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.090
 ressourcÃ© this thing you drop it at this place 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.979
 here I slide 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.680
 and here he is supposed to meet here 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.680
 once these facts are nickel your modest installed 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.160
 you can change something you like 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
 you click on dynamic light the file is finished 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.240
 and in front of you can change things 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.259
 that is to say cure as you could see in the area just before 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.460
 there are several key areas that allow you to illuminate around 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.010
 you if you want you can 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.600
 % add 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.030
 pianos that is humiliating between or two other objects as you want 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.800
 to do this you need cash is what 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.780
 it's the number below 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.770
 Objects 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.550
 we go mostly minitel often you can also find 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.539
 on the link that will be in the description 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.069
 in the video 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.759
 % you put the validate so my presence of master dos santos 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.939
 seventy eight 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:50.839
 278 for French 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.449
 you put two points 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:53.809
 space 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:58.249
 e the wood is stubborn the wood was seven times serena brightness 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.600
 so that's a value that's included 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.770
 as nonsense larger housing 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.659
 it is a value included in this title blah blah blah blah 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:07.689
 enter 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:08.999
 for 100 th 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:10.260
 9 es15 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.119
 as seen here 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:14.520
 e 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.539
 and so if you want to put the maximum brightness for which I had 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:19.650
 15 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.939
 if you want the minimum you put 9 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:25.659
 at one month I stand by what I say that when I still had them 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:27.960
 hands it scares me all around me 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.740
 the more you put then not right like the torch if you see any information 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.089
 concerning the torch 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.300
 so the torch idc 50 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.300
 the aluminum mentioned as we saw it is the most powerful with them 

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:43.099
 with the la la see these 15 6 for nam 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.229
 al meliti the elite 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:49.119
 the man who does too well too 

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:52.979
 here you see who also 15 because it's the maximum brightness bring 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.169
 to these works of art 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.169
 and as I told you the agglo stone its means 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.860
 and to conclude sums of aoste these 10 so it's the lowest with the areq stone 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.439
 heyer the door actually stone 

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:10.389
 so we're going to put 15 because we want it to be as illuminated as possible 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.809
 so the draw the brightness is very important 

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:18.529
 after that we abused the rest do not change you're going to put these 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:20.050
 you copied pasted 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.289
 in the halls 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:22.990
 the eire 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.270
 from 31 years old 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.149
 until the end 

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:28.719
 here and you will reproduce it here 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:31.799
 we copy and paste here you do that and all the objects you 

00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:33.100
 like that you will look 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.169
 luminus maximum quoted with the objects that you will add in your 

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:38.729
 % in 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:40.090
 in this stic file 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.600
 that's it simply and if you wish to illuminate a little more when 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.419
 you have to I do not know me agglo stone in the hands 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:49.370
 we changed the value of 12 and 15 th comedy 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.820
 well in short you just simply relapse to change the value and then 

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.419
 you simply register 

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:55.399
 There you go 

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:58.219
 so the installation tutorial 

00:07:58.219 --> 00:08:01.489
 dot dynamic light ends here and I tell you afp
