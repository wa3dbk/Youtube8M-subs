begin with Merlot the key to

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.130 
begin with Merlot the key to
understanding<00:00:30.820> Merlot<00:00:31.210> is<00:00:31.390> that<00:00:31.630> it's<00:00:31.750> a<00:00:31.869> big

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
it grows in the Sun it ripens it masses

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.439

lots<00:00:38.379> of<00:00:38.559> sugar<00:00:38.860> and<00:00:38.980> as<00:00:39.460> we<00:00:39.699> know<00:00:39.879> that<00:00:40.090> sugar

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
lots of sugar and as we know that sugar

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.780 
lots of sugar and as we know that sugar
gets<00:00:40.750> converted<00:00:41.379> into<00:00:41.770> alcohol<00:00:42.040> in<00:00:42.670> the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
gets converted into alcohol in the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.360 
gets converted into alcohol in the
winery<00:00:43.000> so<00:00:43.420> Merlot<00:00:43.899> gives<00:00:44.140> generous<00:00:44.829> alcohol

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
winery so Merlot gives generous alcohol

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
and that's also helped by the fact that

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.050 
and that's also helped by the fact that
it<00:00:47.890> has<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.100> thin<00:00:48.610> skin

richness and full body now let's

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.980 
richness and full body now let's
contrast<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.460> Cabernet<00:01:51.460> Sauvignon<00:01:52.030> this

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
contrast it to Cabernet Sauvignon this

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.499 
contrast it to Cabernet Sauvignon this
grape<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.619> much<00:01:54.070> smaller<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.360> has<00:01:55.479> a

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
grape is much smaller and it has a

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.200 
grape is much smaller and it has a
thicker<00:01:56.049> skin<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.460> there<00:01:57.790> isn't<00:01:58.060> as<00:01:58.180> much

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
thicker skin so there isn't as much

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.600 
thicker skin so there isn't as much
juice<00:01:58.780> in<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.170> Cabernet<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.890> as<00:02:00.400> there's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
juice in the Cabernet and as there's

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.899 
juice in the Cabernet and as there's
more<00:02:00.790> tannin<00:02:01.360> in<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.110> mix<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.159> get<00:02:03.549> a<00:02:03.579> much

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
more tannin in the mix so you get a much

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.390 
more tannin in the mix so you get a much
more<00:02:04.210> structured<00:02:04.869> wine<00:02:05.350> from<00:02:05.920> Cabernet

mature<00:05:39.070> it<00:05:39.280> more<00:05:39.490> quickly<00:05:39.760> so<00:05:40.479> that<00:05:40.660> those

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
mature it more quickly so that those

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.900 
mature it more quickly so that those
tannins<00:05:41.320> aren't<00:05:41.650> quite<00:05:41.919> so<00:05:42.220> aggressive
