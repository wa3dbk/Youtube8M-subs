hi I'm Dave and today I'm going to
answer<00:00:02.159> your<00:00:02.490> questions<00:00:03.030> about<00:00:03.120> piston<00:00:12.590> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
answer your questions about piston the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.230 
answer your questions about piston the
most<00:00:13.799> common<00:00:14.160> question<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:14.639> hear<00:00:14.670> regarding

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
most common question we hear regarding

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.099 
most common question we hear regarding
pistons<00:00:15.719> centers<00:00:16.440> around<00:00:16.590> piston<00:00:17.279> material

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
pistons centers around piston material

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.090 
pistons centers around piston material
basically<00:00:19.109> what's<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.590> difference<00:00:19.949> between

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
basically what's the difference between

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.099 
basically what's the difference between
a<00:00:20.279> cast<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.060> Forge<00:00:21.359> piston

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
a cast and in Forge piston

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.170 
a cast and in Forge piston
well<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.070> difference<00:00:23.400> mainly<00:00:23.580> lies<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
well the difference mainly lies in the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.359 
well the difference mainly lies in the
manufacturing<00:00:24.900> process<00:00:25.039> but<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> cast

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
manufacturing process but the cast

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.700 
manufacturing process but the cast
piston<00:00:26.910> basically<00:00:27.779> melt<00:00:28.019> down<00:00:28.230> aluminum

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
piston basically melt down aluminum

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
piston basically melt down aluminum
alloy<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.400> pour<00:00:29.820> into<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.090> mold<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.510> then

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
alloy and pour into a mold and then

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.319 
alloy and pour into a mold and then
quickly<00:00:30.900> cool<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.380> with<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> forged<00:00:32.610> piston<00:00:33.120> is

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
quickly cool it with a forged piston is

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.389 
quickly cool it with a forged piston is
start<00:00:33.809> with<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.960> lump<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.380> aluminum<00:00:34.890> or<00:00:34.950> element

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
start with a lump of aluminum or element

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
start with a lump of aluminum or element
and<00:00:35.520> then<00:00:35.640> stamp<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> piston<00:00:36.600> directly<00:00:37.079> out

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and then stamp the piston directly out

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.990 
and then stamp the piston directly out
of<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.440> material<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.670> what's<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
of that material so what's the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.410 
of that material so what's the
advantages<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.540> each<00:00:39.750> well<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> cast<00:00:41.090> piston<00:00:42.090> is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
advantages of each well a cast piston is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
advantages of each well a cast piston is
generally<00:00:42.899> more<00:00:43.050> affordable<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:44.340> lighter

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
generally more affordable it's lighter

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.630 
generally more affordable it's lighter
weight<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.239> often<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.320> plenty<00:00:47.100> ample<00:00:47.460> for

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
weight and often it's plenty ample for

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.209 
weight and often it's plenty ample for
street<00:00:47.879> applications<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.110> forged<00:00:49.500> piston<00:00:49.950> is

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
street applications the forged piston is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
street applications the forged piston is
typically<00:00:50.579> much<00:00:51.030> stronger<00:00:51.390> than<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> cast

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
typically much stronger than a cast

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.569 
typically much stronger than a cast
piston<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.559> recommend<00:00:53.010> those<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.460> high

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
piston and we recommend those for a high

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.540 
piston and we recommend those for a high
rpm<00:00:53.820> or<00:00:54.270> high<00:00:54.390> horsepower<00:00:54.780> applications<00:00:55.550> so

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
rpm or high horsepower applications so

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.459 
rpm or high horsepower applications so
one<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.239> need<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> step<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.960> forge

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
one is that you need to step up to forge

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
step up to a four piston but if you're
