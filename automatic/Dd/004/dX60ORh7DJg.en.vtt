papaya<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.199> through<00:00:29.539> not<00:00:30.539> too<00:00:30.660> much<00:00:30.810> here

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
papaya to get through not too much here

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.250 
papaya to get through not too much here
so<00:00:31.859> when<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.130> get<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> papaya<00:00:32.880> i<00:00:33.660> also<00:00:34.079> have

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
eat it through the wall afterwards which

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.319 
eat it through the wall afterwards which
I<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.950> because<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.579> JP<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.270> I

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
I have to do because I'm on JP so I

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:58.130 
I have to do because I'm on JP so I
can't<00:00:42.600> use<00:00:42.660> storage<00:00:56.449> alright<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.809> once<00:00:58.050> you

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
can't use storage alright so once you

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.700 
can't use storage alright so once you
have<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> papaya<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.859> go<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> this<00:01:00.379> cross<00:01:01.379> here

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
have the papaya I go to this cross here

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.600 
have the papaya I go to this cross here
on<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> floor<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.239> place<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
on the floor and then I place of the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.130 
on the floor and then I place of the
pyre<00:01:05.610> while<00:01:05.880> looking<00:01:06.210> at<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> wall<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.930> green

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
pyre while looking at the wall the green

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.440 
pyre while looking at the wall the green
wall<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.030> should<00:01:09.210> make<00:01:09.390> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
wall here and that should make it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.660 
wall here and that should make it
possible<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.380> clip<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.100> eat<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:14.430> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
possible to clip and to eat it so and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.070 
possible to clip and to eat it so and
then<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.869> not<00:01:15.960> too

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
then just get up here it's not too

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.270 
then just get up here it's not too
important<00:01:16.470> when<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.619> don't<00:01:17.159> think<00:01:17.430> about<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> oh

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
important when I don't think about it oh

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.800 
important when I don't think about it oh
we<00:01:20.280> got<00:01:20.430> very<00:01:20.640> pretty<00:01:20.939> lucky<00:01:21.119> alright<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.750> I'm

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
we got very pretty lucky alright so I'm

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.179 
we got very pretty lucky alright so I'm
going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:21.990> pause<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:23.009> went

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
going to pause here because it went

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.280 
going to pause here because it went
pretty<00:01:23.310> fast<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.110> now

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
pretty fast and what I'm going to do now

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.109 
pretty fast and what I'm going to do now
is<00:01:25.320> instead<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.890> going<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> first<00:01:26.520> person<00:01:26.939> like

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
is instead of going it first person like

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.719 
is instead of going it first person like
most<00:01:27.420> other<00:01:27.990> setups<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:29.040> other<00:01:29.369> setups

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
most other setups of all other setups

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.990 
most other setups of all other setups
even<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.060> think<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:31.259> are<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:32.000> turn

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
even I think we are just going to turn

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.390 
even I think we are just going to turn
to<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> right<00:01:33.720> or<00:01:34.259> look<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> right<00:01:34.890> then

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
to the right or look to the right then

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.700 
to the right or look to the right then
double<00:01:35.820> jump<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.210> flutter<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.840> shoot<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
double jump and flutter and shoot the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.469 
double jump and flutter and shoot the
bullet<00:01:37.950> bill<00:01:38.189> once<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.880> see<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.150> it's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
bullet bill once you can see that it's

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.370 
bullet bill once you can see that it's
going<00:01:39.689> towards<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.710> merry-go-round<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
going towards the merry-go-round and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.569 
going towards the merry-go-round and
this<00:01:43.380> makes<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> bit<00:01:43.920> more<00:01:44.070> lenient<00:01:44.460> because

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
this makes the bit more lenient because

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.639 
this makes the bit more lenient because
you<00:01:44.880> don't<00:01:45.060> really<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> stand<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you don't really have to stand in a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
you don't really have to stand in a
specific<00:01:47.159> position<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:48.000> see<00:01:48.149> when

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
specific position you can just see when

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.440 
specific position you can just see when
to<00:01:48.570> hit<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> yeah<00:01:50.939> that's<00:01:51.119> what<00:01:51.270> I'm<00:01:51.329> going

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
to hit it so yeah that's what I'm going

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.450 
to hit it so yeah that's what I'm going
to<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.630> here<00:01:51.890> double<00:01:52.890> jump<00:01:53.100> water<00:01:53.570> here

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
to do here double jump water here

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.840 
to do here double jump water here
to<00:01:56.299> meet<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.570> crew<00:01:56.799> turn<00:01:57.799> around<00:01:57.920> jump<00:01:58.729> up

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
to meet the crew turn around jump up

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.710 
to meet the crew turn around jump up
with<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.030> platform<00:02:00.130> there<00:02:01.130> we<00:02:01.250> go<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:02.540> then

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
with the platform there we go and then

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.530 
with the platform there we go and then
of<00:02:02.900> course<00:02:03.940> have<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.060> make<00:02:05.180> sure<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.390> don't

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
of course have to make sure you don't

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.850 
of course have to make sure you don't
get<00:02:05.630> hit<00:02:05.780> by<00:02:05.900> anything<00:02:06.110> here<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:08.679> we<00:02:09.679> shoot

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
get hit by anything here so we shoot

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.290 
get hit by anything here so we shoot
everything<00:02:10.069> away<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.520> was<00:02:10.610> lucky<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:11.150> we

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
everything away that was lucky that we
