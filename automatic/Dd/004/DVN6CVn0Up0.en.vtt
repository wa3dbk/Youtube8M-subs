Ontario California to near Wimberley

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.910 
Ontario California to near Wimberley
Texas<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> there's<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.290> grand<00:01:37.530> total<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.860> about

let me get in position here and I can

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.740 
let me get in position here and I can
show<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.049> before<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.040> after<00:01:44.310> picture

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.840 

first<00:01:48.750> here's<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.049> before<00:01:49.229> picture<00:01:49.759> there's<00:01:50.759> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
first here's a before picture there's a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.289 
first here's a before picture there's a
Aniki<00:01:51.840> -<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.320> was<00:01:52.680> using<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.100> V<00:01:53.399> compound<00:01:54.060> on

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
Aniki - I was using the V compound on

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.209 
Aniki - I was using the V compound on
this<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.659> that's<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> Racing<00:01:55.439> compound<00:01:56.009> it

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
this one that's the Racing compound it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.859 
this one that's the Racing compound it
allows<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:56.969> higher<00:01:57.180> temperature

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
allows for a little higher temperature

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.240 
allows for a little higher temperature
so<00:01:59.329> mileage<00:02:00.329> might<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:01.020> enhanced<00:02:01.560> by<00:02:01.740> going

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
so mileage might be enhanced by going

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.069 
so mileage might be enhanced by going
with<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.520> compound<00:02:03.060> versus<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> other<00:02:03.869> one

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
with that compound versus the other one

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.530 
with that compound versus the other one
