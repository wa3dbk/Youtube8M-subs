00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.950
 most people know what strikes 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.840
 head dangerous for the health of the brain 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 our memories and dreams are kept 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.970
 talents and emotions happiness and sadness are shorter 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.740
 all our unique personality 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.750
 but people didn't always give it 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.160
 value head ancient scientists 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.980
 suggested that the soul and personality 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.170
 human is in the heart she is right in 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.740
 man without him right in the middle of the body 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.439
 dies 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 that is, the heart is even breathing 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.800
 her life pulsates besides she 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.230
 perfectly protected 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.090
 hidden between the lungs surrounded by a lattice 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.879
 from the ribs and covered suit the armor plate 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.920
 and yet the brain was more important and 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.739
 he is protected no worse than his heart 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.940
 surrounds a liquid shock absorber pad 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.640
 cerebrospinal fluid and around 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.469
 also a ball with a bone armor a skull and how 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.239
 Once in this armor is hidden one of 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.640
 Brain Vulnerabilities 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.070
 head moves sharply in space 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.199
 but the brain is soft like cheese and skull 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.539
 solid so inertia forces the brain 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.790
 bump your own armor and in the beginning 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.280
 movement and stopping i.e. protection 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.890
 the brain itself hurts him twice 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.140
 Moreover, concussion can happen without 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.240
 any strike is quite simple 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.310
 move or spin your head 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.229
 the brain doesn't just move aside it 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.689
 rotates around its axis and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.240
 deformed inside and outside ie 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.040
 brain chats inside the skull like a passenger 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.860
 in the bus at this moment happens 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.140
 the most dangerous part of shaking in your 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.490
 mask as if the wires are torn thing is 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.159
 what is the main brain cell 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.500
 neurons live in the gray matter of it 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.750
 It includes car and brain stem is like 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.939
 processors and memory of our computer and 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.700
 here is the inner filling of the brain is white 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.619
 substance is just huge 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.259
 tangled wiring is axons 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.570
 long strings that come from each 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.880
 neuron and connect gray chips to each 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.490
 other such brain wires more than 160 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.710
 thousand kilometers if you deploy them to 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.079
 one string will almost half 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.850
 distance from the earth to the moon is a problem in 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.460
 that when shaking gray and white 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.560
 substance move our wires sharply 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.119
 stretch twisted and even 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.550
 break down like a wire from the headphones 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.410
 damaged plug axon 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.390
 begins to excrete poisonous things with 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.640
 his neuron gradually dies away 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.250
 congratulations you got irreversible 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.740
 brain damage is clear that such an injury 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.960
 do not save any gloves in boxing helmets 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.860
 in hockey american football not belts 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.960
 security 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.450
 well, a broken skull does not threaten you 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.910
 but the crunch and shake guaranteed 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.740
 and will not save nor a helmet on him because 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.960
 it is only needed to protect from 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.390
 skull fractures they are from concussions 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.580
 studies have shown that concussion they 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.530
 pass just like that a person starts 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.720
 atrophy part of the white matter in 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.240
 areas that are responsible for the mood 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.400
 mindfulness working memory and acceptance 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.590
 making worse concussion 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.050
 accumulate like a snowball we already 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.270
 know for sure that after one shake 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.010
 the next one is much easier to get from 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.690
 a weaker blow true scientists 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.510
 for some reason still not figured out 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.610
 why is it so what to do if 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.590
 concussion did happen very much 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.080
 just don't strain your brain 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.940
 Alas, it is more difficult than it seems because it 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.530
 mean that even if you feel 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.580
 ok you can't play 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.800
 computer games 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.780
 surf the internet read write 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.240
 text messages all these classes 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.040
 load for the brain to the same cure 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.620
 the effects of a concussion 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.780
 you can only relieve the symptoms so that 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.490
 if you are going to devote your life 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.590
 mental work is not worth too much 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.780
 get involved in professional boxing rick 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.290
 beat hockey take care of your head 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.150
 you are probably your brain every 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.980
 man ever tried to delay 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.989
 breath and see how much will stand 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.239
 limit for the average person 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.450
 one or two minutes but the human body 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.190
 capable of more than 2009 but the box 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.290
 stepan no court not breathing whole 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.220
 eleven and a half minutes but like u 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.220
 he got it
