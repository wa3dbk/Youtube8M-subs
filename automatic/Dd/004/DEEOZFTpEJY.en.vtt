welcome<00:00:10.520> to<00:00:10.700> the<00:00:10.730> phobias<00:00:11.360> operation<00:00:12.049> videos

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:13.209 
welcome to the phobias operation videos

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.660 
welcome to the phobias operation videos
okay<00:00:14.209> let's<00:00:14.840> continue<00:00:15.350> with<00:00:15.559> the<00:00:15.860> calibration

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
okay let's continue with the calibration

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.920 
okay let's continue with the calibration
process<00:00:17.650> first<00:00:18.650> we<00:00:19.190> engage<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:19.940> fovea<00:00:20.390> servo

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
process first we engage the fovea servo

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.339 
process first we engage the fovea servo
our<00:00:21.170> motor<00:00:21.560> to<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:21.859> lens<00:00:22.220> gear<00:00:22.580> assembly<00:00:23.349> we

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
our motor to the lens gear assembly we

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.589 
our motor to the lens gear assembly we
have<00:00:24.589> already<00:00:24.769> selected<00:00:25.519> an<00:00:25.849> appropriate

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
have already selected an appropriate

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.470 
have already selected an appropriate
speed<00:00:27.160> let's<00:00:28.160> move<00:00:28.460> the<00:00:28.699> lens<00:00:28.939> through<00:00:29.330> all

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
speed let's move the lens through all

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.650 
speed let's move the lens through all
its<00:00:29.689> range<00:00:30.369> please<00:00:31.369> pay<00:00:31.789> attention<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.509> the

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
its range please pay attention to the

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:54.330 
its range please pay attention to the
noise<00:00:32.810> reduction<00:00:39.550> now<00:00:40.550> backwards

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.460 

now<00:00:55.340> we<00:00:55.940> will<00:00:56.120> set<00:00:56.420> a<00:00:56.450> limited<00:00:57.020> range<00:00:57.200> of

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
now we will set a limited range of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.540 
now we will set a limited range of
motion<00:00:58.000> to<00:00:59.000> do<00:00:59.270> so<00:00:59.600> we<00:01:00.170> first<00:01:00.530> settle<00:01:01.010> left<00:01:01.280> and

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
motion to do so we first settle left and

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:14.160 
motion to do so we first settle left and
by<00:01:01.760> pressing<00:01:02.330> the<00:01:02.540> left<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.110> button

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.480 

and<00:01:14.259> then<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.310> right<00:01:15.549> end<00:01:16.740> now<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.799> motion<00:01:18.340> is

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
and then a right end now the motion is

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.060 
and then a right end now the motion is
restricted<00:01:19.210> only<00:01:19.330> bet<00:01:19.750> when<00:01:19.780> these<00:01:20.200> two<00:01:20.560> focal

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
restricted only bet when these two focal

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.760 
restricted only bet when these two focal
distances<00:01:21.729> no<00:01:22.000> matter<00:01:22.210> how<00:01:22.600> far<00:01:22.960> we<00:01:22.990> turn<00:01:23.560> the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
distances no matter how far we turn the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:48.899 
distances no matter how far we turn the
knob

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.749
