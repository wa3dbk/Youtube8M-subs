00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
around and use it on them so this is a

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.850 
around and use it on them so this is a
strategy<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.660> very<00:03:52.110> very<00:03:52.230> helpful<00:03:52.590> it

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
strategy that is very very helpful it

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.440 
strategy that is very very helpful it
takes<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.280> long<00:03:53.489> time<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:54.000> feels<00:03:54.209> really

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
takes a long time it feels really

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.360 
takes a long time it feels really
tedious<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.170> it's<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.830> only<00:03:55.890> way<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.340> I

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
tedious but it's the only way that I

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.680 
tedious but it's the only way that I
could<00:03:56.459> figure<00:03:56.760> out<00:03:56.819> how<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.090> beat<00:03:57.299> this<00:03:57.480> guy

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
could figure out how to beat this guy

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.600 
could figure out how to beat this guy
because<00:03:58.049> as<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.560> said<00:03:58.620> before<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:59.100> didn't<00:03:59.459> come

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
because as I said before I didn't come

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.289
