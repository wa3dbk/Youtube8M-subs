this distance too good of a job because
my<00:01:56.420> second<00:01:56.810> shot<00:01:57.050> was<00:01:57.260> always<00:01:57.800> off<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.910> low

I<00:06:28.650> care<00:06:29.310> the<00:06:29.520> ak-74<00:06:30.419> I<00:06:30.660> think<00:06:31.110> overall<00:06:31.650> it's

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
I care the ak-74 I think overall it's

I care the ak-74 I think overall it's
probably<00:06:33.000> a<00:06:33.030> little<00:06:33.419> bit<00:06:33.600> better<00:06:33.870> choice<00:06:34.230> for

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
probably a little bit better choice for

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:40.520 
probably a little bit better choice for
