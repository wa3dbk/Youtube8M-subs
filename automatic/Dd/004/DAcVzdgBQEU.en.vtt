00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
like that you don't need to know that

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.249 
like that you don't need to know that
you<00:00:31.150> know<00:00:31.270> the<00:00:31.390> speed<00:00:31.599> will<00:00:31.779> come<00:00:31.810> with<00:00:32.110> time

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
you know the speed will come with time

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.619 
you know the speed will come with time
and<00:00:32.500> that's<00:00:32.980> definitely<00:00:33.309> true<00:00:33.760> speed<00:00:34.150> is<00:00:34.330> not

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.979 
and that's definitely true speed is not
everything<00:00:35.140> and<00:00:35.350> speed<00:00:35.739> without<00:00:35.950> control<00:00:36.760> is

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
everything and speed without control is

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.350 
everything and speed without control is
absolutely<00:00:37.989> useless<00:00:38.800> but<00:00:39.580> that<00:00:39.970> said<00:00:40.210> I

right<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.850> body<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.150> kind<00:02:38.269> of<00:02:38.390> like<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.690> machine

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
right the body is kind of like a machine

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.720 
right the body is kind of like a machine
and<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.410> machine<00:02:39.709> has<00:02:39.890> many<00:02:40.100> different<00:02:40.310> parts

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
and the machine has many different parts

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.170 
and the machine has many different parts
and<00:02:40.880> all<00:02:41.420> those<00:02:41.660> parts<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:43.400> contribute<00:02:43.940> to

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
and all those parts really contribute to

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.110 
and all those parts really contribute to
what<00:02:44.900> we<00:02:44.989> do<00:02:45.140> on<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.500> drum<00:02:45.680> set<00:02:45.709> okay<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:46.670> what

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
what we do on the drum set okay so what

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.170 
what we do on the drum set okay so what
I<00:02:47.150> do<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.200> just<00:02:48.230> kind<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.620> play<00:02:48.980> these<00:02:49.459> groups

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
I do is I just kind of play these groups

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.940 
I do is I just kind of play these groups
around<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.840> drum<00:02:51.080> set<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:51.470> I'll<00:02:51.620> do<00:02:51.769> two

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
around the drum set so I'll do two

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.530 
around the drum set so I'll do two
sixteenth<00:02:52.489> notes<00:02:52.790> followed<00:02:53.000> by<00:02:53.209> four

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
sixteenth notes followed by four

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:31.369 
sixteenth notes followed by four
thirty-second<00:02:54.170> notes<00:02:54.290> around<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.680> drum<00:02:54.860> set

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.580 

and<00:03:33.150> eventually<00:03:34.150> once<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:34.930> start<00:03:35.200> wanting<00:03:35.379> to

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
and eventually once you start wanting to

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.699 
and eventually once you start wanting to
do<00:03:35.709> longer<00:03:36.540> bursts<00:03:37.540> you'll<00:03:38.230> be<00:03:38.379> able<00:03:38.470> to

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
do longer bursts you'll be able to

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.380 
do longer bursts you'll be able to
without<00:03:39.099> any<00:03:39.129> hassle<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:39.849> you<00:03:39.939> can<00:03:40.090> start

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
without any hassle so you can start

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.110 
without any hassle so you can start
doing<00:03:40.510> groups<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.500> eight<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.220> not<00:03:42.970> even

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
doing groups of eight and not even

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.059 
doing groups of eight and not even
really<00:03:43.299> worry<00:03:43.510> about<00:03:43.599> the<00:03:43.750> time<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.590> things

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
really worry about the time of things

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.160 
really worry about the time of things
necessarily<00:03:45.610> but<00:03:45.730> just<00:03:45.790> really<00:03:46.390> focus<00:03:47.019> on

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
necessarily but just really focus on

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.899 
necessarily but just really focus on
that<00:03:47.620> group<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:48.040> eight<00:03:48.189> making<00:03:48.609> sure<00:03:48.760> it's

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
that group of eight making sure it's

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.429 
that group of eight making sure it's
nice<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.090> consistent<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:50.170> can<00:03:50.290> follow

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
nice and consistent and you can follow

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.349 
nice and consistent and you can follow
it<00:03:50.650> by<00:03:50.769> four<00:03:51.069> sixteenth<00:03:51.579> notes<00:03:51.819> or<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.180> can

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
it by four sixteenth notes or you can

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.550 
it by four sixteenth notes or you can
follow<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.629> by<00:03:52.720> two<00:03:52.780> sixteenth<00:03:53.349> notes

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
follow it by two sixteenth notes

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:23.240 
follow it by two sixteenth notes
whatever<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:53.950> want

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.150 

and<00:04:24.930> then<00:04:25.930> when<00:04:26.080> I<00:04:26.110> play<00:04:26.350> is<00:04:26.560> just<00:04:26.590> sixteenth

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
and then when I play is just sixteenth

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.220 
and then when I play is just sixteenth
notes<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.610> throw<00:04:27.880> in<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.060> bursts<00:04:28.480> randomly

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
notes and throw in the bursts randomly

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:58.409 
notes and throw in the bursts randomly
around<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.710> kit<00:04:29.889> like<00:04:30.340> this

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.600 

it<00:04:59.419> takes<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.780> lot<00:04:59.900> of<00:04:59.960> time<00:05:00.230> but<00:05:00.740> it's<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.430> best

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
it takes a lot of time but it's the best

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.390 
it takes a lot of time but it's the best
way<00:05:01.850> I<00:05:01.880> feel<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.570> get<00:05:03.380> to<00:05:03.500> those<00:05:03.650> faster<00:05:04.130> speeds

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
way I feel to get to those faster speeds

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.860 
way I feel to get to those faster speeds
and<00:05:04.580> to<00:05:04.700> really<00:05:04.820> push<00:05:05.030> yourself<00:05:05.419> rather<00:05:05.690> than

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
and to really push yourself rather than

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.629 
and to really push yourself rather than
putting<00:05:06.230> on<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.350> metronome<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:06.980> really<00:05:07.460> just

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
putting on a metronome and really just

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.090 
putting on a metronome and really just
struggling<00:05:08.120> to<00:05:08.330> keep<00:05:08.540> up<00:05:08.750> for<00:05:09.410> days<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:09.950> days

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
struggling to keep up for days and days

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.310 
struggling to keep up for days and days
and<00:05:10.370> days<00:05:10.430> or<00:05:10.820> simply<00:05:11.630> just<00:05:11.660> practicing

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
and days or simply just practicing

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.860 
and days or simply just practicing
finger<00:05:12.830> technique<00:05:13.040> and<00:05:13.550> not<00:05:13.700> really<00:05:14.060> knowing

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
finger technique and not really knowing

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.500 
finger technique and not really knowing
how<00:05:15.139> this<00:05:15.770> translates<00:05:16.370> specifically<00:05:17.090> on<00:05:17.270> the

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
how this translates specifically on the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.810 
how this translates specifically on the
drumset<00:05:18.010> exactly<00:05:19.010> playing<00:05:19.220> drum<00:05:19.490> set<00:05:19.669> you're

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
drumset exactly playing drum set you're

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.550 
drumset exactly playing drum set you're
using<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.270> combination<00:05:20.570> of<00:05:20.960> things<00:05:21.200> it's<00:05:21.440> never

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
using a combination of things it's never

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.340 
using a combination of things it's never
really<00:05:21.919> just<00:05:22.370> fingers<00:05:22.910> or<00:05:23.180> just<00:05:23.930> wrists

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
really just fingers or just wrists

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.040 
really just fingers or just wrists
sometimes<00:05:25.040> it<00:05:25.190> is<00:05:25.310> but<00:05:25.490> not<00:05:26.120> as<00:05:26.270> often<00:05:26.510> as<00:05:26.870> it

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
sometimes it is but not as often as it

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.350 
sometimes it is but not as often as it
is<00:05:27.169> you<00:05:27.620> know<00:05:27.650> using<00:05:27.980> the<00:05:28.250> whole<00:05:28.520> motor<00:05:29.030> and

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
is you know using the whole motor and

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.090 
is you know using the whole motor and
using<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.780> whole<00:05:29.990> machine<00:05:30.440> as<00:05:30.650> I<00:05:30.800> was<00:05:30.919> saying

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
using the whole machine as I was saying

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.159 
using the whole machine as I was saying
before<00:05:31.220> so<00:05:32.150> I<00:05:32.180> really<00:05:32.240> hope<00:05:32.660> that<00:05:32.870> helps<00:05:33.139> you

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
before so I really hope that helps you

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.460 
before so I really hope that helps you
guys<00:05:33.310> play<00:05:34.310> using<00:05:34.880> Burstyn<00:05:35.660> around<00:05:36.169> the

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
guys play using Burstyn around the

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.020 
guys play using Burstyn around the
drumset<00:05:36.889> I<00:05:37.040> think<00:05:37.250> this<00:05:37.370> is<00:05:37.490> a<00:05:37.520> great<00:05:37.850> way<00:05:38.000> to

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
drumset I think this is a great way to

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.270 
drumset I think this is a great way to
