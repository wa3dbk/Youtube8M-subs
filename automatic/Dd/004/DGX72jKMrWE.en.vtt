00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
have you ever wondered how much power

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.570 
have you ever wondered how much power
your<00:00:04.319> daily<00:00:04.650> driven<00:00:04.859> car<00:00:05.160> could<00:00:05.339> actually

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
horsepower but we have gone crazy we've

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.029 
horsepower but we have gone crazy we've
put<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.670> massive<00:00:15.330> nos<00:00:15.719> system<00:00:15.929> will<00:00:16.770> go<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
put in a massive nos system will go to

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.550 
put in a massive nos system will go to
the<00:00:17.130> power<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:17.520> by<00:00:17.670> 50<00:00:18.090> or<00:00:18.449> 100<00:00:18.600> 150<00:00:19.439> horsepower

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the power up by 50 or 100 150 horsepower

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.650 
the power up by 50 or 100 150 horsepower
all<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> way<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.310> I'm<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.510> how<00:00:21.539> long

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
all the way up I'm going to see how long

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.620 
all the way up I'm going to see how long
it<00:00:21.869> takes<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.289> kill<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> engine<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
it takes to kill the engine and this is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
it takes to kill the engine and this is
the<00:00:25.050> driver<00:00:25.640> Malcolm<00:00:27.590> we<00:00:28.590> fitted<00:00:28.920> as<00:00:29.039> X<00:00:29.250> nos

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the driver Malcolm we fitted as X nos

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.849 
the driver Malcolm we fitted as X nos
system<00:00:29.670> easily<00:00:30.269> install<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.170> system<00:00:31.500> runs<00:00:31.710> up

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
system easily install the system runs up

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.950 
system easily install the system runs up
a<00:00:31.949> single<00:00:32.309> bottle<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:33.149> throttle<00:00:33.540> position

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
a single bottle and a throttle position

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.069 
a single bottle and a throttle position
sensor<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:35.190> will<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> nos<00:00:36.360> system<00:00:36.570> make<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
sensor so will the nos system make the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.799 
sensor so will the nos system make the
old<00:00:37.230> skyline<00:00:37.680> fast<00:00:37.980> or<00:00:38.879> will<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.239> destroy<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
old skyline fast or will it destroy the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.160 
old skyline fast or will it destroy the
engine<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:42.120> how<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.329> feeling<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.809> big<00:00:42.989> run

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
engine so how you feeling for big run

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.600 
engine so how you feeling for big run
well<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.940> old<00:00:45.120> man<00:00:45.410> Eddie<00:00:46.410> 454<00:00:47.039> big<00:00:47.219> block<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
well my old man Eddie 454 big block in a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.150 
well my old man Eddie 454 big block in a
tirana<00:00:48.469> makes<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.620> thing<00:00:49.800> look<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.039> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
tirana makes this thing look like a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
tirana makes this thing look like a
bloody<00:00:50.430> toy<00:00:50.760> are<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.539> reckon<00:00:52.160> cool<00:00:53.180> let's

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
bloody toy are you reckon cool let's

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.290 
bloody toy are you reckon cool let's
start<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> 60<00:00:55.350> horsepower<00:00:55.559> kit

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:13.179 

and

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.520 

so<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.520> did<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.850> 14.9<00:01:15.630> at<00:01:15.840> 91<00:01:16.170> miles<00:01:16.380> an

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
so we just did a 14.9 at 91 miles an

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.050 
so we just did a 14.9 at 91 miles an
hour<00:01:16.619> which<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.890> pretty<00:01:17.009> good<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.759> engine<00:01:18.030> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
hour which is pretty good the engine is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.090 
hour which is pretty good the engine is
pretty<00:01:18.270> cool<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.020> we're<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> fit<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
pretty cool so we're going to fit the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.249 
pretty cool so we're going to fit the
100<00:01:20.670> horsepower<00:01:20.909> nice<00:01:21.270> kid<00:01:21.540> giving<00:01:21.990> us<00:01:22.170> a

dude as you can see the 100 horsepower
nozzle<00:01:45.929> is<00:01:46.110> considerably<00:01:46.920> larger<00:01:47.130> than<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
nozzle is considerably larger than the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.020 
nozzle is considerably larger than the

60 it forces a vast amount more nos into

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969 
60 it forces a vast amount more nos into
the<00:01:51.240> engine<00:01:51.539> but<00:01:52.140> I'll<00:01:52.289> be<00:01:52.409> pushing<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.830> too

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the engine but I'll be pushing it too

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:10.400 
the engine but I'll be pushing it too
far<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.880> will<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.270> too<00:01:54.569> much

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.009 

how<00:02:11.410> was<00:02:11.530> run<00:02:12.150> its<00:02:13.150> bits<00:02:13.540> going<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.870> bit<00:02:13.959> better

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
how was run its bits going a bit better

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.089 
how was run its bits going a bit better
now<00:02:14.319> sir<00:02:15.959> half<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.140> paramedics<00:02:17.709> Carol

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
now sir half the paramedics Carol

now sir half the paramedics Carol
drinking<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.610> think<00:02:19.510> it's<00:02:19.629> about<00:02:19.690> time<00:02:19.959> we<00:02:20.260> put

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
drinking I think it's about time we put

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.320 
drinking I think it's about time we put
in<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.830> big<00:02:20.980> kit<00:02:21.220> I'm<00:02:21.849> gonna<00:02:22.030> put<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.269> the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
in the big kit I'm gonna put in the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.509 
in the big kit I'm gonna put in the
largest<00:02:22.720> nas<00:02:22.870> nas<00:02:23.349> what<00:02:23.500> we<00:02:23.620> have<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.370> gives

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
largest nas nas what we have that gives

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.699 
largest nas nas what we have that gives
us<00:02:24.610> about<00:02:24.730> 400<00:02:25.599> horsepower<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.470> should

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
us about 400 horsepower that should

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.940 
us about 400 horsepower that should
definitely<00:02:27.099> killed<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.580> engine
