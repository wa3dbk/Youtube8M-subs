is a dimarzio and I put in this it was

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.139 
is a dimarzio and I put in this it was
routed<00:01:26.180> out<00:01:26.299> this<00:01:27.009> kaler<00:01:28.009> vibrato<00:01:28.520> bar<00:01:28.820> system

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.020 
routed out this kaler vibrato bar system
which<00:01:29.780> I<00:01:30.009> don't<00:01:31.009> know<00:01:31.250> if<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.520> companies<00:01:31.880> even

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
which I don't know if the companies even

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.670 
which I don't know if the companies even
in<00:01:32.240> business<00:01:32.570> anymore<00:01:33.130> they<00:01:34.130> might<00:01:34.340> be<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:35.680> so

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
in business anymore they might be and so

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.859 
in business anymore they might be and so
that<00:01:37.399> was<00:01:37.549> routed<00:01:38.000> out<00:01:38.119> of<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.240> guitar<00:01:38.390> I'm

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.740 
that was routed out of the guitar I'm
thinking<00:01:39.399> but<00:01:40.399> put<00:01:40.609> a<00:01:40.640> Floyd<00:01:41.000> Rose<00:01:41.030> in<00:01:41.600> there

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.319 
thinking but put a Floyd Rose in there
possibly<00:01:41.990> if<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:42.890> possible<00:01:43.100> if<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.149> is

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
possibly if it's possible if this is

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.480 
possibly if it's possible if this is
even<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.630> go<00:01:44.840> or<00:01:45.170> what<00:01:45.950> I'm<00:01:46.070> going<00:01:46.189> to<00:01:46.250> do<00:01:46.340> with

look at the back real quick and cleaned

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.990 
look at the back real quick and cleaned
up<00:04:16.430> kind<00:04:16.670> of<00:04:16.760> nice<00:04:17.680> is<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.890> back<00:04:20.049> scrubbed

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
up kind of nice is the back scrubbed

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.860 
up kind of nice is the back scrubbed
that<00:04:23.000> up<00:04:23.360> so<00:04:24.850> it's<00:04:25.850> not<00:04:25.970> too<00:04:26.180> bad<00:04:26.360> you<00:04:26.600> can<00:04:26.720> see

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
that up so it's not too bad you can see

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.420 
that up so it's not too bad you can see
from<00:04:27.170> the<00:04:27.350> reflection<00:04:28.010> I<00:04:28.130> mean<00:04:28.280> it's

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
from the reflection I mean it's

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.010 
from the reflection I mean it's
basically<00:04:28.580> like<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.180> car<00:04:29.540> it<00:04:29.690> needs<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.930> be

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
basically like a car it needs to be

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.290 
basically like a car it needs to be
rubbed<00:04:30.290> out<00:04:31.810> it's<00:04:32.810> got<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.080> dull<00:04:33.380> finish<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:34.010> it

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
rubbed out it's got a dull finish to it

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.980 
rubbed out it's got a dull finish to it
so<00:04:35.300> I<00:04:36.700> guess<00:04:37.700> my<00:04:37.880> main<00:04:38.330> question<00:04:38.540> what<00:04:38.840> am<00:04:38.930> I

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
so I guess my main question what am I

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.880 
so I guess my main question what am I
going<00:04:39.140> to<00:04:39.230> do<00:04:39.410> with<00:04:39.620> this<00:04:40.360> guitar<00:04:41.360> here<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.890> mean

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
going to do with this guitar here I mean

going to do with this guitar here I mean
I've<00:04:43.100> always<00:04:43.720> I've<00:04:44.720> always<00:04:44.960> wanted<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.860> do

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
I've always I've always wanted to do

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.910 
I've always I've always wanted to do
something<00:04:46.430> with<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.610> and<00:04:46.910> I've<00:04:47.150> had<00:04:48.050> since<00:04:48.320> 84

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
something with it and I've had since 84

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.120 
something with it and I've had since 84
and<00:04:49.280> someone<00:04:49.550> find<00:04:49.730> out<00:04:49.850> what<00:04:49.970> year<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:50.330> is

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
and someone find out what year it is
there's<00:04:52.130> a<00:04:52.310> serial<00:04:52.790> number<00:04:53.090> again<00:04:53.420> to<00:04:53.960> but<00:04:55.150> so

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
there's a serial number again to but so

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.740 
there's a serial number again to but so
I<00:04:56.980> guess<00:04:57.980> there's<00:04:58.160> a<00:04:58.220> couple<00:04:58.430> things<00:04:58.730> I<00:04:59.090> can<00:04:59.510> do

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
I guess there's a couple things I can do

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.290 
I guess there's a couple things I can do
if<00:04:59.900> I<00:05:00.020> get<00:05:00.230> an<00:05:00.740> expert<00:05:01.310> opinion<00:05:01.610> here<00:05:02.000> what<00:05:02.180> to

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
if I get an expert opinion here what to

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.740 
if I get an expert opinion here what to
do<00:05:02.450> is<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:03.620> possible<00:05:03.800> for<00:05:04.250> this<00:05:04.580> guitar<00:05:04.760> to<00:05:05.450> be

online and with a difference obviously a

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.360 
online and with a difference obviously a
different<00:06:25.750> could<00:06:26.440> be<00:06:26.560> a<00:06:26.590> different<00:06:26.919> shape<00:06:27.160> or

style but so I could make this guitar

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.390 
style but so I could make this guitar
and<00:06:36.340> do<00:06:36.430> a<00:06:36.460> real<00:06:37.000> sweet<00:06:37.440> acts<00:06:38.440> again<00:06:38.950> I<00:06:39.220> do

and do a real sweet acts again I do

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.810 
and do a real sweet acts again I do
believe<00:06:39.910> when<00:06:40.419> way<00:06:40.539> or<00:06:40.599> another<00:06:40.810> with<00:06:41.169> no

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
believe when way or another with no

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.629 
believe when way or another with no
probably<00:06:42.820> about<00:06:43.000> 500<00:06:43.360> bucks<00:06:43.690> maybe<00:06:44.520> you<00:06:45.520> know
