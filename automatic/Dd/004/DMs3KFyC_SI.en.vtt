00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:07.569
 Hi guys, I'm counting on this video and 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.950
 today is a well awaited video well asking 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.140
 for you 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.570
 a lot of people asked me from the video 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.059
 of shopping I did when I was going to 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.770
 use this I decided to use one more 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.490
 Time since I bought it, I'll do it. 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.400
 now a tooth whitening at home what 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.369
 uses to whiten this product 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.630
 here is the product was baby 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:35.499
 the 3d whites white white stripes that are 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.829
 whitening tapes with a gel 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:40.600
 bleach that will lighten the 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.409
 teeth actually promotes teeth 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.019
 visibly whiter in three days 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.749
 the result is even more extraordinary in 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:53.889
 a week and he wins here that he does not 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:56.079
 causes damage to the tooth enamel and here 

00:00:53.889 --> 00:01:01.059
 also says it's the same ingredient 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:06.310
 used by dentists are tablets 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:09.160
 Here such as a plate prudent 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.250
 teeth and other dental care 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.250
 higher 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.160
 I did not take the test and my biggest 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.860
 concern when I bought it here 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.960
 was that he used some damage to the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.030
 Enamel even because we know that 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.350
 There is a lot on the internet. 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.530
 especially that you mix with 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.100
 bicarbonate and then put in oxygenated 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.890
 say this in the long run rather than 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.560
 kariya darkens the tooth mainly to 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.420
 bicarbonate appears to darken the tooth 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.690
 we do not recommend you do this 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.690
 without looking for a dentist right years 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.060
 As long as he likes you, you must leave. 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.850
 when you touched this product here 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.190
 People are a little negative 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.460
 This is a little expensive here, I paid 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.610
 forty nine reais and ninety fifty reais 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.560
 is this product here but after 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.840
 search a lot after searching a lot 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.970
 because in most places I was going 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.460
 type was 75 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.250
 had a place I went to a pharmacy 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.550
 I was the one who reached 80 not real 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.140
 I dropped that product here and I from $ 70 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.580
 after searching a lot 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.460
 a lot because I thought that if I were 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.370
 a pharmacy that from home and thus a 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.440
 stipe of $ 90 so what I did not me 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.780
 I'm going to the downtown pharmacy. 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.940
 because it sure will be cheaper 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.530
 only not so before you 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.660
 buy a place further research 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.490
 near your house because we can stop 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.350
 I would never be slow at the dentist. 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.880
 because the group thinks it has never been 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.440
 I do not think so, I think we do. 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.050
 one thing when we think it's necessary 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.650
 always been satisfied with my teeth 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.690
 I never had any problems with them by 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.520
 I've never done any bleaching in the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.250
 teeth at the dentist and I'm going to use this 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.410
 here folks for seven days 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.370
 We have to wear two ribbons as 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.940
 That 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.970
 the pain I had like this during 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.880
 seven days and comes the right contained in the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:22.810
 case 14 packagings packed with this 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.970
 14 package with that and within that 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.830
 packaging comes two ribbons one plate 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.100
 teeth and another for loading 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.910
 and comes 14 packs or more. 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.890
 whether or not the whole 20 and 28 tapes and 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.150
 to spend seven days with her the other 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.130
 something that was forgetting 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.239
 you can not bleach with this 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.989
 product here is more than twice per 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.150
 year 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.820
 Let's go and take the test or the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.250
 first time and if you are curious 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.049
 who want to see how to whiten 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.049
 home, just keep watching video 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.500
 Jorge is not there 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.840
 what yes 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.689
 like this 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.330
 and the sun 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.620
 to 0 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.970
 the Portuguese 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:05.760
 Andijan bits in walking people I'm going to use 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.580
 the ribbons of oral b for seven of them 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.800
 as the manufacturer himself asks and when 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.450
 I'm finished and I'm back to show results. 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.560
 I'm sure you're very 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.969
 curious even more 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.770
 So I'm coming back here like 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:24.629
 result of 3d white white stripes and 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.460
 You sure should be curious. 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.680
 it cleared cleared 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.000
 I quite liked this product varied 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.120
 my teeth 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.310
 So let's say the 80% you are 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.849
 Seeing there, I thought it made a difference if 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:42.240
 I was also with some middle teeth 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:45.150
 yellowish and really in seven days of 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.599
 a good ally I realized that so the 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.460
 time you put the ribbons in your teeth 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:54.150
 You have to know how to look very well. 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.909
 Try not to tap your finger on the 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.909
 gel that comes right behind the tape well behind 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:03.270
 of that plastic part 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:06.539
 Why, because if you do not put it, it's the 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.599
 part that does not have a gel on the teeth 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.279
 will fix it will not quit can not 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.349
 stay al dente 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:17.430
 then it will compromise the result 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:19.680
 end and I used it for seven days as I said 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.810
 For you at the beginning of the video I liked it 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.449
 A lot of people are okay, do not try 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:29.099
 in my teeth were sensitive 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.779
 okay after application of the product during 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:35.310
 application also felt no type 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:37.319
 problem with the tapes is 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.909
 A little complicated to speak 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.089
 I confess it's a bit complicated to 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:44.400
 talking is recommended that you do not eat 

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:46.500
 logically no one in the water when you 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.779
 reader that I recommend to you 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.150
 although the price is a bit expensive, right? 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:55.949
 Because as I told you, it varies from 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:58.020
 50 to 70 reais this and whitening kits 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.039
 but it's something that you can do 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.389
 at home 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:03.080
 I will not say it is a result 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:07.710
 wonderful an amazing result 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.569
 but it is a good result and so it is not a 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.319
 Somewhat discreet thing is not a whitening 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:15.180
 total of teeth 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.110
 I really liked it again, I liked it 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.819
 enough 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.680
 so that's it folks I hope you 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:23.159
 I liked this video I ask that
