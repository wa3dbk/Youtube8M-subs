thousands of dollars I know that and
this<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.579> five<00:01:02.789> hundred<00:01:03.260> but<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.379> thought<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
this is five hundred but I thought I

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.240 
this is five hundred but I thought I
would<00:01:04.860> try<00:01:05.010> it

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
would try it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.609 
would try it
and<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.700> thought<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.119> would<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.450> even<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.110> little

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and I thought I would get even a little

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.830 
and I thought I would get even a little
bit<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.040> result<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.580> would<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.820> happy<00:01:09.150> because

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
bit of a result I would be happy because

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.740 
bit of a result I would be happy because
I<00:01:10.080> don't<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.560> feel<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.400> need<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:12.540> get

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I don't really feel like I need to get

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.380 
I don't really feel like I need to get
major<00:01:12.990> Fraxel<00:01:13.650> because<00:01:14.580> that's<00:01:14.760> downtime

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
major Fraxel because that's downtime

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.550 
major Fraxel because that's downtime

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
depending on on what you do it may not

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
be there are some pretzel I'm not a real

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.210 
be there are some pretzel I'm not a real
expert<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.920> there's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
expert on it but I know that there's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.560 
expert on it but I know that there's
some<00:01:23.460> procedures<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.119> don't<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.420> any

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
some procedures that don't have any

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.289 
some procedures that don't have any
downtime<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.229> others<00:01:25.939> that<00:01:26.939> are<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.119> little

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
downtime and others that are a little

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.179 
downtime and others that are a little
bit<00:01:27.509> deeper<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:28.049> do<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> have

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
bit deeper that do have it so you have

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.850 
bit deeper that do have it so you have
to<00:01:29.220> look<00:01:29.400> into<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.680> didn't<00:01:31.680> have

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
to look into that but I didn't have

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.710 
to look into that but I didn't have
really<00:01:32.130> bad<00:01:32.579> wrinkles<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.150> anything<00:01:33.180> around

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
really bad wrinkles or anything around

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.330 
really bad wrinkles or anything around
here<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.920> fine<00:01:35.130> lines

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
here just for really really fine lines

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.770 
here just for really really fine lines
you<00:01:35.400> can't<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.180> them<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> thought<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you can't really see them so I thought I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.010 
you can't really see them so I thought I
would<00:01:37.020> try<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.689> what<00:01:39.900> it's

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
would try this and that is what it's

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.810 
would try this and that is what it's
supposed<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.740> supposed<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.460> get<00:01:41.610> rid

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
supposed to do it's supposed to get rid

supposed to do it's supposed to get rid
of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> fine<00:01:42.450> lines<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.259> wrinkles<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.729> if

think you're supposed to do it every day
every<00:01:59.460> other<00:01:59.490> day<00:01:59.729> I'm<00:02:00.390> not<00:02:00.719> sure<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
every other day I'm not sure for the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.730 
every other day I'm not sure for the
first<00:02:01.259> month<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.860> sporadically

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
first month I do it sporadically

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.340 
first month I do it sporadically
so<00:02:03.310> follow<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.090> directions<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.630> maybe<00:02:04.990> you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
so follow the directions and maybe you

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.590 
so follow the directions and maybe you
will<00:02:05.470> get<00:02:05.650> those<00:02:05.860> results<00:02:06.070> I'm<00:02:06.340> not<00:02:06.520> sure<00:02:06.700> but

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
will get those results I'm not sure but

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.960 
will get those results I'm not sure but
again<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.470> results<00:02:08.890> are<00:02:09.069> very<00:02:09.100> very<00:02:09.580> subtle

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
again the results are very very subtle

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.480 
again the results are very very subtle
and<00:02:10.119> I<00:02:10.179> do<00:02:10.240> feel<00:02:10.750> like<00:02:10.810> it's<00:02:11.230> helping<00:02:11.680> my<00:02:12.040> skin

a<00:03:52.580> little<00:03:52.910> bit<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.210> an<00:03:53.330> improvement<00:03:53.920> again

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
a little bit of an improvement again

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.530 
a little bit of an improvement again
it's<00:03:55.070> one<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.280> those<00:03:55.430> things<00:03:55.730> very<00:03:56.270> very

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
it's one of those things very very

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.410 
it's one of those things very very
subtle<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.040> didn't<00:03:58.310> really<00:03:58.550> notice<00:03:58.730> many

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
subtle and I didn't really notice many

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.840 
subtle and I didn't really notice many
lines<00:03:59.750> here<00:04:00.020> to<00:04:00.590> begin<00:04:00.740> with<00:04:01.070> so<00:04:01.280> I<00:04:01.310> didn't

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
lines here to begin with so I didn't

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.740 
lines here to begin with so I didn't
really<00:04:01.970> noticed<00:04:02.270> they're<00:04:02.390> gone<00:04:02.540> because

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
really noticed they're gone because

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.670 
really noticed they're gone because
anything<00:04:03.080> they<00:04:03.170> weren't<00:04:03.290> really<00:04:03.380> there<00:04:03.590> to

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
anything they weren't really there to

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.890 
anything they weren't really there to
begin<00:04:03.800> with<00:04:04.100> but<00:04:04.580> I<00:04:04.700> do<00:04:04.760> feel<00:04:05.360> like<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:05.780> will

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
begin with but I do feel like it will

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.550 
begin with but I do feel like it will
help<00:04:06.200> prevent<00:04:06.470> lines<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.340> future<00:04:08.230> so<00:04:09.230> I

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
help prevent lines in the future so I

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.640 
help prevent lines in the future so I
know<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.520> is<00:04:10.670> a<00:04:10.700> lot<00:04:10.910> of<00:04:11.000> money<00:04:11.530> but<00:04:12.530> if

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
know this is a lot of money but if

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.260

you're expecting again it's one of those

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.970 
you're expecting again it's one of those
things<00:04:14.480> if<00:04:14.660> you're<00:04:14.810> expecting<00:04:15.200> dramatic
