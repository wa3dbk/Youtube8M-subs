in<00:00:00.510> order<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:00.989> predict<00:00:01.560> your<00:00:01.979> menstrual<00:00:02.520> cycle

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
in order to predict your menstrual cycle

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.019 
in order to predict your menstrual cycle
the<00:00:04.020> best<00:00:04.230> way<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.410> do<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.799> is<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.580> on<00:00:05.970> a

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
the best way to do this is to on a

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.790 
the best way to do this is to on a
calendar<00:00:06.799> note<00:00:07.970> the<00:00:08.970> days<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.510> your<00:00:10.230> menstrual

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
calendar note the days of your menstrual

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.410 
calendar note the days of your menstrual
period<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.820> should<00:00:12.030> start<00:00:12.210> with<00:00:12.360> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
period and you should start with the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.959 
period and you should start with the
first<00:00:12.780> day<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.049> your<00:00:13.170> menstrual<00:00:13.710> period<00:00:14.160> so

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
first day of your menstrual period so

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.150 
first day of your menstrual period so
simply<00:00:15.540> write<00:00:16.260> down<00:00:16.640> on<00:00:17.690> that<00:00:18.690> date<00:00:19.010> the<00:00:20.010> day

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
simply write down on that date the day

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.000 
simply write down on that date the day
it<00:00:20.340> starts<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.000> continue<00:00:21.900> for<00:00:22.710> whatever

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
it starts and continue for whatever

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.740 
it starts and continue for whatever
number<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.430> days<00:00:23.550> your<00:00:24.000> menstrual<00:00:24.390> period

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
number of days your menstrual period

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.970 
number of days your menstrual period
lasts<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.500> then<00:00:27.230> when<00:00:28.230> your<00:00:28.439> next<00:00:28.680> period

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
lasts and then when your next period

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.049 
lasts and then when your next period
comes<00:00:29.460> again<00:00:30.590> continue<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.769> process<00:00:32.059> you

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
comes again continue that process you

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.760 
comes again continue that process you
should<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:33.809> several<00:00:33.989> months<00:00:34.350> over

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
should do this for several months over

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.240 
should do this for several months over
these<00:00:35.520> months<00:00:35.940> you'll<00:00:36.360> notice<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.380> pattern<00:00:37.829> or

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
these months you'll notice a pattern or

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.040 
these months you'll notice a pattern or
hopefully<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.850> will<00:00:38.969> notice<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.420> pattern<00:00:39.809> if

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
hopefully you will notice a pattern if

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.250 
hopefully you will notice a pattern if
you<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.309> simply<00:00:42.059> count<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.540> days<00:00:42.750> from

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
you do you simply count the days from

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.799 
you do you simply count the days from
the<00:00:43.379> first<00:00:43.410> day<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.219> period<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.270> next

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the first day of one period to the next

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.770 
the first day of one period to the next
and<00:00:45.899> that's<00:00:46.440> how<00:00:46.739> long<00:00:47.610> your<00:00:47.850> cycle<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and that's how long your cycle is and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.799 
and that's how long your cycle is and
that<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:50.100> generally<00:00:50.640> how<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.239> best<00:00:51.600> way<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
that was generally how the best way to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.729 
that was generally how the best way to
predict<00:00:52.230> your<00:00:52.410> cycle<00:00:53.899> remember<00:00:54.899> when<00:00:55.170> when

predict your cycle remember when when

predict your cycle remember when when
you're<00:00:55.920> younger<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:56.520> teens<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> 20s

you're younger in your teens and 20s
it's<00:00:57.750> normal<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.469> longer<00:00:58.940> cycles<00:00:59.940> in

it's normal to have longer cycles in
your<00:01:00.870> 30s<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.620> tend<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> little<00:01:02.550> bit

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
your 30s they tend to be a little bit

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.679 
your 30s they tend to be a little bit
shorter<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.860> once<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.010> reach<00:01:05.519> mid<00:01:05.820> 40s<00:01:06.299> and
