 for now selected on the subject 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.140
 they do an event in which you can 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.210

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.740
 here is a vehicle is the mercedes benz bayon 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.230
 steal man but I believe the province 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.760
 that is Bahia or even now that the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.829
 participate in an event in which 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.079
 you have a division of a thousand players or 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.820
 I'm competing with a thousand people and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.040
 I have no rating 500 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.629
 I earn 3,000 credits in 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.420
 an initial production of 50 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.460
 best tuning 25 best two have 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.379
 these if I get that first 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.280
 among a thousand people that the game put me 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.520
 like a thousand people 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.949
 I'm going to win the mercedes benz bayon esse 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.600
 event here is good, five 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.059
 gallons of gas that you use 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.559
 can check up there have the gallons 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.330
 scoring I have 10 there and I spend 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.240
 half to attend this event 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.100
 Look what a beautiful car to use 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.510
 mouse here to show around me 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.369
 I was very curious of the research in 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.950
 internet about him so his I saw that he is 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.509
 a concept car there mercedes it 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.070
 He said that in the future she believes 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.350
 vehicles will be like this car here 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.630
 from what I understand he is fed by 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.400
 solar energy and at the same time that it 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.000
 generates all my energy and townsville 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.810
 generates the electricity promoter of it 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.310
 also purifies the air a business of this 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.079
 style I did not get it right 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.090
 how it works but I know he means 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.220
 which purifies the air passes the air enters 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.290
 from the front comes out the air 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.659
 purified and it uses solar energy 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.119
 so the fucking car is a concept 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.189
 very interesting of mercedes benz 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.360
 Let's go to the race here like this. 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.009
 I told you he's going to spend half 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.380
 of the tanks that we have people going 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.240
 in the great wall is a race and already 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.950
 of the game but as I told you 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.110
 the game and in recent days has received a 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.520
 update windows 8 with the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.409
 neighborhood I intend to show you 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.840
 forward a specific video 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.539
 beauty or else you test that vehicle 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.700
 which is very beautiful look of him and has a 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.550
 detail that revolves on his wheels that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.650
 drew a lot of attention too 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.970
 The people talking to you are going to check it out. 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.650
 as I have already said in other videos that 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.690
 can not leave the songs that the game 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.160
 on because because of the issue of 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.540
 copyright is another game has the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.120
 very good songs look only that one 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.860
 detail on his wheels that is not there 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.450
 the wheel was giving some 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.430
 internet images as I told you 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.080
 I gave a survey on vehicles 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.040
 and was presented in 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.500
 2010 there in an event and this business he 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.820
 Is not the wheel just a business that goes 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.980
 spinning to give an effect I do not know if 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.510
 it has some functionality but also 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.880
 It's pretty much it 's a car that really 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.770
 make a very futuristic tone and it 's a car 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.200
 that even I told you guys that 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.690
 it is a concept these cars concepts not 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.300
 they are to sell even more than the guy 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.410
 you are very rich and you can not 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.300
 buy this type of vehicle yet 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.580
 I was also reading a vehicle with 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.790
 the concept of being an ultralight he already 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.530
 consumes less energy because it is 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.610
 much but very light as you 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.010
 search the internet you will find 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.020
 some photos of his house alone is a 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.390
 very simplified carcass and such 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.790
 then the vehicle goes very light 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.989
 beautiful, we hope that from now on 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.130
 ahead of us in a few years we 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.900
 be cars like this on the street, look, he's just 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.160
 speed is not so fast as long as 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.380
 other vehicles that we have to 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.050
 game but they are seeing it reaches that 300 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.730
 miles an hour will look only he 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.810
 is a rather weak cart as well 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.550
 I told you about being a car. 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.220
 ultralight and should use some 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.020
 materials a little more or less 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.360
 resistant and tals so it should be a 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.920
 car a little bit more fragile but he 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.500
 does not pass the feeling of being so fragile 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.940
 So but how are you talking to each other? 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.250
 We hope people see cars like this. 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.900
 more to feel on our streets in the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.390
 Brazil, it should take much longer 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.610
 out of here I know for a decade two that 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.260
 we have cars in this style but 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.120
 I hope you liked the video. 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.320
 If you liked it, you're not leaving your own. 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.360
 also ask to have no channel 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.160
 Sign up for my twitter is shouting at 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.420
 inscription on the 7th track there 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.130
 That's it, I'm going to stay here for a while. 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.130
 I hug everyone and until the next video I went
