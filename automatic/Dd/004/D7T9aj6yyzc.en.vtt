00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:11.870
 where he looked is a kind of 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.030
 since spiritual guidance is not a guardian 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.540
 protector of her remaining niece 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.950
 orphaned and is also an awareness 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.960
 also not on purpose to distinguish 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.669
 conveniently who is but who 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.149
 belong to a social class and who 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:31.640
 to another although the chief of staff and 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.760
 exercises a principle of authority over 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.920
 the rest of the employees but it's a 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.989
 type whose origin no reason to be is 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.440
 based on the data that I 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.809
 handling so far I will not have in a few 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.000
 some principles an observance of some 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.789
 game rules about how to 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.280
 behave both at work and in 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.170
 the life 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.230
 he's going to teach us he's going to teach us 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.670
 guard dog that is there and barking 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.260
 it's like a cavalry sergeant who 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.509
 has all the girls in the workshop more 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.610
 stiff than a rod in fact every time 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.619
 that appears white and strange white doña 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.090
 who comes doña blanca is putting order 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.369
 where it happens is pretty bad 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.600
 character even with poor Don Emilio 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.899
 that does not do more than be nice 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.210
 with me and try and throw me some 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.220
 ball to see if it humanized me a little 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.570
 but well, little by little, I think we're going 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.210
 to go getting what I'm 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.429
 glimpsing already in the chapters towards 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.690
 those who are facing 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.220
 confrontation we have had some 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.440
 dialectical scene if the differences do not 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.170
 only as far as work is concerned 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.340
 refers to the way of understanding the 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.340
 human relationships yes 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.799
 I could not tell you in the series of 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.659
 television and in movies or in the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.530
 theater that is what they have about 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.530
 products for what 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.920
 attract interest I think that in this 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.810
 case the 50s 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.030
 good the political situation in that country 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.380
 it was quite gray the truth but the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.020
 series is like no no no no talk about the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.660
 social political reality but good 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.739
 is a bit circumscribed to those 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.560
 galleries where there is a lot of glamor there 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.810
 some wonderful dresses collections 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.100
 I say that is to that style so 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.780
 feminine that of the 50 the sets are 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.670
 spectacular then all the aesthetics 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.950
 visually it really is very attractive and 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.600
 then it is a time when it is very 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.739
 close is true but well there is already a 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.110
 series of differences that also 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.569
 They are curious because there were no phones 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.430
 it's not people smoked inside the 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.959
 sites then see this kind of thing 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.310
 that already seem like the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.650
 prehistory and that however they were 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.780
 enough of yesterday were like this it turns out 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.090
 also very curious and there is an aspect I 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.610
 I also believe in the part of are not the 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.230
 that room like a back room 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.050
 as 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.970
 the subway where it could appear 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.730
 although it is not the intention or lack 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.640
 makes giving a testimonial series 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.330
 but that could appear that other Spain 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.400
 and more a little more hidden and more gray 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.340
 of course not in the part where the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.890
 they inhabit and a very important thing for 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.170
 I have been the way to face the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.060
 work from the direction the two 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.250
 guys who have so far directed the 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.620
 chapters that we have been doing so much 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.980
 David as Carlos, of course, I do not 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.530
 I expected him to be in that proposal 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.140
 to that way of working that is let's 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.680
 as in the most rigorous of the premieres 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.260
 theatrical works do not work in 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.670
 to shred clarify or correct about 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.459
 even on the fly 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.799
 I must point out particularly what 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.349
 formidable how nice it is to me 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.690
 resulting work is not resulting 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.950
 with the directors I think that the 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.940
 quality is very high in this case I 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.290
 I have the feeling of being doing 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.799
 cinema more than television 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.200
 because everything is very careful as I said 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.909
 to pepe starting with the address that 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.040
 obviously the most important thing is there is a 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.859
 care of the actor a time for the 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.000
 actor there is a lighting too very 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:18.519
 beautiful very beautiful 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.220
 there are always crossed cameras with a 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.540
 sign that you work with a field and 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.070
 against the field there is a care that 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.490
 comes more from the cinema no more than from the 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.470
 television and that is very much appreciated 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.169
 Well, I'm rehearsing and we're already premiering 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.449
 Tuesday at the circus price of madrid 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.990
 with André Lima, the director of 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.460
 animalario a fantastic madness that is 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.759
 fruit of a work of workshops of two 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.849
 years and has the title of capitalism 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.740
 make them laugh a theatrical experience and 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.169
 well eba is a theatrical experience are 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.430

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.080

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.289
 representation and it's a show 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.360
 global where we are 18 people in 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.449

 dancers choreographers anyway is I do not know

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.229
 that very attractive and that will not leave 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.389
