00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.279
 you also know that cooking pizza or 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.430
 the bread on the stone makes them 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.590
 definitely more good for this too 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.510
 most important restaurants use the 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.109
 stone plates to enhance the taste 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.060
 and the taste of stonerook food combines 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.640
 the fast heating of aluminum 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.070
 with the solid surface of piety that 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.500
 it stores heat and gradually it 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.289
 release food allowing you to 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.629
 cook at lower temperatures 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.079
 the food is cooked evenly without 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.360
 lose flavor stonerook unites the 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.520
 better than all the pots in one 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.430
 pan hard life like steel 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.739
 stainless with great conductivity 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.559
 of aluminum to the retention of 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.260
 heat of molten iron to the surface in 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.059
 stone resistant to the maximum you can 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.820
 even use a spoon a fork 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.129
 made of metal without scratching it 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.200
 hard surface of natural stone is 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.270
 made of small stone particles 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.030
 on the aluminum base that leads the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.430
 heat so we have a pan that 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.770
 preserves the heat and gradually it 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.290
 releases into the meat allowing you to 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.600
 cook even at low temperatures 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.670
 your food will drink evenly 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.650
 and all the flavor will remain inside 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.530
 so you will have the taste of cooking 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.140
 traditional on stone is ten times more 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.119
 resistant and lasts ten times more 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.700
 long of normal coatings 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.549
 non-stick so it does not burn 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.920
 it fades and you can't scales 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.320
 healthy cooking without oil or 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.689
 other fats so you can lose weight 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.630
 eating tasty foods and you can 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.700
 fight cholesterol and triglycerides 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.710
 with normal pans sauces nature and 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.740
 Some food comes out when it is cooked 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.680
 and remain on the surface with stonerook 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.840
 the food cooks externally maintaining it 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.150
 its sauces inside so the meat 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.729
 the fish will be more tender juicy 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.399
 full of flavor the vegetables will be more 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.500
 crunchy and cooked to perfection 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.270
 you can do even in a very short time 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.350
 risotto without standing there turning it 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.539
 continuously 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.000
 but you can even make pasta in 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.250
 this same way you see we have put 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.560
 of tomato with onion a little 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.690
 water and then we added 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.270
 directly the pasta without having to 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.030
 cook and drain the pasta first 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.520
 directly it cooks in its non gravy 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.470
 you have to turn it and mix it in little 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.890
 time is ready to be eaten with 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.580
 all its original flavor shell is 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.390
 a reliable and safe Italian product 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.390
 resistant
