00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:54.499 

let's<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:51.890> if<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.460> only<00:01:53.729> was<00:01:54.030> able<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.390> hook

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
let's see if I only was able to hook

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.230 
let's see if I only was able to hook
this<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> cable

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:09.279 

14<00:02:00.170> 14<00:02:00.380> 14<00:02:00.860> 13<00:02:01.189> 3213<00:02:01.759> oh<00:02:07.450> well<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:09.140> get<00:02:09.259> the

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
14 14 14 13 3213 oh well you get the

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.300 
14 14 14 13 3213 oh well you get the
idea<00:02:12.160> now<00:02:13.160> if<00:02:13.489> I<00:02:13.610> try<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.910> add<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:15.709> time<00:02:16.010> to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
idea now if I try to add the time to

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.509 
idea now if I try to add the time to
each<00:02:16.459> one<00:02:16.790> at<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.360> same<00:02:17.569> time<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:18.280> want<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.370> know

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
each one at the same time I want to know

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.410 
each one at the same time I want to know
if<00:02:19.910> they'll<00:02:20.540> be<00:02:20.690> able<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.900> handle<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:22.420> because

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
if they'll be able to handle it because

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.120 
if they'll be able to handle it because
i<00:02:23.599> have<00:02:23.750> an<00:02:23.840> hour<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.319> minute<00:02:24.560> button<00:02:24.830> on<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
i have an hour and minute button on the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:33.000 
i have an hour and minute button on the
remote<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.989> is<00:02:27.170> currently<00:02:27.880> 108<00:02:28.880> p.m.<00:02:29.890> so

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.840 

look<00:02:34.010> at<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:35.890> definitely<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.040> first<00:02:37.370> top<00:02:37.670> one

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
look at the definitely the first top one

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.190 
look at the definitely the first top one
is<00:02:37.940> faster<00:02:38.360> it's<00:02:38.480> already<00:02:38.690> on<00:02:38.750> two<00:02:38.900> o'clock

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
is faster it's already on two o'clock

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.940 
is faster it's already on two o'clock
the<00:02:39.920> middle<00:02:40.160> one<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.549> on<00:02:40.850> one<00:02:41.720> o'clock<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.319> the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
the middle one is on one o'clock and the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.259 
the middle one is on one o'clock and the
bottom<00:02:43.220> one<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.670> also<00:02:44.209> on<00:02:44.390> one<00:02:44.540> o'clock<00:02:44.810> and

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
bottom one is also on one o'clock and

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:54.050 
bottom one is also on one o'clock and
let's<00:02:47.269> just<00:02:47.360> do<00:02:47.810> minutes<00:02:48.200> for<00:02:48.380> kicks

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.470 

now<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.780> top<00:02:55.500> one<00:02:55.770> is<00:02:55.980> slower<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.849> bottom

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
now the top one is slower and the bottom

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.520 
now the top one is slower and the bottom
two<00:02:57.780> are<00:02:58.080> faster

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:22.470 

now<00:03:07.530> they're<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.770> different<00:03:07.980> times<00:03:08.400> but

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.080 

I<00:03:25.560> can<00:03:26.560> almost<00:03:26.769> control<00:03:27.519> them<00:03:27.610> all<00:03:27.700> from<00:03:27.879> back

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
I can almost control them all from back

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.910 
I can almost control them all from back
here

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.980 

I<00:03:31.630> can<00:03:34.150> there<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.239> have<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.450> stacked<00:03:36.410> lyceum
