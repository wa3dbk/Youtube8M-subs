hey guys spider here and I've got a

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.560 
hey guys spider here and I've got a
quick<00:00:02.370> tip<00:00:02.520> for<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.790> for<00:00:03.030> modern<00:00:03.270> warfare<00:00:03.419> 3

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
quick tip for you for modern warfare 3

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.570 
quick tip for you for modern warfare 3
using<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.650> killfeed<00:00:05.040> actually<00:00:05.490> in

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
using the killfeed actually in

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.849 
using the killfeed actually in
combination<00:00:06.299> with<00:00:06.330> using<00:00:07.080> your<00:00:07.290> mini-map<00:00:07.649> in

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
combination with using your mini-map in

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.740 
combination with using your mini-map in
order<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.189> identify<00:00:08.309> or<00:00:09.300> get<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> close

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
order to identify or get a close

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.650 
order to identify or get a close
approximation<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.710> enemy<00:00:11.070> positions<00:00:11.700> really

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
approximation of enemy positions really

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.570 
approximation of enemy positions really
most<00:00:12.840> effective<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.679> objective<00:00:14.099> game<00:00:14.309> types

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
most effective and objective game types

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.960 
most effective and objective game types
but<00:00:14.820> also<00:00:15.000> effective<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.780> other<00:00:16.680> team<00:00:17.369> game

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
but also effective in other team game

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.140 
but also effective in other team game
modes<00:00:18.539> such<00:00:19.140> as<00:00:19.199> team<00:00:19.560> deathmatch<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.789> all

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
modes such as team deathmatch so all

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.480 
modes such as team deathmatch so all
we're<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.470> watch<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.310> kill

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
we're going to do is is watch the kill

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.480 
we're going to do is is watch the kill
feed<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.330> pretty<00:00:24.660> quick<00:00:25.070> you<00:00:26.070> really

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
feed and it's pretty quick you really

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.830 
feed and it's pretty quick you really
really<00:00:26.640> have<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.090> paying<00:00:27.300> attention<00:00:27.449> from

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
really have to be paying attention from

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.439 
really have to be paying attention from
the<00:00:28.140> time<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:29.279> pops<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> kill<00:00:30.119> feed<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
the time it pops up in the kill feed and

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.870 
the time it pops up in the kill feed and
they're<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.869> started<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:31.920> about<00:00:32.399> less

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
they're just started you have about less

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.170 
they're just started you have about less
than<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.180> second<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> half<00:00:33.829> to<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.520> look<00:00:36.000> at

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
than a second and a half to then look at

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.970 
than a second and a half to then look at
your<00:00:36.390> mini-map<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.960> watch<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.290> mini<00:00:37.469> map<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
your mini-map and watch the mini map and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.819 
your mini-map and watch the mini map and
see<00:00:38.219> our<00:00:38.250> our<00:00:38.610> our<00:00:38.820> player<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.719> there<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.170> know

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
see our our our player up there I know

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.490 
see our our our player up there I know
there<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.280> them<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.670> our<00:00:41.879> teammate<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.290> top

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
there to them so our teammate to the top

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.040 
there to them so our teammate to the top
left<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.950> us<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.760> got<00:00:44.940> taken<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.719> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
left of us just got taken out and you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
left of us just got taken out and you
got<00:00:46.170> taken<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> silenced<00:00:47.100> weapon<00:00:47.219> we

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
got taken out with a silenced weapon we

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.400 
got taken out with a silenced weapon we
know<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.239> guys<00:00:48.780> sitting<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:49.260> it's

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
know that guys sitting up there it's

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.709 
know that guys sitting up there it's
actually<00:00:49.770> an<00:00:49.829> SMG<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.059> guys<00:00:51.449> up

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
actually an SMG we know that guys up

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.450 
actually an SMG we know that guys up
there<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.469> definitely<00:00:52.800> know<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:52.920> guys<00:00:53.250> up

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
there so we definitely know that guys up

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.400 
there so we definitely know that guys up
there<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:53.940> then<00:00:54.300> he<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> he<00:00:54.899> ends<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.230> having

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
there but then he and he ends up having

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.959 
there but then he and he ends up having
a<00:00:55.590> teammate<00:00:55.949> down<00:00:56.100> below<00:00:56.370> who<00:00:56.520> takes<00:00:56.730> me<00:00:56.879> out

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
a teammate down below who takes me out

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.310 
a teammate down below who takes me out
but<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.180> could<00:00:57.329> actually<00:00:57.480> hear<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.020> guy<00:00:58.170> up

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
but I could actually hear that guy up

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.439 
but I could actually hear that guy up
top<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:59.100> really<00:00:59.609> really<00:00:59.910> helps<00:01:00.300> identify

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
top that really really helps identify

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.830 
top that really really helps identify
any<00:01:01.109> enemy<00:01:01.770> positions<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:03.210> gives<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> good

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
any enemy positions and gives you a good

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
any enemy positions and gives you a good
approximation<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.890> where<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.189> expect<00:01:05.880> them<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
approximation of where to expect them to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.719 
approximation of where to expect them to
come<00:01:06.420> from<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:08.100> all<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> time<00:01:08.340> in

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
come from I do that all the time in

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.910 
come from I do that all the time in
search<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.240> search<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> destroy<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.229> always

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
search in search of destroy I always

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.060 
search in search of destroy I always
always<00:01:11.659> like<00:01:12.659> ninety<00:01:13.409> percent<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> time

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
always like ninety percent of the time

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.730 
always like ninety percent of the time
if<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.729> see<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.600> killfeed<00:01:16.020> pop<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.530> I'm

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
if I see the killfeed pop up I'm

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.830 
if I see the killfeed pop up I'm
immediately<00:01:17.280> looking<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> mini<00:01:18.420> map<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
immediately looking to the mini map to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.600 
immediately looking to the mini map to
see<00:01:19.020> where<00:01:19.049> my<00:01:19.409> teammate<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.040> got<00:01:20.189> taken<00:01:20.369> out

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
see where my teammate just got taken out

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.670 
see where my teammate just got taken out
from<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> gives<00:01:21.810> me<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> pretty<00:01:22.320> good

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
from because it gives me a pretty good

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.920 
from because it gives me a pretty good
approximation<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:23.820> where<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.360> enemy<00:01:24.659> player

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
approximation of where that enemy player

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.819 
approximation of where that enemy player
is<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.700> potentially<00:01:27.650> anticipate<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
is and I can potentially anticipate the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.469 
is and I can potentially anticipate the
rowdies<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> take<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.790> order<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.060> get<00:01:30.329> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
rowdies going to take in order to get to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.440 
rowdies going to take in order to get to
where<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> am<00:01:31.159> even<00:01:32.159> well<00:01:32.610> particularly<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.329> I'm

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
where I am even well particularly if I'm

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.230 
where I am even well particularly if I'm
defending<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.960> bomb<00:01:34.350> location<00:01:34.979> or

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
defending a bomb location or

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.420 
defending a bomb location or
headquarters<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.479> whatever<00:01:37.100> whatever<00:01:38.100> game

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
headquarters or whatever whatever game

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.039 
headquarters or whatever whatever game
mode<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.759> might<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.000> playing<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.570> anyways

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
mode you might be playing so anyways

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.590 
mode you might be playing so anyways
that's<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.829> quick<00:01:40.950> tip<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
that's just a quick tip that's the the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.899 
that's just a quick tip that's the the
first<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> hope<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.280> maybe<00:01:44.820> a
