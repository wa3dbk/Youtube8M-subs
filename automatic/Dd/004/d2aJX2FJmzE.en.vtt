00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
ring rust off and that's what I'm giving

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.210 
ring rust off and that's what I'm giving
him<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:11.689> pass<00:01:11.930> on<00:01:11.960> this<00:01:12.200> fight<00:01:12.560> like<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:12.770> mean

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
him a pass on this fight like that mean

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.520 
him a pass on this fight like that mean
I<00:01:13.340> don't<00:01:13.729> really<00:01:13.760> give<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.299> crap<00:01:14.330> if<00:01:14.810> he<00:01:15.320> fights
