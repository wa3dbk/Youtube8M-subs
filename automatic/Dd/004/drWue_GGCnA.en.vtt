00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.450
 you are welcome 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.450
 stealing in this pinch cake 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:18.189
 leaving 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:22.540
 at the next meeting with the media and 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:26.590
 barinas 550 grams of flour 4 but not 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.640
 kill me where we would look to put salt 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.599
 the amount of salt that I'm going to put 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.599
 quite 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.550
 teaspoons of salt and have a thing the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.890
 success of this recipe for me lies in 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.350
 this in contrast in this course 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.970
 Sauteed dough with sweet cobra 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.530
 from the outside that has honey that has 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.530
 sugar and that has cinnamon 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.790
 of the heras who does not know what the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.500
 kinship of the mass of the pancakes 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.269
 black we make homemade that is not the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.030
 same song from the bakery but for 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.130
 there they do it with straight bread dough 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.770
 it is totally but it is similar 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.410
 I think white is 80 centimeters 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.390
 water cubes calabrese and a sachet 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.700
 10 grams of dry yeast 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 because I find it practical I say 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.630
 I do not see forever because it takes a lot to 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.620
 beat everything I always have at home but 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.530
 if you want to do it with fresh yeast 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.360
 you do it with a packet of yeast 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.400
 fresh or 40 grams a little less 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.880
 so we work it quickly very well 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.470
 a done then water yeast for 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.119
 make this cake for the honey that the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.640
 you have to make the sad try because 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.770
 It is delicious has a little sugar 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.830
 the mass but not too much have the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.789
 50 grams of sugar in here same 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.940
 Sugar burns milk 250 centimeters 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.720

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.440

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.440
 he could not prove it 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.120
