00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.990
 please tell me how you managed 6 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.990
 hours to spend on the stage where you take 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.049
 strength and so much energy but i'm honest 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.260
 saying did not notice that six hours had passed 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.060
 I don't know I have it inside I don't 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.490
 I know I take nothing questions use 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.740
 h3 have and honestly question 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.109
 unexpected i don't know what 3 more hours 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.599
 held on the stage of saint petersburg by 12 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.079
 so here so warm up let's say before 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.870
 Peter and what you general impressions about 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.300
 This tournament organization is very 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.100
 nice but i see that the organizers were 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.070
 not ready for the influx of such a big 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.410
 the number of athletes above all to me 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.300
 didn't like what we didn't have 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.629
 enough number of judges and all 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.399
 action was taken by people who 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.829
 were coaches athletes that 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.989
 principle prohibited by the rules and their baby 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.370
 the coach cannot judge the athletes 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.739
 because he is free not willing or 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.570
 unwittingly your athletes are better as 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.510
 his child his child he is smarter than 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.310
 others it's ok but here but to 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.570
 sorry for me it seemed to me 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.200
 my personal opinion is subjective that part 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.850
 participants in particular are not participants to me 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.900
 performed well because all the action 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.869
 were their coaches 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.210
 and more to plant was anyone and for this 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.140
 reason with good organization when 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.610
 enough participants 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.900
 refereeing in my opinion they were not very 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.670
 objective this is what i have 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.040
 seemed like a leading person 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.560
 which the 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.870
 You see it from the side and how are you 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.750
 consider increased the level of athletes I 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.240
 here the last time was 20 years ago for 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.550
 20 years the level of athletes is not something that 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 rose new nominations people 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.760
 who then performed now 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.460
 fat respected manage federations 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.400
 and are very far from here of course 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.530
 the level of athletes is almost the same 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.510
 like championships and cups 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.979
 st petersburg because here 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.940
 close to st. petersburg main 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.250
 number of participants from 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.470
 st petersburg and i was weird 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.720
 see those leading in 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.450
 St. Petersburg the meaning of the arrival of the courts is not 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.150
 It was not clear the first numbers because 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.830
 they brought down the bar a little by their arrival 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.140
 a little bit by let the rest 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.000
 participants it is clear that they will win money 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.250
 here for the place do not pay it was a question 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.860
 just ambitions but do people have such 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.660
 ambitions to travel to dovmont 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.010
 cup in order to once again prove 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.320
 that they are the best in Russia 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.959
 This one was so strange to me. 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.610
 saying that my feelings in general of course 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.120
 everything is great more hit new 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.739
 Absolutely complex hall space I 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.630
 thankful to people Nikolai Ivanovich before 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.190
 total who is the owner 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.340
 who provided this room under 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.650
 sporting events struck me and 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.390
 sound quality level quality 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.709
 lighting was maybe not very 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.940
 because they were not ready for 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.680
 general and respect the reception of participants and 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.170
 general pace of the competition was 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.510
 very very very good at 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.580
 St. Petersburg at least and what 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.280
 tournament expectations 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.620
 St. Petersburg and after a week of waiting 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.950
 tough enough why because our 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.110
 a tournament is always a tournament which 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.820
 can equate not so much to the championship 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.150
 Russia for the championship of Europe or the world 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.920
 because in these tournaments take 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.019
 participation of the athletes who enter 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.620
 Russian team are champions 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.110
 Europe champions of the world and for judges very 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.850
 often a great test to stand them 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.620
 right in places bother me not 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.560
 the level of training of the participants me 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.700
 worried about the level of refereeing because 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.440
 not all people are ready to distinguish athletes 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.890
 Pro is the first from the one who became 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.030
 the second especially if the first is his 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.040
 athlete and here if this situation 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.340
 will be repeated in Petersburg it will not 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.610
 quite correct and one more question how 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.160
 do you think every athlete can 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.099
 What qualities do you need to become a coach? 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.349
 to train other people already 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.250
 every athlete can become a coach and 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.410
 this is not due to the fact that the athlete is stupid 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.730
 or not ready but unfortunately not 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.519
 every athlete and sports 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.530
 education not every athlete knows with 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.290
 what muscles does it consist which processes 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.750
 are held in the body due to what can 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.560
 exercise is bad and useful 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.510
 for the body 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.340
 even including some nutritional supplements 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.410
 or God forbid pharmacology which 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.979
 many athletes are not used every 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.600
 knows this 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.790
 in order to find out it is necessary 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.160
 further study and people who 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.630
 don't have education today they are like 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.280
 the rule is not very good 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.070
 instructors even if they occupy 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.510
 high places and become winners 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.350
 different tournaments they know how 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.690
 train yourself 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.250
 but each person is individual each 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.650
 man is unique and in order to 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.660
 train everyone needs to think wider they 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.940
 categories own body categories 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.620
 sport in general and for that you need to be 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.270
 an educated person therefore not everyone 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.310
 athlete can unfortunately become 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.820
 good example thank you very much 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.820
