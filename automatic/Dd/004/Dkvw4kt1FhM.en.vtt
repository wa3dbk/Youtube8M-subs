00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.400
 Hiya how they are because this time is 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.580
 continues to be a video on how to teach 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.010
 our dogs to sit 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.720
 and then let's start we 're going to need 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.660
 some things to begin with 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.220
 we need a dog 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.220
 here is how he is like my dog 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.200
 who claimed to be prizes 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.780
 this 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.780
 and if you can get a clicker 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.090
 We are cheap and they serve a lot so that 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.530
 serve the clicker 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.530
 when our dog 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.040
 and take the action that we 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.040
 we want to click 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.030
 and that's going to teach our dog 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.810
 he did something right right away we give him a 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.460
 prize 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.250
 If you can not buy a clicker, you can not 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.220
 worry we can use our voice 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.310
 yes our voice some word in this 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.760
 case also job series or can use if 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.300
 the word that you like what 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.300
 Well let's start 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.650
 what you can start to cobo and know 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.670
 concentrate but I'll show you how 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.570
 is that he learned 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.490
 ok we are getting a bit of 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.759
 our awards in hand 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.380
 what are we going to do we are going to put our hands 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.640
 above the head of the dog of such 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.290
 way that we make 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.760
 it feels I 'm going to show you how 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.440
 most of the but they do 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.320
 instinctively put your butt in the 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.580
 ground when we make this move 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.580
 but there it is 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.370
 as soon as the dog puts his butt in 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.890
 the ground we are going to give a click or 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.200
 let's say the word if today that alone 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.740
 word that you to well chosen 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.890
 it always has to be the same word 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.890
 that does go with clicker 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.370
 they saw me 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.990
 so that our dog comes back to the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.140
 starting position we handle a prize 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.140
 next I'll put this and other 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.790
 they saw it is very easy most of the 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.790
 people instinctively 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.209
 to how small the very fast 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.800
 ok next step after our 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.200
 dog I've been doing repeated 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.760
 sometimes what we just did what I've 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.730
 done well 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.740
 our hand without prizes and nothing the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.040
 We put up the dog house 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.220
 and we do at the moment and we regret a 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.920
 controversial 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.300
 but we will not have anything in our hands 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.300
 our hand will be empty 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.000
 Y 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.510
 there is this is so that we do not always 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.209
 we have to put a prize in the hand 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.370
 and only the dog at the moment 13 without 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.180
 nothing 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.180
 and 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.709
 for this 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.080
 they lived 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.130
 if they see that the dog is jumping like 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.800
 he does it like 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.040
 a hand closer to his head 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.040
 dog 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.410
 A) Yes 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.980
 do not worry if I do not know if they have 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.060
 problems with that 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.360
 ah 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.650
 try to put the dog in front of 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.880
 a wall like here for example this 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.470
 piece of furniture 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.780
 in this way the dog is not going to do 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.980
 back and it will not be another 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.980
 option rather than sit 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.470
 since the dog is doing this without 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.470
 sit without our prize the hand 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:36.569
 we can make it less obvious 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:39.820
 the signal and so we can be a little bit 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:42.310
 less obvious each time 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.830
 good would be with time 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.220
 so after we go we add a 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.220
 word 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.800
 add the word as we add the 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.379
 word 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.319
 before anything I will say the 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:00.460
 word in this case yes and after the 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:04.030
 moment 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:09.060
 explained we say the word like this before 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:13.340
 move if after the hand 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.340
 and we recommend the dog 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.870
 we'll see 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.999
 there is 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.880
 yes 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:34.270
 and there it is 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.280
 and as I say later we are doing 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.300
 the less obvious signal less obvious less 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:45.900
 obvious until the dog can sit 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.900
 by itself without the need of a hand 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.570
 football 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.150
 and then it is all some doubt some 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.520
 comment leave below here below the 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.380
 video please I hope you like the 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.740
 videos if you like them so let's see 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:08.530
 more so that the dog is thrown so that 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:11.540
 I turned them to be the muertito 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.180
 etc. as 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.770
 spain 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:20.030
 today I hope you like the video comment 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.490
 from the little hand up 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:27.370
 I know there are other videos on my channel 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.370

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.070
 and thanks
