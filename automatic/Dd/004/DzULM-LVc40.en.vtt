the function of plie first plie position

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.800 
the function of plie first plie position
I<00:00:23.440> will<00:00:24.070> take<00:00:24.460> from<00:00:24.910> point<00:00:25.240> number<00:00:25.630> one<00:00:26.760> is

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
I will take from point number one is

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.540 
I will take from point number one is
here<00:00:28.810> this<00:00:29.020> is<00:00:29.080> a<00:00:29.410> demi<00:00:29.859> plie<00:00:30.130> a<00:00:30.550> half<00:00:31.090> clear

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
here this is a demi plie a half clear

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.490 
here this is a demi plie a half clear
the<00:00:33.550> function<00:00:34.149> of<00:00:34.410> plie<00:00:35.410> is<00:00:36.840> very<00:00:37.840> very

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
the function of plie is very very

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.770 
the function of plie is very very
important<00:00:39.309> imperative<00:00:40.090> in<00:00:40.239> fact<00:00:40.480> that<00:00:40.660> you

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
important imperative in fact that you

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.959 
important imperative in fact that you
get<00:00:40.930> it<00:00:41.079> correct<00:00:41.469> because<00:00:41.950> it's<00:00:42.640> something

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
get it correct because it's something

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.830 
get it correct because it's something
that<00:00:43.630> is<00:00:43.780> integrated<00:00:44.440> basically<00:00:45.370> in<00:00:46.120> every

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
that is integrated basically in every

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:56.279 
that is integrated basically in every
step<00:00:47.200> we<00:00:47.530> do<00:00:47.800> i<00:00:50.489> from<00:00:51.489> plie<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:53.170> releve<00:00:53.800> plie<00:00:55.289> to

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
step we do i from plie to releve plie to

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:04.429 
step we do i from plie to releve plie to
one<00:00:56.649> leg<00:00:57.329> plie<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:59.350> peel<00:00:59.710> it<00:01:00.360> plie<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:02.410> jump<00:01:02.739> I

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:33.099 
for the visualization so there is a

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:37.379 
for the visualization so there is a
cutting<00:01:33.639> here<00:01:34.209> a<00:01:34.529> cutting<00:01:35.529> here<00:01:36.189> a<00:01:36.520> cutting

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
I shouldn't say snap here or fold here

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.800 
I shouldn't say snap here or fold here
yeah<00:01:47.169> because<00:01:47.679> the<00:01:48.219> muscle<00:01:48.700> tone<00:01:49.179> and<00:01:49.569> the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
yeah because the muscle tone and the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.099 
yeah because the muscle tone and the
tonality<00:01:50.169> of<00:01:50.499> the<00:01:50.649> muscles<00:01:51.219> will<00:01:52.149> react<00:01:52.659> or

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
tonality of the muscles will react or

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.769 
tonality of the muscles will react or
the<00:01:53.439> student<00:01:53.889> will<00:01:54.130> react<00:01:54.549> or<00:01:54.789> you<00:01:55.060> may<00:01:55.329> react

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:55.779 
the student will react or you may react

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:57.790 
the student will react or you may react
to<00:01:56.739> my<00:01:56.919> turn<00:01:57.189> allottee

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
to my turn allottee

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.510 
to my turn allottee
and<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.280> words<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.760> use<00:01:59.120> it<00:01:59.360> when<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.380> say<00:02:00.650> Bend<00:02:01.160> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
and the words I use it when I say Bend I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.490 
and the words I use it when I say Bend I
mean<00:02:01.720> softly<00:02:03.520> break<00:02:04.520> just<00:02:05.000> be<00:02:05.150> aware<00:02:05.480> of<00:02:05.540> these

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
mean softly break just be aware of these

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.910 
mean softly break just be aware of these
six<00:02:06.920> points<00:02:08.260> okay<00:02:09.290> a<00:02:11.500> general<00:02:12.500> rule<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.740> thumb

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
six points okay a general rule of thumb

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.150 
six points okay a general rule of thumb
again<00:02:13.660> it's<00:02:14.660> mentioned<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.290> lot<00:02:15.530> but<00:02:15.860> it's<00:02:15.980> very

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
again it's mentioned a lot but it's very

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.640 
again it's mentioned a lot but it's very
important<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.210> medium<00:02:17.840> gluteal<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
important is the medium gluteal and the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.390 
important is the medium gluteal and the
minimum<00:02:19.180> these<00:02:20.180> two<00:02:20.540> if<00:02:21.170> one<00:02:21.650> tries<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.250> out

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
minimum these two if one tries it out

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.690 
minimum these two if one tries it out
now<00:02:22.670> if<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.000> can<00:02:23.210> just<00:02:23.240> engage<00:02:24.100> your<00:02:25.100> gluteal

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
now if you can just engage your gluteal

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.230 
now if you can just engage your gluteal
muscles<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.450> foreign<00:02:27.250> all<00:02:28.250> together<00:02:28.730> two<00:02:29.060> on

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
muscles the foreign all together two on

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.660 
muscles the foreign all together two on
each<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:29.570> if<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.870> can<00:02:30.080> hold<00:02:30.380> those<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.190> then

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
each so if you can hold those and then

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.060 
each so if you can hold those and then
actually<00:02:32.210> release<00:02:33.400> your<00:02:34.400> ankles<00:02:35.890> what<00:02:36.890> you're

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
actually release your ankles what you're

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.820 
actually release your ankles what you're
receiving<00:02:37.490> now<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.360> actually<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.830> anatomical

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
receiving now is actually the anatomical

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.480 
receiving now is actually the anatomical
correct<00:02:40.340> function<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:42.350> plie<00:02:42.650> which<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.220> bow

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
correct function of a plie which is bow

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.140 
correct function of a plie which is bow
on<00:02:44.020> it's<00:02:45.020> not<00:02:45.260> just<00:02:45.680> an<00:02:46.010> aesthetic<00:02:46.340> position

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
on it's not just an aesthetic position

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.570 
on it's not just an aesthetic position
is<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.690> has<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.900> function<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:49.220> be<00:02:49.370> very

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
is that it has a function so be very

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.110 
is that it has a function so be very
careful<00:02:49.940> not<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.420> go<00:02:50.750> from<00:02:51.500> one<00:02:51.740> position<00:02:52.120> to

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
careful not to go from one position to

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.010 
careful not to go from one position to
the<00:02:53.150> next<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.560> actually<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.300> middle

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
the next it's actually it's the middle

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.160 
the next it's actually it's the middle
part<00:02:57.350> that's<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.460> worth<00:02:58.720> going<00:02:59.720> from<00:02:59.930> one

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
part that's the worth going from one

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.270 
part that's the worth going from one
place<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.920> neck

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
place to the neck

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.170 
place to the neck
it's<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:02.750> part<00:03:03.739> that's<00:03:04.340> important

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
it's that part that's important

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.620 
it's that part that's important
obviously<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.110> aesthetic<00:03:06.680> finish<00:03:06.890> is

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
obviously the aesthetic finish is

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.750 
obviously the aesthetic finish is
important<00:03:08.630> but<00:03:09.200> it's<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.590> function<00:03:10.520> that's

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
important but it's the function that's

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.690 
important but it's the function that's
important<00:03:11.390> that's<00:03:12.350> right<00:03:12.650> then<00:03:13.070> we<00:03:13.190> take<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
important that's right then we take the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.199 
important that's right then we take the
grand<00:03:14.090> plie<00:03:14.390> grand<00:03:14.989> plie<00:03:15.830> is<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:17.690> position

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
grand plie grand plie is this position

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.060 
grand plie grand plie is this position
now<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.570> couple<00:03:21.140> of<00:03:21.320> things<00:03:21.530> one<00:03:21.739> should<00:03:21.800> be

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
now a couple of things one should be

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.110 
now a couple of things one should be
careful<00:03:22.550> of<00:03:22.640> not<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.390> tuck<00:03:23.630> under<00:03:24.850> not<00:03:25.850> to

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
careful of not to tuck under not to

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.630 
careful of not to tuck under not to
stick<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.540> poper<00:03:26.989> out<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.739> not<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.280> stop

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
stick the poper out and not to stop

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.750 
stick the poper out and not to stop
halfway<00:03:29.380> now<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.410> will<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:31.010> will<00:03:31.070> explain<00:03:31.520> those

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
halfway now I will I will explain those

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.060 
halfway now I will I will explain those
in<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.060> little<00:03:32.209> bit<00:03:32.360> more<00:03:32.630> detail<00:03:33.140> I<00:03:33.380> will<00:03:33.890> take

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
in a little bit more detail I will take

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.560 
in a little bit more detail I will take
the<00:03:34.190> quasi<00:03:34.550> position<00:03:35.739> we<00:03:36.739> tend<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.250> not<00:03:38.209> all<00:03:38.390> of

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
the quasi position we tend to not all of

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.120 
the quasi position we tend to not all of
us<00:03:38.720> but<00:03:39.020> we<00:03:39.230> do<00:03:39.470> have<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:41.570> tendency<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.380> tuck

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
us but we do have the tendency to tuck

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.240 
us but we do have the tendency to tuck
under<00:03:43.450> because<00:03:44.450> one<00:03:44.870> receives<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.739> little<00:03:46.130> bit

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
under because one receives a little bit

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.729 
under because one receives a little bit
more<00:03:46.459> pull<00:03:46.820> but<00:03:47.510> actually<00:03:48.020> again<00:03:48.470> you're

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
more pull but actually again you're

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.280 
more pull but actually again you're
blocking<00:03:49.580> now<00:03:50.360> this<00:03:50.570> is<00:03:50.690> probably<00:03:50.900> going<00:03:51.200> to

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
blocking now this is probably going to

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.280 
blocking now this is probably going to
feel<00:03:51.440> strange<00:03:52.000> turn<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.209> in<00:03:53.390> now<00:03:53.510> just<00:03:54.019> stick

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
feel strange turn it in now just stick

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
to catch the arm your arms the rotation

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.680 
to catch the arm your arms the rotation
of<00:05:40.640> the<00:05:40.789> arm<00:05:40.970> and<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:43.330> connection<00:05:44.330> with<00:05:44.539> the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
of the arm and the connection with the

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.590 
of the arm and the connection with the
leg<00:05:44.930> is<00:05:45.169> very<00:05:45.410> important<00:05:46.160> for<00:05:46.820> a<00:05:46.880> number<00:05:47.570> of

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
leg is very important for a number of

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.050 
leg is very important for a number of
reasons<00:05:48.760> this<00:05:49.760> is<00:05:49.820> the<00:05:50.000> driving<00:05:50.510> force<00:05:52.060> yeah

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
reasons this is the driving force yeah

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.120 
reasons this is the driving force yeah
this<00:05:53.330> isn't<00:05:53.510> this<00:05:53.780> will<00:05:54.020> be<00:05:54.169> from<00:05:54.500> five<00:05:54.830> to

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
this isn't this will be from five to

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.659 
this isn't this will be from five to
seven<00:05:55.340> kilos<00:05:55.760> if<00:05:56.419> this<00:05:56.840> is<00:05:56.990> worked<00:05:57.229> properly

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
seven kilos if this is worked properly

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.520 
seven kilos if this is worked properly
in<00:05:58.669> the<00:05:59.330> classical<00:05:59.900> form<00:06:00.080> this<00:06:00.289> is<00:06:00.500> the

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
in the classical form this is the

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.070 
in the classical form this is the
driving<00:06:01.100> force<00:06:02.500> for<00:06:03.500> a<00:06:03.560> balanced

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
driving force for a balanced

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.060 
driving force for a balanced
so<00:06:06.130> use<00:06:07.130> them<00:06:07.550> together<00:06:07.940> almost<00:06:08.750> imagine<00:06:09.530> if

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
so use them together almost imagine if

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.040 
so use them together almost imagine if
I'm<00:06:10.280> in<00:06:10.430> now<00:06:10.520> in<00:06:10.670> a<00:06:10.760> correct<00:06:11.150> first<00:06:11.420> position<00:06:11.930> I

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
I'm in now in a correct first position I

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.910 
I'm in now in a correct first position I
have<00:06:12.170> to<00:06:12.200> recreate<00:06:12.770> myself<00:06:13.390> also<00:06:14.390> as<00:06:14.810> a

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
leg Demi comes down to Bob our position

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.430 
leg Demi comes down to Bob our position
I<00:06:30.470> catch<00:06:31.250> and<00:06:31.730> then<00:06:32.630> it's<00:06:32.780> almost<00:06:33.170> as<00:06:33.410> though

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
I catch and then it's almost as though

they connect watch I catch a little bit

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:53.920 
they connect watch I catch a little bit
quicker<00:06:47.450> and<00:06:47.810> then<00:06:48.410> my<00:06:48.560> arms<00:06:49.100> lift<00:06:52.150> and<00:06:53.150> that's
