this is her first feature film her

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.990 
this is her first feature film her
understanding<00:01:32.299> of<00:01:32.680> you<00:01:33.680> know<00:01:33.799> colors<00:01:34.220> cuts<00:01:34.670> I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
understanding of you know colors cuts I

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.429 
understanding of you know colors cuts I
felt<00:01:38.000> in<00:01:38.180> character<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.659> minute<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.049> wore<00:01:39.320> the

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
felt in character the minute I wore the

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.590 
felt in character the minute I wore the
clothes<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:39.950> felt<00:01:40.220> like<00:01:40.430> leader<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.330> know<00:01:41.479> and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
clothes I felt like leader you know and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.870 
clothes I felt like leader you know and
I<00:01:41.659> think<00:01:41.720> that's<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.229> most<00:01:42.350> important<00:01:42.920> aspect

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
I think that's the most important aspect

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.030 
I think that's the most important aspect
of<00:01:44.030> when<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.360> designer<00:01:44.720> comes<00:01:45.080> on<00:01:45.229> board<00:01:45.500> it's

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
of when a designer comes on board it's

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.100 
of when a designer comes on board it's
so<00:01:46.189> important<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.790> allow<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.600> actor<00:01:47.990> to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
so important to allow the the actor to

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.649 
so important to allow the the actor to
feel<00:01:48.350> like<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.740> character<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:49.510> she's<00:01:50.510> done<00:01:50.600> a

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
feel like the character and she's done a

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.420 
feel like the character and she's done a

new people and and it is so much magic

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.510 
new people and and it is so much magic
to<00:04:51.630> find<00:04:51.900> new<00:04:52.050> energies<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.710> new<00:04:52.919> people<00:04:53.400> to

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
work because then you have a newer

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.500

perspective to your own vision and I

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.790 
perspective to your own vision and I
think<00:04:57.540> that's<00:04:57.840> what<00:04:58.020> has<00:04:58.139> made<00:04:58.290> this<00:04:58.440> from<00:04:58.620> so

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
think that's what has made this from so

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:08.120 
think that's what has made this from so
special<00:05:01.850> events<00:05:02.930> so<00:05:03.930> you<00:05:03.960> looking<00:05:07.130> obviously

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
special events so you looking obviously

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.790 
special events so you looking obviously
it's<00:05:08.700> a<00:05:08.789> huge<00:05:08.970> risk<00:05:09.180> that<00:05:09.330> are<00:05:09.960> both<00:05:10.199> taken<00:05:10.650> at

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
it's a huge risk that are both taken at

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.460 
it's a huge risk that are both taken at
at<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.190> stage<00:05:11.750> you<00:05:12.750> know<00:05:12.870> where<00:05:13.110> we<00:05:13.229> are

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
at the stage you know where we are

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.110 
at the stage you know where we are
and<00:05:15.270> my<00:05:16.270> friend<00:05:16.690> only<00:05:16.840> item<00:05:17.230> on<00:05:17.320> Assad<00:05:17.650> so
