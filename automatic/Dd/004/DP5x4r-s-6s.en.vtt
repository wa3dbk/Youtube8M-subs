incredible<00:01:17.490> obstacles<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.140> all

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
incredible obstacles in it so it's all

this<00:01:25.110> series<00:01:25.460> probably<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.939> best

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
this series probably has the best
