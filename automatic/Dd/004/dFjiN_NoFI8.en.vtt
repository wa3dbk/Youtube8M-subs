00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.930
 modern cars are very similar friend 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.090
 other aerodynamics 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.070
 safety standards auto trend 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.680
 design force all manufacturers 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.940
 come to some common denominator and 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.190
 what can we say 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.890
 rarely come across in the stream for real 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.350
 spectacular car Koreans managed 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.039
 make it almost impossible and they created 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.160
 sedan to admire 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.989
 meet kia optima who said what 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 the best designers are Italians 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.649
 peter schreier german works in korea 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.380
 a simple sedan he could turn into one 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.070
 of the most beautiful cars on the market he 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.530
 good both in general and in detail with 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.149
 from any angle , anyone remembers 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.170
 how the coming looked not smoked and 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.790
 madzhentis 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.110
 I am not and this sedan I will definitely remember 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.210
 Salon here is not as effective as 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.490
 appearance but compared to the same 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.560
 madzhent am it is not even shako huge 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.959
 leap forward center console 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.799
 deployed to the driver all met in 

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.200
 black color 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.689
 Such a design adjusts to combat 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.579
 fret but not without typical asian 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.709
 items like chrome handles on 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.569
 doors that are somewhat knocked out of 

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:25.299
 overall picture but our cars are the most 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.549
 packaged navigation glass roof 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.590
 driver's seat ventilation is all like 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.009
 perhaps it is necessary only to warm the steering wheel 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.009
 enough 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.390
 under the hood here is a gasoline engine 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.630
 volume 2 4 liters capacity according to the passport 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.210
 180 horsepower torque 231 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.550
 newton meter sounds good but on 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.530
 practice is not so smooth at the start 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.930
 cars from the place she literally jumps 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.480
 go ahead and it seems to you that this is so further 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.000
 and will be but at a speed of over twenty 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.060
 kilometers per hour but 30 horses 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.490
 declared 180 become as it were below 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.620
 on acting large enough 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.540
 heavy here ng active everywhere obviously not 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.490
 apparently has motors 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.350
 six-speed automatic specially so 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.720
 tuned to maximize 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.580
 comfort slow why certainly not 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.830
 will call keep in flow in city 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.630
 but easy on the track for the sake of deception have 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.460
 manually shift gears into 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.560
 Automatic mode box clearly not 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.960
 understands what to do when long ago 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.990
 but it's time to choose the speed of rolls 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.610
 optima gently even on rough roads 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.530
 suspension swallows almost all the kidneys 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.240
 or just really deep we blew 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.870
 have to answer so as not to hurt 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.030
 beautiful rollers and a low car kit in 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.370
 corners there are rolls but not very strong 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.500
 brakes quite adequately cope with 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.320
 its mission only pedal is enough 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.739
 sensitive and will have to get used to 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.690
 optime wants to go sedately 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.550
 relaxed with dignity let 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.560
 surrounding admires swift 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.590
 the silhouette is not jealous 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:02.160
 but if someone doesn't like about tastes not 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.160
 argue that argue if you yourself
