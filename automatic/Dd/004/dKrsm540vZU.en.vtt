as much time as I do in the gym when I

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.420 
as much time as I do in the gym when I

go into a turn you know there's so many

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.540 
go into a turn you know there's so many
g-forces<00:00:35.000> that<00:00:35.150> are<00:00:35.329> building<00:00:35.630> up<00:00:35.780> and<00:00:36.550> my

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
g-forces that are building up and my

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.069 
g-forces that are building up and my
body<00:00:37.790> is<00:00:38.030> strong<00:00:38.210> enough<00:00:38.480> to<00:00:38.630> handle<00:00:38.810> those

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
body is strong enough to handle those

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.229 
body is strong enough to handle those
forces<00:00:39.470> it's<00:00:39.860> really<00:00:40.220> intense<00:00:40.610> you<00:00:40.940> know<00:00:41.000> it's

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
forces it's really intense you know it's

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.420 
forces it's really intense you know it's
not<00:00:41.450> just<00:00:41.810> you<00:00:42.350> know<00:00:42.380> oh<00:00:42.440> I'm<00:00:42.770> cruising<00:00:43.280> down

the<00:00:43.489> mountain<00:00:44.030> it's<00:00:44.240> serious<00:00:45.040> g-forces<00:00:46.100> I<00:00:49.480> go

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
the mountain it's serious g-forces I go

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.190 
the mountain it's serious g-forces I go
faster<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.800> stronger<00:00:52.250> I<00:00:52.280> get<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:52.880> and<00:00:53.240> so<00:00:53.750> for

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
faster the stronger I get and and so for

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.680 
faster the stronger I get and and so for
me<00:00:54.320> it's<00:00:54.560> it's<00:00:55.220> kind<00:00:55.490> of<00:00:55.550> it's<00:00:56.090> clear<00:00:56.420> it's<00:00:56.600> a

and and that that I'm I can be the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.320 
and and that that I'm I can be the
fastest<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:07.070> can<00:01:07.310> go<00:01:07.520> as<00:01:07.670> fast<00:01:07.850> as<00:01:08.000> I<00:01:08.119> want

to go and and there's no limits I have

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.380 
to go and and there's no limits I have
been<00:01:12.680> dreaming<00:01:13.130> about<00:01:13.220> Olympic<00:01:13.939> gold<00:01:14.090> medals

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
been dreaming about Olympic gold medals

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.230 
been dreaming about Olympic gold medals
since<00:01:14.689> I<00:01:15.080> was<00:01:15.470> nine<00:01:16.340> years<00:01:16.369> old<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.229> I<00:01:19.119> want<00:01:20.119> it

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
since I was nine years old and I want it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.080 
since I was nine years old and I want it
so<00:01:20.390> bad<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:20.990> thought<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:22.009> that's<00:01:22.159> the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
so bad and I thought that that's the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.179 
so bad and I thought that that's the
driving<00:01:23.539> force<00:01:23.810> behind<00:01:24.079> me<00:01:24.619> but<00:01:24.859> that's<00:01:25.039> what

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
driving force behind me but that's what

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.219 
driving force behind me but that's what
makes<00:01:25.460> that's<00:01:25.700> what<00:01:25.850> makes<00:01:26.030> me<00:01:26.179> take<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.719> also

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
makes that's what makes me take I also

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.499 
makes that's what makes me take I also
kind<00:01:28.069> of<00:01:28.159> think<00:01:28.340> about<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:28.789> know<00:01:28.909> what<00:01:29.149> my

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
kind of think about you know what my

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.239 
kind of think about you know what my
competitors<00:01:30.020> are<00:01:30.140> doing<00:01:30.200> am<00:01:30.979> i<00:01:31.069> working

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.249 
competitors are doing am i working

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:33.249 
competitors are doing am i working
harder<00:01:31.819> than<00:01:31.969> my<00:01:32.060> competitors<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.899> I<00:01:32.990> think

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
harder than my competitors and I think

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.529 
harder than my competitors and I think
always<00:01:33.979> when<00:01:34.159> I'm<00:01:34.249> in<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.429> gym<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:35.090> answer<00:01:35.390> is

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
always when I'm in a gym the answer is

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.569 
always when I'm in a gym the answer is
yes<00:01:35.749> and<00:01:36.079> and<00:01:36.469> that's<00:01:36.679> that's<00:01:37.069> what<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:37.340> want

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
you know I want to know and my my mind

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.520 
you know I want to know and my my mind
and<00:01:40.039> my<00:01:40.100> heart<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.639> mean<00:01:40.880> I've<00:01:41.420> given<00:01:42.409> the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
and my heart and I mean I've given the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.760 
and my heart and I mean I've given the
most<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.009> know<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.189> be<00:01:43.460> number<00:01:43.729> one<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.240> and

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
most you know to be number one and and

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.200 
most you know to be number one and and
that<00:01:45.770> that<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.369> gives<00:01:46.850> me<00:01:46.969> a<00:01:46.999> lot<00:01:47.149> of

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
that that that gives me a lot of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.700 
that that that gives me a lot of
confidence<00:01:47.389> when<00:01:47.899> I<00:01:47.960> get<00:01:48.109> on<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.319> hill

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
confidence when I get on the hill

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.410 
confidence when I get on the hill
I<00:01:48.740> think<00:01:49.249> Under<00:01:49.490> Armour<00:01:49.700> is<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.819> perfect<00:01:50.240> fit

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
I think Under Armour is a perfect fit

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.270 
I think Under Armour is a perfect fit
for<00:01:50.450> me<00:01:50.659> because<00:01:50.929> you<00:01:51.679> know<00:01:51.740> they<00:01:51.979> have<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
for me because you know they have the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.160 
for me because you know they have the
best<00:01:52.460> product<00:01:52.939> they<00:01:53.149> work<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.479> hardest<00:01:53.810> and

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
best product they work the hardest and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.499 
best product they work the hardest and
that's<00:01:55.100> what<00:01:55.340> I<00:01:55.369> think<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.789> am<00:01:55.909> or<00:01:56.119> at<00:01:56.240> least<00:01:56.389> I

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
that's what I think I am or at least I

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.480 
that's what I think I am or at least I
hope<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:56.899> can<00:01:57.409> be<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.649> know<00:01:57.709> trying<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.219> be<00:01:58.369> the
