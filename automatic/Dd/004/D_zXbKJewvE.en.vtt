subtle moves in it and subtle greens and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.800 
subtle moves in it and subtle greens and
it's<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.299> very<00:01:21.479> deep<00:01:22.140> complex<00:01:23.479> color<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
it's a very deep complex color and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.030 
it's a very deep complex color and
really<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.729> sparkles<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.880> sunlight<00:01:27.180> so

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040

Alcantara<00:03:04.900> headlining<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:05.710> this<00:03:05.860> is<00:03:05.980> like<00:03:06.100> a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
Alcantara headlining so this is like a

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.780 
Alcantara headlining so this is like a
synthetic<00:03:06.820> gum<00:03:07.060> synthetic<00:03:07.900> suede<00:03:08.520> we<00:03:09.520> have
