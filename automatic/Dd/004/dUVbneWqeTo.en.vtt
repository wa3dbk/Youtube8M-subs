00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.929
 we test the dynamic microphone blue 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.480
 yeti 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.370
 This is one of the best microphones on 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.809
 today it is made by 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.389
 advanced technology 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.580
 equipped with three capsules which 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.190
 allows you to use this mic in 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.810
 four recording modes 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.300
 I will test the program heston 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.460
 smoke that almost everyone has 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.800
 the computer through which we do 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.670
 screenshot and photos record video and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.650
 so on my microphone is tuned 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.930
 average sensitivity ie the stock and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.160
 make lower sensitivity and big 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.219
 stock make higher sensitivity 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.190
 so I put it in the middle here 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.320
 as it is and I will do testing 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.780
 this microphone is the only one in the room 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.910
 the sound source is my operating unit 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.890
 which is 6 fans they 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.840
 make a little noise so the microphone 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.879
 microphone is transmitted very sensitive 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.609
 transferred to the microphone this noise can be 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.270
 you are listening to this little part 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.909
 noise especially he will be with us 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.950
 audition all guide mode 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.880
 then when the sound source will be 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.920
 removed from all four sides here well 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.210
 let's test this mic 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.850
 we have the first testing mode 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.220
 microphone is set to stereo 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.790
 you see right now i'm on the left 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.710
 microphone side 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.220
 hear the sound on the left side of the microphone 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.190
 here gradually I turn to the right 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.590
 side tooth right side of the microphone i 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.260
 of course the microphone turns but 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.980
 I am from a microphone at a distance of 40 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.190
 50 centimeters that's how sound is transmitted 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.330
 hour on the right side of the microphone in the middle 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.160
 I will demonstrate again on the left side 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:57.280
 the microphone on the left of the microphone here 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:00.860
 I am recording stereo sound source 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.440
 understandable for what it serves 2 with us 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.190
 I will switch modes as they are 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.740
 on 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.550
 at the microphone itself next with us 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.700
 which are indicated on the microphone circle 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.940
 have we already told you whether the mode 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.950
 omnidirectional recording mode is maintained with 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.020
 this microphone that's how I would not 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.430
 turned the microphone now turn 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.620
 the microphone is almost 360 degrees that's 180 and 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.780
 farther you hear equally my 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.760
 the sound source i have is my transmission 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.500
 voices you hear equally from all 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.750
 parties it can be applied somewhere in 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.150
 conference room and so on where needed 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.060
 effect of the presence of several people 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.379
 write and so on here is the third mode u 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.420
 we will be cardioid like this 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.690
 modes flip quite tightly 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.849
 it's a cardioid regimen right now i'm 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.319
 set the microphone straight ahead 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.110
 I am in front of the microphone 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.420
 he writes mostly clear voice which 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.519
 is right in front of it 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.010
 microphone all the others to the left of the right 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.459
 to the rear of the colas muffled sounds 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.730
 muffled he won't write well 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.549
 this mode to write vocals under casting 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.290
 do a voice-over editing and so 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.269
 further here it is precisely this regime and 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.299
 most of all and use just the same 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.569
 this mode and the last fourth mode i 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.379
 letter crayfish such on this microphone 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.750
 drawn 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.310
 this is our bidirectional mode that is 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.269
 recorded as from the front 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.760
 microphone and back of the microphone 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.590
 This if interview two people let's 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.380
 record in the middle of the microphone 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.269
 put you can record the voice of the first 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:51.090
 and second caller appannie here are the main ones 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.180
 such four modes that we are now with 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.049
 you listened tested in this 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.090
 microphone is the microphone of the first version then 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.440
 have love these mic 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.560
 I'll show you some photos now 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.919
 this microphone in general is like this 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.919
 he looks like 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.579
 this microphone yes I forgot to say it 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.620
 backside or underside of this 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.600
 microphone here look at the picture here 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.240
 this bottom side of the microphone can be here 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.550
 still connect headphones to this 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.130
 microphone and let's say if you record 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.650
 voice or vocals are very beautiful 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.400
 hear your headset clear your voice 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.330
 there is a headphone jack 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.330
 next with us 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.710
 Well, that is, you can see him as he is very 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.690
 good stoyechka so he 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.580
 metal stand made it 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.250
 quite heavy, too, half a kilo 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.380
 weighs the same as the microphone and on this 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.720
 stand here on the hinges it is free and 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.380
 forward back down whatever you can 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.950
 turn very comfortable here it is with us 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.630
 front of the microphone we see 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.470
 button on it 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:11.419
 and headphone volume control 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:15.860
 so adjust the headphone volume 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:18.990
 here is the bottom of the microphone stand itself 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.800
 made see equipped with such a gasket 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.750
 like rubber but still i think 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.820
 that it was necessary to make something thicker and 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.860
 softer because all the same vibration 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.260
 the tires are very dense and the vibration is all nights 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.479
 the source is transmitted therefore had to 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.760
 put a handkerchief in order not to 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.350
 transmitted vibration from the table if 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.720
 let's say is on the table 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.720
 operating blocks so on something and 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.050
 the reverse side of the microphone is two 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.550
 switch 1 sensitivity 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:56.280
 microphone and the second switch we have 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.720
 mode and microphone here they are shown here 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.370
 microphone modes that is all very 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.139
 just conveniently located and 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.380
 the only microphone is so powerful 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:09.590
 large on the table anoyko background looks 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.199
 beautiful very cute microphone here 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.110
 the main thing that he writes very high quality 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:19.100
 here on this site there is another site 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.380

 Hertz at this microphone to 20 kilohertz 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.979
 maximum sound pressure 120 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:36.080
 decibel is pretty high even 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.919
 I can say the characteristics for 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.070
 microphone 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:45.100
