00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
really consider it a glitch but it's a

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.370 
really consider it a glitch but it's a

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
really easy way to play with your

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.739 
really easy way to play with your
friends<00:01:20.710> as<00:01:20.950> you<00:01:21.130> would<00:01:21.399> on<00:01:21.640> black<00:01:22.000> ops<00:01:22.179> 2<00:01:22.359> and

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
friends as you would on black ops 2 and

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.209 
friends as you would on black ops 2 and
this<00:01:22.899> makes<00:01:23.079> me<00:01:23.229> think<00:01:23.439> maybe<00:01:23.499> sledgehammer

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
this makes me think maybe sledgehammer

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:25.739 
this makes me think maybe sledgehammer
would<00:01:24.460> add<00:01:24.609> this<00:01:24.759> into<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.179> game<00:01:25.359> in<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.570> near

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:25.749 
would add this into the game in the near

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:27.899 
would add this into the game in the near
future<00:01:25.960> not<00:01:26.530> too<00:01:26.740> sure<00:01:26.920> exactly<00:01:27.009> but<00:01:27.640> we'll

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
future not too sure exactly but we'll

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.940 
future not too sure exactly but we'll
