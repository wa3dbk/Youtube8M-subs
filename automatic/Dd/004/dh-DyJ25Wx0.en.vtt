 with tuna and tomato sauce it's very easy 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.329
 to prepare and now in summer it feels like 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.760
 very much because we can have it already 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.790
 prepared and leave it in the refrigerator 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.370

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.170
 of butter and a little salt that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.440
 I have not put but way and then the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.369
 we put then to make the stuffing tuna

 We can see you here at home 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.990
 our YouTube channel 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.680
 and to garnish varied salad we are going to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.180
 start we put a pot on the fire 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.020
 we will throw 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.020
 Water 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.950
 the milk 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.630
 a little salt and have done now 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.040
 butter when it boils you 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.470
 we will put the envelope of mashed potatoes 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.470
 when it starts to boil we stop the fire 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.990
 we then take the puree 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.850
 we stir we will let stand and has 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.760
 reposed a moment and this is the texture 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.120
 that we have to stay like this has to 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.650
 be quite thick case 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.440
 when you follow the instructions of the 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.259
 puree maker you throw a little 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.119
 less water than they put in for 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.070
 can rectify it if you see that you have left 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.410
 too thick it has cooled and the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.899
 puree and now we spread a cloth 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.940
 cook in one of the work table 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.570
 we will put 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.570
 the puree 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.760
 now we are going to distribute it with the help 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.069
 of something from the cloth of the kitchen cloth what 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.579
 We will distribute until we are left 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.120
 rather a rectangular and we will go 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.989
 seeing 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.989
 as a staying 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.420
 it is not necessary that it be cold at all 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.420
 it has to be tempered 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.189
 while they finish cooling the puree 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:06.239
 let's prepare the stuffing for it 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.239
 we will catch the tuna 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:14.500
 many many we will see 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.500
 and we will add the tomato sauce 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.220
 let's go chafando so that everything is 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.220
 integrated 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.080
 we will cut the olives in half and 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.080
 we will reserve them 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.250
 already when it cooled 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.730
 the dough we will put the filling in the 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.730
 center 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.939
 we will put the olives 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.939
 in the center in a row 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.240
 we are going to roll it 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.799
 and we will put it in the tray for 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.799
 serve it 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.109
 we go like this 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:24.380
 where are we going to cover what then with the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:28.100
 mayonnaise sauce everything is disguised 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.880
 We will extend the mayonnaise that covers all 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.880
 the roll 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.860
 now we will donate it 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.589
 with olive trees you can put on me what 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.759
 you want that if you have pepper what 

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:49.759
 you like it 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.390
 we decorate it with lettuce 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.390
 and we will have it ready 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.700
 once it's already done then what 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.670
 you can save for a little while in the 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.730
 refrigerator the other country with paper of 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.730
