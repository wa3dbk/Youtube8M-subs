is<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:51.050> conventional<00:00:51.559> grip<00:00:51.680> tapes<00:00:51.980> like<00:00:52.250> the

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
is the conventional grip tapes like the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.000 
is the conventional grip tapes like the
sandpaper<00:00:52.580> read<00:00:53.030> sort<00:00:53.330> of<00:00:53.390> feel<00:00:53.840> to<00:00:53.870> it<00:00:54.170> but

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
sandpaper read sort of feel to it but

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.650 
sandpaper read sort of feel to it but
it's<00:00:55.190> quite<00:00:55.430> hard<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.730> do<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:55.970> tricks<00:00:56.210> we've

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
it's quite hard to do the tricks we've

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.090 
it's quite hard to do the tricks we've
already<00:00:56.780> got<00:00:57.020> to<00:00:57.110> get<00:00:57.200> some<00:00:57.380> practice<00:00:58.010> in

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
already got to get some practice in

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.979 
already got to get some practice in
there<00:00:58.309> with<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.210> sticky<00:00:59.420> grip<00:00:59.630> however

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
there with the sticky grip however

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:09.609 
there with the sticky grip however
anybody<00:01:00.800> can<00:01:01.160> do<00:01:01.280> it<00:01:01.309> even<00:01:01.579> made<00:01:08.500> all<00:01:09.500> those

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
anybody can do it even made all those

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.880 
anybody can do it even made all those
budding<00:01:09.920> Devi<00:01:10.160> planes<00:01:10.369> out<00:01:10.580> there<00:01:11.619> it's<00:01:12.619> great

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
budding Devi planes out there it's great

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.469 
budding Devi planes out there it's great
I<00:01:13.009> think<00:01:13.040> it's<00:01:13.280> really<00:01:13.550> gonna<00:01:13.670> help<00:01:13.880> get<00:01:14.270> more

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
I think it's really gonna help get more

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.539 
I think it's really gonna help get more
kids<00:01:14.750> into<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.050> category

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
kids into the category

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.969 
kids into the category
more<00:01:17.299> kids<00:01:17.539> want<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.780> be<00:01:17.899> doing<00:01:18.289> more<00:01:18.710> advanced

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
more kids want to be doing more advanced

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.740 
more kids want to be doing more advanced
tricks<00:01:19.250> I<00:01:19.549> think<00:01:20.060> it's<00:01:20.179> a<00:01:20.210> great<00:01:20.329> innovation

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
tricks I think it's a great innovation

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.310 
tricks I think it's a great innovation
can<00:01:21.259> I<00:01:21.289> try<00:01:21.469> that<00:01:21.939> okay<00:01:22.939> okay<00:01:23.689> here<00:01:23.929> puts<00:01:24.259> a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
the figure you get new tricks it's also

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.390 
the figure you get new tricks it's also
got<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.680> swivel

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.660 

you<00:02:22.879> just

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.550 

and<00:02:28.060> they<00:02:28.150> go<00:02:28.300> they'll<00:02:28.450> switch<00:02:28.690> on<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.930> bottom

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
and they go they'll switch on the bottom

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:52.650 
and they go they'll switch on the bottom
there<00:02:50.220> basically<00:02:51.220> week<00:02:51.490> so<00:02:51.730> we've<00:02:52.030> got<00:02:52.180> three

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
there basically week so we've got three

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.900 
there basically week so we've got three
items<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.140> range<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:54.190> basic<00:02:54.489> figure<00:02:54.730> and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
items in the range the basic figure and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.840 
items in the range the basic figure and
obstacle<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:56.290> one<00:02:56.470> here<00:02:56.650> you've<00:02:57.640> got<00:02:57.730> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
obstacle this one here you've got the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.100 
obstacle this one here you've got the

we don't just a mock-up stage Wow so
they're<00:03:44.470> gonna<00:03:44.560> be<00:03:44.650> like<00:03:48.600> this

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
just to give you a size comparison as we

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.300 
just to give you a size comparison as we
know<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:02.170> real<00:04:02.620> world<00:04:02.800> of<00:04:02.890> skateboarding

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
the longboard to use more for speed but

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.410 
the longboard to use more for speed but
again<00:04:06.490> we'll<00:04:06.640> take<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:06.940> we've<00:04:07.090> got<00:04:07.180> all<00:04:07.300> the

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.990 

absolute<00:04:14.680> areas<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.430> it<00:04:15.520> will<00:04:15.640> come<00:04:15.820> with<00:04:15.970> a

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
absolute areas and it will come with a

absolute areas and it will come with a
sticky<00:04:16.360> grip<00:04:16.480> tape

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300
