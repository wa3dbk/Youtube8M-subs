behemoths right here now so this is the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.490 
behemoths right here now so this is the
red<00:00:23.039> wing<00:00:23.310> broken<00:00:23.970> 360<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.840> mine<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
red wing broken 360 of mine this is the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.620 
red wing broken 360 of mine this is the
soon-to-be<00:00:26.130> red<00:00:26.369> green<00:00:26.609> probably<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.269> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
soon-to-be red green probably in a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.480 
soon-to-be red green probably in a
couple<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.990> months<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.650> supposed<00:00:29.429> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
couple of months and this is supposed to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.650 
couple of months and this is supposed to
be<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.890> very<00:00:31.890> unlikely<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.820> wear<00:00:33.030> ring<00:00:33.300> even

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
be the very unlikely to wear ring even

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.880 
be the very unlikely to wear ring even
though<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.899> can't<00:00:34.110> actually<00:00:34.260> read<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.620> ring

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
though it can't actually read it ring

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.620 
though it can't actually read it ring
anymore<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.489> little<00:00:35.730> red<00:00:35.880> dot<00:00:36.149> comes<00:00:36.420> up

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
anymore just a little red dot comes up

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.299 
anymore just a little red dot comes up
if<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.840> actually<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.559> any<00:00:37.800> problems<00:00:38.190> with

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
if you actually have any problems with

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.799 
if you actually have any problems with
it<00:00:38.340> Microsoft's<00:00:38.969> inside<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.360> change<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.719> but

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
it Microsoft's inside to change it but

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.080 
it Microsoft's inside to change it but
anyway<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.550> looking<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:41.940> here

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
anyway so this is just looking at here

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.869 
anyway so this is just looking at here
imma<00:00:42.300> go<00:00:42.390> ahead<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.760> broken<00:00:44.760> one

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
imma go ahead and get this broken one

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.130 
imma go ahead and get this broken one
out<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.270> I'm<00:00:45.390> gonna<00:00:45.450> find<00:00:45.690> something<00:00:45.989> to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620 
one it says not really revolutionary as
far<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:17.280> trimming<00:01:17.610> down<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.090> two<00:01:18.330> too

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
much but it's supposed to be a little

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.820 
much but it's supposed to be a little
bit<00:01:20.340> more<00:01:20.490> energy<00:01:20.759> efficient<00:01:21.509> use<00:01:22.290> less<00:01:22.560> power

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
bit more energy efficient use less power

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.260 
bit more energy efficient use less power
we're<00:01:23.100> supposed<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> little<00:01:23.790> quieter

the side here as well you can see here

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.139 
the side here as well you can see here
that<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.720> side<00:01:48.990> has<00:01:49.229> no<00:01:49.470> offense<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:49.950> all<00:01:50.149> but

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
that this side has no offense at all but

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.700

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
events but on the other side the flip

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.389 
events but on the other side the flip
side<00:01:54.600> that's<00:01:55.049> where<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.890> definitely<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
side that's where you definitely see the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.310 
side that's where you definitely see the
vents<00:01:57.090> comparisons<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.170> has<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
vents comparisons here this one has a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.249 
vents comparisons here this one has a
very<00:01:58.680> nice<00:01:59.009> sized<00:02:00.000> bit<00:02:00.390> right<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.960> x

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
very nice sized bit right here this x

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.260 
very nice sized bit right here this x
has<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.829> same<00:02:02.040> type<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> bitch<00:02:02.520> that's<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.180> the

alright so from overall from testing
these<00:04:41.630> two<00:04:41.810> devices<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.530> xbox<00:04:42.890> 360<00:04:43.310> sim<00:04:43.580> is<00:04:43.910> a

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
these two devices the xbox 360 sim is a

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.050 
these two devices the xbox 360 sim is a
considerable<00:04:44.900> quieter<00:04:45.500> then<00:04:45.770> d-duh<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.820> old

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
considerable quieter then d-duh the old

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.910 
considerable quieter then d-duh the old
xbox<00:04:47.420> 360<00:04:48.140> hopefully<00:04:48.410> can<00:04:48.590> hear<00:04:48.800> the

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
xbox 360 hopefully can hear the

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.320 
xbox 360 hopefully can hear the
difference<00:04:48.950> but<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:49.580> can<00:04:49.760> definitely<00:04:49.940> give<00:04:50.270> you

difference but I can definitely give you

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.510 
difference but I can definitely give you
my<00:04:50.450> word<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:51.020> really<00:04:51.530> is<00:04:51.740> quieter<00:04:52.160> even<00:04:52.400> when
