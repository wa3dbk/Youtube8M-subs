00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
was kind of a step backwards I I was

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.500 
was kind of a step backwards I I was
designing<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.459> spear<00:02:32.819> point<00:02:33.150> but<00:02:33.420> it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
designing to be a spear point but it

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.550 
designing to be a spear point but it
came<00:02:33.690> out<00:02:33.900> more<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.470> all<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.780> front<00:02:37.379> edge

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
came out more of a all the front edge

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.530 
came out more of a all the front edge
came<00:02:37.829> out<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> little<00:02:38.220> bit<00:02:38.400> straighter<00:02:39.209> than<00:02:39.420> I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
came out a little bit straighter than I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.559 
came out a little bit straighter than I
was<00:02:39.690> hoping<00:02:39.980> it's<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.040> real<00:02:41.220> small<00:02:41.790> knife<00:02:42.090> it's

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
was hoping it's a real small knife it's

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.330 
was hoping it's a real small knife it's
got<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:43.790> kind<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.909> a<00:02:45.090> boot<00:02:45.390> he'll<00:02:45.629> handle<00:02:46.340> to

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
got a kind of a boot he'll handle to

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.789 
got a kind of a boot he'll handle to
anchor<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.879> your<00:02:48.000> hand<00:02:48.239> for<00:02:48.720> cutting<00:02:49.109> but

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
anchor it in your hand for cutting but

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.069 
anchor it in your hand for cutting but
it's<00:02:49.920> not<00:02:50.069> really<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.370> big<00:02:50.459> knife<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.420> really

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
it's not really a big knife so it really

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.869 
it's not really a big knife so it really
doesn't<00:02:52.319> need<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.560> much<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.980> an<00:02:53.069> anchor<00:02:53.400> but

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
doesn't need that much of an anchor but

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.390 
doesn't need that much of an anchor but
it's<00:02:54.030> nice<00:02:54.239> I<00:02:54.690> really<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.739> this<00:02:56.010> I'm

on this is a perfect example 440c does
rust<00:05:42.780> a<00:05:42.930> little<00:05:43.170> bit<00:05:43.370> I've<00:05:44.370> been<00:05:44.850> keeping
