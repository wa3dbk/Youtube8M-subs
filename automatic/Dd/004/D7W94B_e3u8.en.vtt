last<00:00:05.790> year<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:06.120> was<00:00:06.240> competing<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.839> the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
last year I was competing in the

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.060 
production class of the Berenstain seed
Boxter<00:00:09.179> championship<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.500> car<00:00:10.769> was

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
Boxter championship so the car was

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.580 
Boxter championship so the car was
relatively<00:00:11.639> standard<00:00:12.450> aside<00:00:12.840> from<00:00:13.170> some

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
relatively standard aside from some

relatively standard aside from some
essential<00:00:14.190> safety<00:00:14.340> equipment<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.690> year<00:00:16.049> it

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
essential safety equipment this year it

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.870 
essential safety equipment this year it
had<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> dramatic<00:00:17.100> overhaul

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
had a dramatic overhaul

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.210 
had a dramatic overhaul
we've<00:00:18.060> got<00:00:18.300> quantum<00:00:18.779> racing<00:00:19.170> shocks<00:00:19.439> on<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
we've got quantum racing shocks on the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.880 
we've got quantum racing shocks on the
car<00:00:20.550> now<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.270> they're<00:00:21.869> fully<00:00:22.140> adjustable<00:00:22.560> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
car now and they're fully adjustable and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.380 
car now and they're fully adjustable and
we've<00:00:23.699> also<00:00:23.850> got<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> custom<00:00:24.660> bt<00:00:25.199> being<00:00:25.529> exhaust

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
we've also got a custom bt being exhaust

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.480 
we've also got a custom bt being exhaust
itg<00:00:27.390> you've<00:00:27.539> done<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> custom<00:00:28.140> intake<00:00:28.619> for<00:00:28.949> it

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
itg you've done a custom intake for it

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.659 
itg you've done a custom intake for it
so<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.750> quite<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.320> bit<00:00:31.560> different<00:00:32.130> quint<00:00:32.489> take

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
so it's quite a bit different quint take

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.700 
so it's quite a bit different quint take
racing<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.450> running<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> car<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.350> they<00:00:34.680> are

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
racing and running the car and they are

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.139 
racing and running the car and they are
absolutely<00:00:34.920> experts<00:00:35.579> when<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.760> comes<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
absolutely experts when it comes to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.510 
absolutely experts when it comes to
vehicle<00:00:36.480> dynamics<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.680> despite<00:00:38.160> having<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
vehicle dynamics so despite having a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.819 
vehicle dynamics so despite having a
couple<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.820> problems<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.480> qualifying<00:00:40.020> through

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
couple of problems in qualifying through

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.430 
couple of problems in qualifying through
no<00:00:41.010> fault<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.399> theirs<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.969> all<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.960> actual<00:00:43.230> car

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
no fault of theirs at all the actual car

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
no fault of theirs at all the actual car
felt<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.190> good<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.670> I'm<00:00:45.480> really

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.640 

ordinarily<00:03:18.840> I've<00:03:19.230> been<00:03:19.470> mightily

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
ordinarily I've been mightily

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.920 
ordinarily I've been mightily
disappointed<00:03:20.490> with<00:03:20.730> fourth<00:03:21.180> place<00:03:21.240> because

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
disappointed with fourth place because

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.150 
disappointed with fourth place because
it's<00:03:22.080> not<00:03:22.200> on<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.410> podium

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
it's not on the podium

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.390 
it's not on the podium
however<00:03:23.730> being<00:03:24.690> realistic<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:26.070> team<00:03:26.280> have

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
however being realistic the team have

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.480 
however being realistic the team have
done<00:03:26.550> brilliantly<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.680> we<00:03:28.680> were<00:03:28.920> running<00:03:29.370> in

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
done brilliantly and we were running in

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.710 
done brilliantly and we were running in
third<00:03:29.790> until<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.990> final<00:03:31.410> laps<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.190> if<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.570> had

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
third until the final laps so if I had

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.960 
third until the final laps so if I had
realized<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.530> he<00:03:34.650> was<00:03:34.800> in<00:03:34.920> my<00:03:35.070> class<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.730> think

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
realized that he was in my class I think

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.550 
realized that he was in my class I think
I<00:03:36.120> could<00:03:36.330> be<00:03:36.450> but<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.720> might<00:03:37.020> go<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> little<00:03:37.380> bit

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
I could be but it might go a little bit

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.120 
I could be but it might go a little bit
wider<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:39.120> cars<00:03:39.360> been<00:03:39.630> set<00:03:39.990> up<00:03:40.230> really<00:03:40.860> really

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
wider the cars been set up really really

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.550 
wider the cars been set up really really
well<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:42.690> team<00:03:42.840> have<00:03:42.990> managed<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.380> pull

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560

happy with how the cars run and to
finish<00:03:49.140> him<00:03:49.320> forth<00:03:49.620> for<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.010> first<00:03:50.250> time<00:03:50.580> that

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
finish him forth for the first time that

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.940 
finish him forth for the first time that
we've<00:03:51.570> done<00:03:51.600> longer<00:03:52.050> races<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.710> first

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
finishes for the next race so we've got

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.010 
finishes for the next race so we've got
a<00:04:02.130> few<00:04:02.400> changes<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.480> were<00:04:03.540> going<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.870> make

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
a few changes that were going to make

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.340 
a few changes that were going to make
and<00:04:04.520> parts<00:04:05.520> additions<00:04:06.120> we've<00:04:06.930> got<00:04:07.110> some

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
and parts additions we've got some

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.280 
and parts additions we've got some
uprated<00:04:08.070> brakes<00:04:08.100> coming<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.210> team<00:04:09.780> dynamics

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
uprated brakes coming and team dynamics

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.490 
uprated brakes coming and team dynamics
alloy<00:04:10.500> wheels<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.570> should<00:04:12.750> imagine<00:04:12.960> Robert

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
alloy wheels and I should imagine Robert

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.140 
alloy wheels and I should imagine Robert
will<00:04:13.650> do<00:04:13.800> a<00:04:13.830> few<00:04:14.100> other<00:04:14.130> tweaks<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:15.090> the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
will do a few other tweaks to the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.560 
will do a few other tweaks to the
suspension<00:04:15.570> as<00:04:15.870> well<00:04:15.900> so
