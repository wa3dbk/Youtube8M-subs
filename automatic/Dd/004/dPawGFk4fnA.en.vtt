00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
you got majorly so that's kind of what

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.499 
you got majorly so that's kind of what
we've<00:05:10.110> been<00:05:10.139> seeing<00:05:10.560> too<00:05:10.889> when<00:05:11.340> we<00:05:12.090> purchased

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
we've been seeing too when we purchased

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.839 
we've been seeing too when we purchased
these<00:05:12.599> brand-new<00:05:13.130> they<00:05:14.130> always<00:05:14.639> seal

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
these brand-new they always seal

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.890 
these brand-new they always seal
perfectly<00:05:15.830> but<00:05:16.830> after<00:05:18.500> some<00:05:19.500> time<00:05:19.530> of<00:05:20.069> use<00:05:20.310> and

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
perfectly but after some time of use and

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.360 
perfectly but after some time of use and
I<00:05:22.370> guess<00:05:23.370> there's<00:05:23.840> normal<00:05:24.840> use<00:05:25.039> they<00:05:26.039> start

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
I guess there's normal use they start

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.330 
I guess there's normal use they start
leaking<00:05:26.550> and<00:05:27.860> we<00:05:28.860> actually<00:05:29.099> have<00:05:30.060> I

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
trips and once you load things up it's

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.159 
trips and once you load things up it's
not<00:06:05.099> only<00:06:05.340> water

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169
