00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.230 
detect it on the evasion program as you
see<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:39.570> mine<00:01:39.840> says<00:01:40.110> iphone<00:01:40.320> 5s<00:01:40.829> GSM<00:01:41.549> blah

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
see here mine says iphone 5s GSM blah

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.749 
see here mine says iphone 5s GSM blah
blah<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.590> means<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.040> detected<00:01:44.579> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
blah and that means it's detected and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.310 
blah and that means it's detected and
then<00:01:45.149> you'll<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.329> able<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.780> simply<00:01:46.140> hit

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
then you'll be able to simply hit

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.620 
then you'll be able to simply hit
jailbreak<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> right<00:01:47.250> side<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.509> is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
jailbreak on the right side and that is

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.270 
jailbreak on the right side and that is
it<00:01:48.810> now<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.680> play<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> waiting<00:01:50.130> game

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
it now you just play the waiting game

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520 
it now you just play the waiting game
now<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:51.180> will<00:01:51.329> take<00:01:51.540> about<00:01:51.720> five<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.320> ten

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
now this will take about five to ten

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.230 
now this will take about five to ten
minutes<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:53.340> let<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.579> do<00:01:53.670> its<00:01:53.820> thing<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
minutes just let it do its thing and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.639 
minutes just let it do its thing and
don't<00:01:54.420> touch<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.659> device<00:01:54.930> until<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.619> actually

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
don't touch the device until it actually

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.649 
don't touch the device until it actually
tells<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> go<00:01:56.670> ahead<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.090> press<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
evasion 7 icon to continue now once you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.319 
evasion 7 icon to continue now once you
hit<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:02.070> gonna<00:02:02.250> again<00:02:02.579> reboot<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> few

times and you are actually done that's
how<00:02:07.320> easy<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.190> jailbreak<00:02:08.640> iOS<00:02:09.090> 7<00:02:10.050> device

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
how easy it is to jailbreak iOS 7 device

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.320 
how easy it is to jailbreak iOS 7 device
when<00:02:10.979> all<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.520> done<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.970> old<00:02:12.120> them

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
when all of that is done the old them

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.910 
when all of that is done the old them
see<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> city<00:02:13.110> icon

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
see a city icon

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.380 
see a city icon
and<00:02:14.010> we'll<00:02:14.160> go<00:02:14.280> ahead<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.610> open<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.880> up<00:02:15.150> they

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and we'll go ahead and open that up they

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.699 
and we'll go ahead and open that up they
will<00:02:15.630> start<00:02:15.810> preparing<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.319> file<00:02:16.470> system

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
will start preparing the file system

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.290 
will start preparing the file system
which<00:02:17.099> will<00:02:17.130> take<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.490> couple<00:02:17.670> minutes<00:02:17.970> and
