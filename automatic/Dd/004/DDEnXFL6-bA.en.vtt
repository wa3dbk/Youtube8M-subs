00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
them whereas for skinning you just would

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.040 
them whereas for skinning you just would
be<00:02:13.860> skinning<00:02:14.160> animals<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.180> having<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.540> plus

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.390 
run over to it I mine it I don't run all

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.540 
run over to it I mine it I don't run all
over<00:07:21.420> the<00:07:21.780> map<00:07:21.930> looking<00:07:22.350> for<00:07:22.650> it<00:07:22.800> the<00:07:23.220> reason

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
over the map looking for it the reason

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.220 
over the map looking for it the reason
for<00:07:23.580> this<00:07:23.730> is<00:07:23.880> because<00:07:24.030> Owen<00:07:24.510> forest<00:07:24.960> is<00:07:25.110> an

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.230 
for this is because Owen forest is an

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.400 
for this is because Owen forest is an
excellent<00:07:25.590> spot<00:07:25.980> for<00:07:26.280> farming<00:07:26.640> copper<00:07:27.090> and

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.410 
excellent spot for farming copper and

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.420 
excellent spot for farming copper and
you're<00:07:28.410> pretty<00:07:28.590> much<00:07:28.710> all<00:07:28.950> over<00:07:28.980> the<00:07:29.310> map

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:29.430 
you're pretty much all over the map

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.150 
you're pretty much all over the map
anyways<00:07:29.970> while<00:07:30.210> questing<00:07:30.570> so<00:07:31.560> it's<00:07:31.950> quite

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 
anyways while questing so it's quite

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.190 
anyways while questing so it's quite
easy<00:07:32.220> to<00:07:32.580> get<00:07:32.820> a<00:07:32.850> stack<00:07:33.180> to<00:07:33.420> sex<00:07:33.810> maybe<00:07:33.990> even

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.200 
easy to get a stack to sex maybe even

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.810 
easy to get a stack to sex maybe even
three<00:07:34.650> depending<00:07:35.070> how<00:07:35.190> long<00:07:35.430> you're<00:07:35.640> there

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:35.820
