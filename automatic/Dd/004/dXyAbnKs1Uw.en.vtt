00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hi, how are you doing? 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.680
 I hope you have returned here to another class 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.590
 of the clinical pharmacology course and 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.849
 basic and now let's continue with the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.969
 fifth class we are going to talk 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.500
 specifically of pharmacodynamics and 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.289
 of some issues that have to do 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.650
 with the receptor because pharmacodynamics 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.949
 is the physiological biochemical effect that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.529
 develops the drug in the body or 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.750
 be that this effect is a consequence of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.480
 the interaction with components of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.670
 molecular macro structure and all this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.520
 series of effects that have to do with 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.649
 our body to this is known 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.770
 with him with the mechanism name of 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.000
 action the mechanism of action is evaluated 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.820
 at the molecular level 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.430
 the drug interacts with other 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.670
 molecules and how it looks like we said that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.140
 they were called those molecules by receptor 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.899
 originating the pharmacological action 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.180
 the pharmacological receptor let's talk 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.489
 now about him 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.100
 the pharmacological receptor is a 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.380
 molecule generally of protein type 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.560
 which is located in the cell in 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.360
 a specific physiological area this area 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.659
 physiological concrete we will know 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.200
 as the place of action of course the 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.000
 drug 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.079
 christie here is very important 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.390
 receptor is that it is structurally 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:30.619
 specific to an internal mediator already 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.460
 be hormones out shelter etcetera to which 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.250
 the drug mimics and competes with 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.189
 by means of unions these unions are 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.280
 chemicals obviously with the receiver in 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.719
 are reversible and because they are going to 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.069
 be reversible because they are going to be 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:51.049
 through links with unions such as 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.959
 van der walt forces bridges 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.319
 hydrogen hidro filia hydrophobia 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:59.329
 etcetera and really irreversible like 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.970
 for example when there are links 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.360
 covalent now let's talk about the 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.429
 receptor drug interactions and for 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.799
 this has to start with some of the 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.010
 concepts first we have to the 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:15.690
 affinity is the binding capacity of 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.170
 drug to the receiver 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.050
 we have that intrinsic activity is the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.310
 ability to produce the action after 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:30.120
 the union to the receiver now if an action 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.320
 pharmacological is the concrete change that 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.130
 causes the drug so the effect 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.700
 pharmacological is the manifestation 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:45.240
 observable of the pharmacological action and 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.460
 you also have to define other concepts 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.760
 other concepts for example the power 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.510
 the power is the amount by weight 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.080
 Molecular drug required for a 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.840
 effect and tolerance is the loss of 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.860
 effect after dose administration 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.050
 repeated and it's called tacuifi the chs ya 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.080
 is that phil axia if it develops 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.080
 quickly 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.620
 Now let's continue with the 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.310
 types of drugs in relation to 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.280
 receptor an agonist is that it has 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.280
 affinity and intrinsic activity a 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.390
 antagonist has affinity but not 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.769
 intrinsic activity a partial agonist 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.890
 has affinity and some activity 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.440
 intrinsic an antagonist agonist has 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.650
 an effect of a partial agonist before a 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.860
 agonist and finally an agonist 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.370
 Inverse has affinity and activity 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.400
 intrinsic but inverse I hope that you 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.579
 it's been very clear that these guys 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.290
 of drugs in relation to the recipient 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.239
 partial agonist antagonist agonist 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.980
 antagonist agonist and finally 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.470
 reverse agonist 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.900
 as for the types of receivers there are 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.060
 several types of receivers but four 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.849
 are the main ones we have to those 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.040
 people associated with ion channels or 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.430
 be that the opening of the 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.729
 channel these can be too fast 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.079
 that act in milliseconds 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.570
 approximately example that are 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.380
 associated with ion channels, as those that 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.680
 help to open the floodgates of the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.229
 pump channels to sodium atp handle 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:35.190
 we also have others that are coupled 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.950
 to proteins that this type of receptors 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:42.150
 it's the most of all 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.100
 for example the agonist the receptor 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.860
 proteins that work like 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.590
 transducers and also having effects 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.170
 cell phones, enzymes or others 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.150
 ion channels another type of the 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.150
 recipients are those who have 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.220
 own enzymatic activity means 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.610
 that the same protein recognizes the 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.840
 ligand either extracellular and active the 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.180
 in the enzyme that is the intracellular 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.280
 and finally another one of the types of 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.910
 most important receivers in the world 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.210
 of pharmacology are the receptors 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.400
 intracellular or that the union is 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.500
 intracellular these receptors are expensive 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.060
 They have the characteristic and they are very 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.860
 slow his action is given up for hours 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.430
 with this we are going to finish today 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.590
 the class talking about pharmacodynamics 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.600
 I hope it has been interesting and 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.200
 especially very explicit information 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.830
 what is important to be easy 'the 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.780
 way in which those concepts are given 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.790
 Have a great day and see you 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.790
 in the next class until then
