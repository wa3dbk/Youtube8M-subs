00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.730
 hi came on your sports channel 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.230
 so today we will not do a 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.490
 session properly speaking against 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.750
 will do educational 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.429
 simply because we are going to ask 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.100
 many questions about 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.690
 pumps the difficulty of dargaud fr so 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.220
 the goal of the game was going down to teach you 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.480
 by some exercises that I will not 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.189
 count them I will not tell you in 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.260
 does 20 30 40 or what is it you who 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.060
 dosed and wood I explain four 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.470
 exercises only so that we can 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.970
 get to do over time 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 slopes do not worry how is 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.520
 girl or boy 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.230
 it is not very difficult to go 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.940
 most people tend to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.320
 to get folded but more to push back 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.000
 it's just not used to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.739
 work his muscles there with the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.329
 four exercises that I propose in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.980
 two big news come to do 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.789
 to defend properly do not tell you 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.800
 go 50 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.149
 in any case you will arrive and folded and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.739
 arrogant and if you stand at this 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.030
 workout so has it four exercises 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.430
 no more first then we go to each 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.199
 once spread the legs to spread a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.460
 little weight and especially it goes us 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.800
 help make an appointment to work a little 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.780
 little in the cladding so the first 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.979
 exercise 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.420
 so we will look in the diagonals 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.930
 you will often understand say 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.280
 diagonals 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.439
 just because we're going 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.670
 transfer the weight right and well 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.590
 in the camera focus so that you 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.049
 can see that the wood is not going 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.759
 shift on a single support that remains 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.780
 on the contrary I will try to stay 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.159
 stable that's what will make me 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.770
 work the triceps and the biceps 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.280
 especially for bridges so we are 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.320
 here and there I'm just going to make a tripod 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.650
 ok and I do not want to rock my arm 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.590
 law 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.570
 I'm going to stay in the middle and here I 'm going 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.979
 come a little bit bent the elbow and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.009
 low and hand in the diagonal 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.920
 I do a dozen times to the right and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.750
 then I ask I'm not shifting my 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.790
 hair on the mode and left well at 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.350
 middle and pretty girls slowly 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.060
 on the other hockey and we do it 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.009
 many times that will allow to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.210
 solicit the rotator cuff the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.250
 face and triceps 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.260
 go do you do it you try to 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.370
 to ten 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.510
 if you have not done this to yourself 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.990
 times you have not done you two 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.390
 three times go go the educational number 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.890
 of this one I call cat group 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.550
 in fact simply because we are going 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.700
 off alternately supports therefore 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.560
 to spread the legs well behind and 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.340
 in fact I'm going to transfer the point I 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.170
 folds a tool so can just there a 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.360
 like that ok but you see how 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.040
 weight does not happen in Cuba meanwhile 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.630
 his left right according to my 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.520
 only support that I have left I try 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.540
 always to be well guaino middle there ok 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.660
 so it's also working on my 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.660
 legs 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:46.700
 then we go a little further back 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:49.550
 a small people in advance and this is 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.070
 good now we're going to do the same thing 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.590
 but bending over the arm what 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:59.600
 is a bit more difficult so I small 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:05.150
 more I stay pray ok I did not 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.709
 as if it did not burn and that's it 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.350
 it's the educational number now 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.950
 educational number 3 I had it banks 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.690
 pyramid 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.769
 so I do not know why but 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.769
 anyway you will quickly see it's here 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.290
 there knees that sinks on 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.110
 alignment of hands and feet 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.269
 behind who will come and touch themselves that does not 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:34.360
 not learn if you're going to see 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.360
 young or June passed like that ok 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.620
 so this extension I am dismissed 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.519
 knees in alignment with mayors I 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.959
 come on pillars I get down bending in 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.510
 body lax ok there I'm rocking I 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:58.310
 picked up tricky school I raise some 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:01.370
 young people I pose young man I advance I 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.030
 pose I'm coming back I'm kidding 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.500
 feet and I pay it ladies 1 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:14.640
 I come to touch my elbows and I return 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:17.910
 have the same thing here I just ask 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.209
 elbows and I intend to go now 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.580
 we could do it just said on 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.400
 knees to stay on your knees 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.380
 you advance you fold your appointments 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.449
 see I sting in this axis not on the 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:36.870
 sides I really want to work there 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:39.810
 ok go now we're going to work on 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.610
 the fourth and last educational it is 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.960
 roughly similar to other soil 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.030
 we will work the knees on the ground 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.479
 for this fade and more difficulties 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.370
 so in fact it's I'm on the ground and the 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.960
 young one foot on the side 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.479
 ok not like just now art there 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.350
 with my arm and I'm going to look 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.360
 behind there ok go on the knees 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.680
 impatient feet we will do it 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.360
 you do it a dozen times to 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.010
 right a dozen times to the left or 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.289
 at the time of raising you 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.210
 ok so here's one here and I go down ok in 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.010
 sometimes makes it right we do it 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.630
 sometimes left paying attention 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.700
 well clicked on the side there and so 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.979
 right away and you repeat the series as much 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.120
 of voices you play and after 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.080
 a few weeks you will see that 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.380
 you will come to make pumps 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.020
 complete down then go back to the 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.150

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.110
