00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.710 
tube slide slide things and I there had
been<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> jump<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.550> had<00:02:40.760> been<00:02:40.910> constructed<00:02:41.600> on

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
been a jump that had been constructed on

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.990 
been a jump that had been constructed on
the<00:02:41.750> hill<00:02:41.990> so<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:42.740> was<00:02:42.920> like<00:02:43.040> hell<00:02:43.430> yeah<00:02:43.459> dude

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
the hill so I was like hell yeah dude

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.650 
the hill so I was like hell yeah dude
let's<00:02:44.270> do<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.670> set<00:02:46.670> up<00:02:46.700> my<00:02:46.819> my

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
let's do this and so I set up my my

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.990 
let's do this and so I set up my my
little<00:02:47.900> inner<00:02:48.110> tube<00:02:48.440> on<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.920> top<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.880> hill

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
little inner tube on the top of the hill

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.360 
little inner tube on the top of the hill
and<00:02:50.330> I'm<00:02:50.750> thinking<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.860> know<00:02:51.980> what<00:02:52.190> would<00:02:52.310> be

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
and I'm thinking you know what would be

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.020 
and I'm thinking you know what would be
better<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:53.210> make<00:02:53.360> this<00:02:53.510> jump

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
better to make this jump

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.480 
better to make this jump
if<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.569> ran<00:02:54.900> towards<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.530> inner<00:02:55.709> tube<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.280> then

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
if I ran towards the inner tube and then

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.370 
if I ran towards the inner tube and then
you<00:02:56.760> know<00:02:56.880> proceeded<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.750> slide<00:02:58.110> down<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
you know proceeded to slide down the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.340 
you know proceeded to slide down the
hill<00:02:58.640> so<00:02:59.640> i<00:03:00.000> did<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.420> i<00:03:00.600> put<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.990> inner<00:03:01.140> tube
