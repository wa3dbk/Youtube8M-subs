00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.509
 hello everyone today in this video we're going to 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.610
 see some recommendations very 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.499
 important things that we should have in 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.230
 account when doing surveillance by 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:14.829
 internet using the safe for program 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.380
 cam imagine that we are on vacation 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:21.170
 We are going to travel and we will leave our house 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.660
 completely alone so we need 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.269
 of a system that can alert us in 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.730
 case of theft or that someone 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.269
 try to enter our house or 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.820
 deal 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.270
 The first thing we need is a 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.340
 webcam I recommend high cameras 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.890
 definition since its components are of 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.840
 better quality this camera for example 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.210
 It has an automatic adjustment sensor 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.030
 brightness which allows us to use it 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.830
 both indoors and outdoors 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.380
 as well as in conditions of little 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.290
 light 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.620
 we now turn to the software in this case 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.780
 we use the program safe for cam a 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.090
 of the advantages of safe for cam is that 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.580
 it's a portable program that is not 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.640
 requires installation I can have it 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.370
 in this memory run it directly 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.140
 from the usb or through the cloud by 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.650
 means of google drive services 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.500
 one drive through the box and so on here 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.450
 we have the usb extender which we can 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.600
 use to increase the distance 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.910
 between the camera and the computer here 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.350
 we have a timer and I 'm going to 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.780
 explain later so that what 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.630
 I use and finally we would have the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.210
 computer 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.820
 you can use a laptop or 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.680
 old computer in this case I'm 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.680
 using a tablet with windows 8 and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.899
 it works really well well these are 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.689
 the components of our system of 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.990
 vigilance but remember one thing the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.299
 technology is not perfect so either 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.939
 with the cefor cam or with any other 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.399
 Traditional surveillance system fits 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.880
 ask yourself the following questions what 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.939
 happens if the energy goes away what happens if 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.319
 it falls on the internet what happens if the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.410
 thief takes our camera or 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.330
 computer 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.810
 well I will answer those questions 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.210
 using the safe for cam in the case of 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.800
 let the energy go because we are not going to 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.660
 have problems because if we have a 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.220
 portable these can work with 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.870
 battery just like the tablet 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.280
 for several hours in the case of the laptop 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.920
 you have to keep in mind that the screen 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.350
 it will be turned off and the use of the hard drive and 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.450
 of the processor will be minimal so 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.960
 we can have a range of two to 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.290
 three hours in the case of the tablet I've 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.000
 achieved autonomy from 9 to 10 hours only 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.050
 with battery and using the program 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.790
 safe for cam so in case of blackout or 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.360
 of absence of energy because we are not going to 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.220
 have problems 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.190
 what happens if the internet falls 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.520
 in the case of safe for can we have a 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.890
 auto connection system 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.420
 whereby if the internet goes down as 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.000
 the program is simply going to stay 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.940
 waiting until they have again 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.830
 signal or internet connection so 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.440
 we will not have problems in that either 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.860
 sense 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.860
 in some cases the internet does not fall 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.550
 but it gets slow or just does not 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.740
 it works there is when it enters our 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.010
 timer this is kind of 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.470
 switch which we can program what 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.060
 I do is connect the router to this 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.430
 timer and program that for example 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.820
 every day at 6 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.240
 Shut down and 6 and 1 minute and again 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:51.350
 ignite this is equivalent to turn on and off 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.540
 the router some times with turning on and 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.880
 turn off solves the problem of a 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.210
 internal slow of a sudden 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.220
 network maintenance etc then with 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.470
 just turn on and off is enough 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.690
 this timer is used more than 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.330
 everything when you are going to be many days 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.930
 It's always a good idea to go away from home 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.470
 have a plan b for the case of the fall 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.769
 of the internet signal now what happens 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.860
 if they take the computer or the usb 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.260
 where I have the images good does not happen 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.420
 nothing since safe for can makes a copy 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.250
 of the latest photos either in the 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.010
 hosting service or photos 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.620
 complete can be stored in 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.530
 the cloud through the services of 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.410
 google drive one drive dropbox and so on 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.170
 so neither the problem the thief 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.390
 you can take the computers but your 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.930
 image will remain in the cloud good and 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.400
 to finish a last recommendation 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.760
 when they acquire one of these systems 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.970
 of vigilance always look for 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.160
 functions allowing not prevent theft 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.130
 stay only with the transmission 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.710
 of images in real time because that's not 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.230
 It's enough 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.410
 in the case of the safe for cam we have 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.290
 functions like the sound effects that 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:16.100
 allow you to simulate movements in places 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:18.680
 uninhabited we have alarms by zones 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.560
 to know in which specific place 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.500
 suspicious movements are happening 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.650
 we have the ftp alarms that we can 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.010
 notify with voice sounds on cell phones 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.490
 tablets computers we have alarms 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:37.640
 Traditional email notices by the 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.520
 notices by phone call and many 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.270
 more options so what's important here 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.430
 is that you are notified before or 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.430
 while theft is being committed 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.820
 nothing serves to record how our 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.340
 house or our business if the camera or the 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.919
 program do not do anything about it 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.780
 that's why it's been everything I hope there's 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.930
 liked the video remember to give me 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:07.510
 like to subscribe to the channel and see you 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.510
 in a next opportunity chao
