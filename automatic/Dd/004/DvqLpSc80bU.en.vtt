00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.780
 to maintain them during a mask if 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.910
 the video interest I tell you to 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.260
 after 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.180
 so what do you do with this lotion? 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.560
 need different ingredients so the 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.570
 first is the complex dealings 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.640
 intense from amazon you can 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.830
 however replace those produced by 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.020
 urea that is easily found in 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.760
 pharmacy I then chose to put 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.530
 rice protein that you can 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.720
 also put silk proteins 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.890
 hydrolysed from asoma zone 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.380
 also so that this to allow so 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.089
 also to moisturize but also 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.430
 strengthen and protect fiber 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.860
 capillary 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.820
 then you will need honey which 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.530
 traditional honey class and dominate 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.530
 rattle we start right away 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.479
 so the first ingredient that 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.450
 complex temptation intense we go in 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.930
 put 7 sec belli for 250 milliliters 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.240
 of this pre-final which I have already pre 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.310
 measure the quantity needed 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.990
 so I poured it directly into my 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.450
 containers for rice proteins 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.630
 I decided to put four thousand 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.630
 liters 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.490
 the same I pour it into the container 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.420
 for honey 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.520
 so I 'm going to put a good one 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.520
 soup spoon 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.209
 and these two points m 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.100
 I add myself a little because 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.100
 that there remains the spoon 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.380
 well here I am going to put a little bit 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.500
 water 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:50.190
 but not too much to start a game but 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.190
 a crazy i go high school mons near 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.470
 place it's going to put a fact of 10 or 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.470
 light 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.300
 there I go again a little bit added 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.300
 water 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.459
 so there I ended almost 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.890
 the product so here we can stop there 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.530
 if you wish so we get at this 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.629
 stage there a moisturizing lotion for them 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.110
 hair for shocks are a little more 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.909
 dry 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.650
 we can add a last ingredient 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.230
 which is a vegetable oil 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.519
 so I chose coconut oil because 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.900
 that I like its effects on 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.310
 hair too because it's going to be 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.579
 a fragrance that will go well with the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.379
 honey 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.000
 so we did not have three 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.010
 tons otherwise it will attack anyway 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.190
 the hair there I 'll have you see of this 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.910
 ready it's suck of brooke has also been 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:03.150
 bought at amazon this is where I 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.930
 find but the ingredients and if I 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.500
 believe that's what they're from 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.829
 best quality 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:13.530
 here you see I have about one of 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.849
 their masters a third voila voila 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.260
 you do not see because that 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.519
 area but still has a slight 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.320
 small oil film 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.299
 so here is always well thought out 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.460
 mix produced before 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.229
 apply it so it's a notion that 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.990
 can apply in different 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.150
 ways the first use is going to be so 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.370
 every morning and every day 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.320
 evenings or two you apply it on your 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.500
 hair that valid the rehydrate good there 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.270
 I have a problem with the one- sided 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.400
 spriet and the second museum 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.930
 it's going to be in care so in fact before 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.940
 to make your products apply you this 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.099
 kind of product on your hair that's fine 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.410
 bring nourishing assets and 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.930
 moisturizer and then once your 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.410
 hair and its humidified you apply 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.970
 a bath of oil or butter early 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.070
 will allow to capture hydration 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.620
 opposite in the hair while he 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.180
 is going to feed the hair fiber 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.220
 so do not hesitate to do this 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.440
 lotion you give me your opinion if 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.230

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.730
