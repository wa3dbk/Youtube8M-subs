nutritional science so they started with
learning<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> science<00:01:14.189> behind<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.299> they

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
learning the science behind it and they

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.510 
learning the science behind it and they
learned<00:01:16.020> from<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> community<00:01:16.619> members<00:01:17.280> and

to<00:01:20.369> nutrition<00:01:20.939> science<00:01:21.420> into<00:01:22.140> practical

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
to nutrition science into practical

to nutrition science into practical
recommendations<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.119> public<00:01:24.479> we

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
recommendations for the public we

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.160 
recommendations for the public we
focused<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.920> making<00:01:26.490> recipes<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.570> were

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
focused on making recipes that were

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.340 
focused on making recipes that were
cheaper<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.490> still<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:30.030> healthy<00:01:30.479> as<00:01:30.689> organic

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
cheaper but still as healthy as organic

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.590 
cheaper but still as healthy as organic
meals<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.520> people<00:01:32.880> could<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.090> educated

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
meals so that people could be educated

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.050 
meals so that people could be educated
on<00:01:33.689> how<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.960> eat<00:01:34.170> healthy<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:34.890> still<00:01:35.340> keep<00:01:35.939> a

haven't had soda since I've seen that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.940 
haven't had soda since I've seen that
presentation<00:01:45.570> I've<00:01:45.990> actually<00:01:46.259> stuck<00:01:46.770> to
