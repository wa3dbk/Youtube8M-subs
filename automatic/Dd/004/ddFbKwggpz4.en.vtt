00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
or not I think has the most build to it

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.009 
or not I think has the most build to it
because<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.640> really<00:00:26.760> started<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
because it really started at the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320

Jose California and that's I think Del
Rio's<00:03:22.769> biggest<00:03:23.130> downfall<00:03:23.580> is<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.790> only

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
Rio's biggest downfall is that only

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.870 
Rio's biggest downfall is that only
certain<00:03:24.959> places<00:03:25.140> are<00:03:25.950> gonna<00:03:26.220> get<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.640> big

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
star power between the two is enough to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.840 
star power between the two is enough to

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
maybe headline not even headline semi

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.140 
maybe headline not even headline semi
headline<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:07.049> semi-main<00:04:07.470> event

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
headline the semi-main event

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.400

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
pay-per-view such as SummerSlam if

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.220 
pay-per-view such as SummerSlam if
you're<00:04:10.560> lucky<00:04:10.769> if<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.190> build<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.579> good<00:04:11.790> but

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
you're lucky if the build is good but

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.090 
you're lucky if the build is good but
maybe<00:04:13.230> in<00:04:13.799> Extreme<00:04:14.730> Rules<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.239> think<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.570> third

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
maybe in Extreme Rules I think a third

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.800 
maybe in Extreme Rules I think a third
when<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.190> call<00:04:17.340> it

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
when you call it

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.050 
when you call it
you<00:04:18.810> know<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:18.959> guess<00:04:19.200> top<00:04:19.739> four<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.370> then<00:04:20.850> you

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
you know I guess top four and then you

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.700 
you know I guess top four and then you
got<00:04:21.209> like<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.510> be<00:04:21.780> show<00:04:22.079> yeah<00:04:22.229> sure<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.530> gotta

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
got like a be show yeah sure you gotta

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.900 
got like a be show yeah sure you gotta
call<00:04:22.919> it<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.070> beach<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.460> was<00:04:23.520> gonna<00:04:23.729> say<00:04:23.849> see

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
call it the beach I was gonna say see

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.190 
call it the beach I was gonna say see
but<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.330> think<00:04:24.510> that's<00:04:24.660> pushing<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.169> little

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
but I think that's pushing it a little

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.220 
but I think that's pushing it a little
bit<00:04:25.970> but<00:04:26.970> something<00:04:27.240> like<00:04:27.360> in<00:04:27.479> Extreme<00:04:27.810> Rules

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
bit but something like in Extreme Rules

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.320 
bit but something like in Extreme Rules
would<00:04:28.350> be<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.560> good<00:04:29.190> place<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.520> put<00:04:29.850> that<00:04:30.030> but<00:04:30.270> I

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
would be a good place to put that but I

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
would be a good place to put that but I
do<00:04:30.390> not<00:04:30.600> feel<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:32.250> match<00:04:32.460> itself<00:04:33.350> is

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
do not feel that the match itself is

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.340 
do not feel that the match itself is
building<00:04:34.770> enough<00:04:35.360> anticipation<00:04:36.360> nor<00:04:36.840> is<00:04:37.140> it

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
building enough anticipation nor is it

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.880 
building enough anticipation nor is it
building<00:04:38.040> enough<00:04:38.370> superstar<00:04:38.880> quality<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:40.710> be

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
building enough superstar quality to be

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.940 
building enough superstar quality to be
on<00:04:41.070> WrestleMania<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.170> think<00:04:43.380> Zeb<00:04:43.560> Colter's

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
on WrestleMania and I think Zeb Colter's

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.410 
on WrestleMania and I think Zeb Colter's
doing<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.220> great<00:04:44.370> job<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:44.760> think<00:04:44.790> he's<00:04:45.120> really

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
doing a great job I think he's really

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.110 
doing a great job I think he's really
the<00:04:45.630> main<00:04:46.370> aspect<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.640> whole<00:04:47.790> feud<00:04:48.090> that's

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
the main aspect of the whole feud that's

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.850 
the main aspect of the whole feud that's
really<00:04:48.510> gonna<00:04:48.630> bring<00:04:49.350> it<00:04:49.530> all<00:04:49.620> together

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
really gonna bring it all together

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.360 
really gonna bring it all together

Undertaker<00:06:06.840> that<00:06:07.080> was<00:06:07.230> humongous<00:06:08.450> but<00:06:09.450> now

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
Undertaker that was humongous but now

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.600 
Undertaker that was humongous but now
you<00:06:09.810> compare<00:06:10.380> that<00:06:10.560> to<00:06:10.710> what<00:06:10.890> it<00:06:11.100> is<00:06:11.130> now<00:06:11.400> it's

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
you compare that to what it is now it's

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.300

a<00:06:11.760> big<00:06:11.970> pretty<00:06:12.270> big<00:06:12.480> turn<00:06:12.780> and<00:06:13.170> I<00:06:13.980> think<00:06:14.220> it

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
a big pretty big turn and I think it

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.590 
a big pretty big turn and I think it
really<00:06:14.430> affects<00:06:14.850> the<00:06:14.940> credibility<00:06:15.330> of<00:06:15.510> the

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
really affects the credibility of the

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.320 
really affects the credibility of the
belt<00:06:15.870> especially<00:06:16.470> being<00:06:16.620> put<00:06:16.800> on<00:06:16.890> first<00:06:17.330> but

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330
