00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
wii or more you can run into and you can

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.450 
wii or more you can run into and you can
fire<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.330> would<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.920> same<00:02:13.920> with<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.160> second

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
fire that would be same with the second

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.940 
fire that would be same with the second
player<00:02:14.610> except<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.270> second<00:02:15.600> player

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
which I'll get into later you can fire

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.320 
which I'll get into later you can fire
would<00:02:18.870> be<00:02:18.900> as<00:02:19.170> well<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.680> can<00:02:19.710> hold<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:23.610> g

pad up us to look down is to cancel that

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.820 
pad up us to look down is to cancel that
to<00:02:30.659> move<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> camera<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.349> use<00:02:31.470> left<00:02:31.739> and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
to move the camera and you use left and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.199 
to move the camera and you use left and
white<00:02:31.980> d-pad<00:02:32.400> age<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:33.150> jump<00:02:34.310> yeah<00:02:35.310> pause<00:02:35.700> is

white d-pad age to jump yeah pause is

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.530 
white d-pad age to jump yeah pause is
pretty<00:02:36.989> obvious<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.680> haven't<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.540> haven't

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
for this game super galaxy if you don't

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.930 
for this game super galaxy if you don't
know<00:03:13.470> by<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.680> name<00:03:13.920> already<00:03:14.099> it's<00:03:14.849> about

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
know by the name already it's about

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.180 
know by the name already it's about
galaxy<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.810> you're<00:03:16.290> going<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.560> be<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.709> space

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
galaxy and you're going to be in space

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.309 
galaxy and you're going to be in space
so<00:03:18.030> different<00:03:18.750> or<00:03:18.930> different<00:03:19.819> galaxy<00:03:20.819> types

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
so different or different galaxy types

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.270 
so different or different galaxy types
different<00:03:22.319> galaxies<00:03:22.890> different

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
different galaxies different

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.759 
different galaxies different
gravitational<00:03:24.150> pulls<00:03:24.629> different<00:03:25.530> everything

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
gravitational pulls different everything

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.830 
gravitational pulls different everything
and<00:03:26.069> if<00:03:26.579> you're<00:03:26.730> lucky<00:03:26.909> enough<00:03:27.090> again<00:03:27.569> small

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
and if you're lucky enough again small

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.509 
and if you're lucky enough again small
planet<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.290> can<00:03:28.440> actually<00:03:28.739> spin<00:03:28.950> around<00:03:29.099> it<00:03:29.459> a

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
planet you can actually spin around it a

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.399 
planet you can actually spin around it a
couple<00:03:29.700> times<00:03:29.849> before<00:03:30.239> actually<00:03:30.870> stopping

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
couple times before actually stopping

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:38.420 
couple times before actually stopping
and<00:03:31.769> that's<00:03:32.220> really<00:03:32.519> fun<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.970> do

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.910 

next<00:03:39.430> I'm<00:03:39.550> going<00:03:39.610> to<00:03:39.760> get<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.860> actually<00:03:41.860> the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
next I'm going to get to is actually the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.630 
next I'm going to get to is actually the
graphics<00:03:42.460> now<00:03:43.620> these<00:03:44.620> gain<00:03:44.950> if<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:45.370> can't

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
graphics now these gain if you can't

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.840 
graphics now these gain if you can't
tell<00:03:45.880> already<00:03:46.060> these<00:03:46.780> are<00:03:47.080> one<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.590> best

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
tell already these are one of the best

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.720 
tell already these are one of the best
graphical<00:03:49.380> games<00:03:50.380> on<00:03:50.560> wii<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:51.040> that's<00:03:51.430> just

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
graphical games on wii and that's just

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.060 
graphical games on wii and that's just
saying<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.390> it's<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:53.500> looks<00:03:53.530> beautiful

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
saying that it's it looks beautiful

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.730 
saying that it's it looks beautiful
there's<00:03:55.000> actually<00:03:55.570> later<00:03:55.810> on<00:03:56.020> you<00:03:56.260> see<00:03:56.410> abby

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
there's actually later on you see abby

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.460 
there's actually later on you see abby
and<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.400> actually<00:03:57.610> looks<00:03:58.000> like<00:03:58.270> fuzz<00:03:58.660> like

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
and it actually looks like fuzz like

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.250 
and it actually looks like fuzz like
hair<00:03:59.890> so<00:04:00.250> yeah<00:04:00.490> it<00:04:00.970> looks<00:04:01.390> amazing<00:04:01.630> like<00:04:01.990> that

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
hair so yeah it looks amazing like that

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.400 
hair so yeah it looks amazing like that
of<00:04:02.980> course<00:04:03.520> there's<00:04:03.820> probably<00:04:04.090> like<00:04:04.840> couple

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
of course there's probably like couple

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.740 
of course there's probably like couple
about<00:04:06.250> very<00:04:06.550> few<00:04:06.820> games<00:04:07.060> there<00:04:07.570> are<00:04:07.660> actually

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
about very few games there are actually

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.830 
about very few games there are actually
better<00:04:08.280> graphical<00:04:09.280> wise<00:04:09.760> than<00:04:10.150> this<00:04:10.360> game<00:04:10.630> and

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
better graphical wise than this game and

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.100 
better graphical wise than this game and
that's<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.620> lot<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:11.890> say<00:04:12.370> oh<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:13.630> should<00:04:13.930> mention

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
that's a lot to say oh I should mention

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.300 
that's a lot to say oh I should mention
one<00:04:14.350> more<00:04:14.380> thing<00:04:14.620> about<00:04:14.740> the<00:04:14.860> controls<00:04:15.130> if<00:04:15.220> you

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
one more thing about the controls if you

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.370 
one more thing about the controls if you
spin<00:04:15.700> that<00:04:16.359> if<00:04:16.540> you<00:04:16.660> shake<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:16.989> remote<00:04:17.260> you

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
spin that if you shake the remote you

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.530 
spin that if you shake the remote you
spin<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:17.799> that's<00:04:18.160> really<00:04:18.580> helpful<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.120> get<00:04:19.420> to

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
spin and that's really helpful to get to

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.910 
spin and that's really helpful to get to
plan<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.870> plan<00:04:20.049> it

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.490 

now<00:04:26.490> if<00:04:26.820> u<00:04:27.210> play<00:04:27.390> supermario<00:04:27.420> 64<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.380> will

now if u play supermario 64 you will

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.070 
now if u play supermario 64 you will
know<00:04:28.680> one<00:04:29.310> thing<00:04:29.610> that's<00:04:29.910> different<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.810> life

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080

you actually have less life me and me

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.100 
you actually have less life me and me
instead<00:04:34.290> of<00:04:34.410> having<00:04:34.530> eight<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:34.950> have<00:04:34.980> three

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
instead of having eight you have three

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.770 
instead of having eight you have three
but<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:37.710> but<00:04:38.130> that<00:04:38.190> being<00:04:38.550> said<00:04:38.640> that<00:04:39.180> the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
but that but that being said that the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.560 
but that but that being said that the
levels<00:04:40.110> are<00:04:40.230> you<00:04:40.290> shorter<00:04:41.240> actually<00:04:42.240> they're

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
levels are you shorter actually they're

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.640 
levels are you shorter actually they're
actually<00:04:42.600> pretty<00:04:43.110> decently<00:04:43.680> long<00:04:43.890> but<00:04:44.460> yeah

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
actually pretty decently long but yeah

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.500 
actually pretty decently long but yeah
now<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.710> level<00:04:47.130> design<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.640> this<00:04:47.790> there's<00:04:48.450> a

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
now the level design of this there's a

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.560 
now the level design of this there's a
lot<00:04:48.570> there's<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.080> hub<00:04:49.320> which<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:49.860> saw<00:04:50.040> earlier

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
lot there's a hub which you saw earlier

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.690 
lot there's a hub which you saw earlier
and<00:04:51.570> then<00:04:51.780> there's<00:04:52.130> galaxies<00:04:53.130> within<00:04:53.340> that

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
and then there's galaxies within that

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.210 
and then there's galaxies within that
like<00:04:54.600> within<00:04:54.840> special<00:04:55.440> little<00:04:55.650> sections

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
like within special little sections

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.400 
like within special little sections
which<00:04:56.850> have<00:04:57.030> different<00:04:57.360> stars<00:04:57.780> in<00:04:57.930> them<00:04:58.050> but

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
which have different stars in them but

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.440 
which have different stars in them but
there's<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.710> lot<00:04:58.920> of<00:04:58.950> them<00:04:59.220> personally<00:05:00.210> I<00:05:00.240> would

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
just because it's a game where you can

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.420 
just because it's a game where you can
actually<00:05:39.450> fall<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.170> because<00:05:40.890> it's<00:05:41.040> cropped

actually fall and because it's cropped
gravity<00:05:42.150> you<00:05:42.720> can't<00:05:42.990> fall<00:05:43.230> on<00:05:43.350> everything<00:05:43.800> for

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
gravity you can't fall on everything for

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.230 
gravity you can't fall on everything for
example<00:05:44.310> if<00:05:44.400> I<00:05:44.460> fall<00:05:44.670> right<00:05:44.820> now<00:05:44.940> I'm<00:05:45.120> gonna

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
example if I fall right now I'm gonna

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.420 
example if I fall right now I'm gonna
die<00:05:45.510> especially<00:05:46.470> if<00:05:46.740> I<00:05:46.770> fall<00:05:46.950> off<00:05:47.040> that<00:05:47.100> rope

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
die especially if I fall off that rope

00:05:47.430 --> 00:06:04.100 
die especially if I fall off that rope
pull<00:05:47.700> like<00:05:48.120> into<00:05:48.420> that<00:05:48.570> black<00:05:48.690> hole

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.760 

what<00:06:04.740> else<00:06:05.150> we<00:06:06.150> have<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.360> story<00:06:06.680> for<00:06:07.680> the

what else we have the story for the

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.390 
what else we have the story for the
story<00:06:08.100> it's<00:06:08.460> a<00:06:08.930> pretty<00:06:09.930> basic<00:06:10.220> dollars<00:06:11.220> to

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400

will<00:07:04.560> hope<00:07:04.740> the<00:07:04.949> hub<00:07:05.159> as<00:07:05.460> you<00:07:05.819> saw<00:07:05.969> earlier<00:07:06.150> get

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:06.569 
will hope the hub as you saw earlier get

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:08.420 
will hope the hub as you saw earlier get
brighter<00:07:07.020> which<00:07:07.319> starts<00:07:07.770> off<00:07:07.889> dark<00:07:08.189> and<00:07:08.400> you

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
brighter which starts off dark and you

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.390 
brighter which starts off dark and you
can<00:07:08.580> eventually<00:07:08.939> face<00:07:09.389> Bowser<00:07:09.689> and<00:07:10.189> he<00:07:11.189> faced

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
can eventually face Bowser and he faced

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.040 
can eventually face Bowser and he faced
Bowser<00:07:11.610> three<00:07:11.969> times<00:07:12.240> before<00:07:12.509> you<00:07:12.870> actually

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
Bowser three times before you actually

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.360 
Bowser three times before you actually
faced<00:07:13.409> them<00:07:13.620> the<00:07:13.770> last<00:07:13.949> time<00:07:16.009> I'm<00:07:17.009> not<00:07:17.039> telling

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.370

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:23.200 
faced them the last time I'm not telling
you<00:07:17.430> anything<00:07:17.610> else<00:07:17.879> after<00:07:18.150> that

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.030 

now

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.040 
now

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.190 
now
now<00:07:25.550> I<00:07:25.580> explain<00:07:26.030> everything<00:07:26.300> well<00:07:26.900> there's

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.200 
now I explain everything well there's

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.520 
now I explain everything well there's
pretty<00:07:27.470> much<00:07:27.560> too<00:07:28.490> much<00:07:28.700> to<00:07:28.940> explain<00:07:29.260> but<00:07:30.260> for

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:30.530 
pretty much too much to explain but for

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.290 
pretty much too much to explain but for
a<00:07:30.560> bird<00:07:30.830> well<00:07:31.250> actually<00:07:31.490> I<00:07:31.760> think<00:07:31.790> I<00:07:32.090> covered

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
a bird well actually I think I covered

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.890 
a bird well actually I think I covered
most<00:07:32.630> of<00:07:32.870> it<00:07:33.700> if<00:07:34.700> I<00:07:34.910> forgot<00:07:35.210> everything<00:07:35.480> it's

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900 
most of it if I forgot everything it's

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.300 
most of it if I forgot everything it's
probably<00:07:36.080> if<00:07:36.440> I<00:07:36.590> forgot<00:07:36.950> something<00:07:36.980> it's

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:37.310 
probably if I forgot something it's

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.270 
probably if I forgot something it's
probably<00:07:37.340> minor<00:07:37.850> but<00:07:38.510> yeah<00:07:39.350> i<00:07:39.380> love<00:07:39.890> this<00:07:40.130> game

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 
probably minor but yeah i love this game

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.220 
probably minor but yeah i love this game
now<00:07:40.910> i'm<00:07:41.420> actually<00:07:41.660> had<00:07:41.900> a<00:07:41.930> hard<00:07:42.170> time

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:42.230 
now i'm actually had a hard time

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.480 
now i'm actually had a hard time
thinking<00:07:42.560> if<00:07:42.860> i<00:07:42.920> was<00:07:43.040> going<00:07:43.130> to<00:07:43.190> give<00:07:43.310> it<00:07:43.340> a

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.490 
thinking if i was going to give it a

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.510 
thinking if i was going to give it a
night<00:07:43.730> like<00:07:44.000> a<00:07:44.210> 10<00:07:44.870> or<00:07:45.140> nine<00:07:45.530> point<00:07:45.860> eight<00:07:46.040> like

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 
night like a 10 or nine point eight like

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.890 
night like a 10 or nine point eight like
ever<00:07:46.700> something<00:07:47.030> like<00:07:47.150> that<00:07:47.300> night<00:07:47.570> when<00:07:47.720> five

ever something like that night when five

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.600 
ever something like that night when five

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.610
