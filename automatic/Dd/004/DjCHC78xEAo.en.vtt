00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
and I'm gonna try to relocate the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.400 
and I'm gonna try to relocate the
controller<00:00:33.809> down<00:00:34.079> into<00:00:34.350> here<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:36.140> also<00:00:37.140> get

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
controller down into here and I also get

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.830 
controller down into here and I also get
all<00:00:37.530> these<00:00:37.649> crazy<00:00:37.890> plans<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.760> add<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.329> key

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
all these crazy plans to add a key

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.119 
all these crazy plans to add a key
switch<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.559> rid<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> Anderson

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
switch and get rid of the Anderson

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.930 
switch and get rid of the Anderson
connectors<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:43.370> make<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.550> completely

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
connectors and make it completely

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.840 
connectors and make it completely
watertight<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.680> not<00:00:46.860> sure<00:00:47.070> how<00:00:47.219> far<00:00:47.460> into

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
watertight so I'm not sure how far into

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.549 
watertight so I'm not sure how far into
it<00:00:48.180> I'm<00:00:48.420> gonna<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.809> today<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.760> think<00:00:50.760> I'm

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
it I'm gonna get today but I think I'm

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.029 
it I'm gonna get today but I think I'm
gonna<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.770> ahead<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.090> cut<00:00:54.090> these<00:00:54.270> connections

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
gonna go ahead and cut these connections

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.470 
gonna go ahead and cut these connections
while<00:00:56.039> my<00:00:56.190> battery's<00:00:56.610> charged<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.239> just

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
while my battery's charged in here just

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.220 
while my battery's charged in here just
to<00:00:57.539> see<00:00:57.750> how<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> controller<00:00:58.289> fits<00:01:00.050> this<00:01:01.050> is

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
to see how the controller fits this is

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.070 
to see how the controller fits this is
Scott<00:01:01.530> signing<00:01:01.920> out<00:01:02.359> this<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.480> got<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> little

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
Scott signing out this is got a little

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600 
Scott signing out this is got a little
update<00:01:04.350> while<00:01:04.559> I'm<00:01:04.680> figuring<00:01:05.250> things<00:01:05.400> out

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
update while I'm figuring things out

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940 
update while I'm figuring things out
here<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.030> found<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> only<00:01:07.439> spot

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
here I found out this is the only spot

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.620 
here I found out this is the only spot
that<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.250> controller<00:01:08.640> fits<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.210> without<00:01:09.450> me

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
that the controller fits in without me

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.679 
that the controller fits in without me
having<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.960> modify<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:11.240> which<00:01:12.240> i<00:01:12.390> think<00:01:12.450> is

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
having to modify it which i think is

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.080 
having to modify it which i think is
fine<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.080> it'll<00:01:13.740> all<00:01:13.979> cover<00:01:14.369> back<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
fine because it'll all cover back up and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.320 
fine because it'll all cover back up and
it'll<00:01:15.960> alleviate<00:01:16.200> my<00:01:16.560> entire<00:01:16.799> problem<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> I'm

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it'll alleviate my entire problem so I'm

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.870 
it'll alleviate my entire problem so I'm
gonna<00:01:18.450> go<00:01:18.630> ahead<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.009> start<00:01:20.009> rewiring<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
gonna go ahead and start rewiring the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.490 
gonna go ahead and start rewiring the
whole<00:01:20.909> entire<00:01:21.330> thing<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.869> cut<00:01:22.170> down<00:01:22.200> my

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
whole entire thing I cut down my

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.890 
whole entire thing I cut down my
throttle<00:01:22.890> line<00:01:23.070> made<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:24.390> shorter

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
throttle line made a little bit shorter

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.249 
throttle line made a little bit shorter
and<00:01:25.439> when<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.040> took<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.369> slack<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.939> that

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
and when I took the slack out of that

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.649 
and when I took the slack out of that
I'm<00:01:28.259> going<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> use<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.130> slack<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.850> extend<00:01:30.329> my

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
I'm going to use that slack to extend my

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.560 
I'm going to use that slack to extend my
Hall<00:01:30.900> sensor<00:01:31.409> wires<00:01:31.650> from<00:01:32.040> my<00:01:32.250> hub<00:01:32.460> motor<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.509> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
Hall sensor wires from my hub motor so I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.280 
Hall sensor wires from my hub motor so I
could<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:33.930> over<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.619> terminate<00:01:35.340> him<00:01:36.290> so

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
could get over here and terminate him so

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.539 
could get over here and terminate him so
I'm<00:01:37.380> gonna<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.799> ahead<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.040> fire<00:01:38.400> up<00:01:38.520> my

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
I'm gonna go ahead and fire up my

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.090 
I'm gonna go ahead and fire up my
soldering<00:01:39.000> iron<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.680> start<00:01:40.680> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.950> town

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
soldering iron and start going to town

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.130 
soldering iron and start going to town
on<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> controller<00:01:41.640> wiring<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.210> also<00:01:45.110> have<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
on the controller wiring I also have a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.990 
on the controller wiring I also have a
20<00:01:46.500> amp<00:01:46.619> key<00:01:46.860> switch<00:01:47.189> here<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> took<00:01:47.729> out

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
20 amp key switch here that I took out

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.929 
20 amp key switch here that I took out
of<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.240> scooter<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.380> gutted<00:01:49.770> built<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.820> bike

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
of a scooter that I gutted built a bike

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.230 
of a scooter that I gutted built a bike
for<00:01:51.119> my<00:01:51.240> brother<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.880> seems<00:01:54.149> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
for my brother out of it but it seems to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.730 
for my brother out of it but it seems to
be<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.450> great<00:01:54.600> working<00:01:54.869> order<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.530> I'm<00:01:55.619> gonna

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
be in great working order so I'm gonna

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.289 
be in great working order so I'm gonna
try<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:55.979> implement<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.579> into<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> system

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
try to implement that into the system

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.880 
try to implement that into the system
somewhere<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:57.750> well<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.200> instead<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.740> having

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
somewhere as well so instead of having

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.429 
somewhere as well so instead of having
the<00:01:59.130> 50<00:01:59.399> amp<00:01:59.490> Anderson<00:01:59.969> Connect<00:02:00.270> there<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.600> can

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the 50 amp Anderson Connect there I can

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.050 
the 50 amp Anderson Connect there I can
use<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.460> key<00:02:02.759> switch<00:02:03.000> instead<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:04.790> also<00:02:05.790> have

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
use this key switch instead I also have

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.900 
use this key switch instead I also have
some<00:02:06.469> extra<00:02:07.469> wire<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:08.069> from

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
some extra wire here from

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
the connections back up I used solder

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.080 
the connections back up I used solder
this<00:02:42.270> time<00:02:42.540> instead<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.930> butt<00:02:43.230> splices<00:02:43.910> as<00:02:44.910> you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
this time instead of butt splices as you

this time instead of butt splices as you
can<00:02:45.210> see<00:02:45.390> I'm<00:02:45.510> charging<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.260> right<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.370> I

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
can see I'm charging it right now but I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.900 
can see I'm charging it right now but I
have<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> mess<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.390> zip<00:02:48.690> ties<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.730> fun<00:02:50.730> stuff

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
have a mess of zip ties and fun stuff

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.400 
have a mess of zip ties and fun stuff
everywhere<00:02:52.520> but<00:02:53.720> here's<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.780> good<00:02:54.900> shot<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.320> it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
everywhere but here's a good shot of it

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.640 
everywhere but here's a good shot of it
with<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.620> cover<00:02:55.800> off<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.960> how<00:02:57.960> everything<00:02:58.500> is

with the cover off and how everything is

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.300 
with the cover off and how everything is
mounted<00:02:59.070> now<00:03:00.350> none<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> controller<00:03:02.010> right

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
mounted now none of the controller right

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.480

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
ties holding it on as you can see I also

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.600 
ties holding it on as you can see I also
wired<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.300> key<00:03:09.600> switch<00:03:10.520> although<00:03:11.520> the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.310 
keys out of it right now and it's off
because<00:03:13.200> it's<00:03:13.560> charging<00:03:14.330> but<00:03:15.330> uh<00:03:15.390> all<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
because it's charging but uh all the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.170 
because it's charging but uh all the
connections<00:03:16.800> are<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.070> there<00:03:17.250> which<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.060> going

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
connections are in there which is going

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.380 
connections are in there which is going
to<00:03:18.240> be<00:03:18.360> covered<00:03:18.660> by<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.990> rubber<00:03:19.320> roof<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.610> it

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
to be covered by the rubber roof so it

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.310 
to be covered by the rubber roof so it
shouldn't<00:03:21.660> get<00:03:21.720> wet<00:03:21.870> anymore

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
shouldn't get wet anymore

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.220 
shouldn't get wet anymore
I<00:03:22.970> had<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.090> rewire<00:03:24.420> everything<00:03:24.900> over<00:03:25.110> here<00:03:25.140> too

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
I had to rewire everything over here too

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.510 
I had to rewire everything over here too
tucked<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.380> all<00:03:28.500> up<00:03:28.709> there<00:03:28.920> nice<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.370> neat

controller and uh as you can see here I

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.970 
controller and uh as you can see here I
added<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.569> key<00:04:04.840> switch<00:04:05.140> just<00:04:05.560> poked<00:04:05.830> through

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
added that key switch just poked through

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.490 
added that key switch just poked through
that<00:04:06.250> rubber<00:04:06.459> roofing<00:04:06.819> for<00:04:07.030> now<00:04:07.500> controllers

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
that rubber roofing for now controllers

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.830 
that rubber roofing for now controllers
right<00:04:08.680> up<00:04:08.830> there<00:04:09.010> now<00:04:09.220> all<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.300> wiring<00:04:10.540> is

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
right up there now all the wiring is

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.140 
right up there now all the wiring is
inside<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:13.620> no<00:04:14.620> longer<00:04:14.769> have<00:04:15.099> that<00:04:15.130> block<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:16.090> a

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
inside I no longer have that block of a

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.699 
inside I no longer have that block of a
controller<00:04:16.510> hanging<00:04:17.079> off<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.320> back<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:17.530> my

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
controller hanging off the back of my

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.240 
controller hanging off the back of my
seat<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.639> wiring<00:04:18.880> is<00:04:19.570> not<00:04:19.889> underneath<00:04:20.889> my

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
seat and the wiring is not underneath my

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.770 
seat and the wiring is not underneath my
hard<00:04:22.090> tail<00:04:22.330> anymore<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:25.060> it<00:04:25.360> looks<00:04:25.570> a<00:04:25.690> little

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
hard tail anymore so it looks a little

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.560 
hard tail anymore so it looks a little
cleaner<00:04:26.760> it's<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.820> little<00:04:28.060> more<00:04:28.210> watertight

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
cleaner it's a little more watertight

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.530 
cleaner it's a little more watertight
now<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.740> fixed<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.550> issue<00:04:30.639> of<00:04:31.090> not<00:04:31.270> being

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
now and I fixed the issue of not being
