does under the pressure gun when you're

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.889 
does under the pressure gun when you're
washing<00:01:04.540> it<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:06.450> that's<00:01:07.450> what<00:01:07.539> we<00:01:07.600> got<00:01:07.750> it

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
washing it and that's what we got it

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.420 
washing it and that's what we got it
dirty<00:01:08.580> giving<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.670> quick<00:01:09.789> walk-around

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.820

to make it bother myself as you can see
there<00:01:23.300> is<00:01:23.650> clumps<00:01:24.650> of<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.890> mug<00:01:25.040> I<00:01:28.420> have<00:01:29.420> out

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
there is clumps of the mug I have out

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.010 
there is clumps of the mug I have out
there<00:01:30.020> just<00:01:30.260> laying<00:01:30.470> on<00:01:30.680> there<00:01:31.930> we're<00:01:32.930> gonna

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
there just laying on there we're gonna

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.050 
there just laying on there we're gonna
put<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.320> nozzle<00:01:33.470> real<00:01:33.920> close<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.850> see

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
put the nozzle real close to it to see

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.050 
put the nozzle real close to it to see
if<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.780> just<00:01:35.930> removes<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.710> dirt<00:01:36.950> or<00:01:37.760> if<00:01:37.940> it

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
if it just removes the dirt or if it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.090 
if it just removes the dirt or if it
also<00:01:38.210> peels<00:01:38.630> away<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.080> plastic<00:01:39.260> it's<00:01:39.830> been<00:01:39.950> on

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
also peels away the plastic it's been on

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.920 
also peels away the plastic it's been on
for<00:01:40.370> about<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:41.360> whole<00:01:41.510> summer

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
for about the whole summer

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.900 
for about the whole summer
so<00:01:42.410> it's<00:01:42.590> definitely<00:01:42.740> handle<00:01:43.280> weld<00:01:43.460> under<00:01:43.760> the

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
so it's definitely handle weld under the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.330 
so it's definitely handle weld under the
under<00:01:44.150> degree<00:01:44.420> weather<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.930> here<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.010> Texas

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
under degree weather and here in Texas

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.390 
under degree weather and here in Texas
weather<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.240> it's<00:01:47.360> at<00:01:47.480> Andale<00:01:47.810> really<00:01:48.080> well<00:01:48.400> as

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
weather so it's at Andale really well as

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.010 
weather so it's at Andale really well as
you<00:01:49.610> can<00:01:49.790> see<00:01:49.970> we<00:01:50.150> even<00:01:50.300> swirled<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:50.960> around

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
you can see we even swirled it around

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.250 
you can see we even swirled it around
and<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:52.910> really<00:01:53.180> dug<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.570> into<00:01:53.750> them<00:01:53.990> two

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
and and just really dug it into them two

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.400 
and and just really dug it into them two
fibers<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.860> this<00:01:54.980> material<00:01:55.490> so<00:01:56.290> that's<00:01:57.290> what

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
fibers of this material so that's what

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.150 
fibers of this material so that's what
we're<00:01:57.530> gonna<00:01:57.620> do<00:01:57.830> next

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.440 

hope<00:02:01.160> this<00:02:01.340> clears<00:02:01.640> out<00:02:01.760> any<00:02:01.910> other<00:02:02.030> questions

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
that you had you know regards to how it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.100 
that you had you know regards to how it
handles<00:02:05.030> under<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.270> car<00:02:05.450> wash<00:02:05.660> how<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:05.900> do

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
handles under the car wash how you do

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.169 
handles under the car wash how you do
wash<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:06.620> you<00:02:07.190> know<00:02:07.310> what<00:02:07.490> do<00:02:07.580> you<00:02:07.610> do<00:02:07.850> is<00:02:08.060> there

wash it you know what do you do is there

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.960 
wash it you know what do you do is there
anything<00:02:08.360> new<00:02:08.899> anything<00:02:09.770> special<00:02:10.429> decrepit

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
anything new anything special decrepit

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.940 
anything new anything special decrepit
there's<00:02:11.150> all<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.600> same<00:02:11.810> if<00:02:12.320> anything<00:02:12.710> there's

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
there's all the same if anything there's

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.590 
there's all the same if anything there's
actually<00:02:13.310> no<00:02:13.460> drying<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:14.090> wouldn't<00:02:14.390> recommend

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
actually no drying I wouldn't recommend

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.380 
actually no drying I wouldn't recommend
putting<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:15.110> towel<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:16.210> material<00:02:17.210> because

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
putting a towel to this material because

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.360 
putting a towel to this material because
it<00:02:17.570> actually<00:02:17.900> doesn't<00:02:18.200> do<00:02:18.560> well<00:02:18.770> when<00:02:19.070> I<00:02:19.100> put<00:02:19.340> a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
it actually doesn't do well when I put a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.430 
it actually doesn't do well when I put a
towel<00:02:19.640> along<00:02:19.910> then<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.630> would<00:02:20.780> take<00:02:21.050> away<00:02:21.290> the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
towel along then it would take away the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.199 
towel along then it would take away the
fibers<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:21.920> actually<00:02:22.370> they'll<00:02:22.489> just<00:02:22.670> get

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
fibers and actually they'll just get

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.229 
fibers and actually they'll just get
stuck<00:02:23.450> on<00:02:23.630> there<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.950> don't<00:02:25.130> don't<00:02:25.550> our<00:02:25.880> dry<00:02:26.180> it

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
stuck on there so don't don't our dry it

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.720 
stuck on there so don't don't our dry it
just<00:02:26.900> let<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.140> air<00:02:27.290> dry<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.459> comes<00:02:28.610> out

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
just let it air dry and and it comes out

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.760 
just let it air dry and and it comes out
okay<00:02:29.500> got<00:02:30.500> it

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
okay got it

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.060 
okay got it
money<00:02:31.489> money<00:02:31.700> money<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.620> we're<00:02:33.620> gonna<00:02:33.680> see<00:02:33.980> if

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
money money money and we're gonna see if

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.860 
money money money and we're gonna see if
it<00:02:34.160> actually<00:02:34.250> removes<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:35.060> or<00:02:35.270> if<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.540> stains

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
it actually removes it or if it stains

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.750 
it actually removes it or if it stains
it<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.350> if<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.620> stays<00:02:36.830> there<00:02:37.070> I<00:02:37.250> have<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.610> peel

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
it and if it stays there I have to peel

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.890 
it and if it stays there I have to peel
it<00:02:37.820> all<00:02:38.150> off<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:39.470> then<00:02:39.650> go<00:02:39.739> back<00:02:39.950> lock<00:02:40.310> which

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
it all off and then go back lock which

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.720 
it all off and then go back lock which
either<00:02:41.900> way<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:42.830> don't<00:02:43.310> mind

we'll<00:07:03.060> do<00:07:03.180> a<00:07:03.210> quick<00:07:03.389> walkthrough<00:07:03.720> now<00:07:04.169> the<00:07:04.229> car

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
we'll do a quick walkthrough now the car

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.460 
we'll do a quick walkthrough now the car
is<00:07:04.790> definitely<00:07:05.790> much<00:07:06.000> cleaner<00:07:06.660> looking<00:07:07.080> as

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
is definitely much cleaner looking as

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.040 
is definitely much cleaner looking as
you<00:07:07.620> can<00:07:07.770> see<00:07:07.949> from<00:07:08.370> the<00:07:08.610> before<00:07:08.759> and<00:07:09.030> after<00:07:09.389> no

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
you can see from the before and after no

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.420 
you can see from the before and after no
tears<00:07:10.380> on<00:07:10.740> the<00:07:11.160> material<00:07:13.070> everything<00:07:14.070> looks
