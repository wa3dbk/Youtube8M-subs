your body or on your skin is reacting
with<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> metal<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.060> normally<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> metal

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
with the metal and normally the metal

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.929 
with the metal and normally the metal
that<00:01:37.470> causes<00:01:37.829> people<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> turn<00:01:38.430> green<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that causes people to turn green is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.210 
that causes people to turn green is
copper<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.079> believe<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.590> might<00:01:40.799> also<00:01:41.040> be

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
copper and I believe it might also be

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.210 
copper and I believe it might also be
nickel<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.180> exactly<00:01:42.509> sure<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.220> copper

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
nickel I'm not exactly sure but copper

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.580 
nickel I'm not exactly sure but copper
normally<00:01:44.850> oxidizes<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:45.990> copper<00:01:46.439> for

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
normally oxidizes if you have copper for

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.350 
normally oxidizes if you have copper for
Institute's<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.189> used<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:47.850> silver

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
Institute's this used to be all silver

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.090 
Institute's this used to be all silver
when<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.259> probably<00:01:49.500> can't<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.950> now<00:01:49.979> but

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
when you probably can't see it now but

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.850 
when you probably can't see it now but
now<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> coppery<00:01:51.630> color

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
now it's like you know a coppery color

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.580 
now it's like you know a coppery color
um<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.460> ring<00:01:54.000> really<00:01:54.509> turns<00:01:54.869> me<00:01:55.020> green<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
um this ring really turns me green and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.030 
um this ring really turns me green and
it<00:01:55.680> tarnishes<00:01:56.070> very<00:01:56.460> easily<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.810> um<00:01:58.380> for

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
it tarnishes very easily so um for

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.310 
it tarnishes very easily so um for
instance<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.790> form<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.390> sterling<00:02:00.840> silver

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
instance in the form of sterling silver

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.170 
instance in the form of sterling silver
I<00:02:01.530> guess<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.979> reason<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.369> even<00:02:02.790> sterling

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
I guess the reason that even sterling

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.600 
I guess the reason that even sterling
silver<00:02:03.600> will<00:02:03.810> do<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.619> Stroh

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
silver will do that is because Stroh

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.359 
silver will do that is because Stroh
silver<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.270> an<00:02:06.540> amalgamation<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:08.099> like

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
silver is an amalgamation of it's like

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.240 
silver is an amalgamation of it's like
an<00:02:08.489> alloy<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.259> scientifical<00:02:10.259> terms<00:02:10.530> sterling

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
an alloy so scientifical terms sterling

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.520 
an alloy so scientifical terms sterling
silver<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.970> itself<00:02:12.780> cannot

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
silver in itself cannot

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.010 
silver in itself cannot
be<00:02:13.620> found<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.100> periodic<00:02:14.520> table<00:02:14.870> there<00:02:15.870> are

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
be found on the periodic table there are

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.870 
be found on the periodic table there are
two<00:02:16.290> different<00:02:16.650> building<00:02:17.040> blocks<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.490> come

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
two different building blocks that come

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.360 
two different building blocks that come
together<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.450> make<00:02:18.840> sterling<00:02:19.290> silver<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.830> one

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
together to make sterling silver and one

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.220 
together to make sterling silver and one
of<00:02:20.520> those<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.670> copper<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.510> copper<00:02:21.990> in<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
of those is copper and the copper in the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.960 
of those is copper and the copper in the
sterling<00:02:22.560> silver<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.920> guess<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.430> what<00:02:23.459> reacts

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
sterling silver I guess is what reacts

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.510 
sterling silver I guess is what reacts
and<00:02:24.300> like<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.319> said<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.620> might<00:02:25.800> also<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.160> nickel

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
and like I said it might also be nickel

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.770 
and like I said it might also be nickel
it<00:02:26.640> might<00:02:26.850> also<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.270> couple<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.660> other

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
it might also be a couple of other

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.270 
it might also be a couple of other
things<00:02:28.080> but<00:02:28.319> even<00:02:28.590> if<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:28.830> expensive

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
things but even if it's expensive

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.340 
things but even if it's expensive
jewelry<00:02:29.880> such<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.270> pure<00:02:30.630> gold<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.050> pure

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
jewelry such as pure gold and pure

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.890 
jewelry such as pure gold and pure
silver<00:02:31.650> not<00:02:32.100> pure<00:02:32.400> but<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.700> 14<00:02:33.209> karat<00:02:33.720> or

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
silver not pure but like 14 karat or

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.550 
silver not pure but like 14 karat or
whatever<00:02:34.610> or<00:02:35.610> silver<00:02:36.420> or<00:02:36.630> whether<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.290> cheap

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
whatever or silver or whether it's cheap

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.470 
whatever or silver or whether it's cheap
costume<00:02:37.950> jewelry<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.459> can<00:02:38.790> turn<00:02:39.090> your<00:02:39.239> green

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
costume jewelry it can turn your green

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.300 
costume jewelry it can turn your green
depending<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:40.110> your<00:02:40.170> body's<00:02:40.470> acidity<00:02:40.980> level

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
depending on your body's acidity level

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.670 
depending on your body's acidity level
so<00:02:41.819> that's<00:02:41.970> why<00:02:42.239> we<00:02:42.270> can<00:02:42.630> turn<00:02:42.900> green<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.380> then

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
so that's why we can turn green and then

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.650 
so that's why we can turn green and then
what<00:02:44.010> can<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.220> do<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.370> prevent<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.420> could

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
what can you do to prevent it you could

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.420 
what can you do to prevent it you could
try<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.900> bunk<00:02:46.200> down<00:02:46.380> your<00:02:46.590> body's<00:02:46.920> acidity

lotions or creams or whatever but the
thing<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:56.010> found<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.489> works<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.940> best

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
thing that I found that works the best

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.210 
thing that I found that works the best
is<00:02:57.390> actually<00:02:57.810> using<00:02:57.959> clear<00:02:58.410> nail<00:02:58.590> polish<00:02:58.830> to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
is actually using clear nail polish to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.070 
is actually using clear nail polish to
