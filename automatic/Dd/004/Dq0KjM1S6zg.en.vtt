insecure<00:02:31.360> about<00:02:31.569> myself<00:02:31.840> it's<00:02:32.380> not<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.709> I'm

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769

interacting and activities that are less
combative<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.500> I've<00:02:44.620> started<00:02:44.880> reading

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
combative and so I've started reading

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.449 
combative and so I've started reading
more<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.349> crocheting<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:47.709> love<00:02:47.920> crocheting

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
but then my friend Alex started

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.930 
but then my friend Alex started
crocheting<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:50.860> she<00:02:51.130> was<00:02:51.250> crocheting<00:02:51.640> with

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
crocheting and she was crocheting with

crocheting and she was crocheting with
the<00:02:52.060> same<00:02:52.239> blanket<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.840> was<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.560> then<00:02:53.650> it

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
the same blanket that I was and then it

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.039 
the same blanket that I was and then it
became<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.069> race<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.670> even<00:02:55.239> then<00:02:55.450> it's<00:02:55.870> that

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
became a race and even then it's that

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.500
