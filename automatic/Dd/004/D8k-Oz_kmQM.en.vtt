00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.590
 Intends What mode 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.009
 This time as usual as Konkue 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:12.519
 that's right 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.519
 It can not be helped because there is no load long ssd 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.810
 Let's start 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.020
 Hehehe this screen Wow it's What 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.650
 You're in commander mode 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:34.320
 Since the commander mode is no Toka interesting scene 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.520
 Is better to go back quickly from a waste of good No I for the time being time even if the browser back 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.410
 OK 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.350
 Then I want to use a cruise missile 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:48.430
 If you don't take d and don't hesitate, can't you shoot unless you take a good base ? 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.260
 Well not a not a game After so probably what paddle also to shoot 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.620
 Oh yes 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.430
 I wonder if I can take it early 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.780
 First of all uav deployment 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.339
 It is useful to know the position of the enemy 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.580
 You should see a red dot on the map of the soldiers fighting with this 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:13.220
 Yasue it's important I Commander 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:18.619
 Yes, if you were in one team and not the other 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.770
 Not a team that would be quite disadvantageous, maybe cpu might be doing 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.390
 But it does not 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.719
 After that it is better to add 3 years old Lutheran 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.549
 Cruise missile on the top left 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.549
 I wonder where I should drop it 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:46.409
 Charlie I have come Wow full that over is stolen 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:51.610
 Then drop it around here or let it go into the roof because it's indoors. 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:55.220
 Ok i 'm ok because i 'll drop it out of the building 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:03.310
 Yoshi uav expansion 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:03.310
 Now that the missile will hit Do you see the image from the missile on the camera on the lower left now 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.810
 It is different that it is reflected now 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.810
 Sakuru 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.050
 Oh came XXX 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.350
 One person acceptable 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:29.019
 c is full of allies and defense seems to be possible 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.019
 It's also getting less 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:43.010
 I wonder if this style will attack the eco 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:43.670
 Coincidence with dropping supplies and uav &amp; infantry scan infantry scan I do not know luck 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.240
 but 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:53.650
 I think I will shoot enemy soldiers across the map 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:56.819
 That's more and more down shop team commander is not better 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.819
 I will fast forward 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.800
 Let's talk something 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.190
 Yeah 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:19.110
 Then let's have the front squad attack the echo 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.010
 Well I think everyone would do it without you saying 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.129
 That's right 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.129
 First of all , expand emp av called emp uav 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:36.970
 Then let's drop a missile into a grant, so the enemy is solid. 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.970
 It's what's pretty likely to come to Uma 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.750
 What does this mean yeah 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:49.740
 0 kills 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:52.230
 Gamba rate it's what's Minna Ganbare videos to useless anymore took over commander 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.160
 I had been tired 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:01.130
 It's not good if you drop a missile around here 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.130
 Oh yes that's right then 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.420
 Incidentally uav 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.220
 Elevation Multi-Kill 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.570
 Tteka not it is better to order music of av called missile 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.570
 It is so if it is said so 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:27.620
 The echo is not yet likely to be dropped 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.620
 The enemy commander also came out 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:42.370
 If Delta doesn't get back to the enemy's hand quickly 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:45.699
 The enemy is designated replacement as soon I ally's What 's coming shot missile 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.449
 OK I got it back 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.449
 I'll drive 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.310
 I'm about to be taken again 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.310
 You 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.689
 If you do it 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.349
 For the time being, it will be easier if only eco-auto is done 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.349
 That's right 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:18.159
 It was nice to say that 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:27.770
 The only remaining base is Foxtrot 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.770
 Large all sites ensure made paddle cable 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.129
 I'll support you with emp uav 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:40.630
 Don't feel like the other party has come out too few enemies 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.290
 After all Oh Possibly 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.670
 Alpha and Bravo are taken , what are you doing 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.380
 Totally disgusting 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:56.260
 I was crazy about foxtrot and did not notice it 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.260
 First of all, I have to give instructions to the squad leader who is nearby 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.850
 Dangerous yo g also it dangerous 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.850
 Oh it would flew missile 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.090
 Let's take a look at Celta around the Delta for the time being. 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.460
 I have to attack 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.080
 Hmm 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:19.439
 Oh yeah I should say 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:23.189
 Calm down'm going to click cool settle plain hot water guard only can I I I Lower 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:25.310
 Is it possible to prevent missiles with emp uav? 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:29.360
 Good deployment completion 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:32.980
 It seems that it exploded in the air that was just in time 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:38.400
 Whew Abu never been over over 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:41.750
 But a and b's firing you're still Zee is I have fallen into the hands of the enemy 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.750
 emp say av out kiter 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.979
 First of all, I have to regain Alpha and Bravo 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:11.280
 Launch missiles to Alpha that can not be recovered easily 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:16.409
 I hope I can clean it up 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.720
 Four days 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:23.270
 Well I can not beat it at all 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.220
 But I think the enemy has pulled a little 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.680
 I hope so 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.699
 Don't come the enemy's helicopter 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.699
 I annoying 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:39.920
 It's full of echoes and it's also likely to be taken away by the delta 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:43.560
 First of all, you have to launch missiles and do not disturb 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.889
 It is good to hit the missile of the present into a 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.060
 Yeah I thought too 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:51.510
 There is already 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.510
 You 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:08:02.319
 End 

00:07:55.449 --> 00:08:09.009
 I especially do not do anything our forces or not is overwhelming is you Yeah 

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:10.870
 Missile in a suitable place or was it so Thats was Do appropriate place to uav deployment 

00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:14.499
 I had to shoot 

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:15.440

00:08:14.499 --> 00:08:21.100
