padding so if you don't want to then you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.920 
padding so if you don't want to then you
can<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.619> basically<00:00:23.189> not<00:00:23.850> wear<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> bra<00:00:24.720> with

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
this because they already has like a

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.589 
this because they already has like a
built<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.279> bra<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.420> looks

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
built in bra so this is what it looks

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.210 
built in bra so this is what it looks
like<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.960> think<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.260> perfect<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:28.830> summer

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220

in my tops because most of the things

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.660 
in my tops because most of the things
from<00:03:22.450> GH<00:03:22.840> are<00:03:23.049> mostly<00:03:23.860> made<00:03:24.070> from<00:03:24.250> like<00:03:24.400> all

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
from GH are mostly made from like all

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.509 
from GH are mostly made from like all
women<00:03:25.120> trips<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.600> cotton<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.590> when<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.280> in

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
women trips and cotton so when it is in

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.970 
women trips and cotton so when it is in
the<00:03:27.940> wash<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.200> kind<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.230> shrinks<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.680> little<00:03:29.709> so

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
the wash it kind of shrinks a little so

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.920 
the wash it kind of shrinks a little so
this<00:03:30.130> would<00:03:30.310> be<00:03:30.850> like<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.030> small<00:03:31.420> when<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.750> gets

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
this would be like a small when it gets

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.690 
this would be like a small when it gets
shirts<00:03:32.200> up<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:32.769> just<00:03:32.980> needed<00:03:33.160> this<00:03:33.400> top
