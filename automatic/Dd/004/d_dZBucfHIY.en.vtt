so<00:00:16.070> we'll<00:00:17.070> just<00:00:17.220> take<00:00:17.430> bottom<00:00:17.880> normal<00:00:18.359> grip

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
so we'll just take bottom normal grip

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.779 
so we'll just take bottom normal grip
and<00:00:19.050> then<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.189> get<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.369> change

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789

used to one two one two
usually<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.240> all<00:00:30.330> my<00:00:30.480> students<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.140> takes

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
usually to all my students it takes

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.650 
usually to all my students it takes
maybe<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> few<00:00:32.550> minutes<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.030> then

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
maybe just like a few minutes and then

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.060 
maybe just like a few minutes and then
they<00:00:33.719> easily<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.380> perform<00:00:34.829> it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
they easily can perform it

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.450 
they easily can perform it
so<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.730> two<00:00:36.329> next<00:00:37.290> move<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.010> got<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
so one two next move you got to do a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.900 
so one two next move you got to do a
circle<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.520> change<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
circle like this and change it to the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.720 
circle like this and change it to the
normal<00:00:42.210> group<00:00:42.329> again<00:00:42.660> super<00:00:43.410> easy<00:00:43.469> okay<00:00:44.430> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
normal group again super easy okay and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700 
normal group again super easy okay and
here's<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.420> few<00:00:45.629> variations<00:00:45.840> soon<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.590> get

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
wrote a great one to n into the quarter

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.670 
wrote a great one to n into the quarter
back<00:01:02.010> okay<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> next<00:01:04.110> option<00:01:04.350> I'll

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
back okay here is the next option I'll

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.109 
back okay here is the next option I'll
show<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> two<00:01:05.220> different<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.880> think

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
show you two different and you think

show you two different and you think
which<00:01:06.240> are<00:01:06.420> way<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.750> nose<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.619> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
which are way like nose and if you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.520 
which are way like nose and if you
perform<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.340> n<00:01:08.520> bar<00:01:08.820> behind<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.330> bar<00:01:09.540> one

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
perform it with n bar behind a bar one

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.609 
perform it with n bar behind a bar one
two<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.790> change<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:15.240> two<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.229> get

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
two and change it so one two and get

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.980 
two and change it so one two and get
behind<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.040> hand<00:01:17.330> little<00:01:18.330> different<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
behind a hand little different that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.820 
behind a hand little different that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
troll drip and slide it back so here is

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.630 
troll drip and slide it back so here is
how<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.150> first<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.600> load<00:01:39.720> circle<00:01:40.650> break<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.549> up

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
how the first to load circle break it up

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.649 
how the first to load circle break it up
from<00:01:42.150> your<00:01:42.479> shoulder<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.860> slide<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.850> make
