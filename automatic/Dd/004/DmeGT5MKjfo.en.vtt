00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.120
 daley youtube galera 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.720
 Look, people here again to talk more. 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.830
 a little bit of gs 500 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:47.660
 today I want to talk about air mixing 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:51.200
 fuel that happens when you 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.710
 exchange some component probably or 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.159
 one with the exhaust tip or 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.370
 even a candle filter I believe 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.909
 not going to influence but these two 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.800
 previous filter exhaust items can 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.120
 influence the mixture 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.490
 okay and here comes the doubt because it happens to 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.220
 moto is popping up, it's cool, the bike 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.440
 pipoka leaves fire no, it's not 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.320
 it is normal to run out of fire through the exhaust 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.310
 not mention the fire is because there are some 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.520
 wrong thing 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.380
 a mixture rich but not rich mixture 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.920
 It's okay if you suddenly understood yourself. 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.230
 She's going to speed up the bike. 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.330
 she will have something wrong there 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.860
 Also the bike has to walk free has 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.260
 what to walk like it has to be 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.430
 What happens here below but it's mega 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.990
 hard to see 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.560
 oh my God, you have a screw 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.410
 here I hope you have seen 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.030
 this side and the other I do not 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.610
 ask for how regular 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:05.270
 difficult is there a tool that she 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.160
 has a fold 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.290
 so you put the tip here and it goes 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.780
 spinning and spinning is cool in the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.220
 In case I did not I read and did the mix 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.290
 At home, I got a little something. 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.750
 little one, look how crazy you do not 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.230
 to think that I'm crazy but I really am 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.300
 all zeroed screw to the end 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.890
 I got a specification of how many 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.800
 initial laps 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.520
 I got a dentist's mirror. 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.860
 I put it here and I counted the laps 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.650
 on one side and made the other result 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.010
 the economy did not pay for anyone to do 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.520
 the bike was good 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.920
 you have to start with three 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.830
 twists and turns 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.560
 and then you have to ride the motorcycle that 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.010
 Accelerates it chokes seabra a little bit 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.130
 and it closes and leaves it remembering 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.370
 in shades two sides have let try to come 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:10.150
 here we go 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:15.370
 Here the luan danada here is also the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.620
 boring the place is very annoying but if I 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.820
 able to adjust the bike was 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.750
 filet has stopped bursting and you realize 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.610
 that sometimes you accelerate and it ties 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.140
 then you're missing fuel you have 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.940
 to open a little and that's it 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.880
 I always came quick video just to 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.220
 talk some curiosities and some 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.470
 Let's just say what happened. 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.910
 with me in those five years of gs that I 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:50.380
 I wanted to share with you now the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.110
 next video let's talk about a two 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.380
 three things will talk about filter 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.000
 sports exhaust air exhaust and 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.430
 candles drives on 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.940
 Thanks guys had a hug until 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.940
 next christmas
