00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.700
 hello today we are going to change a bit the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.650
 thematic of violence of the previous 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 weeks for a beautiful game called 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.520
 never alone which in fact is based on 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.780
 a tribe that really exists in alaska 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.550
 but knowing that it is a game 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.759
 independent that is done in unit and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.590
 it's worth it to buy the story 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.960
 is inspired by a fable told by 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.730
 the tribe and newport control makes a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 brave girl called nuna who is 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.660
 he directs his people soon finds himself 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.190
 with a fox who helps him on his way 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.190
 and together they embark on a mystical journey 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.600
 by the frozen lands of alaska almost 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 The whole game consists of jumping 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.220
 platforms escape from some enemy and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.110
 solve some puzzles 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.490
 in each section of the game are shown 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.870
 small videos that explain the 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.910
 cultural content of what you're up to 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.040
 point of view is something like a brief 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.110
 explanation of the museum but it turns out to be 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.570
 much more entertaining to be able to play what 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.980
 you have just taught me in particular 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.450
 loved the explanation of why the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.030
 Eskimos always wear their hood 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.589
 when it leaves the aurora borealis 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.270
 graphics look pretty good to be 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.940
 a profit and munich and especially the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.440
 design of the spirits and the scenarios 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.150
 there are certain textures that are missing polish 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.470
 but the aesthetics of the world spends 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.930
 perfect with the message you want 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.390
 transmit the same goes for the sounds 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.190
 and music all this is combined to 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.540
 create one of the most entertaining ways 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.430
 and effective in telling a story 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.840
 so play it, only what you can do is 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.970
 exchange between the characters with 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.590
 triangle then the fox can jump 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.840
 higher but can not climb I know by the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.970
 ropes instead the girl in a yes 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.830
 you can climb up and down this platform 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.120
 but that platform is still very 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.010
 high then what I'm going to use is 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.960
 change the fox and now with only what 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.810
 can jump up to that platform and with 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.700
 weight with luck and lower the platform 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.590
 so that the girl reaches the other 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.270
 side the game is basically those 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.320
 situations where you have to do that 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.360
 the two people will come towards the 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.640
 another side is not complex but the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.180
 graphics and sounds and the music is 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.180
 super nice 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.920
 but due to the limitations of 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.210
 development team the game suffers from 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.520
 several flaws that make the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.690
 experience disappoints a little the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.009
 principal is that intelligence 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.640
 artificial of your partner is very 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.560
 irregular 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.060
 sometimes it's exasperating when the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.380
 computer is stopped when a 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.180
 projectile is about to fall on the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.430
 head making you recommend a 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.690
 section with again and again that's why 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.430
 I suggest that you play with someone 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.959
 more in a cooperative way to do that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.090
 the experience is a bit more bearable 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.630
 then there is the subject the precision of the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.310
 controls 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.590
 many times it seemed that the character did not 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.910
 I jumped when I wanted and control to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.920
 throwing projectiles sometimes felt 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.900
 like a lottery 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.370
 some puzzles are interesting 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.410
 but they usually vary between being 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.140
 extremely simple or unintuitive 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.480
 and finally I found many box 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.980
 of animation and physics some so serious 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.480
 that I had to restart a section 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.270
 whole because my character was 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.590
 stuck with no solution will only take them 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.959
 about four hours to finish the campaign 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.310
 which includes 24 collectible videos and 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.620
 after that there is almost no 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.900
 incentive to play again sounds 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.310
 that this is a terrible game but despite 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.590
 of all the failures that I have just 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.269
 mention the charm of the presentation 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.580
 and the meaning behind each element 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.200
 they make the value advisable 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.280
 that this title brings to the 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.840
 table makes it one of the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.600
 more innovative proposals that has been 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.519
 seen in years and the only wish is that 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.230
 this formula improves to be able to educate and 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.670
 generate interest much more 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.670
 effective using videogames 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.280
 black radon as a video game has a 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.690
 lots of things to improve but as 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.190
 a new form of storytelling I 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.660
 it seems an extraordinary example of what 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.460
 what can be done and at all times 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.290
 I was thinking about him but he has a 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.400
 lots of stories to tell and I do not know 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.260
 I think of a better way to 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.460
 transmit the new generations that 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.460
 with a video game like this
