take<00:00:35.220> a<00:00:35.250> look<00:00:35.430> around<00:00:41.510> here's<00:00:42.510> where<00:00:42.659> we<00:00:42.780> bring

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
take a look around here's where we bring

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.600 
take a look around here's where we bring
in<00:00:43.079> all<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> base<00:00:43.409> material<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.250> we

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
in all the base material and we

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.340 
in all the base material and we
basically<00:00:44.760> cut<00:00:45.269> out<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:45.839> shapes<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
basically cut out all the shapes of the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.680 
basically cut out all the shapes of the
boards<00:00:46.650> and<00:00:46.800> our<00:00:46.860> big<00:00:47.010> digress<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:47.699> it<00:00:48.570> also

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
boards and our big digress here it also

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.689 
boards and our big digress here it also
pops<00:00:49.050> out<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.680> beacon<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.339> see<00:00:50.519> on<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
pops out the beacon that you see on the

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.689 
pops out the beacon that you see on the
signal<00:00:51.089> bases<00:00:53.570> basically<00:00:54.570> assemble<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:56.550> base

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
signal bases basically assemble the base

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.759 
signal bases basically assemble the base
material<00:00:57.300> into<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> shape<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> board<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
material into the shape of the board and

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.810 
material into the shape of the board and
then<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.010> put<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.219> edges<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.760> over<00:01:00.179> here<00:01:01.820> here

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
then we put the edges on over here here

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.639 
then we put the edges on over here here
you<00:01:03.000> see<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.239> edges<00:01:03.690> being<00:01:04.019> put<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.440> board

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
you see the edges being put on the board

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.899 
you see the edges being put on the board
they're<00:01:05.399> all<00:01:05.580> glued<00:01:06.270> and

one of the most important aspects of a

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.230 
one of the most important aspects of a
board<00:01:59.560> like<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.890> lot<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.520> lot<00:02:00.759> of<00:02:00.880> factories

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
board like a lot of a lot of factories

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.870 
board like a lot of a lot of factories
overseas<00:02:01.530> use<00:02:02.530> really<00:02:02.770> inexpensive<00:02:03.490> resin

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
overseas use really inexpensive resin

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.600 
overseas use really inexpensive resin
that<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:05.320> not<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.590> good<00:02:05.800> thing<00:02:06.009> usually<00:02:06.310> when

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
that is not a good thing usually when

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.639 
that is not a good thing usually when
your<00:02:06.729> board<00:02:06.909> breaks<00:02:07.210> it's<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.780> it's<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.170> resin

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
your board breaks it's a it's the resin

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.469 
your board breaks it's a it's the resin
being<00:02:08.830> too<00:02:09.009> thin<00:02:09.250> in<00:02:09.280> one<00:02:09.550> place<00:02:09.819> it's<00:02:10.119> usually

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
being too thin in one place it's usually

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.290 
being too thin in one place it's usually
not<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:11.020> core<00:02:11.680> or<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.459> fiberglass<00:02:12.970> it's<00:02:13.209> the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
not the core or the fiberglass it's the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.060 
not the core or the fiberglass it's the
resin<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:13.870> really<00:02:14.470> important<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.010> use

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
resin so really important that you use

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.750 
resin so really important that you use

you<00:02:54.370> guys<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:55.030> core<00:02:55.360> shop<00:02:55.660> it's<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.350> really

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
you guys the core shop it's a really

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.070 
you guys the core shop it's a really
important<00:02:57.790> part<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.150> our<00:02:58.270> factory<00:02:58.840> we

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
important part of our factory we

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.210 
important part of our factory we
basically<00:03:00.570> we<00:03:01.570> profile<00:03:02.380> all<00:03:02.650> our<00:03:02.800> course<00:03:03.070> to

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
basically we profile all our course to

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.030 
basically we profile all our course to
face<00:03:03.400> every<00:03:04.240> size<00:03:04.570> board<00:03:05.020> we<00:03:05.200> make<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:05.710> with

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
face every size board we make so with

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.950 
face every size board we make so with
that<00:03:06.610> basically<00:03:06.970> means<00:03:07.240> we<00:03:07.390> don't<00:03:07.480> take<00:03:07.750> our

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
that basically means we don't take our

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.420 
that basically means we don't take our
course<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.380> just<00:03:08.650> shorten<00:03:09.040> them<00:03:09.190> for

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
course and just shorten them for

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.310 
course and just shorten them for
different<00:03:09.520> lengths<00:03:10.000> we<00:03:10.150> tailor<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.870> mouse<00:03:11.080> to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
different lengths we tailor a mouse to

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.810 
different lengths we tailor a mouse to

core depending on what size board you

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.910 
core depending on what size board you
ride<00:03:18.400> your<00:03:20.670> course

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.160 

they<00:03:25.490> go<00:03:25.640> on<00:03:25.670> that

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
they go on that

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.280 
they go on that
and<00:03:27.650> they<00:03:27.770> get<00:03:27.920> cut<00:03:28.130> out

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
and they get cut out

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.679 
and they get cut out
we<00:03:29.439> put<00:03:29.650> all<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.920> tip<00:03:30.069> and<00:03:30.250> tail<00:03:30.400> material<00:03:31.000> and

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
we put all the tip and tail material and

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.899 
we put all the tip and tail material and
the<00:03:31.810> sidewalls<00:03:32.319> on<00:03:32.560> here<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.609> then<00:03:33.670> they<00:03:33.879> go

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
the sidewalls on here and then they go

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.990 
the sidewalls on here and then they go
into

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
into

and when it's all done you'll have a
beautiful<00:03:42.980> Sierra<00:03:43.980> board<00:03:44.780> much<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.990> the

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
beautiful Sierra board much like the
