decided that I would run as a feral tank

of<00:00:33.450> seconds<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.309> tanking<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.760> rather<00:00:36.149> easy

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
of seconds and tanking was a rather easy

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.840 
of seconds and tanking was a rather easy
job<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.980> honest<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> monsters

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
job I have to be honest the monsters

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.600 
job I have to be honest the monsters
we're<00:00:39.120> rather<00:00:39.629> weak<00:00:40.129> avoiding<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> puddles

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
we're rather weak avoiding the puddles

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.760 
we're rather weak avoiding the puddles
on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.790> ground<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> relatively<00:00:43.020> easy<00:00:43.379> job

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
on the ground was a relatively easy job

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.130 
on the ground was a relatively easy job
I<00:00:43.800> mean<00:00:44.270> this<00:00:45.270> dungeon<00:00:45.600> shouldn't<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:45.960> too

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I mean this dungeon shouldn't be too

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.650 
I mean this dungeon shouldn't be too
hard<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.440> complete<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.160> first<00:00:48.090> boss<00:00:48.300> was

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
hard to complete and the first boss was

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.290 
hard to complete and the first boss was
really<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.800> easy<00:00:50.190> he<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.000> don't<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
really really easy he was I don't know I

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
really really easy he was I don't know I
thought<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:51.960> kind<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.350> joke<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:53.219> be

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
thought it was kind of a joke to be

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.119 
thought it was kind of a joke to be
honest<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.660> did<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> piece<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.770> loot

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
honest and we did get a piece of loot

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.430 
honest and we did get a piece of loot
from<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.520> boss<00:00:57.260> unfortunately<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
from that boss unfortunately the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.010 
from that boss unfortunately the
monsters<00:00:58.890> don't<00:00:59.100> drop<00:00:59.550> anything<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
monsters don't drop anything so you

completing<00:05:24.009> this<00:05:24.250> fight<00:05:24.490> there<00:05:24.849> was<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.030> piece

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
completing this fight there was a piece

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.930 
completing this fight there was a piece
of<00:05:25.509> plate<00:05:26.050> gear<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:26.830> dropped<00:05:27.130> yeah<00:05:27.909> I

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
of plate gear that dropped yeah I

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.480 
of plate gear that dropped yeah I
couldn't<00:05:28.539> wear<00:05:28.719> it<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:29.139> didn't<00:05:29.860> get<00:05:29.949> that<00:05:30.009> I<00:05:30.190> am

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
couldn't wear it I didn't get that I am

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.640 
couldn't wear it I didn't get that I am
because<00:05:30.880> I<00:05:31.060> know<00:05:31.120> yes<00:05:31.840> I<00:05:32.050> can<00:05:32.199> only<00:05:32.380> wear

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
because I know yes I can only wear

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.820 
because I know yes I can only wear
leather<00:05:32.880> unfortunately<00:05:33.880> and<00:05:34.349> that<00:05:35.349> that

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
leather unfortunately and that that

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.800 
leather unfortunately and that that
piece<00:05:36.070> of<00:05:36.099> gear<00:05:36.430> wasn't<00:05:37.000> used<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.360> think<00:05:37.389> by

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
piece of gear wasn't used I think by

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.740 
piece of gear wasn't used I think by
anyone<00:05:38.289> so<00:05:39.130> that<00:05:39.280> was<00:05:39.430> kind<00:05:39.610> of<00:05:39.669> sad<00:05:39.940> but<00:05:40.479> after

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
anyone so that was kind of sad but after

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.870 
anyone so that was kind of sad but after
doing<00:05:40.990> this<00:05:41.259> boss<00:05:41.530> fight<00:05:41.560> we<00:05:42.070> moved<00:05:42.340> on<00:05:42.550> and

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
doing this boss fight we moved on and

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.029 
doing this boss fight we moved on and
tried<00:05:43.389> to<00:05:43.509> do<00:05:43.599> the<00:05:43.810> second<00:05:44.380> boss<00:05:44.530> which<00:05:44.860> was

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
tried to do the second boss which was

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.700 
tried to do the second boss which was
kind<00:05:45.280> of<00:05:45.310> a<00:05:45.400> failure<00:05:45.820> because<00:05:46.030> for<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.349> second

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
kind of a failure because for the second

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.920 
kind of a failure because for the second
boss<00:05:47.919> fight<00:05:48.250> needed<00:05:48.759> a<00:05:48.880> lot<00:05:49.150> of<00:05:49.180> communication

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
boss fight needed a lot of communication

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.080 
boss fight needed a lot of communication

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
we're just testing stuff we're not

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.219 
we're just testing stuff we're not
really<00:06:11.159> committing<00:06:12.159> to<00:06:12.310> anything<00:06:12.580> right<00:06:13.270> but

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
really committing to anything right but

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.070 
really committing to anything right but
again<00:06:14.520> this<00:06:15.520> fight<00:06:15.789> was<00:06:16.240> pretty<00:06:16.479> easily<00:06:16.690> and

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
again this fight was pretty easily and

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.100 
again this fight was pretty easily and
after<00:06:17.979> doing<00:06:18.219> the<00:06:18.520> first<00:06:18.940> fight<00:06:19.210> we<00:06:19.719> moved<00:06:19.930> on

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
after doing the first fight we moved on

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.620 
after doing the first fight we moved on
to<00:06:20.500> a<00:06:20.530> couple<00:06:21.069> more<00:06:21.250> you<00:06:21.550> know<00:06:21.669> places<00:06:21.969> in<00:06:22.389> the

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
to a couple more you know places in the

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.750 
to a couple more you know places in the
dungeon

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
dungeon

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.270 
dungeon
and<00:06:23.880> again<00:06:24.330> the<00:06:24.690> groups<00:06:25.110> of<00:06:25.380> mobs<00:06:25.620> were<00:06:25.950> easy

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
and again the groups of mobs were easy

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.490 
and again the groups of mobs were easy
to<00:06:26.580> kill<00:06:26.760> you<00:06:27.570> shouldn't<00:06:27.840> have<00:06:27.960> any<00:06:27.990> problems

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
to kill you shouldn't have any problems

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.680 
to kill you shouldn't have any problems
killing<00:06:28.680> them<00:06:29.040> but<00:06:29.640> I<00:06:29.670> think<00:06:30.150> it<00:06:30.300> needs<00:06:30.330> some

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
killing them but I think it needs some

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.930 
killing them but I think it needs some
