00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
with that yet the polish team they were

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.690 
with that yet the polish team they were
a<00:03:28.079> tough<00:03:28.290> opposition<00:03:28.439> weren't<00:03:28.980> they<00:03:29.069> sure<00:03:29.669> oh

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700

tired but they play together all the

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.229 
tired but they play together all the
time<00:03:34.319> we<00:03:35.129> played<00:03:35.370> against<00:03:35.669> him<00:03:35.760> in<00:03:35.849> the<00:03:35.969> in<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
time we played against him in the in the

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.509

ehl<00:03:36.840> for<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.049> outdoor<00:03:37.319> as<00:03:37.439> well<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:38.250> we<00:03:38.370> knew

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
ehl for the outdoor as well so we knew

them<00:03:38.669> personally<00:03:38.959> but<00:03:39.959> there's<00:03:40.469> certainly<00:03:40.709> a

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
them personally but there's certainly a

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:41.869 
them personally but there's certainly a
very<00:03:40.919> good<00:03:41.129> team<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.519> think<00:03:41.760> we'll

very good team and I think we'll

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.250

probably come again if we're lucky
enough<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.680> get<00:03:43.769> through<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.129> final

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
enough to get through to the final

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.009 
enough to get through to the final
they'll<00:03:44.549> be<00:03:44.639> one<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:44.909> teams<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.180> will<00:03:45.900> be
