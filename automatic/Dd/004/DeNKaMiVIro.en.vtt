you<00:00:10.809> in<00:00:10.900> a<00:00:11.110> sec<00:00:11.290> here<00:00:11.469> but<00:00:11.590> I<00:00:11.620> want<00:00:11.800> to<00:00:11.860> explain

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
you in a sec here but I want to explain

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:13.560 
you in a sec here but I want to explain
something<00:00:12.429> first<00:00:12.849> off<00:00:13.000> this<00:00:13.090> video<00:00:13.269> was

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
something first off this video was

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.099 
something first off this video was
filmed<00:00:13.599> on<00:00:14.049> the<00:00:14.920> galaxy<00:00:15.549> note<00:00:15.969> of<00:00:16.359> your<00:00:16.840> first

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.109 
filmed on the galaxy note of your first

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.830 
filmed on the galaxy note of your first
one<00:00:17.289> and<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:18.670> a<00:00:18.760> phenomenal<00:00:19.330> device<00:00:19.570> I'm

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
one and it's a phenomenal device I'm

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.859 
one and it's a phenomenal device I'm
recording<00:00:20.350> at<00:00:20.619> 6<00:00:21.130> or<00:00:21.340> 480<00:00:21.760> instead<00:00:22.210> of<00:00:22.330> 720

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
recording at 6 or 480 instead of 720

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.529 
recording at 6 or 480 instead of 720
because<00:00:23.199> 720<00:00:23.710> takes<00:00:23.920> up<00:00:24.039> a<00:00:24.130> lot<00:00:24.279> of<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:25.510> know

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
because 720 takes up a lot of you know

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.380 
because 720 takes up a lot of you know
memory<00:00:25.930> and<00:00:26.170> this<00:00:26.920> also<00:00:27.220> does<00:00:27.369> 1080p<00:00:27.910> native

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
memory and this also does 1080p native

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.150 
memory and this also does 1080p native
which<00:00:28.750> is<00:00:28.900> fantastic<00:00:29.080> anyway<00:00:29.710> I'll<00:00:29.890> get<00:00:30.010> into

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
which is fantastic anyway I'll get into

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.230 
which is fantastic anyway I'll get into

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
with so you know those of the dongle and

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.900 
with so you know those of the dongle and
it<00:00:38.140> is<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.770> quite<00:00:39.040> a<00:00:39.070> few<00:00:39.280> other<00:00:39.399> features<00:00:39.579> but

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
basically a built-in lithium ion battery

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.760 
basically a built-in lithium ion battery
up<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.370> 12<00:00:42.579> hours<00:00:42.940> of<00:00:43.110> player<00:00:44.110> on<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.410> single

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
up to 12 hours of player on a single

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.440 
up to 12 hours of player on a single
charge<00:00:44.890> USB<00:00:45.430> dongle<00:00:45.579> like<00:00:45.850> I<00:00:45.879> said<00:00:46.030> up<00:00:46.149> to<00:00:46.270> 2

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
charge USB dongle like I said up to 2

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.389 
charge USB dongle like I said up to 2
you<00:00:46.780> additional<00:00:47.260> USB<00:00:47.500> so<00:00:47.739> it<00:00:47.829> basically<00:00:48.100> it's

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
you additional USB so it basically it's

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.610 
you additional USB so it basically it's
a<00:00:48.489> hub<00:00:48.670> essentially<00:00:49.360> built<00:00:50.020> in<00:00:50.140> QWERTY<00:00:50.440> keypad

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620

whatever the hell six axis that's all
just<00:01:04.900> getting<00:01:05.110> right<00:01:05.260> in<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.439> video<00:01:05.560> so<00:01:06.010> it

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
just getting right in the video so it

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.700 
just getting right in the video so it
feels<00:01:06.220> very<00:01:06.340> tactile<00:01:07.150> I<00:01:07.420> like<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.320> features

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
feels very tactile I like the features

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.030 
feels very tactile I like the features
of<00:01:08.799> it<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.400> is<00:01:09.729> plastic<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.710> well<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.740> don't

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
feels and like I said they're great but

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.490 
feels and like I said they're great but
the<00:01:46.390> reason<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.659> real<00:01:46.810> reason<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.259> picked<00:01:47.380> this

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
the reason I real reason I picked this

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.319 
the reason I real reason I picked this
up<00:01:47.649> though<00:01:47.829> is<00:01:47.979> because<00:01:48.220> it's<00:01:48.729> a<00:01:48.759> cheap<00:01:48.970> ps3

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
up though is because it's a cheap ps3

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.179 
up though is because it's a cheap ps3
controller<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:50.530> everything<00:01:50.799> works<00:01:50.950> great

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
controller and everything works great

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.319

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
if you're in for great controller and

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.069 
if you're in for great controller and

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
reason because it is bluetooth

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.240

I<00:03:03.250> don't<00:03:03.819> know<00:03:03.879> 2.4<00:03:04.510> gigahertz<00:03:05.250> you'll

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
I don't know 2.4 gigahertz you'll

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.860 
I don't know 2.4 gigahertz you'll
definitely<00:03:06.790> want<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.000> pick<00:03:07.120> this<00:03:07.269> up<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.690> would

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
definitely want to pick this up I would

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.990 
definitely want to pick this up I would
do<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:08.049> in<00:03:08.200> 720<00:03:08.680> but<00:03:08.799> like<00:03:09.099> 6<00:03:09.340> 720<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:09.760> really

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
do this in 720 but like 6 720 is really

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.479 
do this in 720 but like 6 720 is really
a<00:03:10.180> lot<00:03:10.659> more<00:03:10.690> memory<00:03:11.290> intensive<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:12.250> it's

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
a lot more memory intensive and it's

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.280 
a lot more memory intensive and it's
harder<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.000> it's<00:03:13.390> longer<00:03:13.659> than<00:03:13.780> upload<00:03:14.140> on<00:03:14.260> my

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
harder to it's longer than upload on my

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.099 
harder to it's longer than upload on my
speed<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:15.190> that's<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.519> I<00:03:15.900> definitely<00:03:16.900> give<00:03:17.079> us

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
speed so that's it I definitely give us

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.490 
speed so that's it I definitely give us
a<00:03:17.370> 4.9<00:03:18.370> out<00:03:18.639> of<00:03:18.760> 5<00:03:18.970> because<00:03:19.269> it's<00:03:19.599> I<00:03:19.959> have<00:03:20.470> a

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
a 4.9 out of 5 because it's I have a

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.710 
a 4.9 out of 5 because it's I have a
couple<00:03:20.919> minor<00:03:21.639> issues<00:03:22.000> with<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.329> like<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.480> said

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
couple minor issues with it like I said

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.930
