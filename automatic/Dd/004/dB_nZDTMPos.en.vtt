 the busy actually appears the crossing of the desert was done in 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.060
 the pain of the private problems and a tennis that abandons you friends 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.400
 who are going elsewhere and we have to rebuild everything but 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.420
 champion thierry it is necessary to remain vigilant because at any time by tf1 the 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.420
 events come to light in the open, regardless of the surface 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.999
 it's free and it sucks 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.599
 come because you have not emerged yet 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.499
 titled renewable energy be the good there without hitting it but at 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.499
 the less we can already put in place 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.820
 a necessity 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820
 it's not nice of you 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.030
 bad it's really not his thing 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.970
 right from the kickoff in the duels I do not have much intensity in the 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.970
 legs inevitably you can not develop in France 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.950
 will we stop being afraid 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.580
 she wanted to hit him 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.140
 puppet for the best 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.140
 during that time 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.610
 there are landscapes page main page 6 years old and 162 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.810
 on this game back to training he worked a little bit this 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.320
 winter 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.320
 because it was two years old at first it's a bit that shot 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.370
 I learn every day when we were younger several times 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.040
 it's true I'm going for 100 m I'm going to cut myself a little bit because you wanted to play 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.090
 basketball after a workout all that 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.970
 moved did not understand it and was I did it yesterday at that time but 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.570
 it's true that I did not understand 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.620
 the fact that he played basketball and that in a warehouse in a warehouse in 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.500
 tennis to subscribers not as much as I would have hoped 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.190
 and that after continues and basketball was completely lacking 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.040
 romp 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.400
 he wanted to jump everywhere isonat background 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.620
 it's like that I'm not going I did not actually read that because otherwise rock 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.690
 if the thought of joy of life 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.210
 who breathe sweat at home 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.210
 it becomes and becomes automata and narrow as possible 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.309
 it was my son had never won the least
