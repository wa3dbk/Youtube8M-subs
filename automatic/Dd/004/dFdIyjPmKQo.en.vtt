00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.110
 full of peace of friendship love that is 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.710
 what we need companionship 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.940
 cooperation among us all human 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.250
 as the state well they return the world 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.500
 you know that neighbors please already 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.110
 celebrating the holidays of the year 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.870
 new and that's why cleaning in one place 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.460
 where we honey size and everything 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.710
 that is cleaning the so that it does not 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.770
 let's leave for the jewelers in the cleanings 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.840
 we also communicate hell must 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.270
 igor make a plan where it took 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 to your criteria 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.540
 the diagram we are taught to have a 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.350
 bed appointment and one from a slight I hope 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.120
 that they learn to see your sheet of paper and 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.339
 here I am usually with a phone 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.560
 of sign may fail you this year and if 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.650
 they failed they were a realizing home 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.200
 I more awake with you not 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.050
 they tarnished that we 're going to see the sheet 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.270
 of paper let's form let's see the 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.640
 corner of the sheet to be a square 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.659
 good customer 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.900
 we fold the corner of the paper 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.730
 well more clearly to make a square 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.840
 the leftover shore is the one we are going to fly 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.840
 backward 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.320
 but as I already have practice then what 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.930
 Let's do with fingernails with fingers 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.930
 We crossed the left bank with the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.050
 hands grabbed practice to cut the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.020
 miren paper 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.150
 we already form the square since we have 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.520
 the square we are going to fold no longer 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.380
 we talk about that corners we're going to bend 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.810
 the other corner corner 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.880
 without that simple line in the bed appointment or 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.500
 the sweetie box I do not know how you guys 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.509
 want to call 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.530
 now since we doubled from corner to 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.300
 corner of the other side let's double by 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.800
 half 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.800
 in the opposite direction 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.050
 of the program if we go for the other 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.050
 half 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.300
 if it's fine that doubling in concession 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.110
 against him alone they form doubles 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:41.260
 now let's double it 's soloists that 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.260
 They end in little pits on both sides 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.080
 we turn the other side and do what 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.270
 same 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.520
 I hope you have not taught them the same 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.520
 figure today but if you already are 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.360
 have taught how they talk about me 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.510
 cachita villegas point as if taking for 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.100
 a facebook carita villegas inspire you 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.780
 the figure you want if it does not make you 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.570
 do they know how I do it but I know 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.640
 I teach them we are going to since it is that way 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.550
 from all sides we turn to the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.480
 other side and we're going to open it to it 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.819
 way 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.620
 write me neighbor because I want you 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.020
 tell me that without group averages that 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.480
 they even want me to resist them 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.870
 and there it is going well for them today 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.380
 to teach them with a lot of love since 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.600
 we fold sides we are going to sell this side 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.150
 from another side we opened like they were 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.150
 the figures here inside and here they are 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.660
 ready let's fold on the edges to 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.660
 the other side 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.840
 we turn to the other side 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.840
 and we do the same 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.230
 A) Yes 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.090
 and that we double all the piquitos now 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.290
 let's fly each little bird to its 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.570
 respective place my side and side these 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.980
 four goals since we doubled this not what 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.080
 let's open on the sides 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.080
 and we talked it two little ones 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.760
 since we have the figure so now we're going 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.439
 to open here 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.439
 we shape the box 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.199
 if it's for a child's party and it's 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.479
 a light basket now you have to 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:28.270
 a girl let's make the living room home 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:31.330
 let's work the excess tape 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.500
 and we open and fold the edges towards 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.350
 in 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.320
 we doubled in half 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.800
 with glue we already stick here 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.340
 and in the box the light basket that 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.070
 it seems like little friends 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.169
 say we can call non-autistic car 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.169
 If it's a girl , we'll give it a charge 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:01.729
 and if the child sweeters the law I hope that 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.540
 they have not learned anything they do not know 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:08.810
 how I eggs, I want them again 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.000
 Many congratulations that all this world 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.610
 is going for peace and love and bunks 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.160
 let's love each other more than before 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.870
 They are more united than ever to see 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.580
 I do not know if I'm late of all 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.380
 I repeat these actions again I say 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.720
 that we are going to be with the 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.630
 sports you have to take them as a muleÃ±o 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.180
 with a surname with everyone world with a 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.620
 to sell because we all need 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.290
 let's make a better world let's go the 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.530
