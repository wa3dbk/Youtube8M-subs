all<00:00:04.350> right<00:00:04.500> so<00:00:05.240> um<00:00:06.950> we're<00:00:07.950> gonna<00:00:08.099> play<00:00:08.309> first

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
all right so um we're gonna play first

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.299 
all right so um we're gonna play first
this<00:00:09.389> time<00:00:09.530> that's<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> reasonable

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
this time that's this is a reasonable

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:47.840 
this time that's this is a reasonable
hand

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.549 

we're<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> go<00:00:48.719> ahead<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.079> contingent

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
we're going to go ahead and contingent

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.069 
we're going to go ahead and contingent
class<00:00:49.769> that<00:00:50.010> before<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.460> play<00:00:50.699> a<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.690> toughness

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
class that before we play a to toughness

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:02.569 
class that before we play a to toughness
guy

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.719 

no<00:01:03.239> need<00:01:03.749> I<00:01:04.189> mean<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.280> gonna<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.580> die

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
no need I mean it's gonna have to die

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.320 
no need I mean it's gonna have to die
eventually<00:01:07.670> most<00:01:08.670> likely

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.150 

so<00:01:12.960> I'd<00:01:13.050> rather<00:01:13.230> not<00:01:13.440> take<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.830> something

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
so I'd rather not take out something

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.649 
so I'd rather not take out something
else<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.520> mine

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.230 

we've<00:01:20.350> got<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.560> much<00:01:21.369> more<00:01:21.520> reasonable<00:01:21.729> curve

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
we've got a much more reasonable curve

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:35.460 
we've got a much more reasonable curve
this<00:01:22.689> game

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.480 

hmm

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.570 

alright

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.390 

might<00:01:47.540> be<00:01:47.690> in<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.900> bit<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.590> racing<00:01:48.980> situation

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
might be in a bit of a racing situation

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.100 
might be in a bit of a racing situation
I<00:01:49.430> think<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.730> we've<00:01:49.970> got<00:01:50.150> a<00:01:50.180> pretty

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
I think that we've got a pretty

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.840 
I think that we've got a pretty
reasonable<00:01:51.260> chance<00:01:51.620> of<00:01:51.830> racing<00:01:52.220> with<00:01:52.610> this

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
reasonable chance of racing with this

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:05.530 
reasonable chance of racing with this
flame<00:01:53.210> fiend<00:01:54.220> coming<00:01:55.220> up<00:01:57.400> chatter

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.350 

x1<00:02:06.670> he's<00:02:07.670> going<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:07.940> going<00:02:08.479> straight

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.680 

for<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.050> aggressiveness

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:27.920 

and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.190 

No

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.670 

mmm

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.790 

now<00:02:37.680> if<00:02:38.069> i<00:02:38.250> drop<00:02:38.490> flame<00:02:38.910> Fein<00:02:39.210> here<00:02:39.800> what

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
now if i drop flame Fein here what

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.970 
now if i drop flame Fein here what
happens

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.100 

he<00:02:47.550> may<00:02:48.390> be<00:02:48.420> leaves<00:02:48.750> back<00:02:48.959> as<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> courier<00:02:50.750> 10

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.690 

i<00:02:54.170> wish<00:02:55.040> i<00:02:55.130> had<00:02:55.280> another<00:02:55.490> play

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:24.080 

but<00:02:59.270> I<00:02:59.300> do<00:02:59.390> not

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.410 

problems<00:03:24.870> now<00:03:25.080> is<00:03:25.290> he<00:03:25.700> drops<00:03:26.700> like<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.000> drops

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
problems now is he drops like a drops

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.759 
problems now is he drops like a drops
lend<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:28.050> drop<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:28.819> def<00:03:29.819> mantle<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.590> if<00:03:31.590> we

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
lend to drop you can def mantle it if we

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.080 
lend to drop you can def mantle it if we
kill<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.849> can<00:03:33.860> force<00:03:34.860> us<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.069> play<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.940> play

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
kill it you can force us to play to play

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.180 
kill it you can force us to play to play
something<00:03:36.420> out<00:03:36.540> here<00:03:36.920> this<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.069> actually

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
something out here this is actually

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.470 
something out here this is actually
reasonable

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:55.500 

as<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.599> replacement<00:03:44.500> for<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:44.920> flame<00:03:45.159> fiend

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:04.080 

let's<00:03:56.140> see<00:03:56.290> here<00:03:56.470> now<00:03:56.650> if<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.400> flame<00:03:57.970> fiend

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.750 

I<00:04:04.180> slim<00:04:04.989> seen<00:04:05.230> now<00:04:05.500> I'm<00:04:05.800> doing<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.430> all<00:04:06.550> to<00:04:06.670> his

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
I slim seen now I'm doing it all to his

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:20.530 
I slim seen now I'm doing it all to his
face<00:04:06.940> is<00:04:07.150> eight<00:04:08.190> if<00:04:09.190> he<00:04:09.310> attacks<00:04:10.379> and

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.130 

trying<00:04:21.350> to<00:04:21.440> see<00:04:21.760> how<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.790> could<00:04:22.970> possibly<00:04:23.600> kill

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
trying to see how I could possibly kill

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.750 
trying to see how I could possibly kill
them<00:04:24.320> next<00:04:24.650> turn<00:04:24.800> if<00:04:25.130> he<00:04:25.280> doesn't<00:04:25.580> drop

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
them next turn if he doesn't drop

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.880 
them next turn if he doesn't drop
something<00:04:26.060> I<00:04:26.420> think<00:04:27.230> I'm<00:04:27.290> just<00:04:27.320> going<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.650> drop

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
something I think I'm just going to drop

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.839 
something I think I'm just going to drop
the<00:04:28.100> flame<00:04:28.310> fiend<00:04:28.610> not<00:04:29.330> ideal

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.869 

but<00:04:34.599> I<00:04:34.629> got<00:04:34.779> to<00:04:34.809> give<00:04:34.959> myself<00:04:35.110> away<00:04:35.439> a<00:04:35.860> way<00:04:36.819> to

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:36.879 
but I got to give myself away a way to

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:42.959 
but I got to give myself away a way to
win<00:04:37.089> next<00:04:37.300> turn<00:04:40.830> or<00:04:41.830> at<00:04:42.279> least<00:04:42.339> force<00:04:42.669> him<00:04:42.849> to

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:42.969 
win next turn or at least force him to

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.769 
win next turn or at least force him to
drop<00:04:43.599> something<00:04:43.779> else<00:04:44.729> okay<00:04:45.729> actually<00:04:46.449> once

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:46.779 
drop something else okay actually once

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:48.929 
drop something else okay actually once
once<00:04:47.080> my<00:04:47.199> flame<00:04:47.409> scenes<00:04:47.649> out<00:04:47.939> dropping

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
once my flame scenes out dropping

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:53.359 
once my flame scenes out dropping
something<00:04:49.209> else<00:04:49.449> isn't<00:04:49.629> as<00:04:49.929> good<00:04:50.999> but<00:04:51.999> I<00:04:52.179> think

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:53.369 
something else isn't as good but I think

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:57.119 
something else isn't as good but I think
this<00:04:54.369> way<00:04:55.259> he<00:04:56.259> doesn't<00:04:56.559> know<00:04:56.709> that<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.949> can

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129 
this way he doesn't know that I can

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:02.029 
this way he doesn't know that I can
block<00:04:57.429> the<00:04:57.699> courrier<00:04:58.270> once<00:04:58.509> potentially

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.659 

because<00:05:03.039> he<00:05:03.879> might<00:05:03.999> just<00:05:04.240> go<00:05:04.389> for<00:05:04.599> it<00:05:05.669> assuming

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
because he might just go for it assuming

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.139 
because he might just go for it assuming
he<00:05:07.379> he<00:05:08.379> wins<00:05:08.589> next<00:05:08.800> turn<00:05:09.069> if<00:05:09.219> I<00:05:09.309> can't<00:05:09.490> kill<00:05:09.699> and

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:10.149 
he he wins next turn if I can't kill and

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:15.910 
he he wins next turn if I can't kill and
I'm<00:05:10.240> down<00:05:10.389> to<00:05:10.539> one<00:05:10.569> card<00:05:12.419> see

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:29.220 

oh<00:05:16.840> ah<00:05:18.820> my<00:05:19.820> turn

okay back so we need to draw an artifact

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:50.740 
okay back so we need to draw an artifact
that<00:05:35.890> was<00:05:36.150> pretty<00:05:37.150> brutal<00:05:38.730> ok<00:05:40.050> so<00:05:41.050> now

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:06:14.860 

alright

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.010 

we're<00:06:15.470> just<00:06:15.560> going<00:06:15.770> to<00:06:15.830> stack<00:06:16.070> right<00:06:16.250> now

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.940 

no<00:06:20.650> sense<00:06:20.919> and<00:06:21.069> dropping<00:06:21.430> land

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.500 

can't<00:06:24.580> really<00:06:24.760> attack<00:06:25.090> here

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
can't really attack here

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:44.800 
can't really attack here
we<00:06:27.080> are<00:06:27.230> we<00:06:27.590> are<00:06:27.710> definitely<00:06:27.950> in<00:06:28.070> some<00:06:28.280> trouble

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.629 

so<00:06:45.350> I<00:06:45.680> assume<00:06:46.010> he<00:06:46.130> has<00:06:46.160> a<00:06:46.250> got<00:06:46.430> a<00:06:46.460> way<00:06:46.610> of

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
so I assume he has a got a way of

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.890 
so I assume he has a got a way of
finishing<00:06:46.910> off<00:06:47.270> our<00:06:49.419> flame<00:06:50.419> theme<00:06:50.660> that<00:06:50.840> I

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
finishing off our flame theme that I

00:06:50.900 --> 00:07:03.650 
finishing off our flame theme that I
don't<00:06:51.080> really<00:06:51.440> think<00:06:51.650> I<00:06:51.800> have<00:06:51.950> a<00:06:51.980> choice

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.340 

oh<00:07:03.720> I<00:07:04.260> see<00:07:04.650> he<00:07:05.400> gets<00:07:05.580> to<00:07:05.730> bring<00:07:05.880> back<00:07:05.970> and<00:07:06.630> ping

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
oh I see he gets to bring back and ping

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.140

us<00:07:07.440> in<00:07:07.590> the<00:07:07.680> face

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:22.170 

better<00:07:12.020> take<00:07:12.260> one<00:07:12.320> and<00:07:12.830> two

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.540 

so<00:07:23.230> that<00:07:24.230> is<00:07:24.440> not<00:07:25.090> an<00:07:26.090> artifact<00:07:26.630> creature<00:07:26.930> so

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
so that is not an artifact creature so

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.850 
so that is not an artifact creature so
looks<00:07:28.550> like<00:07:28.810> we<00:07:29.810> lost<00:07:29.840> despite<00:07:30.290> Conley's

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
looks like we lost despite Conley's

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.740 
looks like we lost despite Conley's
apparently<00:07:31.400> terrible<00:07:32.120> that<00:07:32.240> it<00:07:32.420> doesn't<00:07:32.660> seem

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750 
apparently terrible that it doesn't seem

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.030 
apparently terrible that it doesn't seem
like<00:07:32.780> rape<00:07:33.050> just<00:07:33.320> because<00:07:33.560> the<00:07:33.710> aggressive

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.040 
like rape just because the aggressive

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.780 
like rape just because the aggressive
draws<00:07:34.250> and<00:07:35.470> we<00:07:36.470> couldn't<00:07:36.920> contain<00:07:37.220> them<00:07:37.430> so

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:37.790 
draws and we couldn't contain them so

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.530
