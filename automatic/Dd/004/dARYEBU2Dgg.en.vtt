00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 I agree 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.140
 I have many people but I have 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.510
 I'm not exclusive 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:16.100
 og at 6000 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:21.680
 That person's fierce fights are impressive but it is impressive 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:27.010
 It is a room of the type that will be packed in excess if you do a long-term battle 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.010
 Yes I have a good image of the mountain turn around 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:37.690
 Oh yes and that this ztt player was also Barulog 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.690
 The point was high. Yes, nearly 5000 are not mobile. 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.809
 It before Sello sticker ー 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.809
 Oh I want to do it 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.230
 To the village 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:59.950
 Stiffness Sasa went decided frankly 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:05.410
 ep 6 If there isn't enough power and stability after all 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:09.130
 Alice of different diameter, especially at this time there are fewer if it is doing ranks in the form of 5,000 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.360
 That's why it looks like it's hard to climb up 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:18.870
 So little country is fine 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:23.880
 z who has been Barrozzate of the player received a source can be a cone or can Khan 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.430
 But I still have that physical strength, so there was almost no bullet 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.470
 Big 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:37.310
 What action Tteyuu kneading threw the fastest Nagerenka this body opponent you do not know what will happen 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:39.590
 I threw Standing Yes Lift the go but attack power of Gras crush is I'm abnormal in the great strong 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.310
 And again because it does not become a counter hit 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.370
 It us Rampage is hard to fit in so much sore eyes 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:51.190
 Standing toss 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:54.310
 If you are looking for a little trouble with Cody and you're looking at it, you're going to stand and throw at a short distance 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.890
 If you try it while putting the lever behind you 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.220
 Maybe there is also this round is a judgment love 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.650
 Tightly, etc. 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.530
 Get the barlog 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.340
 Because there was correction here, it remains but 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.050
 Go terribly 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:15.140
 Derivation of Urukon 2 that quite early to now but it was a bit difficult experience frame consumption 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.190
 In which Rob Well I'd also use quite as surface-to-air 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.030
 Well done we'll also firmly site b now 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:27.140
 Come and Steller albeit 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:29.480
 This is Cody which has a thin gauge with a thin stun at a glance 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.780
 Strong if you can 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.650
 You can be this continent at a stretch 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.360
 The 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.930
 Iidado game that is delicious if you throw it by rolling 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:46.750
 I wanted lower stage unset larvae during 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:51.569
 I don't hit at a aa I wanted to have a true attitude 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:55.849
 Samal Nue by 1997 was fully fishing ｰｰｰ 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.849
 Oh and as I was scraping the last minute 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:06.320
 It looked like I was overwhelmed by the first round quite well, though 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.320
 In the hall offensive in response to the second round the third round
