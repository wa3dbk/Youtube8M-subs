00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
hi everyone so the SCAF tattoo with at

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.140 
hi everyone so the SCAF tattoo with at
long<00:00:09.940> last<00:00:10.240> over<00:00:11.200> a<00:00:11.500> year<00:00:12.460> of<00:00:12.700> getting<00:00:12.940> it

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
long last over a year of getting it

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.590 
long last over a year of getting it
together

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
together

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.440 
together
my<00:00:14.280> moving<00:00:15.280> bottom<00:00:15.730> bracket<00:00:17.760> then<00:00:18.760> about<00:00:18.939> 25

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
my moving bottom bracket then about 25

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.550 
my moving bottom bracket then about 25
miles<00:00:19.840> on<00:00:20.020> it<00:00:20.050> so<00:00:20.290> far<00:00:20.529> in<00:00:21.779> five<00:00:22.779> mile<00:00:23.020> stints

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
miles on it so far in five mile stints

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.729 
miles on it so far in five mile stints
just<00:00:24.550> all<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:25.570> way<00:00:26.430> along<00:00:27.430> the<00:00:27.640> bay<00:00:27.790> on<00:00:28.090> our

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
just all the way along the bay on our

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.660 
just all the way along the bay on our
cycle<00:00:29.739> track<00:00:29.950> multi-use<00:00:30.669> path<00:00:32.670> manageable

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
cycle track multi-use path manageable

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.910 
cycle track multi-use path manageable
certainly<00:00:37.230> still<00:00:38.230> a<00:00:38.260> lot<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.500> practice<00:00:38.829> and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
certainly still a lot of practice and

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.200 
certainly still a lot of practice and
even<00:00:39.190> this<00:00:39.340> will<00:00:39.550> more<00:00:39.699> than<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.969> others

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
even this will more than the others

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.549 
even this will more than the others
certainly<00:00:40.480> I'm<00:00:41.230> not<00:00:41.410> riding<00:00:41.769> the<00:00:41.949> hills<00:00:42.219> yet

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
certainly I'm not riding the hills yet

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.139 
certainly I'm not riding the hills yet
but<00:00:44.559> I<00:00:44.829> say<00:00:45.429> workable<00:00:46.179> certainly<00:00:47.910> long<00:00:48.910> as<00:00:49.030> no

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
but I say workable certainly long as no

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.299 
but I say workable certainly long as no
one<00:00:49.269> gets<00:00:49.300> in<00:00:49.570> my<00:00:49.660> way

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
one gets in my way

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.639 
one gets in my way
no<00:00:51.309> not<00:00:51.489> really<00:00:52.480> pretty<00:00:53.109> much

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
no not really pretty much

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.130 
no not really pretty much
high-speed<00:00:54.429> is<00:00:54.579> good<00:00:54.789> I<00:00:54.969> can<00:00:55.120> put<00:00:55.719> some<00:00:55.870> speed

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
high-speed is good I can put some speed

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.639 
high-speed is good I can put some speed
out<00:00:56.350> on<00:00:56.499> it<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:56.710> it<00:00:56.800> feels<00:00:57.010> solid<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.850> doesn't

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
out on it and it feels solid it doesn't

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.729 
out on it and it feels solid it doesn't
the<00:00:59.649> front<00:00:59.890> doesn't<00:01:00.160> move<00:01:00.460> around<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:01.629> I<00:01:01.989> as<00:01:02.620> I

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
the front doesn't move around as I as I

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.970 
the front doesn't move around as I as I
push<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.159> pedal<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.989> low-speed<00:01:04.989> handling<00:01:05.409> is

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
push and pedal a low-speed handling is

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.740 
push and pedal a low-speed handling is
pretty<00:01:06.430> good<00:01:06.670> just<00:01:07.090> drop<00:01:07.330> down<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.630> gears

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
pretty good just drop down the gears

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.640 
pretty good just drop down the gears
obviously<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:09.400> and<00:01:09.580> down<00:01:09.730> the<00:01:09.910> gears<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.500> it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
obviously up and down the gears and it

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.170 
obviously up and down the gears and it
seems<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:11.980> run<00:01:12.100> okay<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.380> we've<00:01:14.620> got<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.920> usual

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
seems to run okay so we've got the usual

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.180 
seems to run okay so we've got the usual
couple<00:01:16.180> of<00:01:16.240> months<00:01:16.450> testing<00:01:16.720> now<00:01:17.170> I've<00:01:17.980> got<00:01:18.160> a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
couple of months testing now I've got a

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.100 
couple of months testing now I've got a
few<00:01:18.400> new<00:01:18.520> components<00:01:19.120> coming<00:01:19.390> down<00:01:19.570> for<00:01:19.900> it

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
few new components coming down for it

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.890 
few new components coming down for it
got<00:01:20.950> myself<00:01:21.100> a<00:01:21.370> new<00:01:21.520> adjustable<00:01:22.240> stem<00:01:22.600> so<00:01:22.840> I

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
got myself a new adjustable stem so I

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.110 
got myself a new adjustable stem so I
can<00:01:23.050> just<00:01:23.170> lift<00:01:23.350> these<00:01:23.560> bars<00:01:24.340> just<00:01:24.580> up<00:01:24.910> that<00:01:24.940> a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
can just lift these bars just up that a

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.420 
can just lift these bars just up that a
little<00:01:25.270> bit<00:01:25.390> higher<00:01:25.540> arm<00:01:26.500> position<00:01:27.160> with

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
little bit higher arm position with

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.020 
little bit higher arm position with
these<00:01:27.520> bull<00:01:27.790> horns<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:29.380> totally<00:01:29.740> sure<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
these bull horns not totally sure I

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.840 
these bull horns not totally sure I
don't<00:01:31.480> think<00:01:31.660> I've<00:01:31.870> got<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.400> position<00:01:33.400> angles

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
don't think I've got the position angles

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.330 
don't think I've got the position angles
for<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.360> drop<00:01:34.630> bars<00:01:34.900> so<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:35.770> don't<00:01:35.980> think<00:01:36.220> I'll

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
for the drop bars so I don't think I'll

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.600 
for the drop bars so I don't think I'll
go<00:01:36.490> for<00:01:36.700> them<00:01:37.530> angles<00:01:38.530> as<00:01:38.800> we<00:01:39.160> know<00:01:39.280> spoke

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
go for them angles as we know spoke

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.040 
go for them angles as we know spoke
about<00:01:39.910> I<00:01:40.120> think<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.480> seem<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:40.720> be<00:01:40.870> following

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
about I think I seem to be following
