00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:03.160
 the 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.300
 the 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.240
 gig in the stone age used the first farmers considered 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.160
 addition of vegetable food that would be too little other than meat 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.899
 to give birth 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.580
 and it was an ideal means to prevent the covering of meat 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.890
 because that would not be easily available everywhere it became costly and so 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.700
 trade in europe quarry the basement room deadlines and from day to day with 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.800
 the romans and who use that would then again as a means of payment to the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.590
 Soldiers and civil servants co-pay the word salary derived from stable 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.180
 what he would salt there it became so precious that it became the white gold 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.079
 mentioned by that important one 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.929
 the heavier work that from the Middle Ages a basis for 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:46.130
 taxation 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.020
 the salt action was sometimes so high that they lead to violent protests and 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.250
 even our destiny 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.690
 a kilo of salt could have a value of half a daily wage 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.220
 in the netherlands up to the nineteenth century, an excise duty on sand was reflected 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.010
 led to significant smuggling with belgium but the taxes through 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.340
 was abolished 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.170
 among other things by the invention of the fridge there is nowadays not 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.380
 more needed to preserve food it is also less rare and therefore up 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.330
 less expensive 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.570
 yet he still earns well the Netherlands is one of the most important 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.790
 salt exporting countries 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.990
 We have so much salt here in the soil that we have been around the world for two centuries 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.930
 being able to supply salt and that need is still very much the same because, for example 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.520
 industry uses a lot of salt 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.130
 for example, it is in steel by the village class washing powder hearing no 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.370
 medicines and in many foods 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.220
 Just like the first farmers in the Stone Age, we cannot do without 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.050
 salt 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.520
 the room traps the water in your body so that you do not have too much moisture 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.680
 loses 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.540
 just as much would therefore not be good again it raises blood pressure 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.280
 can cause cancer 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.060
 room can even be deadly a portrait there would still know a man survives 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.080
 not sitting there is therefore still more valuable 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.229
 if we limit the salt value in our body
