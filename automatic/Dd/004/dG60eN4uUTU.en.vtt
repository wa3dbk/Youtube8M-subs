the wires we're gonna start by looking

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.490 
the wires we're gonna start by looking
for<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.280> left<00:01:29.430> turn<00:01:29.580> signal<00:01:30.260> and<00:01:31.260> it<00:01:31.380> looks

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
for the left turn signal and it looks

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.840 
for the left turn signal and it looks
like<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.740> yellow<00:01:31.920> wire<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.640> we're<00:01:32.760> gonna

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
like the yellow wire is what we're gonna

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.730 
like the yellow wire is what we're gonna
be<00:01:32.970> tapping<00:01:33.150> into<00:01:33.390> our<00:01:33.660> yellow<00:01:34.260> wire<00:01:34.350> from<00:01:34.620> our

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
be tapping into our yellow wire from our

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.720 
be tapping into our yellow wire from our
harness<00:01:35.010> is<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.160> to<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.370> to<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.580> yellow

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
harness is going to go to the yellow

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.150 
harness is going to go to the yellow
wire<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.210> car<00:01:36.590> next<00:01:37.590> we'll<00:01:37.770> test<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
wire on the car next we'll test for the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.590 
wire on the car next we'll test for the
running<00:01:38.370> lights<00:01:38.550> and<00:01:38.940> that's<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> brown<00:01:39.360> wire

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
running lights and that's the brown wire

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.190 
running lights and that's the brown wire
so<00:01:40.200> we're<00:01:40.350> gonna<00:01:40.470> go<00:01:40.650> brown<00:01:41.010> to<00:01:41.190> brown<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
so we're gonna go brown to brown and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
so we're gonna go brown to brown and
then<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.230> brakes<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:44.370> the<00:01:44.430> final<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:44.880> we're
