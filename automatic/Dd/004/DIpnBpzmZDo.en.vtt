00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
you can upgrade to a to a second unit

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.490 
you can upgrade to a to a second unit
but<00:03:22.090> not<00:03:22.270> only<00:03:22.600> is<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:22.750> touch<00:03:23.080> screen<00:03:23.110> it'll

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
but not only is it touch screen it'll

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.990 
but not only is it touch screen it'll
also<00:03:23.680> interact<00:03:24.280> with<00:03:24.430> all<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.700> engine

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
also interact with all the engine

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.370 
also interact with all the engine
control<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:25.540> can<00:03:25.660> bring<00:03:25.930> up<00:03:26.050> all<00:03:26.230> your

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
control so you can bring up all your

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.220 
control so you can bring up all your
engine<00:03:26.770> data<00:03:26.950> you've<00:03:27.700> got<00:03:27.850> an<00:03:28.000> IPS<00:03:28.570> auto<00:03:29.080> pilot

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
engine data you've got an IPS auto pilot

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.650 
engine data you've got an IPS auto pilot
here<00:03:29.800> as<00:03:29.920> well<00:03:30.100> you've<00:03:30.820> got<00:03:31.030> your<00:03:31.180> helm<00:03:31.450> which

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
here as well you've got your helm which

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.180 
here as well you've got your helm which
is<00:03:31.810> adjustable<00:03:32.110> which<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.770> really<00:03:32.980> great

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
is adjustable which is really great

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.980 
is adjustable which is really great
especially<00:03:33.459> for<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.120> tubby<00:03:34.390> club<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.780> think

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
especially for the tubby club I think

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.320 
especially for the tubby club I think
that'd<00:03:35.140> be<00:03:35.290> helpful<00:03:35.500> for<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:35.920> guys<00:03:36.330> standard

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
that'd be helpful for you guys standard

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.690 
that'd be helpful for you guys standard

great<00:03:39.820> if<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.270> get<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.510> optional<00:03:40.900> cockpit<00:03:41.350> TV

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
great if you get the optional cockpit TV

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.670 
great if you get the optional cockpit TV
this<00:03:42.400> will<00:03:42.610> also<00:03:42.730> play<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.180> DVD<00:03:43.500> through<00:03:44.500> that

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680

minimal<00:03:53.680> instrumentation<00:03:54.459> we've<00:03:54.580> really

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
minimal instrumentation we've really

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.580 
minimal instrumentation we've really
cleaned<00:03:55.209> this<00:03:55.390> dash<00:03:55.690> up<00:03:55.959> here<00:03:56.230> because<00:03:56.470> we

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
cleaned this dash up here because we

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.050 
cleaned this dash up here because we
don't<00:03:56.800> need<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.160> anymore<00:03:57.400> we<00:03:57.700> can<00:03:57.880> actually

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
don't need it anymore we can actually

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.670 
don't need it anymore we can actually
bring<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.570> up<00:03:58.690> through<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.080> through<00:03:59.590> the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
bring it up through the through the

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.590 
bring it up through the through the

joystick<00:04:05.440> it's<00:04:05.620> positioned<00:04:06.160> properly<00:04:06.400> here

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
joystick it's positioned properly here

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.910 
joystick it's positioned properly here
you<00:04:07.360> just<00:04:07.570> basically<00:04:07.750> turn<00:04:08.320> around<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:08.769> can

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
you just basically turn around you can

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.220 
you just basically turn around you can
face<00:04:09.100> after<00:04:09.489> that<00:04:09.610> joysticks<00:04:10.120> right<00:04:10.360> there<00:04:10.630> so

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
face after that joysticks right there so

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.690 
face after that joysticks right there so
really<00:04:11.410> use<00:04:11.650> some<00:04:11.830> good<00:04:11.980> thought<00:04:12.250> setting

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
really use some good thought setting

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.970 
really use some good thought setting
that<00:04:12.760> up<00:04:12.820> now<00:04:13.600> obviously<00:04:14.200> this<00:04:14.410> helms<00:04:14.739> got<00:04:14.890> to

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
that up now obviously this helms got to

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.280 
that up now obviously this helms got to
fit<00:04:15.160> more<00:04:15.370> than<00:04:15.430> just<00:04:15.820> me<00:04:16.030> so<00:04:16.720> you've<00:04:17.080> got<00:04:17.109> a

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
fit more than just me so you've got a

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.979 
fit more than just me so you've got a
helm<00:04:17.590> seat<00:04:17.859> that<00:04:18.700> goes<00:04:18.910> up<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.510> down<00:04:19.570> with<00:04:19.959> a

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
helm seat that goes up and down with a

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.530 
helm seat that goes up and down with a
flip<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.440> also<00:04:20.919> goes<00:04:21.100> for<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.549> back<00:04:21.729> put<00:04:22.330> you

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
flip it also goes for and back put you

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.990 
flip it also goes for and back put you
down<00:04:22.870> below<00:04:23.260> Chris<00:04:23.590> you've<00:04:24.130> got<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.520> flip

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
down below Chris you've got this flip

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.810 
down below Chris you've got this flip
down<00:04:25.210> teak<00:04:25.930> step<00:04:26.260> heavy-duty<00:04:26.710> step<00:04:27.130> so<00:04:27.610> if<00:04:27.729> you

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
down teak step heavy-duty step so if you

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.250 
down teak step heavy-duty step so if you
want<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.090> do<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.300> dog<00:04:28.540> thing<00:04:28.570> where<00:04:29.140> your

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
want to do the dog thing where your

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.360 
want to do the dog thing where your
head's<00:04:29.470> through<00:04:29.710> through<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.040> window<00:04:30.310> you

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
head's through through the window you

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.250 
head's through through the window you
know<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:30.760> so<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:30.910> speak<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.690> can<00:04:31.870> flip<00:04:32.110> that

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
know and so to speak you can flip that

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.960 
know and so to speak you can flip that
down<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.800> gives<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.070> additional<00:04:33.490> hike

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
down and it gives you additional hike

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.640 
down and it gives you additional hike
you<00:04:34.570> can<00:04:34.720> look<00:04:34.840> over<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.229> top<00:04:35.410> of<00:04:35.590> the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
you can look over the top of the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.260 
you can look over the top of the
windchill<00:04:36.010> which<00:04:36.190> sometimes<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:36.700> desirable

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
windchill which sometimes is desirable

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.380 
windchill which sometimes is desirable
absolutely<00:04:38.140> and<00:04:38.320> my<00:04:39.250> favorite<00:04:39.550> touch<00:04:39.910> cabin

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
absolutely and my favorite touch cabin

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.570 
absolutely and my favorite touch cabin
is<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.750> unobstructed<00:04:41.380> visibility<00:04:42.310> that<00:04:42.430> you

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
is the unobstructed visibility that you

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.790 
is the unobstructed visibility that you
have
