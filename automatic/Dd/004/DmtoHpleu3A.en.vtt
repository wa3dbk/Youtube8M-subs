is glass that's obviously the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.999 
is glass that's obviously the
touch-sensitive<00:01:41.380> pad<00:01:42.380> on<00:01:42.500> top<00:01:42.530> there<00:01:42.890> where

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
touch-sensitive pad on top there where

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.169 
touch-sensitive pad on top there where
you<00:01:43.070> do<00:01:43.159> that<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.369> know<00:01:43.490> your<00:01:43.640> finger<00:01:43.970> slides

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
you do that you know your finger slides

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.389 
you do that you know your finger slides
and<00:01:44.360> gestures<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:44.840> stuff<00:01:45.020> like<00:01:45.110> that

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
and gestures and stuff like that

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.340 
and gestures and stuff like that
underneath<00:01:46.399> you've<00:01:46.580> got<00:01:46.789> the<00:01:47.350> tracking

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
underneath you've got the tracking

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.469 
underneath you've got the tracking
sensor<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.640> obviously<00:01:49.909> this<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.179> battery

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
sensor and obviously this is the battery

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.520 
sensor and obviously this is the battery
compartment<00:01:50.600> which<00:01:51.080> you<00:01:51.259> would<00:01:51.439> open<00:01:51.770> like<00:01:52.700> so

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
compartment which you would open like so

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.490 
compartment which you would open like so
she's<00:01:54.530> going<00:01:54.709> to<00:01:54.770> be<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:54.860> total<00:01:55.159> guess<00:01:55.810> yeah<00:01:56.810> and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
she's going to be a total guess yeah and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.419 
she's going to be a total guess yeah and
it<00:01:57.590> looks<00:01:57.619> like<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.890> comes<00:01:57.979> with<00:01:58.159> batteries

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
it looks like it comes with batteries

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.669 
it looks like it comes with batteries
already<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:58.909> that's<00:01:59.149> handy<00:02:02.319> it<00:02:03.319> should<00:02:03.530> be<00:02:03.560> a

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
already so that's handy it should be a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.590 
already so that's handy it should be a
case<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.009> just<00:02:04.190> switching<00:02:04.970> your<00:02:05.030> bluetooth<00:02:05.390> on

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
case of just switching your bluetooth on

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.419 
case of just switching your bluetooth on
on<00:02:05.869> your<00:02:06.140> mac<00:02:06.319> and<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.830> should<00:02:07.039> pick<00:02:07.190> it<00:02:07.250> up

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
on your mac and it should pick it up

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.609 
on your mac and it should pick it up
forward<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.670> matalie<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.929> think<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.470> was<00:02:09.590> a

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
forward to matalie I think it was a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.340 
forward to matalie I think it was a
software<00:02:10.009> update<00:02:10.160> for<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.610> magic<00:02:10.789> mouse<00:02:11.350> but

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
software update for the magic mouse but
