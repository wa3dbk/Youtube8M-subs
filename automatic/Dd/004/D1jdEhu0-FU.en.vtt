the kind of all time best clips um I
would<00:01:35.070> preferably<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> same

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
would preferably with with the same

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.039 
would preferably with with the same
gamertag<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.500> suppose<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.900> can

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
gamertag I suppose we can like as we can

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
gamertag I suppose we can like as we can
look<00:01:40.229> into<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.610> see

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
look into it if it's not and we can see

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.380 
look into it if it's not and we can see
those<00:01:42.780> ways<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.110> find<00:01:43.320> out<00:01:43.500> guys<00:01:43.710> anyway<00:01:44.399> going

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
those ways to find out guys anyway going

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.399 
those ways to find out guys anyway going
back<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> top<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.049> contact<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.619> tab<00:01:47.009> um

back up to the top the contact is tab um

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.780 
back up to the top the contact is tab um
that's<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> trick

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that's that that's just with the trick

getting an advantage of someone else

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.680 
getting an advantage of someone else
because<00:02:07.189> you<00:02:07.310> can<00:02:07.490> edit<00:02:07.670> clips<00:02:08.090> better<00:02:08.479> than

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
because you can edit clips better than

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.330 
because you can edit clips better than
someone<00:02:08.929> else<00:02:09.080> can<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.709> as<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:09.860> say<00:02:09.979> guys<00:02:10.160> just

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
someone else can so as I say guys just

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.020 
someone else can so as I say guys just
walk<00:02:10.520> clips<00:02:11.349> for<00:02:12.349> feeders<00:02:12.739> that<00:02:13.040> well<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.819> does

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
walk clips for feeders that well it does

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.000 
walk clips for feeders that well it does
state<00:02:14.300> quad<00:02:14.690> quad<00:02:15.170> on<00:02:15.230> more<00:02:15.560> by<00:02:15.709> think<00:02:15.860> that's

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
state quad quad on more by think that's

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.190 
state quad quad on more by think that's
fairly<00:02:16.190> obvious<00:02:16.250> I'm<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:17.270> ghost<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.989> do

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
fairly obvious I'm on ghost I do

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.740 
fairly obvious I'm on ghost I do
understand<00:02:19.190> there<00:02:19.520> aren't<00:02:19.849> really<00:02:20.030> standards

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
understand there aren't really standards

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.780 
understand there aren't really standards
yet<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.319> I've<00:02:21.680> heard<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.010> maps<00:02:22.250> are<00:02:22.520> quite

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
yet and I've heard the maps are quite

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.630 
yet and I've heard the maps are quite
big<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.090> whether<00:02:23.540> triple<00:02:24.380> feeds<00:02:24.590> do<00:02:25.010> become<00:02:25.430> a

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
big so whether triple feeds do become a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.820 
big so whether triple feeds do become a
thing<00:02:25.940> for<00:02:26.330> ecology<00:02:26.750> egos<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.350> not<00:02:27.650> too<00:02:27.770> sure

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
thing for ecology egos and not too sure

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.229 
thing for ecology egos and not too sure
that's<00:02:28.100> going<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.340> happen<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:28.730> as<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:28.910> say<00:02:29.030> like

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
that's going to happen so as I say like

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.970 
that's going to happen so as I say like
maybe<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:29.900> doesn't<00:02:30.020> apply<00:02:30.319> too<00:02:30.410> much<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.830> go

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
maybe that doesn't apply too much to go

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.070 
maybe that doesn't apply too much to go
to<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.250> standards<00:02:31.610> aren't<00:02:31.819> set<00:02:32.270> yet<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:32.900> like

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
to the standards aren't set yet so like

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080 
to the standards aren't set yet so like
maybe<00:02:33.230> maybe<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.370> going<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.790> part<00:02:35.030> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
maybe maybe that is going to part the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.640 
maybe maybe that is going to part the
Sanders<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.450> know<00:02:35.600> guys<00:02:35.780> you're<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.530> guys

Sanders you know guys you're the guys

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.680 
Sanders you know guys you're the guys
setting<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.130> standards<00:02:37.519> so<00:02:38.000> gonna<00:02:38.209> do<00:02:38.540> what

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
setting the standards so gonna do what

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.390

you can and submit your best clips and
we<00:02:40.760> will<00:02:40.880> probably<00:02:41.030> rate<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.569> clips<00:02:41.780> based<00:02:42.140> on

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
we will probably rate the clips based on

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.100 
we will probably rate the clips based on
other<00:02:42.560> teams<00:02:42.830> around<00:02:43.160> us<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.090> yeah<00:02:44.330> go<00:02:44.569> for<00:02:44.810> go
