00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.550
 hi everyone today i'm coming 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.260
 to make you a makeup of all 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.190
 the days it changes because I have 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.809
 the impression that I'm only doing 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.360
 smoky and evening makeups on 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.530
 the chain cart and for a video I 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.660
 you make a look goes everywhere 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.279
 with the added bonus of two alternatives for 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.820
 lips so if you're interested stay 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.859
 there in low I will apply jumbo 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.359
 mick doohan wykes all over the eyelid 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.039
 mobile that I go next and get it wrong 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.289
 audois that will help intensify 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.119
 the effort since for a makeup 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:50.500
 simple but his parents so that it does not 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:53.769
 so not so I'll come clean 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.059
 hands nor what is the first that 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.089
 as you see a trip and seen from 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.699
 tons of packaging and I'm going to come 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.249
 take the color that's here that 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.320
 is called signs that is a species of 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:09.880
 hyper bright champagne pink so that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.840
 it is the far that goes everywhere especially 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:22.720
 the irises that saves life so in 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:24.520
 moving river and then with a small 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.550
 brush blurs hours we will come back 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.300
 take the color puck which is a good 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.220
 matte way with which we will score at 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.780
 hollow of the eyelid 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.780
 so we stay in hollow and mbaye 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.960
 always with a small brush here it's 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.080
 a little bit of sigma I'm going to take 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.370
 the color the only one that is not 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:01.480
 now with a few reflections 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:04.060
 bordeaux I would say slightly and I'm going 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.570
 come to draw an actor life as we 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.740
 sight in the united states 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:15.760
 in fact I'm going there I'm going to draw a 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:32.230
 little son and I'm going back in 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:34.510
 hollow what will form then takes on the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.830
 theory should be roughly traced from 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.090
 this way obviously this is 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.710
 absolutely not symmetrical 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.540
 but it does not matter because we had 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.910
 nor take back our little brush is have 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:48.150
 afraid of just now resume a little 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.150
 of bugs and we will be blurred 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.810
 he'll put with polls done 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.030
 I will now come back quite 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.220
 quickly is my going with one 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:15.720
 always and finally I'll take 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.840
 a black pencil is like rebound 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.910
 the noise which caused the iron eyes 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.459
 pencil in shades six years so the black 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.280
 in fact a dull black and I will come 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.280
 trace of half of my eye 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.610
 to the outer corner a line in 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.610
 staying relatively relative so like these 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.599
 is time that I have my cry to black I 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.610
 will take the opportunity to come and put some 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.170
 crillon in the upper mucosa what 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.310
 which will give an impression of 2.6 a 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.840
 little more provided the game being not 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.840
 to crash write in the eye obviously 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.109
 and with a small liner brush and the 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.829
 lighthouse crif so the famous black a little 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:10.859
 not been silvery from the palette 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:22.410
 I'm fading this trait for it to be 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:23.970
 a little more smoke a little mascara and 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.650
 we will be able to pass to the rest of the face 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.599
 that's the result for the eyes once 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.550
 the mascara ask so you see that 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:32.010
 remain very neutral we will be able to pass 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.960
 to the rest of the face and for the blush I 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.680
 chose to use a blush from nars 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.880
 which is called seduction is a 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.870
 limited edition it seems to me it's the 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.490
 new collection that is 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:47.419
 currently available and you see 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:53.130
 it's a burgundy blush with light 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:55.610
 light iridescent really very beautiful so I 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.960
 to apply that on the cheekbones 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.610
 in light touch because what I want 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.950
 even if it remains neutral as 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:08.219
 you guys see you there is 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.550
 extremely it was missing so do not have 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.100
 not the heavy hand 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.050
 do not do like the young woman's 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.790
 sephora for those who followed me on 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.290
 Facebook 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.410
 I asked that we try this blush 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.800
 on me at sephora the young woman has 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.390
 took a big brush that pretty much 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.580
 half of my face and applied it to me 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.370
 on the cheekbones on the nose and on the 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.080
 coat so here I was kind of like 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.870
 that but mostly face 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.610
 so it's not a maybe it's me 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.230
 who do not know the methods 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.590
 appropriate but I found that a little 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.690
 strange rome m 10 it's way too much 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.210
 dark for me 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.350
 I'll show you more closely 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.790
 because I really feel that 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.340
 the blushes do not stand out at all 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.720
 twenty cameras 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:59.140
 so I applied very slightly 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:01.000
 as I have said and the for 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.340
 lips so I have two alternatives 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.720
 so be a lipstick more of 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.910
 his makeup quite complete no matter 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:13.570
 what lipstick to either flashy or 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:22.090
 not that so I have a very nude nude 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:31.630
 it's number 505 of kiko and as 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:33.400
 sophie and that's the result with the 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.440
 lipstick better to drown its rest 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.060
 extremely sober and it goes everywhere 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.830
 so now I'm going to show you a 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.200
 other alternative had something 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.390
 a little more flashy this other solution 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.270
 it is to succumb to the trend of 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.330
 burgundy lips who is very happy that 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:53.320
 this season I chose a gloss of 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.270
 revlon is number 16 and you go 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:07:03.700
 see it is hyper pigmented is 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:05.950
 extremely beautiful here is the result with 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.150
 a bordeaux gloss so the advantage in 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.890
 more of its colors is that that you 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.480
 white so it's time ultra smile 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:15.860
 brite guarantee see yourself 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.629
 so it's not insignificant 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.099
 I hope this makeup of all 

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:20.599
 days will have pleased you do not hesitate to 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:22.310
 love the video she let me 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:23.990
 center comments is really pleasure 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.520
 I make to all beautiful jewels and 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.520
 I hope I can quickly charm
