for<00:00:17.550> almost<00:00:17.850> two<00:00:18.180> weeks<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.660> gotta<00:00:18.840> say

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
for almost two weeks and I gotta say

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.380 
for almost two weeks and I gotta say
it's<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.619> beautiful<00:00:20.130> interface<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.850> lot<00:00:21.240> has

it's a beautiful interface a lot has
been<00:00:21.420> improved<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.260> basically<00:00:22.769> my

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
been improved but basically my

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.519 
been improved but basically my
impression<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:24.060> iOS<00:00:24.630> 6<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> new

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
impression is that it's iOS 6 with a new

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.920 
impression is that it's iOS 6 with a new
skin<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.189> new<00:00:26.880> functionality<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.750> that's

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
skin and new functionality and that's

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.419 
skin and new functionality and that's
pretty<00:00:28.140> much<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.410> still<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.160> same

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
pretty much it still the same

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.400 
pretty much it still the same
restriction<00:00:30.029> there<00:00:30.300> are<00:00:30.420> many<00:00:30.720> new<00:00:30.960> things<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
restriction there are many new things to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.150 
restriction there are many new things to
experience

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
experience

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.030 
experience
it's<00:00:32.399> basically<00:00:32.820> iOS<00:00:33.329> 6<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> new<00:00:34.440> look<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
it's basically iOS 6 with a new look and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.530 
it's basically iOS 6 with a new look and
a<00:00:35.130> few<00:00:35.340> new<00:00:35.460> features<00:00:35.910> now<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:36.390> you're

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
a few new features now if you're

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.139 
a few new features now if you're
thinking<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.960> installing<00:00:37.230> iOS<00:00:37.950> 7<00:00:38.280> beta<00:00:38.460> 1<00:00:38.850> I

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
thinking of installing iOS 7 beta 1 I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.030 
thinking of installing iOS 7 beta 1 I
would<00:00:39.600> maybe<00:00:39.780> hold<00:00:40.110> off<00:00:40.260> until<00:00:40.469> beta<00:00:40.800> 2

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
would maybe hold off until beta 2

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.369 
would maybe hold off until beta 2
because<00:00:41.340> beta<00:00:41.579> 1<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.300> bit<00:00:42.690> unstable<00:00:43.079> right

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
because beta 1 is a bit unstable right

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.080 
because beta 1 is a bit unstable right
now<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.980> been<00:00:44.010> using<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.640> my<00:00:44.850> main

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
now I have been using it as my main

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.240 
now I have been using it as my main
phone<00:00:45.660> firmware<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> while<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.100> it's

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
great however it does crash often it

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.500 
great however it does crash often it
doesn't<00:00:50.129> play<00:00:50.250> well<00:00:50.520> with<00:00:50.670> many<00:00:50.910> applications

everything<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.000> iOS<00:02:12.420> 7<00:02:12.599> interface

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
everything in iOS 7 interface

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.900 
everything in iOS 7 interface
has<00:02:13.350> been<00:02:13.530> redesigned<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.370> changed<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
has been redesigned and changed I

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.760 
has been redesigned and changed I
couldn't<00:02:15.240> really<00:02:15.390> find<00:02:15.690> anything<00:02:16.290> that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
couldn't really find anything that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.670 
couldn't really find anything that
looked<00:02:17.040> old<00:02:17.340> from<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.120> Iowa<00:02:18.540> six<00:02:18.870> firmware<00:02:19.350> so

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
looked old from the Iowa six firmware so

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.470 
looked old from the Iowa six firmware so
basically<00:02:20.040> everything<00:02:20.460> has<00:02:20.610> been<00:02:20.790> redone<00:02:21.210> and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
basically everything has been redone and

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.570 
basically everything has been redone and
there<00:02:21.600> are<00:02:21.780> many<00:02:22.080> nice<00:02:22.350> little<00:02:22.800> touches<00:02:23.040> now

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
there are many nice little touches now

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.950 
there are many nice little touches now
if<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.790> look<00:02:23.940> closely<00:02:24.150> at<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.630> clock

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
if you look closely at the clock

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.140 
if you look closely at the clock
application<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.710> actually<00:02:26.220> works<00:02:26.550> now<00:02:26.760> so

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
application it actually works now so

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150 
application it actually works now so
it's<00:02:27.570> not<00:02:27.690> set<00:02:28.050> at<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> fixed<00:02:28.500> time<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:29.010> actually

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
it's not set at a fixed time it actually

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.340 
it's not set at a fixed time it actually
moves<00:02:29.730> which<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.240> pretty<00:02:30.540> neat<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.960> small

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
moves which is pretty neat a small

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.440 
moves which is pretty neat a small
little<00:02:31.620> thing<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.760> course<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.210> do<00:02:33.330> have

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
little thing and of course you do have

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.680 
little thing and of course you do have
the<00:02:33.570> 3d<00:02:33.930> effect<00:02:34.320> if<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.190> move<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.820> iPhone

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the 3d effect if you move the iPhone

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.880 
the 3d effect if you move the iPhone
like<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.080> which<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.470> pretty<00:02:37.650> cool

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
like that which is pretty cool

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.760 
like that which is pretty cool
stereoscopic<00:02:38.760> 3d<00:02:38.790> effects<00:02:39.480> we<00:02:40.020> have<00:02:40.230> seen<00:02:40.530> in

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
stereoscopic 3d effects we have seen in

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.860 
stereoscopic 3d effects we have seen in
an<00:02:40.890> earlier<00:02:41.220> tweak<00:02:41.550> in<00:02:41.820> Cydia<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:42.630> that's<00:02:42.810> a

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
an earlier tweak in Cydia so that's a

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.780 
an earlier tweak in Cydia so that's a
nice<00:02:43.050> little<00:02:43.080> thing<00:02:43.500> Apple<00:02:43.860> did<00:02:44.070> add<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.580> one

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
nice little thing Apple did add this one

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.360 
nice little thing Apple did add this one
maybe<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.330> little<00:02:45.810> bit<00:02:46.110> hard<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.410> see<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:46.860> if

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
maybe a little bit hard to see but if

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.980 
maybe a little bit hard to see but if
you<00:02:47.490> scroll<00:02:47.730> through<00:02:47.790> messages<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.600> actually

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
you scroll through messages you actually

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.140 
you scroll through messages you actually
get<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.260> nice<00:02:49.530> fluid<00:02:50.010> animation<00:02:50.610> where<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
get this nice fluid animation where the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.940 
get this nice fluid animation where the
messages<00:02:51.540> go<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> little<00:02:52.110> bit<00:02:52.320> slower<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.770> they

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
messages go a little bit slower and they

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.380 
messages go a little bit slower and they
kind<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.160> pile<00:02:53.400> up<00:02:53.580> against<00:02:53.910> each<00:02:54.000> other<00:02:54.120> I

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
kind of pile up against each other I

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.060 
kind of pile up against each other I
love<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.990> because<00:02:55.080> it's<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:55.620> one<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:55.980> those

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
love it because it's just one of those

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.560 
love it because it's just one of those
little<00:02:56.310> touches<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:57.030> makes<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.300> big<00:02:57.540> difference

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
little touches it makes a big difference

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.050 
little touches it makes a big difference
in<00:02:58.260> terms<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:59.160> know<00:02:59.190> intricate<00:02:59.760> design

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
around with it a little bit by moving

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
too exciting but you know again it's

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.699 
too exciting but you know again it's
just<00:03:27.030> one<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.420> those<00:03:27.480> little<00:03:27.720> things<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.170> iOS<00:03:28.440> 7

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.920 
just one of those little things in iOS 7
that<00:03:29.310> makes<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.670> little<00:03:29.940> different<00:03:30.480> but<00:03:30.780> it

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
that makes a little different but it

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.910 
that makes a little different but it
looks<00:03:31.080> really<00:03:31.530> cool

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
looks really cool
