but<00:02:10.429> let's<00:02:10.819> innovate<00:02:11.120> let's<00:02:11.569> create

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
but let's innovate let's create

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.300 
but let's innovate let's create
something<00:02:12.080> different<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.709> no<00:02:12.860> one's<00:02:13.040> seen

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.610 
something different that no one's seen
before<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:20.030> coaster<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.569> actually<00:02:21.170> made<00:02:21.349> just

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
before the coaster is actually made just

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.330 
before the coaster is actually made just
a<00:02:21.709> paper<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.430> tape

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.970 

and<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.360> we<00:02:26.480> actually<00:02:26.660> have<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.050> fold<00:02:27.319> all<00:02:27.739> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
and so we actually have to fold all the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.380 
and so we actually have to fold all the
pieces<00:02:28.190> together<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:29.420> piece<00:02:30.610> then<00:02:31.610> we<00:02:32.150> would

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
pieces together this piece then we would

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.340 
pieces together this piece then we would
test<00:02:32.750> them<00:02:32.900> outlets<00:02:33.260> marbles

all the work that you did to it because
at<00:03:01.710> first<00:03:01.890> we<00:03:02.040> start<00:03:02.340> out<00:03:02.460> with<00:03:02.640> one<00:03:02.880> solar<00:03:03.330> car

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990

I<00:03:04.020> mean<00:03:04.350> solar<00:03:04.530> panel<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.190> then<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.540> went<00:03:06.810> kind

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
I mean solar panel and then it went kind

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.500 
I mean solar panel and then it went kind
of<00:03:07.740> fast<00:03:07.800> then<00:03:08.460> once<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.700> got<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.880> second<00:03:09.420> one

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
of fast then once you got a second one

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.530 
of fast then once you got a second one
you<00:03:09.630> can<00:03:09.750> see<00:03:09.990> how<00:03:10.410> much<00:03:10.650> faster<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.250> went<00:03:14.540> we

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
you can see how much faster it went we

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
it's satisfying to me because I used to

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.680

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
program like that growing up and I think

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.940 
program like that growing up and I think
it's<00:05:54.820> very<00:05:55.060> rewarding<00:05:55.330> for<00:05:55.690> them<00:05:56.050> to<00:05:56.680> know

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
that they can come to a program like

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.500 
that they can come to a program like

it<00:06:21.850> allows<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.420> kids<00:06:22.660> to<00:06:22.810> actually<00:06:22.990> see<00:06:23.620> some

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
it allows the kids to actually see some

it allows the kids to actually see some
of<00:06:24.100> the<00:06:24.220> things<00:06:24.400> that<00:06:24.490> they're<00:06:24.700> doing<00:06:24.730> and

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
of the things that they're doing and

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.110 
of the things that they're doing and
some<00:06:26.830> actually<00:06:27.430> work<00:06:27.610> with<00:06:27.760> some<00:06:27.940> of<00:06:28.030> the

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
some actually work with some of the

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.720 
some actually work with some of the
students<00:06:28.690> that<00:06:28.780> are<00:06:29.170> our<00:06:29.860> student<00:06:30.310> mentors

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
students that are our student mentors

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.880 
students that are our student mentors
and<00:06:31.060> it<00:06:31.330> motivates<00:06:31.870> them<00:06:32.170> to<00:06:32.440> work<00:06:32.620> in<00:06:32.770> that

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890 
and it motivates them to work in that

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.530 
and it motivates them to work in that
field<00:06:33.130> and<00:06:33.340> also<00:06:33.490> know<00:06:33.790> about<00:06:34.000> the<00:06:34.150> college

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540
