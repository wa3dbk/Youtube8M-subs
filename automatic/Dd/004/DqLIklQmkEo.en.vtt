to<00:00:52.170> form<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.649> spike<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:54.690> may<00:00:54.840> find<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.230> you

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
to form the spike you may find that you

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.290 
to form the spike you may find that you
have<00:00:55.410> some<00:00:55.770> holes<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.219> your<00:00:56.309> spike<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.120> can

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
have some holes in your spike you can

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.240 
have some holes in your spike you can
fix<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.840> by<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.140> right-clicking<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
fix this by just right-clicking at the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.310 
fix this by just right-clicking at the
base<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> spike<00:01:00.120> again<00:01:00.329> where<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> holes

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
base of the spike again where the holes

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.410 
base of the spike again where the holes
occur<00:01:03.769> once<00:01:04.769> you've<00:01:04.979> finished<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.519> spike<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
occur once you've finished one spike you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.750 
occur once you've finished one spike you
can<00:01:06.600> repeat<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.140> process<00:01:07.350> again<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.520> form

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
can repeat the process again to form

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.780 
can repeat the process again to form
another<00:01:09.000> spike<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> same<00:01:10.530> base<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
another spike with the same base so it

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.429 
another spike with the same base so it
looks<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.360> coming<00:01:12.689> out<00:01:12.840> from<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.200> same

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
looks like it's coming out from the same

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:27.320 
looks like it's coming out from the same
point<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:24.290> there<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.770> two<00:01:26.490> spikes<00:01:26.880> if

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
point and there we have it two spikes if

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.359 
point and there we have it two spikes if
you<00:01:27.479> repeat<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.990> again<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.500> different<00:01:28.890> areas

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
you repeat this again in different areas

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
you repeat this again in different areas
you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.970> reduce<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.390> series<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.780> spikes<00:01:31.140> like

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
you can reduce a series of spikes like

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.969 
you can reduce a series of spikes like
this<00:01:32.329> but<00:01:33.329> now<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.750> time<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.079> try<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> more

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
this but now it's time to try a more

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.340 
this but now it's time to try a more
advanced<00:01:35.460> technique<00:01:35.810> first<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:37.140> need<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
advanced technique first we need to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440 
advanced technique first we need to
change<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.770> block<00:01:37.979> we're<00:01:38.220> using<00:01:38.579> by<00:01:39.060> putting

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
change the block we're using by putting

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.429 
change the block we're using by putting
in<00:01:39.920> /b<00:01:40.920> packed<00:01:41.490> ice<00:01:41.759> then<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.960> repeat<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
in /b packed ice then we repeat the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.139 
in /b packed ice then we repeat the
process<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:44.070> we've<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.640> learned<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
process that we've just learned and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.030 
process that we've just learned and
create<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.930> normal<00:01:46.439> spike

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
create a normal spike

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.289 
create a normal spike
using<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> different<00:01:47.790> block

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.670 

now<00:01:52.299> we<00:01:52.360> need<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.659> position<00:01:52.780> ourselves<00:01:53.140> very

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
now we need to position ourselves very

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.800 
now we need to position ourselves very
carefully<00:01:54.280> above<00:01:54.790> where<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.390> spike<00:01:55.630> is

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
carefully above where the spike is

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.899 
carefully above where the spike is
pointing<00:01:56.320> making<00:01:57.280> sure<00:01:57.490> that<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:57.760> are

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
pointing making sure that you are

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.289 
pointing making sure that you are
completely<00:01:58.060> in<00:01:58.720> line<00:01:58.990> with<00:01:59.290> it<00:01:59.440> and<00:01:59.619> type<00:02:00.400> /up

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
completely in line with it and type /up

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.830 
completely in line with it and type /up
1<00:02:02.310> now<00:02:03.310> we<00:02:03.369> want<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.850> change<00:02:04.090> our<00:02:04.390> block<00:02:04.630> to

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
1 now we want to change our block to

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.800 
1 now we want to change our block to
something<00:02:05.140> opaque<00:02:05.530> such<00:02:06.130> as<00:02:06.310> ice<00:02:06.690> using<00:02:07.690> the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
something opaque such as ice using the

your arrow on the glass block and right
click<00:02:14.590> with<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.830> gunpowder<00:02:15.340> around<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
click with the gunpowder around the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.180 
click with the gunpowder around the
packed<00:02:16.840> ice<00:02:17.110> spike<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.800> you've<00:02:17.950> already

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
packed ice spike that you've already

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.040 
packed ice spike that you've already
made<00:02:18.810> encasing<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.770> ice<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:24.900> there<00:02:25.900> we

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
made encasing it in the ice and there we

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.470 
made encasing it in the ice and there we
have<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.500> spike<00:02:26.950> within<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.370> spike<00:02:27.670> something

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
have it a spike within a spike something

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.699 
have it a spike within a spike something
that<00:02:28.630> looks<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.870> little<00:02:28.989> better<00:02:29.200> than<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.530> ones

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
that looks a little better than the ones

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.140 
that looks a little better than the ones
we<00:02:29.830> made<00:02:29.980> out<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.250> obsidian<00:02:32.459> if<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.640> continue

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
we made out of obsidian if you continue

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.059 
we made out of obsidian if you continue
to<00:02:34.300> use<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:34.660> technique<00:02:35.050> using<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.530> variety<00:02:35.709> of

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
to use this technique using a variety of

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.820 
to use this technique using a variety of
blocks<00:02:36.489> both<00:02:36.730> opaque<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.420> solid<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:38.650> can

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
blocks both opaque and solid you can

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.650 
blocks both opaque and solid you can
make<00:02:39.010> some<00:02:39.190> really<00:02:39.430> diverse<00:02:39.970> structures<00:02:40.330> with

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
make some really diverse structures with

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.320 
make some really diverse structures with
your<00:02:40.780> spikes<00:02:41.220> but<00:02:42.220> maybe<00:02:42.430> we<00:02:42.550> can<00:02:42.730> go<00:02:42.850> one<00:02:43.090> step

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
your spikes but maybe we can go one step

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.440 
your spikes but maybe we can go one step
further<00:02:43.600> it's<00:02:44.200> time<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.590> get<00:02:44.680> creative<00:02:44.980> in

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
further it's time to get creative in

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.330 
further it's time to get creative in
this<00:02:46.450> scenario<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:47.140> have<00:02:47.170> created<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.800> floating

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
this scenario I have created a floating

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.580 
this scenario I have created a floating
sphere<00:02:48.700> surrounded<00:02:49.480> by<00:02:49.600> many<00:02:49.870> glass<00:02:50.200> blocks

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
sphere surrounded by many glass blocks

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.500 
sphere surrounded by many glass blocks
which<00:02:50.920> we<00:02:51.100> all<00:02:51.220> know<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.519> be<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.970> tips<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.360> our

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
which we all know to be the tips of our

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.990 
which we all know to be the tips of our
spikes<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.170> then<00:02:53.980> use<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.400> technique<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:54.760> you

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
spikes I then use the technique that you

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.910 
spikes I then use the technique that you
have<00:02:55.090> learnt<00:02:55.269> in<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.510> video<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.440> connect<00:02:56.769> the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
have learnt in this video to connect the

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.350 
have learnt in this video to connect the
glass<00:02:57.130> blocks<00:02:57.579> to<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.690> sphere<00:02:58.959> using<00:02:59.470> spikes

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
glass blocks to the sphere using spikes

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.030 
glass blocks to the sphere using spikes
in<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.570> end<00:03:01.690> this<00:03:02.019> will<00:03:02.230> produce<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.739> large

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
in the end this will produce a large

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.910 
in the end this will produce a large
looking<00:03:03.400> star<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.260> there<00:03:05.260> we<00:03:05.410> have<00:03:05.620> it

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
looking star and there we have it

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.949 
looking star and there we have it
you<00:03:06.070> now<00:03:06.250> know<00:03:06.459> how<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.640> make<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:06.940> spike<00:03:07.239> but<00:03:07.930> I

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
you now know how to make a spike but I

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.720 
you now know how to make a spike but I
don't<00:03:08.200> really<00:03:08.470> want<00:03:08.829> you<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:08.980> just<00:03:09.100> copy<00:03:09.459> what

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
don't really want you to just copy what

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.699 
don't really want you to just copy what
I<00:03:09.760> made<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.150> this<00:03:10.269> video<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.840> want<00:03:11.230> you<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.470> learn
