00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
um and the skin is working for all ten

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.410 
um and the skin is working for all ten
stages<00:00:46.280> but<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> won't<00:00:47.700> work<00:00:47.820> for<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
stages but it won't work for the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.799 
stages but it won't work for the
flashback<00:00:48.899> scene<00:00:49.820> it's<00:00:50.820> better<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.270> way<00:00:51.629> at

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
flashback scene it's better that way at

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.049 
flashback scene it's better that way at
least<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.170> think<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.030> only

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
least I think so because it's the only

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.139 
least I think so because it's the only
flashback<00:00:54.870> scene<00:00:55.170> where<00:00:55.980> both<00:00:56.520> Jill<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
flashback scene where both Jill and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.920 
flashback scene where both Jill and
Chris<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.469> VSA<00:00:59.039> uniform<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.940> it's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
Chris we are the VSA uniform and it's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.049 
Chris we are the VSA uniform and it's
kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> correct<00:01:01.890> compared<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
kind of correct compared with a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.850 
kind of correct compared with a
storyline<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:05.000> we<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:06.420> all<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.619> Jill's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
storyline and we can use all of Jill's

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.289 
storyline and we can use all of Jill's
weapons<00:01:08.220> without<00:01:08.400> being<00:01:08.729> afraid<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.150> some

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
weapons without being afraid of some
