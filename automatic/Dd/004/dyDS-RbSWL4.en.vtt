00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
 never everyone has only video games e 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.299
 tutorial 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:11.040
 today I am here with this crossroads man 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.340
 to show you how to get vehicles from 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.520
 luxury imported from history or 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.070
 found for the way of the online for 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.900
 put them in the garage so let's start 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.150
 we get on the car we want to put 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.609
 in the garage 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.779
 so it was we position as you see in the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.200
 video we place it centrally at 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.840
 garage then we open the phone and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.270
 we call the emergency service 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.239
 if you have not saved the service of 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.760
 emergency and address book crush squared 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.350
 and we write 9 11 and then as soon as we have 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.239
 called the emergency service 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.550
 let the police arrive 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.460
 a police patrol this 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.920
 important once the police arrived 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.899
 this is very important 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.030
 we have to eliminate the cops they are 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.869
 inside the car once 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.650
 eliminated us with the auto buffer 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.350
 fight the police patrol 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.159
 as you see in the video then we have to 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.869
 sow the stars 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.570
 so we move away a bit 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.600
 sow the stars once 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.930
 flashes that the stars are flashing 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.060
 we have to get into the garage right away 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.060
 here's how you see it in the video 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.140
 therefore once entered the competition 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.320
 you will have to sacrifice a vehicle for it 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.229
 lose network remember then let's go up 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.240
 inside the vehicle must be 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.340
 be sure you remember guys must 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.100
 be insured once inside 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.350
 of the vehicle we want to sacrifice 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.869
 we open the phone we go to the game 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.049
 fast and while we do join 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.090
 random game we have to speed up 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.090
 so i do hicks to go up 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.700
 random game and then accelerate 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.739
 as you can see in the video the timing must 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:21.340
 be right then once we are 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.650
 entered the random game 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.269
 we must immediately exit the game 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.180
 random 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.010
 remember this is very important 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.760
 passage 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.830
 otherwise the glitch will not work 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.120
 once inside the game 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:45.940
 casual we immediately leave the game 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:51.790
 random then once you exit the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:56.859
 random match appear so on 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:03.390
 this screen then we will go up to the 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:03.390
 our vehicle to put in the garage 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.620
 you will see this screen that we will exit 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.109
 with in the vehicle 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:19.000
 but this will not be enough therefore we go down 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:20.709
 then we get back on the vehicle and enter 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.959
 garage 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:29.410
 then remember if you have a full garage 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.480
 you will have to replace some vehicles but 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.000
 even without full garage that goes 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.609
 so good 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.720
 if this method will not work 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.940
 go up and down and then up again 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.100
 enter the garage and exit with a 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.879
 any vehicle then returned with 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.970
 that vehicle 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.010
 if it does not operate this method, however, there 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.980
 it should 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.700
 honor so here is everything from video games and 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.329
 tutorial 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.329
 to the next
