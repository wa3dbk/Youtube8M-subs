now<00:00:09.870> we're<00:00:10.080> going<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.349> do<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.530> one-handed<00:00:10.980> tie

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
now we're going to do a one-handed tie

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.499 
now we're going to do a one-handed tie
under<00:00:11.969> tension

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
under tension

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.010 
under tension
using<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.049> slip<00:00:13.290> knot<00:00:13.320> as<00:00:14.540> you've<00:00:15.540> seen<00:00:15.750> when<00:00:15.990> we

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
using a slip knot as you've seen when we

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.720 
using a slip knot as you've seen when we
were<00:00:16.199> doing<00:00:16.500> one-handed<00:00:16.949> ties<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.490> very

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
were doing one-handed ties it's very

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.880 
were doing one-handed ties it's very
difficult<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.480> do<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> surgeon's<00:00:19.470> knot<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.770> do

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
difficult to do a surgeon's knot to do

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.740 
difficult to do a surgeon's knot to do
two<00:00:20.279> throws<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.029> if<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.449> something

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
two throws so if you have something

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.420 
two throws so if you have something
under<00:00:22.020> tension<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.560> I'm<00:00:22.710> setting<00:00:23.010> up<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.279> as

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
under tension as I'm setting up here as

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.830 
under tension as I'm setting up here as
you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.670> see<00:00:23.789> at<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> purple<00:00:24.420> strand<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
you can see at the purple strand the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.480 
you can see at the purple strand the
white<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.619> white<00:00:25.650> strand<00:00:26.130> I'm<00:00:26.279> going<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
white the white strand I'm going to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.089 
white the white strand I'm going to
cross<00:00:26.730> over<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:28.470> every<00:00:28.920> time

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
cross over just like I do every time

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.279 
cross over just like I do every time
where<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> hand<00:00:29.699> that's<00:00:29.880> doing<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> work<00:00:30.289> is

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
where the hand that's doing the work is

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.920 
where the hand that's doing the work is
distal<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.090> go<00:00:33.239> let's<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
distal so here we go let's do a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.780 
distal so here we go let's do a
one-handed<00:00:34.350> tie<00:00:34.620> we'll<00:00:34.980> review<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.640> do

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
one-handed tie we'll review what we do

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.569 
one-handed tie we'll review what we do
again<00:00:37.309> pistol<00:00:38.309> hook<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> barrels<00:00:40.489> bring<00:00:41.489> it

again pistol hook the barrels bring it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.569 
again pistol hook the barrels bring it
to<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> center<00:00:42.149> make<00:00:42.719> your<00:00:42.899> cross<00:00:43.340> slide<00:00:44.340> your

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
to the center make your cross slide your

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.319 
to the center make your cross slide your
thumb<00:00:44.610> down<00:00:45.260> push<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.590> flip<00:00:47.430> hook<00:00:48.180> with

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
thumb down push it out flip hook with

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.610 
thumb down push it out flip hook with
the<00:00:48.360> forefinger<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:49.610> pinch<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.620> third

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the forefinger then pinch with the third

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.060 
the forefinger then pinch with the third
digit<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> middle<00:00:53.550> finger<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> then

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
digit or the middle finger and then

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.660 
digit or the middle finger and then
pronate<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.329> bring<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.629> down

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
pronate out here we go we bring it down

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.880 
pronate out here we go we bring it down
now<00:00:59.670> how<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.120> create<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.600> slip<00:01:00.840> knot<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.710> do

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
now how do we create the slip knot we do

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
now how do we create the slip knot we do
the<00:01:02.039> exact<00:01:02.399> same<00:01:02.550> throw<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.539> don't<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the exact same throw so we don't do the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.609 
the exact same throw so we don't do the
perfect<00:01:04.320> sign<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.890> supinate<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.840> pistol

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
perfect sign and supinate we just pistol

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.649 
perfect sign and supinate we just pistol
grip<00:01:07.770> hook<00:01:08.159> again<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.939> exactly<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:09.540> we

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
grip hook again and do exactly what we

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.810 
grip hook again and do exactly what we
did<00:01:09.689> again<00:01:09.950> now<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
did again now as you can see we have the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.450 
did again now as you can see we have the
cross<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.799> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> create<00:01:14.340> your

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
cross here this is going to create your

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.870 
cross here this is going to create your
slip<00:01:14.670> knot<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> push<00:01:15.990> out<00:01:16.229> look<00:01:17.100> through<00:01:17.460> bring

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
slip knot so push out look through bring

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.990 
slip knot so push out look through bring
it<00:01:18.000> down<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:19.380> hold<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.250> up<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.939> you

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it down and then hold this up if you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.940 
it down and then hold this up if you
hold<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.360> flat<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.020> how<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.259> slides

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
hold it up flat you see how this slides

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.130 
hold it up flat you see how this slides
right<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.430> down<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> slip<00:01:25.110> knot

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
right on down on it this is a slip knot

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.460 
right on down on it this is a slip knot
so<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.610> several<00:01:26.909> times<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:28.290> can

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
so if I do this several times you can

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.390 
so if I do this several times you can
see<00:01:28.850> how<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:30.479> doing<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> same<00:01:31.650> throw<00:01:32.009> every

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
see how I'm doing the same throw every

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.050 
see how I'm doing the same throw every
time<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:34.759> this<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:37.310> purple<00:01:38.310> strand<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
time and this the purple strand is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.690 
time and this the purple strand is
sliding<00:01:39.509> slipping<00:01:40.350> down<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.520> white

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
sliding slipping down on the white

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.450 
sliding slipping down on the white
strand<00:01:42.150> creating<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> slip<00:01:43.170> knot<00:01:43.310> if<00:01:44.310> I

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
strand creating the slip knot if I

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.160 
strand creating the slip knot if I
continue<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.299> will<00:01:45.450> become<00:01:45.689> become

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
continue this this will become become

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.109 
continue this this will become become
unraveled<00:01:46.500> unless<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.130> lock<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:48.030> how

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
unraveled unless I lock it you see how

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.350 
unraveled unless I lock it you see how
it's<00:01:48.299> sliding<00:01:48.570> down<00:01:49.009> that's<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.159> slip<00:01:50.399> knot<00:01:50.430> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it's sliding down that's a slip knot so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
it's sliding down that's a slip knot so
how<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.659> lock<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.049> I've<00:01:52.229> got<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> throw

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
how do I lock it I've got to do a throw

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.760 
how do I lock it I've got to do a throw
with<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:55.549> opposite<00:01:56.549> maneuver<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:57.770> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
with the opposite maneuver so then you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.480 
with the opposite maneuver so then you
want<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.100> supinate<00:02:00.320> with<00:02:01.320> your<00:02:01.530> second<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
want a supinate with your second and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.170 
want a supinate with your second and
third<00:02:02.520> digit<00:02:03.590> within<00:02:04.590> there<00:02:04.829> our<00:02:05.490> third<00:02:05.520> and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
third digit within there our third and

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.210 
third digit within there our third and
fourth<00:02:06.360> digit<00:02:06.570> excuse<00:02:06.990> me<00:02:07.140> within<00:02:07.439> there

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
fourth digit excuse me within there

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.130 
fourth digit excuse me within there
and<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:08.820> you<00:02:08.940> grab<00:02:09.149> your<00:02:09.210> strand<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:10.020> you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and then you grab your strand like you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.240 
and then you grab your strand like you
do<00:02:10.320> normally<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.160> then<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.660> cross<00:02:12.960> over<00:02:13.260> to

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
do normally and then you cross over to

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.450 
do normally and then you cross over to
lock<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:15.200> now<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.260> lock<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.010> these<00:02:17.220> won't

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
lock it now to lock it so these won't

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.420 
lock it now to lock it so these won't
slip<00:02:17.700> off<00:02:18.230> then<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.320> can<00:02:19.500> go<00:02:19.650> back<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.160> forth

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
slip off then you can go back and forth

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.330 
slip off then you can go back and forth
like<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.850> are<00:02:21.060> with<00:02:21.330> your<00:02:21.680> square<00:02:22.680> knots<00:02:22.920> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
like you are with your square knots and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.890 
like you are with your square knots and
that<00:02:23.730> will<00:02:23.880> prevent<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.930> from<00:02:24.990> slipping<00:02:26.900> but

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
that will prevent it from slipping but

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.330 
that will prevent it from slipping but
as<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.290> see<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.560> area<00:02:28.800> where<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.040> slips

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
as you can see the area where it slips

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.210 
as you can see the area where it slips
it's<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.640> roll<00:02:29.940> with<00:02:30.210> nice<00:02:30.630> lined<00:02:31.590> up<00:02:31.830> that's

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
it's a roll with nice lined up that's

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.470 
it's a roll with nice lined up that's
that's<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.450> sign<00:02:33.690> right<00:02:33.960> here<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:35.160> slip<00:02:38.480> now

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
that's a sign right here of a slip now

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.330 
that's a sign right here of a slip now
we're<00:02:39.660> going<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.930> do<00:02:40.110> one<00:02:40.350> handed<00:02:40.680> tie<00:02:40.890> under

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
we're going to do one handed tie under

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.460 
we're going to do one handed tie under
tension<00:02:41.580> using<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.060> slip<00:02:42.300> knot<00:02:42.330> using<00:02:43.200> silk

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
tension using a slip knot using silk

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.900 
tension using a slip knot using silk
suture<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.010> I'm<00:02:44.100> going<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.250> set<00:02:44.459> ourselves<00:02:44.550> up

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
suture so I'm going to set ourselves up

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.730 
suture so I'm going to set ourselves up
here<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:45.900> we're<00:02:45.990> going<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.140> try<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.380> take<00:02:46.530> these

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
here so we're going to try to take these

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.080 
here so we're going to try to take these
two<00:02:47.010> strands<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.430> are<00:02:47.490> in<00:02:47.670> tension<00:02:48.060> and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
two strands that are in tension and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.190 
two strands that are in tension and
putting<00:02:48.420> bring<00:02:48.750> together<00:02:49.250> set<00:02:50.250> myself<00:02:50.400> up<00:02:50.760> I

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
putting bring together set myself up I

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.449 
putting bring together set myself up I
set<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.320> up<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.770> hand<00:02:52.980> that's<00:02:53.130> going<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.340> be

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
set it up so the hand that's going to be

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.370 
set it up so the hand that's going to be
doing<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:54.090> time<00:02:54.450> which<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.050> case<00:02:55.230> is

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
doing the time which in this case is

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.290 
doing the time which in this case is
going<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.530> be<00:02:55.590> my<00:02:55.709> right<00:02:55.830> hand<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.790> cross

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
going to be my right hand is that cross

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.860 
going to be my right hand is that cross
is<00:02:57.600> distal<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.860> then<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.520> just<00:02:59.730> then<00:03:00.480> will<00:03:00.690> go

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
is distal and then you just then will go

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.420 
is distal and then you just then will go
ahead<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.140> do<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.380> one-handed<00:03:01.800> tie<00:03:02.010> like<00:03:02.280> we've

bring it down and now we're flat but

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.020 
bring it down and now we're flat but
this<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.110> loose<00:03:34.290> see<00:03:34.530> how<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.739> pops<00:03:34.950> out<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.880> we

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
this is loose see how it pops out so we

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.960 
this is loose see how it pops out so we
want<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.360> make<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.810> tight<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:38.370> how<00:03:38.610> do<00:03:38.670> we<00:03:38.760> do

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
want to make it tight so how do we do

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.509 
want to make it tight so how do we do
that<00:03:39.180> what<00:03:39.630> we<00:03:39.750> do<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.260> we<00:03:40.560> do<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:40.830> exact<00:03:41.370> same

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
that what we do is we do the exact same

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.180 
that what we do is we do the exact same
throw<00:03:42.030> again<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:43.110> how<00:03:43.230> do<00:03:43.290> we<00:03:43.440> do<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.709> instead

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
throw again so how do we do that instead

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.570 
throw again so how do we do that instead
of<00:03:44.600> supinating<00:03:45.799> we're<00:03:46.799> going<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:47.370> do

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
of supinating we're going to just do

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.199 
of supinating we're going to just do
pistol<00:03:48.000> grip<00:03:48.150> again<00:03:48.510> for<00:03:48.870> both<00:03:49.970> bring<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.090> to

pistol grip again for both bring it to

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.570 
pistol grip again for both bring it to
the<00:03:51.299> midline<00:03:51.630> again<00:03:51.989> just<00:03:52.799> like<00:03:52.890> we<00:03:53.070> did<00:03:53.250> push

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
the midline again just like we did push

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.949 
the midline again just like we did push
it<00:03:53.730> out<00:03:53.940> with<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:55.019> thumb<00:03:55.260> hook<00:03:55.830> it<00:03:55.950> again

push it out catch it and now
we're<00:04:05.910> going<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.330> keep<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.620> strand<00:04:07.980> that

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
we're going to keep the the strand that

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.050 
we're going to keep the the strand that
the<00:04:10.410> non-dominant<00:04:10.800> hand<00:04:11.190> up<00:04:11.430> in<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.760> air<00:04:11.790> and

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
the non-dominant hand up in the air and

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.240 
the non-dominant hand up in the air and
that<00:04:12.360> allows<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.960> slide<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.470> down<00:04:13.500> slip<00:04:14.100> it

that allows you to slide it down slip it
down<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.880> this<00:04:15.030> will<00:04:15.210> tighten<00:04:15.420> see<00:04:15.990> how<00:04:16.080> it

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
down and this will tighten see how it

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.040 
down and this will tighten see how it
tightens<00:04:16.760> so<00:04:17.760> if<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:17.970> keep<00:04:18.180> on<00:04:18.360> throwing<00:04:18.750> this

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
tightens so if I keep on throwing this

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.210 
tightens so if I keep on throwing this
exact<00:04:19.530> same<00:04:19.770> throw<00:04:20.270> it's<00:04:21.270> just<00:04:21.480> going<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.870> be

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
exact same throw it's just going to be

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.530 
exact same throw it's just going to be
tight<00:04:23.220> if<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:24.510> don't<00:04:24.720> lock<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.200> what<00:04:25.350> happens<00:04:25.770> is

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
tight if I don't lock it what happens is

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.350 
tight if I don't lock it what happens is
if<00:04:27.540> you<00:04:27.690> take<00:04:27.900> your<00:04:28.080> suture<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:30.120> hook

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
if you take your suture and you hook

if you take your suture and you hook
underneath<00:04:30.660> here<00:04:33.710> it's<00:04:34.710> going<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:34.950> slip<00:04:35.160> see

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
underneath here it's going to slip see

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.970 
underneath here it's going to slip see
how<00:04:35.490> it's<00:04:35.670> slipping<00:04:36.440> so<00:04:37.440> that's<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.770> sign<00:04:37.950> of

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
how it's slipping so that's the sign of

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.910 
how it's slipping so that's the sign of
a<00:04:38.190> slip<00:04:38.370> knot<00:04:38.400> watch<00:04:38.820> what<00:04:39.000> happens<00:04:39.240> here

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
a slip knot watch what happens here

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.230 
a slip knot watch what happens here
it<00:04:40.920> comes<00:04:41.190> undone<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.700> just<00:04:41.880> slipped<00:04:42.150> right

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
it comes undone it just slipped right

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.290 
it comes undone it just slipped right
out<00:04:42.480> because<00:04:42.930> these<00:04:43.200> weren't<00:04:43.380> locked<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:45.240> you

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
out because these weren't locked so you

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.060 
out because these weren't locked so you
have<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.780> be<00:04:45.870> careful<00:04:46.230> with<00:04:46.320> slip<00:04:46.680> knot<00:04:46.890> you
