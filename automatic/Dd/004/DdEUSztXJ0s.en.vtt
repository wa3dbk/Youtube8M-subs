00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.300
 more video with the pet tester today 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.900
 a little update or if you can 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.010
 better on 16 january 2013 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.910
 certain the version 1.2 was published a 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.570
 few days of preview version 1.1 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.230
 appeared 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.349
 but there were not many innovations 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.560
 there were just bugfixes and that one 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.170
 It can make it up to the four teams 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.739
 I can also briefly show such teams 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.180
 fourth against every two teams three teams 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.750
 four teams or all putsch against the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:52.190
 player as a computer controlled 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:56.789
 against a yes and the 2142 was just 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.670
 with four new maps and again bugfixes 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.549
 the settings because I can so short 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.260
 So they are new for sensitive 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.940
 to come 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:20.140
 you can just adjust how far you go 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:22.680
 can see so narrow highway came too 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.009
 and make up 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.619
 I do at times at the beginning of of Sun 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.170
 Now we go to box then go 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.759
 I'll show you the new maps and 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:42.429
 Although this is the lhp version 2 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:46.179
 liter v2 give now purely select 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.310
 okay now with two teams 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.550
 that we can do that here too 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.310
 four sv after me too 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:00.899
 one second 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:03.899
 I 'll do it 15 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.899
 Yes 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.560
 I always film and throw the I take the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.340
 so room down here also sees that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.880
 would have to be new here are the cartridge 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:27.690
 next to the weapon described as an indicator 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:32.700
 so so you can see that now also a 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:36.080
 opponent has now just something yellow around 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.080
 not now 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:46.269
 no idea and then you see 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:50.290
 here offered 1 and 2 shows this in addition to 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.930
 the team where with himself is where 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.019
 just no name over that are just 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.200
 opponents could also here the map 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:04.540
 written here as a house can also 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:08.319
 high and then you have one you have one 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:13.870
 down here either way a little 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:16.470
 labyrinth and then you have been here 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:22.709
 also spawn table here still a few 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.180
 trees did not die again 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.920
 Jan I think I'm much more beautiful 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:33.690
 than where before that there were the 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.690
 internet look great too 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.350
 m 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:47.090
 yes, I think that depends too 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.500
 much less runs against the wall like that 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.590
 then I'll show you the times 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:58.720
 next map sometimes less space 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:02.130
 let's do it 7 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.130
 so now we have it 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:14.950
 for me the ak sees you here 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.950
 house then 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.159
 you have here ne 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.819
 when that where you can not get out always 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.819
 able to see 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:34.539
 then we have a few hills here 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:38.639
 I'll call it now if it happens 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:43.629
 go here so smaller 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:50.650
 that bond was then likely 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:53.879
 I'm still here a little way yes 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.879
 again like over there 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.389
 next to spot we can also go into the 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.710
 house in 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:07.250
 I just do not know what's going on here 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.969
 is not because dying 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.969
 but now 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.600
 we can still down here and that 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.600
 it was also from the mep 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.720
 after killing shortly 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.900
 so we can do that too if you're on 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.910
 Pause here on the middle press 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.030
 anyone can commit suicide 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:38.390
 Do not know what to do 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.520
 but we should do it 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:44.420
 already here you can now 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.870
 to adjust reached it can go 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:54.860
 here infinitely two minutes five minutes 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:06:01.660
 ten minutes of 520 50 years so go 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:03.630
 now to the next web and that the country 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.110
 saves 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:10.250
 Let's take that too now 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.710
 right in such a small house 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.900
 the only material looks the app to me 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.590
 so great to here simply as a 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.220
 Wall 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:26.970
 there in the house there is a new exit 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.070
 came out we go but otherwise true 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:33.000
 Actually, there is nothing on the map 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:36.090
 just show it just in there 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.290
 to see the house and the wall here 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.290
 now easy to the next 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.940
 to the bunker start 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.529
 so 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:56.869
 topic in my name you can already hear 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:59.559
 here in the underground bunker with 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:59.559
 many gang 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:14.610
 here in the small room such a camp 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.610
 Maybe it could be munitions space 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:22.560
 there are many ways here as well 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.560
 nice map 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:30.709
 So now the camera has to be this short 

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:33.080
 we lay as I said I think 

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:37.610
 actually all the maps that were added 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.800
 Well the old country looked that way 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:43.569
 not really so good anymore 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:48.489
 But nothing at all is me so far 

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:48.489
 always another room 

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:58.370
 yes, I was also quite surprising 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:05.450
 cards because the where at the beginning was only there 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:08.260
 not good drive yes the link to the review 

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.640
 you can find in the video description 

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:16.360
 that was it from the update 

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.360
 review until the next video
