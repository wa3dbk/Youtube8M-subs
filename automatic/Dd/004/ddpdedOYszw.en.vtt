00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
extensions because out of the three

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.280 
extensions because out of the three
types<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.609> they<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.600> one's<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.140> one

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
types that they do this one's the one

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.859 
types that they do this one's the one
that's<00:01:04.559> most<00:01:04.860> similar<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.640> my<00:01:05.880> curl<00:01:06.270> type<00:01:06.630> I'd

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869

say<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.610> see<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.180> bundle<00:01:09.510> is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
say so you can see one bundle is

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.109 
say so you can see one bundle is
actually<00:01:10.409> really<00:01:10.770> quite<00:01:10.979> thick<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.820> hasn't

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
hair a break so first of all when you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.560 
hair a break so first of all when you
take<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.970> don't<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
take it out the but I don't know if you

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.090 
take it out the but I don't know if you
ever<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.229> I'd<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> smell<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
ever do this but I'd like to smell the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.890 
ever do this but I'd like to smell the
hair<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:36.360> sometimes<00:01:36.570> hair

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
hair and because sometimes hair

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.539 
hair and because sometimes hair
extensions<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.470> whip<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.340> but

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
extensions can whip a little bit but

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.880 
extensions can whip a little bit but
this<00:01:38.939> actually<00:01:39.299> doesn't<00:01:39.630> smell<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.380> anything

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
this actually doesn't smell of anything

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.310 
this actually doesn't smell of anything
basically<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.610> doesn't<00:01:41.729> smell<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.509> chemicals

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
basically it doesn't smell of chemicals

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.899 
basically it doesn't smell of chemicals
or<00:01:43.470> anything<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.549> hundred<00:01:44.790> percent

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
or anything this is a hundred percent

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.600 
or anything this is a hundred percent
human<00:01:45.450> hair<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.740> apply<00:01:47.040> heat<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
human hair so you can apply heat to it

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
lot lace closure so with this it means

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.050

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
the top obviously better than this and

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.759 
the top obviously better than this and
then<00:03:18.910> it's<00:03:19.120> gonna<00:03:19.239> blend<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.810> with<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.320> curl

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
then it's gonna blend in with the curl

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.170 
then it's gonna blend in with the curl
so<00:03:21.040> I'm<00:03:21.100> just<00:03:21.190> gonna<00:03:21.280> have<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.489> full<00:03:21.850> head<00:03:22.150> of
