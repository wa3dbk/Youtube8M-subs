00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.899
 the handball players from haro stood this 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.000
 weekend for a difficult job 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.490
 the rotterdammers join the hague 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.769
 hellas for promotion to the premier league 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.820
 the first competition in Rotterdam 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.139
 ended in one 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.900
 2115 defeat and Saturday was the reed 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.640
 in the hague and so the assignment is for 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.680
 clearly also win her with 7 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.269
 goals difference and rotterdammer 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.050
 player at the highest next season 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.539
 level 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.330
 jordy bayens put her here for it 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.910
 first ahead in the first 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.800
 competition was hellish with one and 2015 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.090
 too strong but during the match 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.160
 the rotterdam people have the hague 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.059
 actually getting a head start that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.059
 varies in size 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.879
 this is the two four of dani baeyens 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.670
 the lead had a lot by the way 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.620
 could be bigger for her oh like the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.050
 Peter Rabbit's team is a bit precise 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.730
 he had dealt with the opportunities in particular 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.730
 the penalties are not successful 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.280
 6 hello eventually 2 get it 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.950
 but use the herman guidance 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.840
 scores 6 out of 6 so we are then 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.659
 now in the second half as her 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.430
 red margin is trying to bring a7 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.430
 here is the stand 1319 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.100
 jar but at the expense of one 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.520
 violation and therefore the penalty for 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.520
 haro 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:41.440
 jordi baeyens now accurate and he 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.659
 finally knocked once from 7 meters 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.340
 so the hole is so seven points this 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.440
 holding means next season 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.030
 active in the premier division 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.500
 but knew how to play well 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.840
 two minutes 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.640
 and now he was of course like one 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.950
 looking for that second goal 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.420
 made a violation on this semi 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.030
 founder 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.789
 is going to take the punishment himself and save 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.789
 that good we 1420 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.500
 and then ho needs another goal 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.269
 time is ticking away it's the absolute 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.690
 final phase 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.790
 if hairs are still free, they are also entitled 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.480
 Now not Bazoer and right again 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.380
 violation and therefore another free ball 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.380
 they go crazy at hellas 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.730
 it will be the last action time 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.650
 sit on it 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.239
 jordy baeyens must do it and one 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.609
 it is detection 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.959
 and that is about that means none 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.959
 promotion for her 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.390
 yes yes but more importantly for us 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.520
 the week how to put your doll down then 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.520
 two good season not played 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.210
 had a good close and that is 200% 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.460
 succeeded 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.100
 if you win old with 6 do differences 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.040
 from premier league team and if you look what 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.720
 with us for age of walking around 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.490
 late I am more than satisfied of course 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.860
 t that a dime of course beautiful 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.030
 but that has happened now and we 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.230
 if it is your good season or 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.880
 that does you go back in wax or 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.200
 not we have had a good season and 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.180
 you can be proud of that you don't have to 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.530
 cup down data is good 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.080
 who look like your premier league team 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.730
 first half to four after 25 minutes by 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.560
 of that country 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.050
 that means that you are doing very well 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.850
 and you can see if someone is performing 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.010
 and then you hear breakout 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.480
 need two three lanes away 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.190
 yes so under load we cannot do that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.050
 on training then it must come with that 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.820
 age and as that group together 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.900
 continues then I think we can still 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.900
 can enjoy
