00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
talking my head and went to sleep and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.920 
talking my head and went to sleep and
because<00:02:26.880> i<00:02:26.970> know<00:02:27.030> i<00:02:27.150> had<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.330> go<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.510> work<00:02:27.600> today

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
because i know i had to go to work today

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.050 
because i know i had to go to work today
and<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:29.220> all<00:02:29.370> going<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.790> ponytail

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
and so it's all going in a ponytail

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.180 
and so it's all going in a ponytail
anyway<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:31.200> really<00:02:31.530> doesn't<00:02:31.800> even<00:02:32.040> matter

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
anyway so it really doesn't even matter

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.190 
anyway so it really doesn't even matter
how<00:02:32.430> about<00:02:32.990> care<00:02:33.990> but<00:02:34.740> um<00:02:35.510> overall<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.020> like

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
how about care but um overall I do like

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.180 
how about care but um overall I do like
this<00:02:37.620> hair<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:39.140> can't<00:02:40.140> say<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:40.980> will

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190

actually<00:02:41.700> buy<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.030> again<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.930> feel<00:02:43.200> like<00:02:43.610> once<00:02:44.610> I

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
actually buy it again I feel like once I

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.850 
actually buy it again I feel like once I
really<00:02:45.090> get<00:02:45.450> into<00:02:45.870> exploiting<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.650> whole

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
really get into exploiting this whole

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.470 
really get into exploiting this whole
hair<00:02:47.220> thing<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.730> different<00:02:48.030> types<00:02:48.240> and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
hair thing and different types and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.230 
hair thing and different types and
textures<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.020> hair<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.970> don't<00:02:50.970> think<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.209> ever

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
textures of hair I don't think I ever

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.880 
textures of hair I don't think I ever
come<00:02:51.630> back<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.110> one<00:02:52.350> but<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.680> was<00:02:52.860> a

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
come back to this one but this was a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.680 
come back to this one but this was a
good<00:02:53.160> first<00:02:53.520> starter<00:02:54.120> because<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.540> all<00:02:54.660> know

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
good first starter because you all know

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.199 
good first starter because you all know
that<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.440> was<00:02:55.890> my<00:02:56.100> first<00:02:56.280> virgin<00:02:56.610> hair<00:02:56.940> ever

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
that this was my first virgin hair ever

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.650 
that this was my first virgin hair ever
and<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.880> i<00:03:00.000> did<00:03:00.209> pay<00:03:01.160> i<00:03:02.420> didn't<00:03:03.420> pay<00:03:03.510> that

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
and so and i did pay i didn't pay that

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.350 
and so and i did pay i didn't pay that
much<00:03:03.720> for<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.490> think<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.610> longest<00:03:05.970> bundle<00:03:06.300> was

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
much for it think the longest bundle was

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.470 
much for it think the longest bundle was
like<00:03:06.630> 99<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.980> i<00:03:08.040> didn't<00:03:08.310> pay<00:03:08.430> too<00:03:09.060> much<00:03:09.090> further

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
like 99 so i didn't pay too much further

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.780 
like 99 so i didn't pay too much further
hair<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.410> it's<00:03:11.010> really<00:03:11.100> good<00:03:11.370> here<00:03:11.580> but<00:03:11.730> i

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
hair so it's it's really good here but i

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.240 
hair so it's it's really good here but i
feel<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.350> there's<00:03:13.350> probably<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.800> lot<00:03:14.070> of

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
feel like there's probably a lot of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.610 
feel like there's probably a lot of
better<00:03:14.430> here<00:03:14.700> too<00:03:14.940> because<00:03:15.150> i'm<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:16.080> newbie<00:03:16.470> to

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
better here too because i'm a newbie to

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.330 
better here too because i'm a newbie to
this<00:03:16.769> virgin<00:03:17.310> thing<00:03:17.489> so<00:03:18.590> yeah<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:19.920> over<00:03:20.310> all

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
this virgin thing so yeah but over all

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.750 
this virgin thing so yeah but over all
his<00:03:21.180> hair<00:03:21.420> has<00:03:21.690> held<00:03:22.050> up<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:23.190> think<00:03:23.580> it's

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
his hair has held up is I think it's

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.810 
his hair has held up is I think it's
done<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.480> justice<00:03:25.110> is<00:03:25.260> done<00:03:25.470> his<00:03:25.680> job<00:03:25.760> but<00:03:26.760> I

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
done is justice is done his job but I

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.310 
done is justice is done his job but I
think<00:03:27.150> it's<00:03:27.300> just<00:03:27.360> really<00:03:27.630> any<00:03:27.870> time<00:03:28.140> to

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
think it's just really any time to

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.640 
think it's just really any time to
retire<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.950> tater<00:03:29.160> because<00:03:29.610> i<00:03:30.500> don't<00:03:31.500> know<00:03:31.560> i

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
retire the tater because i don't know i

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.860
