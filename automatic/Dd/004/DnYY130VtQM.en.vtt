00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
dollars that i paid for it it certainly

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.560 
dollars that i paid for it it certainly

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.730 
is the main antagonist in the game and
where<00:01:42.009> I<00:01:42.039> felt<00:01:42.549> that<00:01:43.020> Megaman<00:01:44.020> truly<00:01:44.409> shine

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
where I felt that Megaman truly shine

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.520 
where I felt that Megaman truly shine
was<00:01:45.340> in<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.209> platforming<00:01:46.899> in<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.140> level

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
was in the platforming in the level

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.889 
was in the platforming in the level
design<00:01:47.649> I<00:01:48.099> thought<00:01:48.399> that<00:01:48.700> deep<00:01:48.939> levels<00:01:49.659> were

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
design I thought that deep levels were

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.279 
design I thought that deep levels were
very<00:01:50.170> well<00:01:50.590> designed<00:01:50.979> I<00:01:51.429> thought<00:01:52.270> that<00:01:52.329> there

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
very well designed I thought that there

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.289 
very well designed I thought that there
were<00:01:53.439> a<00:01:53.649> lot<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:53.950> moments<00:01:54.340> where<00:01:54.849> your

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
were a lot of moments where your

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.569 
were a lot of moments where your
platforming<00:01:55.990> skills<00:01:56.409> were<00:01:56.740> put<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.340> test

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
platforming skills were put to the test

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.719 
platforming skills were put to the test
and<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:58.929> was<00:01:58.959> refreshing<00:01:59.590> and<00:02:00.159> I<00:02:00.520> would<00:02:00.700> argue

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
and it was refreshing and I would argue

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.770 
and it was refreshing and I would argue
that<00:02:01.390> it's<00:02:01.750> a<00:02:01.989> lot<00:02:02.319> like<00:02:02.739> contra<00:02:03.399> 4<00:02:03.729> in<00:02:04.119> this

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
that it's a lot like contra 4 in this

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.370 
that it's a lot like contra 4 in this
respect<00:02:04.989> in<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.159> respect<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.959> levels

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
respect in the respect that the levels

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.979 
respect in the respect that the levels
are<00:02:08.590> very<00:02:08.769> well<00:02:09.310> designed<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.149> there's<00:02:10.720> a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
are very well designed and there's a

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.800 
are very well designed and there's a
good<00:02:11.470> mix<00:02:11.799> of<00:02:12.090> stuff<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.329> you've<00:02:13.569> seen

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
good mix of stuff that you've seen

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.190 
good mix of stuff that you've seen
before<00:02:13.989> as<00:02:14.620> well<00:02:14.799> as<00:02:15.010> new<00:02:15.250> stuff<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:17.109> a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
before as well as new stuff so it's a

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.740 
before as well as new stuff so it's a
really<00:02:17.380> refreshing<00:02:17.889> experience<00:02:18.370> as<00:02:19.359> far<00:02:19.600> as

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
really refreshing experience as far as

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.200 
really refreshing experience as far as
the<00:02:19.900> platforming<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.709> concerned

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.880 

another<00:02:27.110> area<00:02:27.530> where
