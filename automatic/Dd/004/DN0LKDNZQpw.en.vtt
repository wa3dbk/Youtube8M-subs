 to the maximum controls and deployed 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.870
 thousands of troops to ensure that 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.429
 everything went perfectly the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.200
 security was one of the subjects 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.910
 essential in the agenda of this end of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.290
 week at the summit of the Americas in 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.269
 Colombia 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.820
 but maybe what the president of the us 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.830
 he did not expect when he arrived was that his 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.869
 own bodyguards the men to 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.660
 who trusts his personal security 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.369
 they were involved in a scandal the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.380
 secret services have confirmed that 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.480
 part of the staff sent to Cartagena 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.099
 of Indians has been returned home in 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.279
 means of behavior complaints 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.279
 inappropriate 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.649
 internal sources entrusted to media 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.170
 Americans that the days before 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.710
 the arrival of barack obama one or more 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.149
 agents got involved with prostitutes 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.550
 an official who did not want to be 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.140
 identified said there are 12 agents 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.010
 under investigation 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.600
 it's certainly not the issue that the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.910
 President candidate for reelection 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.329
 wants on the table in this meeting 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 with his Latin American peers the way 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.040
 to colombia he stopped in tampa florida and 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.489
 He said he wanted the summit to result in more 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.489
 job 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.619
 may have highlighted the importance 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.720
 of the region but some leaders 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.289
 regional do not feel that love of part 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.289
 from the USA 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.590
 or abandoned 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.590
 Actions 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.360
 and important issues that come back out 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.670
 to the light 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.710
 the president of venezuela hugo chÃ¡vez 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.760
 it is not at the summit because it will receive 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.980
 cancer treatment in Cuba ' 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.690
 from the balcony of the town in Caracas 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.320
 whipped up the topics discussed in 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.320
 cartagena 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.689
 and these two governments usa and canada 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.210
 they refuse to discuss such issues 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.009
 deeply consubstantial with being 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.950
 of Latin America and the Caribbean as the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.250
 cuba's sister cuba's theme 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.840
 solidaria cuba or the theme of the islands 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.140
 malvinas so that more summit of the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.670
 americas then there would be while in 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.349
 Colombia, those present expect the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.390
 summit itself bring commercial benefits 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.209
 and that the episode of the bodyguards 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.440
 Obama's story becomes the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.440
 that generate the resources
