00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.800
 how many types of robots 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:17.009
 There are several classifications but the most 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.009
 diffused includes four types 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.190
 manipulators 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:29.230
 Learning 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:29.230
 with hoist and smart sensor control 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.570
 the first generation of robots is that of 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.160
 the manipulators 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.440
 it's about mechanical systems 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.920
 multifunctional with a system of 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:51.000
 manual control of fixed sequence or 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.990
 very easy to manipulate variable 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.440
 the second generation of robots 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:02.100
 it includes those of learning that repeat 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.270
 a series of movements previously 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.930
 made by a human operator and this one 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.610
 the robots follow them and the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.500
 hold 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.980
 then there are the robots with control 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.310
 hoisted sensor 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:25.020
 this monitoring is done by a 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:29.520
 computer that follows the indications 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:34.240
 of a program and send them to the robot 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:38.340
 to make the required movements 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.300
 finally the intelligent robots 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.810
 although similar to the previous ones 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:50.430
 They have sensors that data is output 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.990
 to the control computer over the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.549
 process alternatives 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.299
 in this way you can make decisions 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:06.340
 in an intelligent way and control the 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.340
 real-time process
