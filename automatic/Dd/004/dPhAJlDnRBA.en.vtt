any of that crap now we're onto prepping
our<00:02:46.579> new<00:02:47.150> engine<00:02:47.569> same<00:02:47.930> motors<00:02:48.349> still<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
our new engine same motors still the

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.910 
our new engine same motors still the

factory 240sx engine makes about 140

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.789 
factory 240sx engine makes about 140
horsepower<00:02:52.250> stock<00:02:52.760> but<00:02:53.060> before<00:02:53.900> we<00:02:53.989> put<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.380> we

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
horsepower stock but before we put in we

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.350 
horsepower stock but before we put in we
got<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.069> isis<00:02:55.519> turbo<00:02:55.849> kit<00:02:56.060> we're<00:02:56.180> going<00:02:56.299> to

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
got this isis turbo kit we're going to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.839 
got this isis turbo kit we're going to
throw<00:02:56.599> on<00:02:56.750> there<00:02:56.930> get<00:02:57.110> about<00:02:57.349> another<00:02:57.590> 100<00:02:58.250> 120

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
throw on there get about another 100 120

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.270 
throw on there get about another 100 120
horsepower<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.480> right<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.900> said<00:03:00.200> make<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.099> way

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
horsepower so right I said make it way

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.970 
horsepower so right I said make it way
more<00:03:01.519> fun<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.790> drive<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.110> turbo<00:03:06.500> and

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
more fun to drive so this is turbo and

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.890 
more fun to drive so this is turbo and
it's<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.250> manifold<00:03:07.670> turbos<00:03:08.420> are<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.600> most

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
it's the manifold turbos are the most

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.750 
it's the manifold turbos are the most
cost<00:03:09.200> effective<00:03:09.319> way<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.829> add<00:03:10.069> horsepower<00:03:10.310> to

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
cost effective way to add horsepower to

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.430 
cost effective way to add horsepower to
your<00:03:10.880> car<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.359> manifold<00:03:12.019> is<00:03:12.049> going<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.260> bolt

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
your car the manifold is going to bolt

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.710 
your car the manifold is going to bolt
to<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.590> side<00:03:12.889> on<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.130> exhaust<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.850> turbo

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
to the side on the exhaust and turbo

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.390 
to the side on the exhaust and turbo
bolts<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.139> this<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.560> basically<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:16.040> exhaust

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
bolts to this and basically the exhaust

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.460 
bolts to this and basically the exhaust
gas<00:03:16.639> is<00:03:16.880> going<00:03:17.150> through<00:03:17.450> these<00:03:17.690> runners<00:03:18.079> here

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
gas is going through these runners here

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.379 
gas is going through these runners here
are<00:03:18.920> going<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.190> spool<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.639> turbo<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.209> help

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
are going to spool the turbo to help

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.910 
are going to spool the turbo to help
compress<00:03:20.720> more<00:03:21.079> air<00:03:21.319> getting<00:03:21.620> into<00:03:21.799> the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
compress more air getting into the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.270 
compress more air getting into the
engine

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
engine

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.099 
engine
so<00:03:22.579> more<00:03:22.940> air<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.329> fuel<00:03:23.540> makes<00:03:23.930> more

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
so more air and fuel makes more

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:31.420
