end up at the the same place a practical
method<00:00:21.499> is<00:00:21.890> to<00:00:22.310> determine<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:23.720> chain<00:00:23.989> length

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
method is to determine the chain length

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.099 
method is to determine the chain length
from<00:00:24.499> our<00:00:24.619> largest<00:00:25.130> front<00:00:25.609> chain<00:00:25.880> ring<00:00:26.109> and

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
from our largest front chain ring and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.589 
from our largest front chain ring and
compare<00:00:27.859> it<00:00:27.949> with<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:28.550> chain<00:00:28.909> the<00:00:29.239> largest

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
compare it with the chain the largest

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.470 
compare it with the chain the largest
sprocket<00:00:30.079> and<00:00:30.439> back<00:00:30.640> make<00:00:31.640> sure<00:00:31.939> that<00:00:32.180> we<00:00:32.329> have

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
sprocket and back make sure that we have

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.030 
sprocket and back make sure that we have
enough<00:00:32.750> chain<00:00:33.079> to<00:00:33.350> shift<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.920> that

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
enough chain to shift to that

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.630 
enough chain to shift to that
combination<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.750> our<00:00:35.899> large<00:00:36.260> large<00:00:36.949> method

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
combination so our large large method

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.360 
combination so our large large method
here<00:00:38.000> we're<00:00:38.840> going<00:00:38.930> to<00:00:38.989> add<00:00:39.230> an<00:00:39.469> extra<00:00:39.680> inch

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
here we're going to add an extra inch

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.689 
here we're going to add an extra inch
which<00:00:40.670> is<00:00:40.820> two<00:00:41.059> rivets<00:00:41.679> two<00:00:42.679> extra<00:00:43.100> rivets<00:00:43.550> is

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
which is two rivets two extra rivets is

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.779 
which is two rivets two extra rivets is
one<00:00:43.940> inch<00:00:44.149> of<00:00:44.269> chain<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:46.070> ensure<00:00:46.429> that<00:00:46.640> we're

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
one inch of chain to ensure that we're

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.400 
one inch of chain to ensure that we're
able<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.090> uh<00:00:47.239> to<00:00:47.600> make<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:47.989> shift<00:00:48.260> without

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
able to uh to make that shift without

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.569 
able to uh to make that shift without
damage<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.129> our<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:50.629> our<00:00:50.660> derailleur<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:52.460> do

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
damage to our to our derailleur so to do

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.750 
damage to our to our derailleur so to do
this<00:00:52.760> we're<00:00:53.089> going<00:00:53.210> to<00:00:53.300> use<00:00:53.570> our<00:00:53.750> cable<00:00:54.230> and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
this we're going to use our cable and

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.709 
this we're going to use our cable and
shift<00:00:55.989> up<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.469> large<00:00:57.710> ring<00:00:58.329> but<00:00:59.329> we're<00:00:59.480> not

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
shift up to the large ring but we're not

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.579 
shift up to the large ring but we're not
going<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.079> shift<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.710> rear<00:01:01.870> so<00:01:02.870> we're<00:01:03.409> simply

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
going to shift the rear so we're simply

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.730 
going to shift the rear so we're simply
going<00:01:03.829> to<00:01:03.890> lay<00:01:04.100> this<00:01:04.339> chain<00:01:04.699> in<00:01:05.200> not<00:01:06.200> connect

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
going to lay this chain in not connect

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.500 
going to lay this chain in not connect
it<00:01:06.890> right<00:01:06.920> now<00:01:07.280> because<00:01:07.550> we<00:01:07.850> know<00:01:08.000> our<00:01:08.030> chains

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
it right now because we know our chains

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.170 
it right now because we know our chains
not<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.960> right<00:01:09.140> length<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:09.500> we're<00:01:09.740> not<00:01:10.180> we're

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
not the right length so we're not we're

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.130 
not the right length so we're not we're
not<00:01:11.300> going<00:01:11.480> to<00:01:11.540> push<00:01:11.810> any<00:01:12.080> rivet<00:01:12.560> Center<00:01:12.860> out

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
not going to push any rivet Center out

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.480 
not going to push any rivet Center out
just<00:01:15.140> yet<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:17.720> largest<00:01:18.110> largest<00:01:18.650> would<00:01:19.190> be

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
just yet so the largest largest would be

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.660 
just yet so the largest largest would be
like<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.240> as<00:01:20.450> if<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:20.750> were<00:01:20.870> one<00:01:21.200> speed<00:01:21.520> we<00:01:22.520> could

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
like so as if it were one speed we could

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.520 
like so as if it were one speed we could
join<00:01:22.970> right<00:01:23.390> here<00:01:24.190> well<00:01:25.190> that's<00:01:25.960> too<00:01:26.960> short<00:01:27.290> we

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
join right here well that's too short we

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.850 
join right here well that's too short we
have<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:27.830> go<00:01:27.980> one<00:01:28.340> two<00:01:29.050> two<00:01:30.050> more<00:01:30.230> rivets<00:01:30.680> would

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
have to go one two two more rivets would

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.570 
have to go one two two more rivets would
be<00:01:31.040> here<00:01:31.870> that's<00:01:32.870> that's<00:01:33.680> an<00:01:33.830> additional<00:01:34.370> inch

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
be here that's that's an additional inch

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.440 
be here that's that's an additional inch
and<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.720> gives<00:01:36.110> us<00:01:36.350> enough<00:01:36.970> bend<00:01:37.970> in<00:01:38.330> our

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
and that gives us enough bend in our

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.580 
and that gives us enough bend in our
rear<00:01:38.780> mechanism<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:40.190> allow<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:40.790> shift<00:01:41.590> so

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
rear mechanism to to allow that shift so

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.280 
rear mechanism to to allow that shift so
we<00:01:42.620> do<00:01:43.160> want<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.520> allow<00:01:44.150> that<00:01:44.210> combination<00:01:44.780> so

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
we do want to allow that combination so

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.830 
we do want to allow that combination so
we<00:01:45.410> don't<00:01:45.610> don't<00:01:46.610> damage<00:01:46.940> things<00:01:47.390> if<00:01:47.570> we<00:01:47.690> do

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
we don't don't damage things if we do

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.820 
we don't don't damage things if we do
get<00:01:47.990> in<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:48.350> gear<00:01:49.090> this<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.540> two<00:01:51.380> by<00:01:51.410> 10

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830

this<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.740> we<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.640> add<00:02:39.080> we<00:02:40.080> have<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.350> add

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
this and we have to add we have to add

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.880 
this and we have to add we have to add
that<00:02:40.800> extra<00:02:41.310> inch<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.959> make<00:02:43.380> sure<00:02:43.590> we<00:02:43.740> get

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that extra inch to make sure we get

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.449 
that extra inch to make sure we get
through<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.700> derailleur<00:02:45.150> pulleys<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.459> this

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
through the derailleur pulleys so this

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.800 
through the derailleur pulleys so this
is<00:02:48.000> formula<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:50.370> described<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.420> perc<00:02:51.600> tool

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
is formula is described on the perc tool

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.890 
is formula is described on the perc tool
website<00:02:52.770> in<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.400> chain<00:02:54.170> how-to<00:02:55.170> section<00:02:55.739> and

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
website in the chain how-to section and

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.010 
website in the chain how-to section and
there's<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.989> rigorous<00:02:59.390> equation<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.690> simple

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
there's a rigorous equation and a simple

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.530 
there's a rigorous equation and a simple
equation<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.280> cogs<00:03:02.520> are<00:03:02.790> very<00:03:02.940> similar<00:03:03.270> in

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
equation of the cogs are very similar in

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.320 
equation of the cogs are very similar in
size<00:03:03.750> like<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.650> simple<00:03:05.489> equation<00:03:05.670> work<00:03:06.090> so

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
size like this a simple equation work so

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:18.300 
size like this a simple equation work so
it<00:03:06.480> works<00:03:06.660> quite<00:03:06.959> well

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.970 

so<00:03:19.310> -<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:20.269> do<00:03:20.450> this<00:03:20.690> as<00:03:20.900> an<00:03:21.050> example<00:03:21.379> here<00:03:21.830> we

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
so - to do this as an example here we

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.869 
so - to do this as an example here we
measure<00:03:22.250> from<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.670> rear<00:03:22.700> stay<00:03:24.129> the<00:03:25.129> center<00:03:25.760> of

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
measure from the rear stay the center of

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.839 
measure from the rear stay the center of
the<00:03:25.970> axle<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.440> front<00:03:27.769> here<00:03:28.129> and<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:28.670> one

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
the axle to the front here and this one

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:36.280 
the axle to the front here and this one
luckily<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.959> our<00:03:31.120> 18<00:03:32.709> 18<00:03:33.709> inches<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:35.720> if<00:03:36.080> it

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
luckily is our 18 18 inches and if it

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.670 
luckily is our 18 18 inches and if it
was<00:03:36.470> off<00:03:36.709> there<00:03:37.040> we<00:03:37.190> would<00:03:37.400> round<00:03:38.260> we<00:03:39.260> would<00:03:39.470> do

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
was off there we would round we would do

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.910 
was off there we would round we would do
the<00:03:39.799> eight<00:03:40.010> closest<00:03:40.489> eighth<00:03:40.700> inch<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:42.560> then

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
the eight closest eighth inch and then

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.190 
the eight closest eighth inch and then
do<00:03:43.099> our<00:03:43.129> rounding<00:03:43.670> at<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.940> end<00:03:44.120> we<00:03:44.870> could<00:03:44.959> only

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
do our rounding at the end we could only

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.220 
do our rounding at the end we could only
shorten<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.650> chain<00:03:45.920> by<00:03:46.190> one<00:03:46.610> inch<00:03:47.049> increments

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
shorten a chain by one inch increments

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.589 
shorten a chain by one inch increments
you<00:03:48.920> cannot<00:03:49.280> shorten<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.790> chain<00:03:50.030> an<00:03:50.209> eighth<00:03:50.420> of

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
you cannot shorten a chain an eighth of

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.319 
you cannot shorten a chain an eighth of
an<00:03:50.720> inch<00:03:50.840> or<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.200> quarter<00:03:51.829> of<00:03:52.040> an<00:03:52.250> inch<00:03:52.370> so<00:03:52.730> we

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
an inch or a quarter of an inch so we

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.800 
an inch or a quarter of an inch so we
can<00:03:54.260> do<00:03:54.380> our<00:03:54.500> rounding<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.069> at<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.489> end<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:56.720> if

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
can do our rounding it at the end so if

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.610 
can do our rounding it at the end so if
we<00:03:56.959> have<00:03:57.049> 18<00:03:57.709> inches<00:03:58.130> sprocket<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.120> sprocket

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
we have 18 inches sprocket to sprocket

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.460 
we have 18 inches sprocket to sprocket
so<00:04:00.620> 18<00:04:01.280> times<00:04:01.549> 2<00:04:02.239> will<00:04:02.750> have<00:04:03.610> 36<00:04:04.610> inches<00:04:05.470> from

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
so 18 times 2 will have 36 inches from

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.190 
so 18 times 2 will have 36 inches from
the<00:04:06.769> 18th<00:04:07.579> on<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.910> top<00:04:08.120> 18<00:04:08.569> from<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.780> bottom

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
the 18th on the top 18 from the bottom

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.520 
the 18th on the top 18 from the bottom
36<00:04:09.829> there<00:04:10.069> our<00:04:10.900> formula<00:04:11.900> says<00:04:12.170> take<00:04:12.410> our

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
36 there our formula says take our

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.060 
36 there our formula says take our
largest<00:04:12.890> sprocket<00:04:13.310> divided<00:04:13.970> by<00:04:14.209> 4<00:04:14.629> and<00:04:15.070> our

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
largest sprocket divided by 4 and our

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.610 
largest sprocket divided by 4 and our
largest<00:04:16.489> chainring<00:04:16.940> here<00:04:17.419> and<00:04:17.570> divide<00:04:17.810> by<00:04:18.049> 4

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
largest chainring here and divide by 4

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.120 
largest chainring here and divide by 4
well<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:19.010> math<00:04:19.190> is<00:04:19.400> easy<00:04:19.519> again<00:04:19.970> this<00:04:20.180> is<00:04:20.329> 36

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
well the math is easy again this is 36

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.820 
well the math is easy again this is 36
divided<00:04:22.130> by<00:04:22.250> 4<00:04:22.610> that's<00:04:23.030> 9<00:04:23.900> inches<00:04:24.620> of<00:04:24.680> chain

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
divided by 4 that's 9 inches of chain

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.320 
divided by 4 that's 9 inches of chain
here<00:04:25.600> this<00:04:26.600> is<00:04:26.780> 36<00:04:27.470> as<00:04:27.680> well<00:04:27.889> 9<00:04:28.729> inches<00:04:29.120> of

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
here this is 36 as well 9 inches of

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.400 
here this is 36 as well 9 inches of
chain<00:04:29.360> here<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.289> we<00:04:30.470> have<00:04:30.680> our<00:04:31.630> 36<00:04:32.630> inches<00:04:33.020> plus

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
chain here so we have our 36 inches plus

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.310 
chain here so we have our 36 inches plus
9<00:04:33.860> plus<00:04:34.570> 9<00:04:36.340> 54<00:04:37.340> inches<00:04:37.820> but<00:04:38.660> that's<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:39.110> one

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
9 plus 9 54 inches but that's a one

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.190 
9 plus 9 54 inches but that's a one
speed<00:04:39.500> we<00:04:40.160> do<00:04:40.580> need<00:04:40.970> the<00:04:41.360> extra<00:04:41.389> inch

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
speed we do need the extra inch

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.779 
speed we do need the extra inch
so<00:04:42.950> that's<00:04:43.190> 55<00:04:44.120> inches<00:04:44.539> of<00:04:44.720> chain<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.550> in<00:04:46.550> our

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
so that's 55 inches of chain and in our

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.050 
so that's 55 inches of chain and in our
scenario<00:04:47.000> here<00:04:47.830> if<00:04:48.830> we<00:04:48.950> go<00:04:49.099> over<00:04:49.130> and<00:04:49.610> we

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
scenario here if we go over and we

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.089 
scenario here if we go over and we
measure<00:04:50.360> our<00:04:50.810> chain<00:04:52.240> we<00:04:53.240> start<00:04:53.630> at<00:04:54.070> one<00:04:55.070> end

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
measure our chain we start at one end

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.770 
measure our chain we start at one end
here<00:04:55.669> hold<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.150> tape<00:04:56.360> measure<00:04:56.539> even<00:04:58.780> 55

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
here hold the tape measure even 55

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.270 
here hold the tape measure even 55
inches<00:05:00.320> would<00:05:00.560> be<00:05:00.620> right<00:05:01.099> here<00:05:01.780> 1<00:05:02.780> 2<00:05:03.260> 3<00:05:03.289> 4<00:05:03.770> that

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
inches would be right here 1 2 3 4 that

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.230 
inches would be right here 1 2 3 4 that
fourth<00:05:04.970> rivet<00:05:05.450> once<00:05:05.720> again<00:05:06.169> so<00:05:07.160> it<00:05:07.789> comes<00:05:08.060> out

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
fourth rivet once again so it comes out

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.529 
fourth rivet once again so it comes out
comes<00:05:08.539> out<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:08.930> same<00:05:09.139> so<00:05:10.000> just<00:05:11.000> two<00:05:11.180> different

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
comes out the same so just two different

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.260 
comes out the same so just two different
methods<00:05:11.900> but<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.260> practical<00:05:12.770> method<00:05:13.120> when<00:05:14.120> in

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
methods but the practical method when in

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.120 
methods but the practical method when in
doubt<00:05:14.419> always<00:05:14.720> a<00:05:14.990> good<00:05:15.229> one<00:05:15.349> to<00:05:15.560> use<00:05:15.710> simply

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
doubt always a good one to use simply

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.879 
doubt always a good one to use simply
wrap<00:05:16.400> it<00:05:16.610> large<00:05:16.849> too<00:05:17.120> large<00:05:17.270> so<00:05:17.650> I'm<00:05:18.650> going<00:05:18.830> to

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
wrap it large too large so I'm going to

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.659 
wrap it large too large so I'm going to
cut<00:05:19.070> that<00:05:19.250> fourth<00:05:19.580> rivet<00:05:20.919> so<00:05:21.919> now<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:22.250> chain

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
cut that fourth rivet so now the chain

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.140 
cut that fourth rivet so now the chain
is<00:05:22.940> shortened<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.360> our<00:05:23.660> correct<00:05:24.139> length<00:05:25.150> we're

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
is shortened to our correct length we're

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.180 
is shortened to our correct length we're
going<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:26.539> return<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.530> front<00:05:27.830> derailleur

cages on to the small cog and this is
where<00:06:44.760> we'll<00:06:44.910> join<00:06:45.210> it's<00:06:45.570> a<00:06:45.780> little<00:06:46.620> easier<00:06:47.190> if

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
where we'll join it's a little easier if

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.909 
where we'll join it's a little easier if
we<00:06:47.580> just<00:06:47.760> disconnect<00:06:48.570> entirely<00:06:49.080> we<00:06:49.470> can<00:06:49.620> relax

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
we just disconnect entirely we can relax

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:55.400 
we just disconnect entirely we can relax
that<00:06:50.780> tension<00:06:51.780> quite<00:06:52.020> successfully<00:06:53.750> too<00:06:54.750> to

make this easier easier to join in my

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:08.170 
make this easier easier to join in my
case<00:07:01.260> I'm<00:07:01.530> going<00:07:01.590> to<00:07:01.889> shove<00:07:03.260> rub<00:07:04.260> it<00:07:06.080> outside

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
case I'm going to shove rub it outside

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:20.180 
case I'm going to shove rub it outside
toward<00:07:09.180> the<00:07:09.419> inside<00:07:10.490> so<00:07:13.669> take<00:07:14.669> our<00:07:14.910> chain<00:07:15.240> tool

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.060 

engage<00:07:21.180> the<00:07:21.660> Revit<00:07:21.990> make<00:07:22.260> sure<00:07:22.530> things<00:07:22.860> are

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.070 
engage the Revit make sure things are

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.490 
engage the Revit make sure things are
nice<00:07:23.310> and<00:07:23.760> straight<00:07:24.210> and<00:07:24.480> then<00:07:24.800> we<00:07:25.800> drive

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
nice and straight and then we drive

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.560 
nice and straight and then we drive
drive<00:07:28.500> that<00:07:28.830> in<00:07:29.070> it<00:07:29.280> goes<00:07:29.610> in<00:07:29.820> with<00:07:29.970> resistance

drive that in it goes in with resistance

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.130 
drive that in it goes in with resistance
and<00:07:31.370> a<00:07:32.370> connection<00:07:33.120> rivet<00:07:33.570> will<00:07:33.690> now<00:07:33.810> pass

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.140 
and a connection rivet will now pass

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.850 
and a connection rivet will now pass
through<00:07:34.200> the<00:07:34.620> back<00:07:34.800> plate<00:07:35.160> we<00:07:35.370> will<00:07:35.520> feel<00:07:35.880> a
