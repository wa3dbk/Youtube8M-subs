 urgently for playstation3 first 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.239

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.000

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.640

 suggestions that have been contributing 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.509

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.789
 of development has been trying to correct 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.049

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.740
 it seems if the play really needs 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.440
 disable this the game is wrong 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.970
 developed or the consoles no longer give 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.149
 more times and I want to know your opinion 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.580
