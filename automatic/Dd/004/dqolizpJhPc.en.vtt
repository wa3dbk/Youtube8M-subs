hi guys I'm Heath Manning of man queues

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.440 
hi guys I'm Heath Manning of man queues
this<00:00:07.710> video<00:00:08.100> is<00:00:08.370> going<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.639> be<00:00:08.760> on<00:00:08.850> deflection

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
this video is going to be on deflection

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.660 
this video is going to be on deflection
and<00:00:09.690> how<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.020> compensate<00:00:10.680> for<00:00:10.920> deflection<00:00:11.309> and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
and how to compensate for deflection and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.440 
and how to compensate for deflection and
what<00:00:11.910> deflection<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:13.910> deflection<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.210> very

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
what deflection is deflection is very

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.429 
what deflection is deflection is very
simple<00:00:15.840> deflection<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:17.779> whenever<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:19.140> use

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
simple deflection is whenever you use

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.210 
simple deflection is whenever you use
left<00:00:19.860> or<00:00:20.099> right<00:00:20.430> spin<00:00:20.849> on<00:00:21.149> the<00:00:21.509> cue<00:00:21.720> ball

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
left or right spin on the cue ball

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.409 
left or right spin on the cue ball
you're<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.640> throw<00:00:23.849> the<00:00:23.880> cue<00:00:24.210> ball<00:00:24.390> off

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
you're going to throw the cue ball off

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.499 
you're going to throw the cue ball off

right now and I'm Center ball if I hit

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.720 
right now and I'm Center ball if I hit
that<00:00:30.180> my<00:00:30.960> cue<00:00:31.020> ball<00:00:31.380> will<00:00:31.590> go<00:00:31.800> straight<00:00:31.860> on

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
that my cue ball will go straight on

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
right now how many times and we all have

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.960 
right now how many times and we all have
been<00:00:55.160> if<00:00:56.160> we're<00:00:56.370> being<00:00:56.550> honest<00:00:56.820> with

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
been if we're being honest with

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.150 
been if we're being honest with
ourselves<00:00:57.050> how<00:00:58.050> many<00:00:58.260> times<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.739> got<00:00:59.040> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
ourselves how many times have we got to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.760 
ourselves how many times have we got to
the<00:00:59.250> pool<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.120> had<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> shot<00:01:00.630> like<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.140> right

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the pool and had a shot like this right

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.960 
the pool and had a shot like this right
in<00:01:02.010> front<00:01:02.310> of<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> pocket<00:01:02.880> okay<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:04.970> very

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
in front of the pocket okay a very

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.660 
in front of the pocket okay a very
minimal<00:01:06.450> cut<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> put<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.350> pocket

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
minimal cut to put that in the pocket

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.950 
minimal cut to put that in the pocket
say<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.820> want<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.180> shaped<00:01:09.390> down<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:09.810> for

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
say we want to get shaped down here for

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.910 
say we want to get shaped down here for
this<00:01:10.080> eight<00:01:10.260> ball<00:01:11.240> okay<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.740> we're<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.860> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this eight ball okay so we're going to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.469 
this eight ball okay so we're going to
cut<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.310> we're<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.300> put<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
cut that in we're going to put the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.820 
cut that in we're going to put the
bottoms<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:15.960> cue<00:01:16.140> ball<00:01:16.170> maybe<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.680> little

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
bottoms on the cue ball maybe a little

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
bottoms on the cue ball maybe a little
bit<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.070> Rights<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.610> drag<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.000> down<00:01:18.150> okay

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
bit of Rights and just drag it down okay

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.500 
bit of Rights and just drag it down okay
so<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.260> line<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.580> our<00:01:20.610> exact<00:01:21.090> angle

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
so we line up we have our exact angle

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.570 
so we line up we have our exact angle
that<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.200> pop<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.620> two<00:01:22.770> ball<00:01:22.979> right<00:01:23.430> into

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
that we can pop the two ball right into

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.670 
that we can pop the two ball right into
the<00:01:23.700> corner<00:01:23.970> pocket<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:25.229> go<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> bottom

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the corner pocket we go to the bottom

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.580 
the corner pocket we go to the bottom
the<00:01:25.920> cue<00:01:26.100> ball<00:01:26.600> we<00:01:27.600> move<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.260> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the cue ball we move to the right of the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.170 
the cue ball we move to the right of the
cue<00:01:28.770> ball<00:01:28.799> because<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.490> want<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> suck<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.030> down

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
cue ball because we want to suck it down

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.260 
cue ball because we want to suck it down
there<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.320> spoke<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> ball<00:01:32.270> well

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
there and then we spoke the ball well

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.520 
there and then we spoke the ball well
what<00:01:33.780> happened<00:01:35.330> well<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:36.570> almost<00:01:36.780> hit<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.170> two

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
what happened well I almost hit that two

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.210 
what happened well I almost hit that two
ball<00:01:37.740> dead-on<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.320> almost<00:01:40.320> hit<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.619> two<00:01:40.979> ball

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
ball dead-on I almost hit that two ball

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.899 
ball dead-on I almost hit that two ball
dead-on

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
dead-on

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.820 
dead-on
because<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> didn't<00:01:42.810> compensate<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
because I didn't compensate for the

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.800 
because I didn't compensate for the
right<00:01:44.010> spin<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.580> didn't<00:01:44.880> compensate<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.690> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
right spin I didn't compensate for the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.950 
right spin I didn't compensate for the
deflection<00:01:46.189> caused<00:01:47.189> when<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.549> hit<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.750> right

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
deflection caused when I hit the right

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.649 
deflection caused when I hit the right
side<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> cue<00:01:49.710> ball<00:01:50.119> so<00:01:51.119> now<00:01:51.240> I'm<00:01:51.330> gonna<00:01:51.420> do

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
side of the cue ball so now I'm gonna do

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.500 
side of the cue ball so now I'm gonna do
it<00:01:51.810> face<00:01:52.350> on

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
it face on

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.010 
it face on
okay<00:01:54.510> straight<00:01:54.750> into<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.140> pocket<00:01:56.960> okay<00:01:57.960> so

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
okay straight into that pocket okay so

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.780 
okay straight into that pocket okay so
you<00:01:58.260> can<00:01:58.380> look<00:01:58.530> right<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.250> see<00:01:59.580> what's

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
you can look right down and see what's

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.020 
you can look right down and see what's
going<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.530> when<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> shoot<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.040> shot<00:02:02.310> if

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
going on here when I shoot this shot if

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.570 
going on here when I shoot this shot if
I<00:02:03.180> hit<00:02:03.360> straight<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:04.380> no<00:02:04.560> spin<00:02:04.830> I'm<00:02:05.400> gonna

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
I hit straight on with no spin I'm gonna

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.010 
I hit straight on with no spin I'm gonna
hit<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.880> cue<00:02:06.060> ball<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.900> gonna

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
hit that cue ball then on it it's gonna

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.399 
hit that cue ball then on it it's gonna
go<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.610> when<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> move<00:02:08.939> to<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> right<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
go in when I move to the right of the

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.259 
go in when I move to the right of the
cue<00:02:10.590> ball<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> same<00:02:11.519> shot<00:02:11.849> I'm<00:02:12.120> gonna

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
cue ball and do the same shot I'm gonna

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.539 
cue ball and do the same shot I'm gonna
push<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.779> cue<00:02:13.019> ball<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.499> the<00:02:13.950> left<00:02:14.189> because<00:02:14.430> I

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
push that cue ball to the left because I

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.610 
push that cue ball to the left because I
got<00:02:14.760> great<00:02:14.999> spin<00:02:15.299> on<00:02:15.419> it<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:16.109> now<00:02:16.290> I'm<00:02:16.439> not

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
got great spin on it and now I'm not

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.300 
got great spin on it and now I'm not
gonna<00:02:16.799> hit

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
gonna hit

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.540 
gonna hit
the<00:02:18.180> center<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.890> cue<00:02:20.100> ball<00:02:20.280> pushed

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
the center of the to the cue ball pushed

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.180 
the center of the to the cue ball pushed
over<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:21.030> contact<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.140> what<00:02:22.350> do<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.040> do

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
over on contact so what do I have to do

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.020 
over on contact so what do I have to do
I<00:02:23.430> have<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.480> compensate<00:02:25.170> for<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.160> by<00:02:26.460> aiming

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
I have to compensate for that by aiming

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.050 
I have to compensate for that by aiming
at<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.450> proper<00:02:27.870> location<00:02:28.880> okay

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
at the proper location okay

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.470 
at the proper location okay
so<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.660> what<00:02:30.780> I'm<00:02:30.870> gonna<00:02:30.990> do<00:02:32.480> dead-on

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
so this is what I'm gonna do dead-on

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.220 
so this is what I'm gonna do dead-on
will<00:02:34.050> put<00:02:34.230> me<00:02:34.380> right<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.160> pocket<00:02:35.750> if<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:37.020> put

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
will put me right in the pocket if I put

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.710 
will put me right in the pocket if I put
right<00:02:37.470> spin<00:02:37.830> on<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.100> cue<00:02:38.310> ball<00:02:38.540> that's<00:02:39.540> gonna

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
right spin on the cue ball that's gonna

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.010 
right spin on the cue ball that's gonna
throw<00:02:40.080> my<00:02:40.320> cue<00:02:40.590> ball<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> left<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:42.720> instead

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
throw my cue ball to the left so instead

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.860 
throw my cue ball to the left so instead
of<00:02:43.080> aiming<00:02:43.590> right<00:02:44.490> here<00:02:44.850> with<00:02:45.030> right<00:02:45.270> spin

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
of aiming right here with right spin

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.870 
of aiming right here with right spin
I<00:02:45.900> would<00:02:46.620> aim<00:02:46.830> slightly<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.550> right<00:02:47.820> of

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
I would aim slightly to the right of

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.170 
I would aim slightly to the right of
center<00:02:49.130> because<00:02:50.130> by<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.370> time<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.820> cue<00:02:51.030> ball

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
center because by the time the cue ball

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.720 
center because by the time the cue ball
travels<00:02:51.750> from<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.380> here<00:02:52.739> it<00:02:53.220> will<00:02:53.550> have

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
travels from here to here it will have

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.690 
travels from here to here it will have
shifted<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.780> left<00:02:54.810> if<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.980> put<00:02:56.190> right<00:02:56.400> spin

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
shifted to the left if I put right spin

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.890 
shifted to the left if I put right spin
on<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.270> cue<00:02:57.450> ball<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:59.239> aim<00:03:00.239> up<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.630> shoot<00:03:00.780> a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
on the cue ball so aim up to shoot a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.550 
on the cue ball so aim up to shoot a
dead<00:03:01.110> end

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
dead end

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.760 
dead end
move<00:03:02.459> over<00:03:02.670> maybe<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.480> quarter<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.110> ball<00:03:04.320> so

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
move over maybe a quarter of a ball so

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.140 
move over maybe a quarter of a ball so
you're<00:03:04.890> not<00:03:05.010> aiming<00:03:05.280> directly<00:03:05.520> at<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.000> center

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
you're not aiming directly at the center

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.690 
you're not aiming directly at the center
of<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.630> put<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.739> right<00:03:07.920> spin<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.400> and

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
of the to put the right spin on and

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.930 
of the to put the right spin on and
stroke<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> same<00:03:09.390> shot<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:11.489> see<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> right

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
stroke the same shot you see the right

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.880 
stroke the same shot you see the right
spin<00:03:12.300> it's<00:03:12.750> taking<00:03:13.170> off<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.950> right<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.780> I

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
spin it's taking off to the right and I

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.040 
spin it's taking off to the right and I
made<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.010> shot<00:03:17.250> now<00:03:17.850> all's<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.420> did<00:03:18.450> was<00:03:18.840> change

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
made the shot now all's I did was change

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.020 
made the shot now all's I did was change
my<00:03:19.290> aiming<00:03:19.709> point<00:03:20.750> because<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.870> compensated

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
my aiming point because I compensated

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.930 
my aiming point because I compensated
for<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.209> deflection<00:03:24.450> now<00:03:25.519> you<00:03:26.519> guys<00:03:26.730> won't

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
for the deflection now you guys won't

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.789 
for the deflection now you guys won't
have<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.269> practice<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.170> learn<00:03:28.530> this

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
have to practice this and learn this

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.490 
have to practice this and learn this
because<00:03:29.430> many<00:03:29.910> variables<00:03:30.780> come<00:03:30.989> into<00:03:31.230> contact

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
because many variables come into contact

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.270 
because many variables come into contact
when<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:33.510> tried<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:34.019> use<00:03:34.350> left<00:03:34.739> or<00:03:34.860> right<00:03:34.980> spin

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
when you tried to use left or right spin

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.800 
when you tried to use left or right spin
and<00:03:35.580> that's<00:03:35.730> why<00:03:35.970> when<00:03:36.180> you're<00:03:36.299> shooting<00:03:36.510> and

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
and that's why when you're shooting and

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.750 
and that's why when you're shooting and
you<00:03:36.870> miss<00:03:37.080> some<00:03:37.260> easy<00:03:37.440> shots<00:03:37.560> think<00:03:38.370> back<00:03:38.610> to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
you miss some easy shots think back to

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.729 
you miss some easy shots think back to
yourself<00:03:38.880> deny<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.510> spent<00:03:39.959> on<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.230> shot<00:03:40.470> if

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
yourself deny you spent on that shot if

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.960 
yourself deny you spent on that shot if
you<00:03:41.280> did<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:42.720> probably<00:03:42.750> didn't<00:03:43.380> aim<00:03:44.220> wrong<00:03:44.610> if

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
you did you probably didn't aim wrong if

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.150 
you did you probably didn't aim wrong if
you<00:03:45.360> weren't<00:03:45.660> using<00:03:45.840> spit<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.709> fact<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.130> that

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
you weren't using spit the fact is that

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.580 
you weren't using spit the fact is that
you<00:03:47.670> spin<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.420> didn't<00:03:48.690> compensate<00:03:49.170> for

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
you spin and you didn't compensate for

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.140 
you spin and you didn't compensate for
the<00:03:49.709> new<00:03:49.860> contact<00:03:50.370> point<00:03:50.610> on<00:03:50.820> your<00:03:51.000> object

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
the new contact point on your object

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.870 
the new contact point on your object
ball<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:53.060> whenever<00:03:54.060> you're<00:03:54.360> shooting<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.750> shot

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
ball so whenever you're shooting a shot

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.170 
ball so whenever you're shooting a shot
the<00:03:56.880> distance<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.660> shot<00:03:58.730> affects<00:03:59.730> how

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
the distance of the shot affects how

you're<00:04:58.020> gonna<00:04:58.140> have<00:04:58.320> to<00:04:58.410> aim<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.560> little<00:04:58.800> bit<00:04:58.950> to

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
you're gonna have to aim a little bit to

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.330 
you're gonna have to aim a little bit to

natural aiming point to sink the ball

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.870 
natural aiming point to sink the ball
would<00:05:04.170> be<00:05:04.290> as<00:05:04.800> by<00:05:05.040> the<00:05:05.130> time<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.550> cue<00:05:05.730> ball

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
would be as by the time the cue ball

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.700 
would be as by the time the cue ball
gets<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.360> contact<00:05:06.870> point<00:05:07.080> it<00:05:07.440> will<00:05:07.560> have

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
gets to the contact point it will have

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.440 
gets to the contact point it will have
shifted<00:05:07.920> over<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.550> you<00:05:08.640> will<00:05:08.820> make<00:05:09.000> your<00:05:09.180> shot

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
shifted over and you will make your shot

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.580 
shifted over and you will make your shot
and<00:05:09.920> you<00:05:10.920> will<00:05:11.130> get<00:05:11.310> your<00:05:11.490> shape<00:05:12.080> so<00:05:13.080> we'll

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
and you will get your shape so we'll

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.550 
and you will get your shape so we'll
shoot<00:05:13.770> that<00:05:13.950> first<00:05:14.280> shot<00:05:14.460> again

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
shoot that first shot again

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.150 
shoot that first shot again
this<00:05:16.560> time<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.190> shooter<00:05:17.370> properly<00:05:18.980> I'm<00:05:19.980> gonna

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
this time the shooter properly I'm gonna

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.490 
this time the shooter properly I'm gonna
line<00:05:20.400> up<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:20.910> sink<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.210> naturally<00:05:21.780> with<00:05:22.170> center

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
line up to sink it naturally with center

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.580 
line up to sink it naturally with center
ball<00:05:23.000> I'm<00:05:24.000> gonna<00:05:24.180> put<00:05:24.390> right<00:05:24.510> bottom<00:05:25.110> spin<00:05:25.470> on

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
ball I'm gonna put right bottom spin on

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.590 
ball I'm gonna put right bottom spin on
it<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.950> know<00:05:26.310> that's<00:05:26.670> gonna<00:05:26.820> throw<00:05:27.060> my<00:05:27.210> cue<00:05:27.450> ball

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
it I know that's gonna throw my cue ball

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.680 
it I know that's gonna throw my cue ball
to<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.840> left<00:05:28.160> so<00:05:29.160> that<00:05:29.370> means<00:05:29.820> I<00:05:30.150> have<00:05:30.420> to<00:05:30.540> aim

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
to the left so that means I have to aim

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.740 
to the left so that means I have to aim
more<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.260> the<00:05:31.380> right<00:05:31.530> than<00:05:31.770> normal<00:05:32.570> we<00:05:33.570> put<00:05:33.720> a

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
more to the right than normal we put a

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.600 
more to the right than normal we put a
quarter<00:05:34.110> ball<00:05:34.290> more<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.800> right<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:35.130> shoot

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
quarter ball more to the right and shoot

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.690 
quarter ball more to the right and shoot
that<00:05:35.790> shot<00:05:36.890> all<00:05:37.890> right<00:05:38.070> and<00:05:38.310> I<00:05:38.460> roll<00:05:38.669> down

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
that shot all right and I roll down

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.080 
that shot all right and I roll down
touch<00:05:39.390> hard<00:05:39.660> right<00:05:40.530> I<00:05:40.650> miss<00:05:40.860> my<00:05:41.040> shape<00:05:41.280> touch

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
touch hard right I miss my shape touch

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.790 
touch hard right I miss my shape touch
hard<00:05:42.360> but<00:05:43.110> I<00:05:44.870> made<00:05:45.870> my<00:05:46.050> shot<00:05:46.320> I'm<00:05:46.500> at<00:05:46.650> least

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
hard but I made my shot I'm at least

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.400 
hard but I made my shot I'm at least
still<00:05:46.980> shooting<00:05:47.370> right<00:05:47.880> so<00:05:48.630> then<00:05:49.140> you<00:05:49.230> come

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
still shooting right so then you come

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.220 
still shooting right so then you come
down<00:05:49.440> here<00:05:49.890> and<00:05:50.450> now<00:05:51.450> you<00:05:51.510> can<00:05:51.660> watch<00:05:51.990> the

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
down here and now you can watch the

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.120 
down here and now you can watch the
video<00:05:52.440> on<00:05:52.530> ghost<00:05:53.100> ball<00:05:53.400> kicking<00:05:53.820> and

video on ghost ball kicking and

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.400 
video on ghost ball kicking and
basically<00:05:56.130> I'm<00:05:56.760> uploading<00:05:57.090> that<00:05:57.419> with<00:05:58.260> these

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
basically I'm uploading that with these

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.590 
basically I'm uploading that with these
videos<00:05:58.770> now<00:05:59.010> and<00:05:59.880> then<00:06:00.030> you<00:06:00.090> can<00:06:00.240> just<00:06:00.419> measure

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
videos now and then you can just measure

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.390 
videos now and then you can just measure
that<00:06:00.750> out<00:06:01.110> and<00:06:01.230> you<00:06:01.530> can<00:06:01.680> shoot<00:06:01.860> this<00:06:02.040> shot<00:06:02.280> as

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
that out and you can shoot this shot as

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.310 
that out and you can shoot this shot as
well<00:06:02.550> and<00:06:02.790> make<00:06:02.910> your<00:06:03.090> contact<00:06:03.510> hopefully

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
well and make your contact hopefully

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.560 
well and make your contact hopefully
you'll<00:06:04.440> make<00:06:04.470> your<00:06:04.710> ball<00:06:07.190> so<00:06:08.570> basically

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
you'll make your ball so basically

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.240 
you'll make your ball so basically
that's<00:06:10.350> deflection<00:06:12.260> it<00:06:13.260> does<00:06:13.470> vary<00:06:13.740> on<00:06:13.950> length

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
that's deflection it does vary on length

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.790 
that's deflection it does vary on length
and<00:06:14.520> power<00:06:14.970> and<00:06:15.330> stroke<00:06:15.750> right<00:06:16.560> and

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
and power and stroke right and

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.070 
and power and stroke right and
everyone's<00:06:17.190> going<00:06:17.310> to<00:06:17.400> be<00:06:17.460> different<00:06:17.820> but<00:06:18.810> you

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
everyone's going to be different but you

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.590 
everyone's going to be different but you
can<00:06:19.560> learn<00:06:19.770> how<00:06:20.250> much<00:06:20.430> deflection<00:06:20.730> occurs

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
can learn how much deflection occurs

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.450 
can learn how much deflection occurs
when<00:06:22.050> you<00:06:22.200> shoot<00:06:22.440> and<00:06:22.680> you'll<00:06:23.100> learn<00:06:23.250> how<00:06:23.310> to

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
when you shoot and you'll learn how to

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.460 
when you shoot and you'll learn how to
compensate<00:06:23.880> for<00:06:24.270> it<00:06:24.390> but<00:06:24.960> that's<00:06:25.110> why<00:06:25.410> you

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
compensate for it but that's why you

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.770 
compensate for it but that's why you
miss<00:06:25.710> those<00:06:25.919> easy<00:06:26.160> shots<00:06:26.460> if<00:06:27.270> you<00:06:27.360> enjoyed<00:06:27.660> the

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
miss those easy shots if you enjoyed the

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.530
