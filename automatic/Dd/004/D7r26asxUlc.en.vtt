00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.359
 from yesterday in maringá 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.189
 a man died after being run over by 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.250
 a train this story is somewhat 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.509
 buzzá and who sees you there at the time I passed 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.670
 by chance 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.070
 when he saw by Luxa 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.080
 was very large and I have already seen 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.410
 that a team our brand was there 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.390
 along with the bear is chasing after 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.180
 of all information 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.349
 Look what happened yesterday afternoon here. 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.080
 in maringá 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.620
 at a crossing there on December 19 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.600
 ov with the railroad 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.239
 the accident happened at the intersection of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.030
 avenida 19 de diciembre and the carlos dalla 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.860
 The 42-year-old Bernardo worked as a 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.379
 municipal guard of the prefecture of 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.239
 maringá and took care of one of the gates of the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.620
 railway line it is not known whether it was 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.989
 cross the railroad or if the train did not see 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.930
 It's happened and it's happening. 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.329
 sorry if owes who for more than 20 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.190
 years on the job says he never 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.299
 seen similar scene 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.280
 I've never missed you at 29 I've never seen 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.970
 This is sad, this information. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.310
 unpleasant to do the time that he 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.060
 worked is more or less an almost 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.060
 20 years, right? 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.930
 how he was a quiet person 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.370
 worker is working person 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.670
 person responsible for the work, right? 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.560
 looks the pictures are very strong 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.890
 who had there who passed by the place 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.220
 yesterday you know what I'm talking about the train and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.800
 the boy was hopeful he had 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.680
 chunks for everything that is there 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.010
 then according to unofficial information 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.450
 that's coming for the boy, the boy was not coming 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.880
 he had signs of depression 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.880
 lately he was a little upset 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.400
 my stupidity has been that it was a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.700
 run over or was an act 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.740
 extreme and solved the fine life itself 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.390
 if it happened last night here in 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.820
 then there is the two maringá 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.920
 information you at home take your 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.770
 conclusions if he worked there 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.650
 many years this cancels how many times 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.170
 he saw the train pass by the same place 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.160
 for the same time, then there was a whole 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.170
 routine 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.830
 then the information that does not go very far 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.840
 time he lost his father to his mother and he came 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.480
 presenting symptoms of depression 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.550
 I was sad, this is the truth. 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.280
 there but the information shocked who 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.890
 passed by there xocoa until the ursão that the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.360
 our black videographer had in sight 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.270
 at the time the value is a very 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.390
 shocking is very shocking what you see 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.970
 even the problem is not what the odor 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.830
 smell is the problem right then it's gone 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.830
 shocked and the truth is this
