00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
about six feet of snow and looking super

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.490 
about six feet of snow and looking super
gnarly<00:00:45.730> so<00:00:46.420> here<00:00:46.630> we<00:00:46.660> are<00:00:46.930> a<00:00:46.960> couple<00:00:47.080> weeks

gnarly so here we are a couple weeks

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.160 
gnarly so here we are a couple weeks
later<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:47.980> it<00:00:48.220> is<00:00:48.340> looking<00:00:48.730> primo<00:00:49.390> granted

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
later and it is looking primo granted

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.150 
later and it is looking primo granted
they're<00:00:50.320> probably<00:00:50.560> going<00:00:50.770> to<00:00:50.860> be<00:00:50.920> a<00:00:50.950> couple

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
they're probably going to be a couple

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.400 
they're probably going to be a couple
areas<00:00:51.520> that<00:00:51.850> will<00:00:51.910> be<00:00:52.060> a<00:00:52.090> little<00:00:52.300> moist<00:00:52.570> so<00:00:53.110> I

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
areas that will be a little moist so I

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.870 
areas that will be a little moist so I
wouldn't<00:00:53.830> recommend<00:00:54.070> wearing<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.610> white

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
wouldn't recommend wearing a white

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.130 
wouldn't recommend wearing a white
t-shirt<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:58.180> top<00:00:58.360> of<00:00:58.480> like<00:00:58.690> and<00:00:58.870> it's<00:00:58.990> all

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
t-shirt the top of like and it's all

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.480 
t-shirt the top of like and it's all
melted<00:00:59.530> out<00:00:59.650> there's<00:00:59.890> still<00:01:00.100> some<00:01:00.280> snow

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
surrounding the trail but I think it is

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.750 
surrounding the trail but I think it is
going<00:01:02.980> to<00:01:03.220> be<00:01:03.250> pretty<00:01:03.670> darn<00:01:04.150> good<00:01:05.550> since<00:01:06.550> rock
