I've<00:01:20.549> had<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.880> take<00:01:21.060> summer<00:01:21.960> school<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
I've had to take summer school and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.130 
I've had to take summer school and
online<00:01:22.860> school<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.780> worth<00:01:24.990> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
online school and but it's worth it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.990 
online school and but it's worth it
definitely

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.630 

if<00:01:34.660> I<00:01:34.930> was<00:01:35.140> not<00:01:35.230> able<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.590> resist<00:01:35.860> mercy<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.520> a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
if I was not able to resist mercy of a

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.900 
if I was not able to resist mercy of a
scholarship<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.360> would<00:01:37.720> probably<00:01:38.370> be<00:01:39.370> stuck<00:01:39.700> in

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
scholarship I would probably be stuck in

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
scholarship I would probably be stuck in
a<00:01:40.210> very<00:01:40.450> bad<00:01:41.140> school<00:01:41.760> doing<00:01:42.760> bad<00:01:43.360> things<00:01:43.390> most

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
a very bad school doing bad things most

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.320 
a very bad school doing bad things most
likely<00:01:44.380> it's<00:01:44.800> always<00:01:45.250> good<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.460> actually<00:01:45.760> get

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
likely it's always good to actually get

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330 
likely it's always good to actually get
some<00:01:46.630> help<00:01:46.810> because<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.320> actually<00:01:47.470> shows<00:01:47.860> that

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
some help because it actually shows that

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.090 
some help because it actually shows that
you<00:01:48.790> can<00:01:49.060> do<00:01:49.510> so<00:01:50.200> much<00:01:50.350> better<00:01:50.410> for<00:01:50.830> your<00:01:50.950> life
