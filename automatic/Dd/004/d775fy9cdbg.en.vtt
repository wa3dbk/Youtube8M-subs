00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
all right I've got the tip for you on

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.990 
all right I've got the tip for you on
shooting<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.259> long<00:02:08.530> exposure<00:02:09.130> HDR's

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
shooting the long exposure HDR's

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.150 
shooting the long exposure HDR's
so<00:02:10.509> normally<00:02:11.290> what<00:02:11.440> we'll<00:02:11.560> do<00:02:11.739> we're<00:02:12.099> gonna

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
so normally what we'll do we're gonna

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.100 
so normally what we'll do we're gonna
set<00:02:12.370> up<00:02:12.459> an<00:02:12.580> HDR<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.060> bracket<00:02:13.420> like<00:02:13.540> five<00:02:13.810> shots

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
set up an HDR to bracket like five shots

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.500 
set up an HDR to bracket like five shots
no<00:02:14.290> unlike<00:02:14.530> money<00:02:14.800> after<00:02:15.069> bracket<00:02:15.489> five<00:02:16.209> shots

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
no unlike money after bracket five shots

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.790 
no unlike money after bracket five shots
but<00:02:16.720> you're<00:02:16.840> only<00:02:16.900> going<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> use<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.590> first

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
but you're only going to use the first

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.370 
but you're only going to use the first
shot<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.849> second<00:02:19.239> shot<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.989> fifth<00:02:20.170> shot

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
shot the second shot and the fifth shot

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.380 
shot the second shot and the fifth shot
on<00:02:20.739> Canon<00:02:21.250> they'll<00:02:21.400> actually<00:02:21.610> do<00:02:21.910> two<00:02:22.150> shot

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
on Canon they'll actually do two shot

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.790 
on Canon they'll actually do two shot
brackets<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.080> can<00:02:23.200> use<00:02:23.349> all<00:02:23.500> three

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
brackets so you just can use all three

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.710 
brackets so you just can use all three
but<00:02:24.760> here's<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.300> problem

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
but here's the problem

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.089 
but here's the problem
when<00:02:26.019> I'm<00:02:26.110> shooting<00:02:26.380> something<00:02:26.560> as<00:02:26.739> dark<00:02:26.980> as

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
when I'm shooting something as dark as

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.040 
when I'm shooting something as dark as

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
we are here I'm going to shoot a regular

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.660 
we are here I'm going to shoot a regular
exposure<00:02:29.319> watch<00:02:29.709> how<00:02:29.920> long<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.340> shutter<00:02:30.610> is

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
exposure watch how long the shutter is

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.650 
exposure watch how long the shutter is
going<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:30.880> be<00:02:30.970> open<00:02:31.239> watch<00:02:33.300> all<00:02:34.300> right<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:34.540> it's

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
going to be open watch all right so it's

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.589 
going to be open watch all right so it's
open<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.930> good<00:02:35.110> long<00:02:35.290> time<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.739> I'm<00:02:35.830> at<00:02:36.269> f5<00:02:37.269> now

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
open a good long time and I'm at f5 now

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.729 
open a good long time and I'm at f5 now
let's<00:02:37.720> get<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> where<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.140> really<00:02:38.380> should<00:02:38.560> be

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
let's get to where you really should be

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.850 
let's get to where you really should be
about<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.489> fader<00:02:39.910> hand<00:02:40.780> here<00:02:41.080> maybe<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.680> will

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
about a fader hand here maybe I will

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.670 
about a fader hand here maybe I will
ever<00:02:42.010> hears<00:02:42.489> up<00:02:42.640> eleven<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:44.110> just<00:02:44.410> for<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
ever hears up eleven so just for the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.970 
ever hears up eleven so just for the
regular<00:02:44.860> exposure<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:46.540> five<00:02:46.840> seconds<00:02:47.319> so

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
regular exposure it's five seconds so

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.500 
regular exposure it's five seconds so
I'm<00:02:48.130> going<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.340> need<00:02:48.459> five<00:02:48.790> shots<00:02:49.239> well

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
I'm going to need five shots well

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.449 
I'm going to need five shots well
normally<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.410> regular<00:02:50.769> lighting<00:02:51.040> condition

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
normally in a regular lighting condition

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.979 
normally in a regular lighting condition
you<00:02:51.970> would<00:02:52.090> set<00:02:52.269> this<00:02:52.420> thing<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.810> high-speed

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
you would set this thing to high-speed

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.910 
you would set this thing to high-speed
continuous<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:54.250> take<00:02:54.489> your<00:02:54.640> finger<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:54.970> go

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
continuous you take your finger and go

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.229 
continuous you take your finger and go
and<00:02:56.920> shoot<00:02:57.190> off<00:02:57.340> all<00:02:57.519> five<00:02:57.730> shots<00:02:58.000> right

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
and shoot off all five shots right

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.360 
and shoot off all five shots right
that's<00:02:58.900> what<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.110> normally<00:02:59.230> do<00:02:59.620> but<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
that's what you normally do but the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.190 
that's what you normally do but the
problem<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.849> is<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.209> could<00:03:01.540> be<00:03:01.660> holding<00:03:02.079> that

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
problem is is I could be holding that

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.589 
problem is is I could be holding that
button<00:03:02.530> down<00:03:02.650> for<00:03:02.980> 25<00:03:03.400> seconds<00:03:03.880> 30<00:03:04.120> seconds

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
button down for 25 seconds 30 seconds

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.839 
button down for 25 seconds 30 seconds
for<00:03:04.780> all<00:03:04.810> five<00:03:05.290> exposures<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.950> go<00:03:06.069> off<00:03:06.250> which

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
for all five exposures to go off which

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.009 
for all five exposures to go off which
means<00:03:07.060> there's<00:03:07.359> going<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.540> be<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.690> little<00:03:07.840> bit

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
means there's going to be a little bit

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.599 
means there's going to be a little bit
of<00:03:08.109> camera<00:03:08.319> shake<00:03:08.620> you're<00:03:08.890> gonna<00:03:09.010> move<00:03:09.340> the

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
of camera shake you're gonna move the

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.910 
of camera shake you're gonna move the
camera<00:03:09.819> just<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.359> little<00:03:10.569> bit<00:03:10.750> just<00:03:11.560> enough<00:03:11.709> to

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
camera just a little bit just enough to

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.890 
camera just a little bit just enough to
take<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.190> from<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.430> tack<00:03:12.700> sharp<00:03:13.000> shot<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.510> just<00:03:13.720> a

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
take it from a tack sharp shot to just a

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.410 
take it from a tack sharp shot to just a
oh<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.560> wish<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.250> was<00:03:15.370> tacks<00:03:15.640> are<00:03:15.850> sharp<00:03:16.209> shot

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
oh I wish it was tacks are sharp shot

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.970 
oh I wish it was tacks are sharp shot
here's<00:03:16.840> how<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.049> get<00:03:17.200> around<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.650> you're

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
here's how to get around that you're

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.490 
here's how to get around that you're
gonna<00:03:18.069> use<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.489> self-timer<00:03:18.970> mode<00:03:19.359> on<00:03:20.019> your

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
gonna use the self-timer mode on your

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.020 
gonna use the self-timer mode on your
camera<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.340> what<00:03:21.459> it's<00:03:21.579> going<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.760> do<00:03:21.910> is

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
camera so what it's going to do is

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.640 
camera so what it's going to do is
you're<00:03:22.150> gonna<00:03:22.239> press<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.660> up<00:03:22.870> take<00:03:23.500> your

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
you're gonna press this up take your

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.440 
you're gonna press this up take your
hand<00:03:23.889> off<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.220> it's<00:03:24.459> going<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.639> take<00:03:24.819> the<00:03:24.940> shot

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
hand off and it's going to take the shot

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.030 
hand off and it's going to take the shot
a<00:03:25.480> little<00:03:25.840> wait<00:03:25.989> as<00:03:26.139> long<00:03:26.200> as<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.530> needs<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.859> to

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
a little wait as long as it needs to to

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.199 
a little wait as long as it needs to to
leave<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.280> shutter<00:03:27.430> button<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.790> it'll<00:03:27.940> close

leave the shutter button and it'll close

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.059 
leave the shutter button and it'll close
the<00:03:28.269> shutter<00:03:28.630> for<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:29.049> that<00:03:29.530> way<00:03:29.739> in<00:03:29.980> a

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
the shutter for you that way in a

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.319 
the shutter for you that way in a
lighting<00:03:30.370> condition<00:03:30.700> like<00:03:30.819> we<00:03:30.970> have<00:03:31.150> here

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
lighting condition like we have here

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.210 
lighting condition like we have here
which<00:03:31.480> is<00:03:31.510> really<00:03:31.720> really<00:03:32.049> very<00:03:32.170> dark<00:03:32.560> you're

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
which is really really very dark you're

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.770 
which is really really very dark you're
not<00:03:33.370> gonna<00:03:33.459> have<00:03:33.639> any<00:03:33.910> camera<00:03:34.329> shake<00:03:34.359> at<00:03:34.660> all

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
not gonna have any camera shake at all

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.229 
not gonna have any camera shake at all
now<00:03:35.410> by<00:03:35.950> default<00:03:36.160> your<00:03:36.549> camera<00:03:36.880> sets<00:03:37.120> are

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
now by default your camera sets are

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.349 
now by default your camera sets are
probably<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.720> 10<00:03:38.049> second<00:03:38.530> exposure<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.670> go<00:03:40.090> into

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
probably a 10 second exposure so go into

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.300 
probably a 10 second exposure so go into
your<00:03:40.480> menu<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:40.959> change<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:41.980> can<00:03:42.069> go<00:03:42.160> as

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
your menu and change it to you can go as

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.430 
your menu and change it to you can go as
low<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.489> think<00:03:42.609> as<00:03:42.940> two<00:03:43.389> seconds<00:03:43.810> on<00:03:43.870> both<00:03:44.019> Nikon

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
low I think as two seconds on both Nikon

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.050 
low I think as two seconds on both Nikon
and<00:03:44.650> Canon<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:45.430> way<00:03:45.579> you<00:03:45.639> can<00:03:45.790> get<00:03:45.910> your

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
and Canon that way you can get your

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.000 
and Canon that way you can get your
exposure<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.540> awake<00:03:46.930> one<00:03:47.170> two

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
exposure to awake one two

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.649 
exposure to awake one two
then<00:03:48.129> take<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.430> shot<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:49.060> best<00:03:49.239> way<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.420> see

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
then take the shot the best way to see

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.660 
then take the shot the best way to see
it<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:49.870> let's<00:03:50.170> just<00:03:50.379> try<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.620> so<00:03:51.069> first<00:03:51.280> let<00:03:51.640> me

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
it is let's just try it so first let me

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.729 
it is let's just try it so first let me
go<00:03:51.819> ahead<00:03:51.939> and<00:03:52.060> turn<00:03:52.299> on<00:03:52.569> my<00:03:52.870> bracketing<00:03:53.590> so

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
go ahead and turn on my bracketing so

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.350 
go ahead and turn on my bracketing so
I'm<00:03:53.829> bracketing<00:03:54.280> five<00:03:54.489> exposures<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:55.239> it's

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
I'm bracketing five exposures so it's

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.449 
I'm bracketing five exposures so it's
going<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.510> take<00:03:55.689> five<00:03:55.900> shots<00:03:56.739> with<00:03:57.040> one<00:03:57.189> step

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
going to take five shots with one step

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.670 
going to take five shots with one step
increments<00:03:57.879> one<00:03:58.269> stop<00:03:58.510> increments<00:03:59.049> then<00:03:59.650> I

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
increments one stop increments then I

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.539 
increments one stop increments then I
want<00:03:59.890> to<00:03:59.950> set<00:04:00.129> my<00:04:00.159> camera<00:04:00.640> here<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.299> dial<00:04:01.599> to

want to set my camera here the dial to

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.430 
want to set my camera here the dial to
self<00:04:03.549> timer<00:04:03.909> I've<00:04:04.659> already<00:04:04.959> set<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.170> in<00:04:05.349> my

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
self timer I've already set it in my

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.440 
self timer I've already set it in my
menu<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.860> two<00:04:06.040> seconds<00:04:06.549> so<00:04:06.879> here's<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.239> first

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
menu to two seconds so here's the first

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.940 
menu to two seconds so here's the first
exposure<00:04:07.810> watch<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.680> then<00:04:09.610> just<00:04:09.790> take<00:04:10.950> now

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
exposure watch and then just take now

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.770 
exposure watch and then just take now
watch<00:04:12.129> how<00:04:12.310> long<00:04:12.489> this<00:04:12.700> is<00:04:12.849> open<00:04:15.660> all<00:04:16.660> right

you're taking five right here's to your

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.760 
you're taking five right here's to your
finger<00:04:21.280> would<00:04:21.430> be<00:04:21.549> there<00:04:21.760> from<00:04:22.180> now<00:04:22.530> all<00:04:23.530> the

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
finger would be there from now all the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.110 
finger would be there from now all the
way<00:04:23.860> through<00:04:24.100> that<00:04:24.250> whole<00:04:24.460> shot<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:24.940> it's

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
way through that whole shot and it's

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.100 
way through that whole shot and it's
going<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.300> get<00:04:25.389> longer<00:04:25.570> here<00:04:25.840> in<00:04:25.900> just<00:04:26.020> a

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
going to get longer here in just a

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.390 
going to get longer here in just a
moment<00:04:26.199> here's<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.650> third<00:04:26.830> exposure<00:04:29.160> also<00:04:30.160> to

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
moment here's the third exposure also to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.370 
moment here's the third exposure also to
minimize<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:31.300> vibration<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.139> might

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
minimize the vibration that you might

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.320
