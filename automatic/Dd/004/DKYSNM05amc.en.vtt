that's for sure I think overall last
year<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> whole<00:00:52.370> my<00:00:53.370> endurance<00:00:53.760> series

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060 
year as a whole my endurance series
season<00:00:54.719> was<00:00:54.870> really<00:00:55.140> great<00:00:55.379> i<00:00:55.410> won<00:00:55.739> 8<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:55.920> of

season was really great i won 8 out of
10<00:00:56.870> had<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> quite<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> few<00:00:58.980> GNCC<00:00:59.399> wins<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.149> you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
10 had a quite a few GNCC wins and you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.540 
10 had a quite a few GNCC wins and you
know<00:01:00.629> battled<00:01:01.079> down<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> last<00:01:01.559> race<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
know battled down the last race and I

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.160 
know battled down the last race and I
felt<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.149> rode<00:01:03.359> well<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> genus

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
felt like I rode well in the genus

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.280 
felt like I rode well in the genus
species<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:05.330> my<00:01:06.330> results<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.869> six<00:01:07.049> days<00:01:07.229> I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
species and my results in six days I

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.100 
species and my results in six days I
felt<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:08.040> we're<00:01:08.700> pretty<00:01:08.820> solid<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
felt like we're pretty solid I that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.480 
felt like we're pretty solid I that
could<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.380> been<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> little<00:01:10.710> bit<00:01:10.950> better<00:01:11.159> but

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
could have been a little bit better but

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.940 
could have been a little bit better but
I<00:01:11.820> think<00:01:12.570> overall<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.020> year<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> whole<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
I think overall the year as a whole it

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.340 
I think overall the year as a whole it
was<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> great<00:01:14.640> year<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:14.970> me<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.600> this

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
was a great year for me and this

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
was a great year for me and this
definitely<00:01:16.560> will<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:16.979> hard<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.310> top<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.549> year

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
definitely will be hard to top a year

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.480 
definitely will be hard to top a year
like<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.320> know<00:01:19.350> 14s<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.070> new<00:01:20.220> year

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
like that but you know 14s a new year

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.100 
like that but you know 14s a new year
and<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.479> know<00:01:21.570> I'm<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> challenge

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.800 
and you know I'm up for the challenge
and<00:01:22.650> hopefully<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.310> two<00:01:23.610> championships<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and hopefully get two championships and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.060 
and hopefully get two championships and
you<00:01:25.680> know<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> top<00:01:26.220> American

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
you know a top American

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.969 
you know a top American
the<00:01:27.520> B<00:01:27.700> would<00:01:28.150> be<00:01:28.210> perfect<00:01:28.810> pretty<00:01:29.560> much<00:01:29.680> same

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
the B would be perfect pretty much same

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.820 
the B would be perfect pretty much same
way<00:01:30.159> last<00:01:30.490> year<00:01:30.729> I<00:01:31.390> had<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.960> natural<00:01:32.590> endura

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
way last year I had a natural endura

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.920 
way last year I had a natural endura
last<00:01:33.159> weekend<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:33.760> it<00:01:33.880> started<00:01:34.210> off<00:01:34.330> well<00:01:34.630> and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
last weekend and it started off well and

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.660 
last weekend and it started off well and
got<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.440> win<00:01:35.470> there<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:36.130> I<00:01:36.160> think<00:01:36.280> I'm<00:01:36.520> on<00:01:36.640> the

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
got the win there so I think I'm on the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.950 
got the win there so I think I'm on the
right<00:01:36.880> track<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:38.040> we're<00:01:39.040> here<00:01:39.160> in<00:01:39.280> Florida

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
right track and we're here in Florida

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.420 
right track and we're here in Florida
not<00:01:40.960> your<00:01:41.110> typical<00:01:41.260> Florida<00:01:41.800> race<00:01:42.010> I<00:01:42.250> think

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
not your typical Florida race I think

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.040 
not your typical Florida race I think
it's<00:01:42.520> going<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.700> be<00:01:42.760> more<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.390> typical

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
it's going to be more of a typical

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.330 
it's going to be more of a typical
standard<00:01:44.890> GNCC<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.490> lot<00:01:45.700> of<00:01:45.820> mud<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:48.009> smart

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
standard GNCC a lot of mud and the smart

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.390 
standard GNCC a lot of mud and the smart
line<00:01:48.550> choices<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:49.390> just<00:01:50.290> build<00:01:50.440> off<00:01:50.710> dendera

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
line choices and just build off dendera

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.680 
line choices and just build off dendera
and<00:01:51.640> just<00:01:51.790> try<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.090> keep<00:01:52.210> that<00:01:52.390> minimum

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
and just try to keep that minimum
