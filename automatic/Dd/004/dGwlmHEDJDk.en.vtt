00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
of something from another halo Avenger I

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.050 
of something from another halo Avenger I

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
which I'll show there so it should be

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.949

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:58.529 
from there C is a pretty good forger

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.769 
from there C is a pretty good forger
when<00:04:58.889> it<00:04:58.979> comes<00:04:59.129> to<00:04:59.279> like<00:04:59.460> building<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.509> track

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:00.779 
when it comes to like building the track

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:02.300 
when it comes to like building the track
but<00:05:00.990> he<00:05:01.139> wasn't<00:05:01.650> really<00:05:01.919> sure<00:05:02.039> about

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
but he wasn't really sure about

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.610 
but he wasn't really sure about
aesthetics<00:05:02.819> so<00:05:02.909> you<00:05:03.479> know<00:05:03.569> me<00:05:04.229> being<00:05:04.379> me

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
aesthetics so you know me being me

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.080 
aesthetics so you know me being me
having<00:05:04.949> seen<00:05:05.129> a<00:05:05.159> lot<00:05:05.370> of<00:05:05.400> maps<00:05:05.610> that<00:05:05.849> kind<00:05:06.029> of

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
having seen a lot of maps that kind of

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.149 
having seen a lot of maps that kind of
helped<00:05:06.300> him<00:05:06.419> all<00:05:07.050> told<00:05:07.259> him<00:05:07.409> I<00:05:07.650> gave<00:05:07.830> him<00:05:08.099> some

helped him all told him I gave him some

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.309 
helped him all told him I gave him some
ideas<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:08.699> there<00:05:09.479> is<00:05:09.569> like<00:05:09.719> a<00:05:09.750> lava<00:05:09.990> jump

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
ideas and there is like a lava jump

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.990 
ideas and there is like a lava jump
which<00:05:10.469> firestorm<00:05:10.949> are<00:05:11.099> helped<00:05:11.430> with<00:05:11.699> so

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
which firestorm are helped with so

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.719 
which firestorm are helped with so
thanks<00:05:12.360> for<00:05:12.419> that<00:05:12.479> dude<00:05:12.860> but<00:05:13.860> yeah<00:05:14.009> in<00:05:14.550> a<00:05:14.699> way

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
thanks for that dude but yeah in a way

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.369 
thanks for that dude but yeah in a way
of<00:05:14.879> aesthetics<00:05:15.270> I<00:05:15.389> don't<00:05:15.569> actually<00:05:15.960> thinking

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
of aesthetics I don't actually thinking

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.200 
of aesthetics I don't actually thinking
these<00:05:16.500> that<00:05:16.650> many<00:05:16.830> because<00:05:16.889> look<00:05:17.159> at<00:05:17.250> that<00:05:17.400> all

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
these that many because look at that all

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.659 
these that many because look at that all
that<00:05:18.539> complexity<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.439> winding<00:05:19.979> up<00:05:20.219> on<00:05:20.400> itself

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
that complexity and winding up on itself

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.519 
that complexity and winding up on itself
and<00:05:20.879> over<00:05:21.270> laughing<00:05:21.599> and<00:05:21.749> everything<00:05:21.960> it

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
and over laughing and everything it

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:23.869 
and over laughing and everything it
makes<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:22.979> really<00:05:23.189> cool<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.550> look<00:05:23.669> at<00:05:23.819> and

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:23.879 
makes it really cool to look at and

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:25.309 
makes it really cool to look at and
you're<00:05:24.150> constantly<00:05:24.509> looking<00:05:24.810> at<00:05:24.960> another<00:05:25.110> bit

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
you're constantly looking at another bit

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.320 
you're constantly looking at another bit
of<00:05:25.349> the<00:05:25.469> track<00:05:25.710> which<00:05:25.919> kind<00:05:26.129> of<00:05:26.219> serves<00:05:26.460> as<00:05:26.699> an

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
of the track which kind of serves as an

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.899 
of the track which kind of serves as an
aesthetic<00:05:27.810> in<00:05:27.960> itself<00:05:28.430> so<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.460> think<00:05:29.610> that's<00:05:29.789> a

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
aesthetic in itself so I think that's a

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.179 
aesthetic in itself so I think that's a
regal<00:05:30.319> they<00:05:31.319> lapped<00:05:31.529> length<00:05:31.740> is<00:05:31.860> like<00:05:31.979> two

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
regal they lapped length is like two

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:33.800 
regal they lapped length is like two
minutes<00:05:32.370> so<00:05:32.729> you<00:05:33.089> know<00:05:33.180> two<00:05:33.569> and<00:05:33.719> a<00:05:33.750> half

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
minutes so you know two and a half

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.480 
minutes so you know two and a half
minutes<00:05:34.110> you'd<00:05:34.469> probably<00:05:34.680> what<00:05:35.189> I<00:05:35.219> would<00:05:35.279> say

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
minutes you'd probably what I would say

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.679 
minutes you'd probably what I would say
is<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.699> later<00:05:35.909> after<00:05:36.360> that<00:05:36.479> it's<00:05:36.629> just

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:36.689 
is the later after that it's just

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:38.269 
is the later after that it's just
getting<00:05:36.930> ridiculous<00:05:37.020> so<00:05:37.589> but<00:05:37.830> two<00:05:37.949> minutes<00:05:38.099> is

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279 
getting ridiculous so but two minutes is

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:40.040 
getting ridiculous so but two minutes is
cool<00:05:38.460> I<00:05:38.610> do<00:05:38.699> love<00:05:38.909> that<00:05:39.060> map<00:05:39.240> that<00:05:39.659> lap<00:05:39.839> length

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
cool I do love that map that lap length

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.920 
cool I do love that map that lap length
and<00:05:40.669> yeah<00:05:41.669> it's<00:05:41.819> just<00:05:41.939> a<00:05:42.419> comedy<00:05:42.810> have

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930

ramps walls yeah here's the fire jump

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.100 
ramps walls yeah here's the fire jump
with<00:05:53.039> the<00:05:53.189> lava<00:05:54.060> there<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.810> it's<00:05:54.930> just<00:05:55.050> a

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.959 
with the lava there and it's just a
shame<00:05:55.259> that<00:05:55.319> it<00:05:55.560> does<00:05:55.710> that<00:05:55.889> like<00:05:56.219> two<00:05:56.819> or

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969 
shame that it does that like two or

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:58.249 
shame that it does that like two or
three<00:05:57.000> times<00:05:57.300> out<00:05:57.509> of<00:05:57.539> 10<00:05:57.750> which<00:05:57.960> is<00:05:57.990> really

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
three times out of 10 which is really

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.079 
three times out of 10 which is really
stupid<00:05:58.439> because<00:05:58.740> I've<00:05:59.490> raced<00:05:59.699> on<00:05:59.849> this<00:05:59.939> map

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:00.089 
stupid because I've raced on this map

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:02.209 
stupid because I've raced on this map
like<00:06:00.240> three<00:06:00.479> or<00:06:00.569> four<00:06:00.599> times<00:06:00.839> and<00:06:01.199> like<00:06:01.349> this

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
like three or four times and like this

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:04.070 
like three or four times and like this
time<00:06:02.490> every<00:06:03.300> single<00:06:03.449> time<00:06:03.689> one<00:06:03.839> hundred

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
time every single time one hundred

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.829 
time every single time one hundred
percent<00:06:04.110> that<00:06:04.439> Chum<00:06:04.680> work<00:06:05.060> because<00:06:06.060> havoc<00:06:06.659> was

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:06.839 
percent that Chum work because havoc was

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:07.969 
percent that Chum work because havoc was

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
to talk about this map so I'll just fill

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.060 
to talk about this map so I'll just fill
it<00:06:22.830> with<00:06:22.949> some<00:06:23.099> mindless<00:06:23.939> no<00:06:24.539> I
