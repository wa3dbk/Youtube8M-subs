00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
tweaks that have been made based on the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.880 
tweaks that have been made based on the
community's<00:02:39.180> feedback<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:40.140> mg<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.800> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
community's feedback the mg and the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.980 
community's feedback the mg and the
combat<00:02:41.280> mg<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:41.850> increased<00:02:42.210> damage<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
combat mg have increased damage the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.050 
combat mg have increased damage the
assault<00:02:43.320> shotgun<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.890> now<00:02:44.040> less<00:02:44.310> effective<00:02:44.850> at

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
assault shotgun is now less effective at

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.570 
assault shotgun is now less effective at
longer<00:02:45.600> ranges<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.620> I'm<00:02:46.740> happy<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.250> mg

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
longer ranges so I'm happy that the mg

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.950 
longer ranges so I'm happy that the mg
is<00:02:47.670> going<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.910> have<00:02:48.000> increased<00:02:48.390> damage<00:02:48.630> but

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
is going to have increased damage but

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.050 
is going to have increased damage but
the<00:02:48.990> sole<00:02:49.320> shotgun<00:02:49.830> was<00:02:49.980> such<00:02:50.130> an<00:02:50.250> Opie<00:02:50.670> weapon

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the sole shotgun was such an Opie weapon

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.970 
the sole shotgun was such an Opie weapon
it<00:02:51.150> was<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.420> much<00:02:51.540> fun<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.840> use<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:52.590> now<00:02:52.770> has

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
it was so much fun to use but now has

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.770 
it was so much fun to use but now has
been<00:02:53.190> tweaked<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.790> it's<00:02:53.910> less<00:02:54.150> effective<00:02:54.630> at

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
been tweaked and it's less effective at

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.570 
been tweaked and it's less effective at
longer<00:02:55.170> ranges<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.740> I<00:02:55.950> don't<00:02:56.280> think<00:02:56.460> as<00:02:56.550> much

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
longer ranges so I don't think as much

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.180 
longer ranges so I don't think as much
people<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:57.240> using<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.630> now<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.920> hook

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
people can be using it now and the hook

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.920 
people can be using it now and the hook
at<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.340> cargobob<00:02:59.820> can<00:03:00.240> no<00:03:00.390> longer<00:03:00.660> live

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
at the cargobob can no longer live

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.270 
at the cargobob can no longer live
vehicles<00:03:01.500> with<00:03:01.620> players<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.040> are<00:03:02.250> in

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
vehicles with players that are in

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.280 
vehicles with players that are in
passive<00:03:02.760> mode<00:03:02.790> there's<00:03:03.330> also<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.690> new<00:03:03.780> ability

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
passive mode there's also a new ability

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.199 
passive mode there's also a new ability
to<00:03:04.320> cycle<00:03:04.800> between<00:03:04.920> targets<00:03:05.610> when<00:03:05.820> using<00:03:06.150> the

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
to cycle between targets when using the

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.240 
to cycle between targets when using the
lock<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.600> missiles<00:03:07.080> such<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.860> Buzzard

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
lock on missiles such as the Buzzard

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.670 
lock on missiles such as the Buzzard
missiles<00:03:08.670> or<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.060> homing<00:03:09.420> launcher<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.530> this

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
missiles or the homing launcher so this

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.900 
missiles or the homing launcher so this
is<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.860> great<00:03:10.980> addition<00:03:11.310> into<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.730> game

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
is a great addition into the game

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.580 
is a great addition into the game
because<00:03:12.180> for<00:03:12.420> example<00:03:12.450> if<00:03:13.110> there<00:03:13.290> are<00:03:13.410> two

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
because for example if there are two

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.320 
because for example if there are two
players<00:03:13.920> online<00:03:14.220> when<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.790> your<00:03:14.910> friend<00:03:15.150> and

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
players online when is your friend and

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.880 
players online when is your friend and
when<00:03:15.690> it's<00:03:15.840> random<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.380> your<00:03:16.470> rocket

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
when it's random and your rocket

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.860 
when it's random and your rocket
launcher<00:03:17.250> locks<00:03:17.520> on<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.880> your<00:03:18.180> friend<00:03:18.480> you

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
launcher locks on to your friend you

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.790 
launcher locks on to your friend you
obviously<00:03:19.170> don't<00:03:19.230> want<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.560> shoot<00:03:19.680> your

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
obviously don't want to shoot your

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.560 
obviously don't want to shoot your
friend<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.220> wanted<00:03:20.520> it<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.820> lock<00:03:21.150> onto<00:03:21.390> the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
friend you wanted it to lock onto the

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.300 
friend you wanted it to lock onto the
other<00:03:21.600> guy<00:03:21.959> so<00:03:22.650> now<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:22.830> can<00:03:22.950> be<00:03:23.040> able<00:03:23.190> to

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
other guy so now you can be able to

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.890 
other guy so now you can be able to
cycle<00:03:23.490> through<00:03:23.670> different<00:03:24.150> kinds<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.390> objects

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
cycle through different kinds of objects

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.690 
cycle through different kinds of objects
or<00:03:25.050> people<00:03:25.080> so<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.620> locks<00:03:25.769> onto<00:03:26.040> what<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.459> want

kinds of bugs and glitches were bound to

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.060 
kinds of bugs and glitches were bound to
happen<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:13.050> they<00:04:13.140> fix<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.500> lot<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:13.769> those<00:04:13.860> as
