to<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:51.210> side<00:01:51.479> alright<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.530> we're

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to go to one side alright and we're

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.320 
to go to one side alright and we're
going<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> go<00:01:52.950> to

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
going to go to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.850 
going to go to
other<00:01:53.510> side<00:01:53.690> so<00:01:54.110> what<00:01:54.410> you're<00:01:54.560> doing<00:01:54.590> is

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
other side so what you're doing is

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.150 
other side so what you're doing is
you're<00:01:55.190> pushing<00:01:55.880> from<00:01:56.480> one<00:01:56.900> side<00:01:57.170> over<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:58.010> the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
you're pushing from one side over to the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.460 
you're pushing from one side over to the
other<00:01:58.310> side<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:58.790> your<00:01:59.420> opposite<00:01:59.990> sides<00:02:00.230> going

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
other side and your opposite sides going

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.320 
other side and your opposite sides going
to<00:02:00.560> bend<00:02:00.740> just<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:01.040> little<00:02:01.280> bit<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:01.850> what<00:02:02.060> we<00:02:02.150> do

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
to bend just a little bit so what we do

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.700 
to bend just a little bit so what we do
the<00:02:02.480> balance<00:02:02.840> do<00:02:03.020> we<00:02:03.110> put<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.320> all<00:02:03.530> together

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
the balance do we put it all together

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.220 
the balance do we put it all together
we're<00:02:04.220> going<00:02:04.370> to<00:02:04.430> drop<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.180> one<00:02:05.360> side<00:02:05.600> come

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
we're going to drop to one side come

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.889 
we're going to drop to one side come
back<00:02:06.410> up<00:02:06.620> go<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.820> other<00:02:07.910> side<00:02:08.180> come<00:02:08.720> back

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
back up go to the other side come back

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.160 
back up go to the other side come back
up<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.350> it<00:02:09.470> goes<00:02:09.619> like<00:02:09.800> this<00:02:09.830> one<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:11.150> two<00:02:11.750> and

beat okay the second movement i'm going

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.420 
beat okay the second movement i'm going
to<00:02:33.110> show<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.260> here<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.980> rocking<00:02:34.400> motion

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
to show you here is the rocking motion

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.140 
to show you here is the rocking motion
okay<00:02:35.270> so<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.900> how<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.500> looks<00:02:36.530> like<00:02:36.770> this

okay so this is how it looks like this

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.650 
okay so this is how it looks like this
one-and-two<00:02:38.150> one-and-two<00:02:38.950> one-and-two

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
one-and-two one-and-two one-and-two

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.160 
one-and-two one-and-two one-and-two
one-and-two<00:02:43.060> okay<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.360> for<00:02:44.630> this<00:02:44.810> movement

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
one-and-two okay so for this movement

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.020 
one-and-two okay so for this movement
there's<00:02:45.590> two<00:02:45.950> different<00:02:46.190> things<00:02:46.459> involved

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
there's two different things involved

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.470 
there's two different things involved
first<00:02:47.570> thing<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.290> end<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.430> motion<00:02:50.030> what

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
first thing is the end of motion what

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.940 
first thing is the end of motion what
we're<00:02:50.600> going<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.810> do<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.140> we're<00:02:51.320> starting<00:02:51.860> with

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
we're going to do is we're starting with

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.010 
we're going to do is we're starting with
our<00:02:52.040> knee<00:02:52.250> spin<00:02:52.520> and<00:02:52.820> then<00:02:52.850> our<00:02:53.390> body<00:02:53.660> is<00:02:53.870> going

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
our knee spin and then our body is going

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.630 
our knee spin and then our body is going
to<00:02:54.080> go<00:02:54.230> backwards<00:02:54.709> just<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.920> little<00:02:55.130> bit<00:02:55.280> we're

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
to go backwards just a little bit we're

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.610 
to go backwards just a little bit we're
not<00:02:55.790> looking<00:02:56.120> up<00:02:56.209> at<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.480> ceiling<00:02:56.690> but<00:02:57.380> we're

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
not looking up at the ceiling but we're

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.229 
not looking up at the ceiling but we're
just<00:02:57.830> laying<00:02:58.040> back<00:02:58.160> just<00:02:58.640> enough<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.150> can

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
just laying back just enough so you can

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.570 
just laying back just enough so you can
see<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.780> difference<00:03:00.260> between<00:03:00.400> leaning<00:03:01.400> back

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
see the difference between leaning back

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.940 
see the difference between leaning back
and<00:03:01.880> standing<00:03:02.570> up<00:03:02.660> some<00:03:03.140> studying<00:03:03.590> with<00:03:03.739> it

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
and standing up some studying with it

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.280 
and standing up some studying with it
he's<00:03:04.550> been<00:03:04.790> back<00:03:05.480> just<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.810> little<00:03:05.840> bit<00:03:06.050> we're

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
he's been back just a little bit we're

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.130 
he's been back just a little bit we're
going<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.530> go<00:03:06.709> up<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.190> this<00:03:07.850> is<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.150> one<00:03:08.420> come

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
going to go up and this is on one come

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.650 
going to go up and this is on one come
back<00:03:09.290> down<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.800> then<00:03:10.340> come<00:03:10.550> back<00:03:10.580> up<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:11.269> two

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
back down and then come back up on two

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.300 
back down and then come back up on two
so<00:03:12.080> beginning<00:03:13.060> one<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.380> two<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.920> one<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:17.080> two
