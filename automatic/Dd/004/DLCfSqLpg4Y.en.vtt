00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 on Tuesday, June 29, it was so long out of studio money and this in Westende bath 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.940
 a very special reason because the diamond fields are opened 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.929
 This nostalgia in the chapel at the hotel put everyone in the short run 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.780
 party and we really enjoyed that there are five 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.599
 beautiful songs 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.410
 aha 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.569
 just for a while 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:28.179
 let you 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.739
 but yeah 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:31.779
 also 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.160
 h 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.150
 adha 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.560
 it was a very quick honor to be able to welcome the bacteria 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.089
 all are also wax greasy 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.309
 yes the cd show a day later it was actually with a lot of pleasure 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.739
 looking forward to those years certainly not too long a whole time I look there 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.020
 basically the newspaper only made it with that five-year idea 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.740
 I have to record a CD 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.720
 with those beautiful songs, syntus and it did not come to ICT 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.120
 a very happy because waited so long yes I have to put it in a serene and so they 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.270
 recently that is a major update major difficulty it's the cost for such 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.100
 fancy 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 if you are not asked to record a CD you have to pay for everything yourself 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.390
 and the cost dramatically it is a huge amount of gigs in my legs 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.600
 the first time to hear you guys together 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.520
 a lot of people with shackles and then it is still asked behind a CD or not 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.230
 yes well then a fairly recent one is not ready yet and is regularly 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.090
 asked and I am no longer interested in his new CD 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.659
 hoeness's plans are even bigger 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.210
 to make the album 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.580
 He didn't even have anything and the five 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.280
 with five chosen really nostalgic a book she sings vilder op een 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.900
 Wedding party is rather in such a lake in the church and that has 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.900
 also played along to get these features they know 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.210
 Hey 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.460
 very nice but how a beautiful location today, of course, our father is 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.330
 also ensure that the votes have 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.390
 to the pastor 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.239
 the pastor have some ability 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.969
 influence doors 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:14.669
 is doing a performance. this 4 5 3 profit the profit of the group 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:19.339
 N / A Favorite numbers are currently judged to be right 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.249
 I have to see myself at work again, she has a lot 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.030
 she's not in for years and they want things you make 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.290
 7 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.330
 for this period just the pond favorite songs well you are a lot 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.539
 years this of the eight year old 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:37.689
 music comes with generating is now the media i have a lot of theremin 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.739
 diplomat then returned when also picks up 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.550
 and singing is my passion and people kept passing that 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.730
 until their death, I miss life for the cost of the diamond 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.570
 that states 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.010
 because you would think that should sing a lot at home I only have my speech with you 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.489
 she says do not sing in the shower 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.219
 We are internal then a dozen people do not assume that the Swiss also 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.700
 not but I don't either 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.200
 mainz has a separate screen i also have a few municipalities with which every 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.599
 other things how you practice 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.280
 and then of course I hear no surprises there, but that is usually 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.369
 with closed doors and therefore I have a few standing 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:14.829
 that's nice a nice busy we are so the council for 2013 then 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.909
 it also now that I do not see this growing calms naturally 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.719
 of course with the new cd i have fiat 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.620
 interviews of course that should you can of course also be able 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.650
 of course radio interviews and interviews everywhere a bit 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:30.859
 and that is then that naturally crawls and then 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.049
 Mon in October in Middelkerke 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.030
 the red fell too our churches are standing yes we are very happy to be in a casino 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:39.760
 in Middelkerke so beautiful surroundings 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.669
 like being able to do the show and what they don't do just like that 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.340
 so join in with and probably some musicians 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:50.900

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.399
 six points less than 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:57.369
