00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.480
 continue to talk about sports and 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.010
 active rest stitch release on 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.320
 told you about one sport 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.550
 kiting on today we are back in town 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.550
 tell you about street sports 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.550
 skateboarding 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.840
 so we told you a little about 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.340
 skateboarding 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.230
 and today we are in the city center 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.450
 where we will meet with the enthusiastic guys 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.549
 this sport and we hope they 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.239
 anything on the ears 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:43.609
 hi oats find our traditional 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.849
 question what started my passion for my 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:49.129
 the mission began in childhood since 10 years 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.109
 when my first skateboard appeared 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:56.120
 cellular it all started it usually roll 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:58.790
 usually on the streets but more often on 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.859
 monuments can be said because it 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.879
 less suitable place for our 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.040
 sport 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.349
 tell me how passers-by refers to filters 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.269
 on the street we can say 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.840
 differently someone looks enthusiastically 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.270
 indignantly in the winter you continue 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.130
 somehow your workouts 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.950
 if we find some kind of room 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.600
 suitable for it then yes if not then 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.640
 have to wait are given 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.950
 say as we say does not go on 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.600
 learning 1 trick 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.240
 it depends on the trick technique if 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.510
 technically difficult labor is most likely 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.880
 a year or half a year and if easy 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.680
 from a couple of hours to a couple of days 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.180
 tell a little about the device stay 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.629
 and the most elementary banquet is just 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.010
 suspension board and wheels say case 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.870
 breakdowns how much time it takes to 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.439
 fix 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.680
 15 to 30 minutes can learn 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:56.629
 something simple yes can i think 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.489
 start with base rates 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:03.620
 ok let's try try the most 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.250
 the main thing is to catch the balance as in 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.120
 any sport 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.579
 first thing you put your feet on the bolts 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.939
 For the first time, then the second and further itself 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.939
 will go 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.539
 when i think i can proceed 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:56.960
 the most basic trick is called ali 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:59.830
 the whole trick is that 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.720
 need to click on the tail 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.360
 lift and display it at the same time 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.490
 and it turns out such a jump 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.490
 it is possible even with a dr to demonstrate 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.939
 like that 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.700
 almost have something 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.800
 today we tried to ride 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.750
 skate though rags didn't get us 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.280
 learned to stand confidently on the board 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.380
 next time we'll tell you more 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.870
