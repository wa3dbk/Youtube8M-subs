I<00:02:21.830> probably<00:02:22.010> had<00:02:22.250> before<00:02:22.610> actually<00:02:23.390> looks

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
I probably had before actually looks

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.830 
I probably had before actually looks
just<00:02:23.660> like<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.840> one<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.020> came<00:02:24.140> with<00:02:24.320> my<00:02:24.440> tab

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
just like the one that came with my tab

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.120 
just like the one that came with my tab
well<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:26.900> think<00:02:26.960> for<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.230> tab<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.530> 2<00:02:27.740> amp<00:02:27.920> this

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
well I think for the tab is a 2 amp this

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.680 
well I think for the tab is a 2 amp this
is<00:02:28.250> probably<00:02:28.400> one<00:02:28.640> amp<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:28.970> that's<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.390> looks

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
is probably one amp and that's it looks

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.310 
is probably one amp and that's it looks
like<00:02:29.810> pretty<00:02:29.990> much<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.730> nothing<00:02:31.730> else<00:02:32.320> nothing

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
like pretty much it nothing else nothing

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.820 
like pretty much it nothing else nothing

resistant know if i should say
waterproof<00:03:45.709> because<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.370> can't<00:03:46.640> help<00:03:46.790> you

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
waterproof because you can't help you

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.789 
waterproof because you can't help you
can<00:03:47.180> fully<00:03:47.450> submerge<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.080> for<00:03:48.230> very<00:03:48.380> long<00:03:48.590> in

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
can fully submerge it for very long in

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.949 
can fully submerge it for very long in
the<00:03:48.890> water<00:03:49.100> i<00:03:49.220> think<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.489> can<00:03:49.640> be<00:03:49.670> in<00:03:50.090> like<00:03:50.720> a

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
the water i think it can be in like a

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.440 
the water i think it can be in like a
couple<00:03:51.290> feet<00:03:51.590> of<00:03:51.650> water<00:03:51.980> for<00:03:52.400> like<00:03:52.730> up<00:03:52.850> to<00:03:53.060> 20

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
couple feet of water for like up to 20

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.640 
couple feet of water for like up to 20
minutes<00:03:53.600> or<00:03:53.780> something<00:03:53.989> like<00:03:54.230> that<00:03:54.290> i'm<00:03:54.590> not

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
minutes or something like that i'm not

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.100 
minutes or something like that i'm not
exactly<00:03:55.070> sure<00:03:55.540> i'll<00:03:56.540> have<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.840> look<00:03:56.959> at<00:03:57.080> the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
exactly sure i'll have to look at the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.979 
exactly sure i'll have to look at the
specs<00:03:58.100> on<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.310> but<00:03:58.900> that's<00:03:59.900> definitely

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
specs on that but that's definitely

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.630 
specs on that but that's definitely
something<00:04:00.290> nice<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.830> see<00:04:00.950> in<00:04:01.040> smartphones<00:04:01.519> I

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
something nice to see in smartphones I

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.130 
something nice to see in smartphones I
hopefully<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.239> iphone<00:04:02.540> will<00:04:02.690> have<00:04:02.810> something

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
hopefully the iphone will have something

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.350 
hopefully the iphone will have something
similar<00:04:03.320> because<00:04:03.650> i<00:04:04.010> think<00:04:04.190> people<00:04:04.700> are

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
similar because i think people are

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.120 
similar because i think people are
constantly<00:04:05.690> dropping<00:04:06.110> their<00:04:06.410> smartphones<00:04:06.860> in

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
constantly dropping their smartphones in

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.330 
constantly dropping their smartphones in
in<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.580> toilets<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.150> things<00:04:08.299> like<00:04:08.420> that<00:04:08.480> and

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
in the toilets and things like that and

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.920 
in the toilets and things like that and
messing<00:04:10.340> them<00:04:10.459> up<00:04:10.580> so<00:04:10.790> if<00:04:11.120> you<00:04:11.600> just<00:04:11.720> have<00:04:11.900> a

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
messing them up so if you just have a

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.100 
messing them up so if you just have a
couple<00:04:12.320> seconds<00:04:12.799> of<00:04:12.920> protection<00:04:14.110> that's

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
couple seconds of protection that's

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.960 
couple seconds of protection that's
that's<00:04:15.380> pretty<00:04:15.709> good<00:04:15.860> so

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
that's pretty good so

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.270 
that's pretty good so
too<00:04:17.180> strong<00:04:18.970> so<00:04:19.970> they'll<00:04:20.090> go<00:04:20.239> ahead<00:04:20.360> there<00:04:20.660> and

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
too strong so they'll go ahead there and

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.260 
too strong so they'll go ahead there and
you<00:04:22.280> know<00:04:22.370> what<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.730> still<00:04:22.940> feels<00:04:22.970> pretty

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
you know what it still feels pretty

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.360 
you know what it still feels pretty
light<00:04:23.480> even<00:04:23.810> with<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:23.990> battery<00:04:24.230> in<00:04:24.320> there<00:04:24.470> and

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
light even with the battery in there and

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.730 
light even with the battery in there and
it's<00:04:26.210> almost<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.900> pre<00:04:27.050> family<00:04:27.350> who<00:04:27.470> can<00:04:27.620> do<00:04:27.710> it

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
it's almost a pre family who can do it

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.670 
it's almost a pre family who can do it

without<00:04:30.830> saber<00:04:31.220> view<00:04:31.430> just<00:04:31.640> a<00:04:31.700> comparison

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
without saber view just a comparison

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.170 
without saber view just a comparison
with<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.810> iphone<00:04:33.140> 5s<00:04:33.980> as<00:04:34.550> well<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.030> just

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
with the iphone 5s as well so you just

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.660 
with the iphone 5s as well so you just
see<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.390> difference<00:04:35.960> in<00:04:36.080> thickness<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:36.830> just

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
see the difference in thickness and just

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.420 
see the difference in thickness and just
comparing<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.150> two<00:04:38.680> i'm<00:04:39.680> still<00:04:39.980> not<00:04:40.100> sure<00:04:40.160> how

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
comparing the two i'm still not sure how

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.340 
comparing the two i'm still not sure how
i<00:04:40.460> feel<00:04:40.550> about<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.940> largest<00:04:41.300> screen<00:04:41.900> the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
i feel about the largest screen the

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.350 
i feel about the largest screen the

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
larger the bigger display this does have

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.070 
larger the bigger display this does have
a<00:04:44.390> thickness<00:04:44.870> of<00:04:44.990> 5.7<00:04:45.530> it's<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.550> 5.7<00:04:47.270> or<00:04:47.420> 5.1<00:04:48.050> i

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.530 
a thickness of 5.7 it's a 5.7 or 5.1 i

heart rate monitoring here in the back
that's<00:05:06.200> kind<00:05:06.410> of<00:05:06.440> interesting<00:05:06.790> so<00:05:07.790> I'm<00:05:08.120> not

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
that's kind of interesting so I'm not

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.300 
that's kind of interesting so I'm not
sure<00:05:08.300> how<00:05:08.780> many<00:05:08.900> people<00:05:09.470> would<00:05:09.530> be<00:05:09.650> using<00:05:10.100> that

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
sure how many people would be using that

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.830 
sure how many people would be using that
think<00:05:10.580> of<00:05:10.700> you<00:05:10.820> because<00:05:11.390> I<00:05:11.450> know<00:05:11.510> if<00:05:11.720> you're

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
think of you because I know if you're

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.600 
think of you because I know if you're
using<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.140> fitness<00:05:12.380> app<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.770> you<00:05:12.830> just<00:05:12.980> threw

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
using the fitness app and you just threw

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.950 
using the fitness app and you just threw
in<00:05:13.760> different<00:05:14.150> intervals<00:05:14.450> while<00:05:14.570> during<00:05:14.810> your

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
in different intervals while during your

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.030 
in different intervals while during your
workout<00:05:15.260> you<00:05:15.410> tap<00:05:15.560> your<00:05:15.590> feet<00:05:15.770> down<00:05:15.890> here

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
workout you tap your feet down here

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.920 
workout you tap your feet down here
it'll<00:05:16.190> record<00:05:16.520> with<00:05:16.730> your<00:05:16.850> heart<00:05:17.000> rate<00:05:17.090> is<00:05:17.210> but

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
it'll record with your heart rate is but

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.210 
it'll record with your heart rate is but
I<00:05:17.960> would<00:05:18.140> think<00:05:18.260> if<00:05:18.380> you<00:05:18.500> really<00:05:18.860> want<00:05:19.040> to<00:05:19.070> get

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
I would think if you really want to get

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.730 
I would think if you really want to get
a<00:05:19.250> good<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:20.570> calorie<00:05:20.960> counter<00:05:21.440> know<00:05:21.590> what

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
a good the calorie counter know what

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.720
