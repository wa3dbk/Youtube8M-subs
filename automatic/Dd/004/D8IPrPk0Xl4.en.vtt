because I do suffer from dry skin and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.530 
because I do suffer from dry skin and
oily<00:00:39.420> skin<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.320> that's<00:00:40.410> why<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.649> use

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
oily skin so that's why I use

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.770 
oily skin so that's why I use
moisturizer<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.899> doesn't<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> boil<00:00:44.780> so

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
moisturizer that doesn't have a boil so

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.319

seems like I'm putting on a lot but it's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.300 
seems like I'm putting on a lot but it's

sort<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> base<00:01:38.420> just<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.540> foundation

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
sort of like a base just a foundation

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.039 
sort of like a base just a foundation
bare<00:01:41.070> minerals<00:01:41.430> I've<00:01:41.700> been<00:01:41.939> using<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
bare minerals I've been using for a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.840 
bare minerals I've been using for a
while<00:01:43.259> no<00:01:43.590> really<00:01:44.460> good

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
while no really good

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.260 
while no really good
as<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.930> see<00:01:46.350> instantly<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:48.740> goes<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:50.270> and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
as you can see instantly it goes on and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.100 
as you can see instantly it goes on and
it<00:01:52.229> starts<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.890> cover<00:01:53.250> I'm<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.450> perfect

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
