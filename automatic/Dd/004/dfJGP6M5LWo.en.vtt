00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.260
 when setting menus, they can now also menus with multiple pages 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.080
 If you plan to release blue-ray on Blu-ray 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.449
 supports this feature on DVD 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.970
 it does not work we change that z 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.060
 We are looking for a hand like this the miners out of this study 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.999
 and here appreciated the possibility 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.509
 There to make appropriate adjustment 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.679
 At the moment this menu does not contain any ideas 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.960
 we go there the pages palette 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.340
 and if I say here in the menu now 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.600
 Add new pages 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.620
 then pay attention to what he puts here in the Ihme Palette he is coming 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.620
 do not give a new one eg train add the new page 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.260
 we can now see here we draw with it 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.160
 a z for page 1 by double clicking on it i can use the page as well 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.730
 For example, Team Chance to say VAT more 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.710
 Info 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.070
 under Linux a new page 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.490
 but still add new page 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.760
 there is still contact Rathaus Ost 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.990
 as linked and now between these pages 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.039
 I can now jump between pages and jump here 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.590
 and we see I am here at the moment 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.080
 so called pages 0 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.680
 you can see that when I look at Georg Tryba page numbers Ullrich 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.620
 I did Page 1 and we are different 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.540
 all elements of page 0 so all the elements here 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.780
 normal 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.400
 all the buttons are visible now I am now in 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.970
 the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.770
 since then more info or 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.290
 still one click likes 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.630
 however, had contact 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.579
 so it does not matter what you say about that 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.380
 select here 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.460
 whether over typed in the smoothness accident here in the menu 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.810
 I'm now on the page more info the buttons 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.030

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.850
 disappear 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.690
 Gamer in the library and look us 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.850
 a fitting 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.550
 new button 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.850
 and there I can, for example, I would like to have another one here 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.850
 just take off your clothes 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.750
 No, my second statute 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.750
 and align the other rooms 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.049
 and then he left again 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.469
 third miller one 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:12.869
 5 4 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.869
 a notice surfaces to here maybe a normal one 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.889
 if people think the chamber employee's instructor 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.059
 presses 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.689
 achso customs clearance on that 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.689
 we push back market Exelon 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.579
 but collected 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.119
 these show go 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.969
 Adrian thinks of adding such a menu as she is rising to this 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.739
 Element could have added a text 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.340
 one is taking extract page 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.419
 and here 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.359
 you can do more 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.389
 formations 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.749
 write 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:55.099
 Fri drew with it 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.809
 and from the a-team so far 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.629
 in larger cities in between pages and forth 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.629
 insofar you can see this individual 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.529
 just add individual content in the form of images also 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:09.629
 everything that is here 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.969
 into the layer palette, so to speak, we are now seeing here 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.979
 on the page more information 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.269
 and a text 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.289
 additional Information 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.129
 which element they now add objects to each 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.429
 the level 0 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:29.049
 There item will be added there or after all the individual pages here 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.069
 they just add something 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.990
 linking now such pages that 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.969
 John, you have to plus Dirk Hammann 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.209
 we always say when we have the DVD 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.759
 do not want to start with the menus 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.759
 and we are now in the flow of the chamber with making it a little bigger 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:46.269
 maximize 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.909
 then you are here now 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.899
 the page 0 and the pages more information and contact 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.769
 and just like that one can link here too can not for example from 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.639
 a definite page here now i want to say here 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.749
 refer the mini 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:01.749
 or if a movie minstrel from then on 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.889
 and 7 for Peter on it when the movie is played payer Knight Link on 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.379
 Roof can link here on the 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.909
 1 add how much their connection from Pechsteins 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.009
 Name of the movie played St 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.209
 be it so then you can just the link between in different 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.349
 Again, perform pages 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.409
 but you also have the opportunity to cover afterwards 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.620
 Sites like cinema on the blu-ray disc directly 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.900
 to go on a certain time if I pind now here in this menu 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.540
 what then in the chats ackern 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.620
 you go to the next page 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.570
 that is if you do not set it by buttons information the pages 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.719
 on the blu-ray disc 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:39.590
 1 sent in 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.710
 Hein next page 0 more info ab AK timeless thank you note 2 played 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.139
 just as we see it here in the layer palette for the menu 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.689
 Wittmanns also can build a photo the fasting Topshop though only 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.039
 to make this clip with the author 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.499
 Give Candan the name of the page Well then the possibility here 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.389
 add more content 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.069
 to take that before is in Photoshop 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.139
 who has no time is new coding sza light bracket on rhombus 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.360
 use for pages 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.270
 Pages can be used not only in normal minis but also in pop 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.409
 superseded 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.520
 if I go here now 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.259
 Emma should copy and paste Korte da from the spot 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:22.919
 and I say here now 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.650
 that we do the whole 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.120
 the Blue Port Bou 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.189
 want to use 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.379
 then we're off here at Blue Pop 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.379
 since the sides of ZDF of course keep all other elements 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.490
 Buttons are automatically hidden selecting a pop-art endeavor 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.849
 he only supports 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.930
 Buttons but nonetheless 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.289
 also the possibility in a Bluepost 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.499
 who can use his function 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:50.020
 in terms of function can save a lot of time and Jan by applying a 

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:51.620
 blu-ray disc 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.889
 RP the ability to easily put more content in a menu 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.300
 where I had to make a lot of different menus before 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.419
 A disadvantage is that it is not the one from the compact Tel 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.240
 that is the individual subpages 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.129
 do not show up on the DVD 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:06.389
 then you have to maybe 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.389
 but alternatives application 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.569
 for the animals clock on page 0 quasi take place
