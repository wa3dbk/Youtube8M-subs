use alternative clarifying shampoo it
actually<00:00:06.750> takes<00:00:06.990> away<00:00:07.170> any<00:00:07.410> residue<00:00:07.620> and

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
actually takes away any residue and

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.770 
actually takes away any residue and
cleans<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.790> hair<00:00:08.940> for<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> nice<00:00:09.450> application

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780

of<00:00:10.260> vanish<00:00:11.990> this<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> other<00:00:13.440> part<00:00:13.710> which

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
of vanish this is the other part which

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.829 
of vanish this is the other part which
we'll<00:00:14.160> talk<00:00:14.280> about<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.670> second<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.570> looks

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
we'll talk about in a second it looks

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.230 
we'll talk about in a second it looks
like<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.500> then<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> if<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.789> open<00:00:18.150> up

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
like this and then in the if you open up

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.630 
like this and then in the if you open up
the<00:00:18.390> box<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.810> look<00:00:18.990> inside<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:20.039> actually<00:00:20.430> can

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the box and look inside you actually can

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.490 
the box and look inside you actually can
see<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.060> has<00:00:21.180> little<00:00:21.390> directions<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.199> if

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
see that it has little directions but if

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.439 
see that it has little directions but if
you<00:00:22.650> need<00:00:22.800> reading<00:00:23.039> glasses<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.119> time<00:00:24.300> to

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
you need reading glasses is the time to

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.870 
you need reading glasses is the time to
put<00:00:24.600> them<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.859> it's<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:25.949> tiny<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.460> can't<00:00:26.699> read

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
put them on it's so tiny you can't read

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.429 
put them on it's so tiny you can't read
it<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.150> actually<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:27.990> well<00:00:28.170> so

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
it but it actually is in here as well so

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.990 
it but it actually is in here as well so
if<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.650> lose<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.039> blue<00:00:29.429> sheet<00:00:29.730> you're

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
if you lose this blue sheet you're

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.590 
if you lose this blue sheet you're
totally<00:00:30.269> fine<00:00:31.309> there<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.460> two<00:00:32.940> steps<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
totally fine there is two steps to it

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.479 
totally fine there is two steps to it
quite<00:00:33.899> simple<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:34.559> everyone's<00:00:34.890> familiar<00:00:35.160> with

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
quite simple if everyone's familiar with

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.630 
quite simple if everyone's familiar with
it<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:36.390> modulus<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.290> phantom<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.399> step

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it like modulus of phantom you have step

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.959 
it like modulus of phantom you have step
1<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.059> step<00:00:39.090> 2<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:40.320> magic<00:00:40.770> trick<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.790> this

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
1 and step 2 the magic trick is not this

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.100 
1 and step 2 the magic trick is not this
things<00:00:42.239> me<00:00:42.420> alone<00:00:42.629> there<00:00:44.539> I've<00:00:45.539> done<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.840> with

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
things me alone there I've done it with

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.650 
things me alone there I've done it with
the<00:00:46.320> real<00:00:46.500> hair<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.059> ok<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.090> take<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.390> little

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the real hair but ok you take a little

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.970 
the real hair but ok you take a little
bit<00:00:50.449> this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.809> color<00:00:52.079> molecules<00:00:52.739> we'll

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
bit this is the color molecules we'll

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.180 
bit this is the color molecules we'll
pretend<00:00:53.340> okay<00:00:53.719> kind<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.750> stir<00:00:54.989> them<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.260> so

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
pretend okay kind of stir them up so

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.119 
pretend okay kind of stir them up so
let's<00:00:56.430> pretend<00:00:56.610> that's<00:00:57.000> hair<00:00:57.770> then<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.800> take

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
let's pretend that's hair then you take

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.970 
let's pretend that's hair then you take
step<00:00:59.640> one<00:01:00.109> and<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.230> actually<00:01:01.379> put<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.829> in

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
step one and you actually put this in

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.980 
step one and you actually put this in
the<00:01:02.070> applicator<00:01:02.670> bottle<00:01:03.799> so<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:06.420> those<00:01:06.630> step

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the applicator bottle so do those step

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.960 
the applicator bottle so do those step
one<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> little<00:01:11.040> step<00:01:11.340> two

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.580 

now<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.479> really<00:01:15.630> good<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
now this is really good to do when you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.490 
now this is really good to do when you
apply<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> applicator<00:01:18.330> bottle

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.440 

so<00:01:23.500> it's<00:01:23.680> all<00:01:24.250> goes<00:01:25.149> away

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
so it's all goes away

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.580 
so it's all goes away
Wow<00:01:28.409> mm-hmm

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
Wow mm-hmm

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.950 
Wow mm-hmm
so<00:01:30.549> that's<00:01:30.729> pretty<00:01:30.909> much<00:01:31.030> my<00:01:31.119> atmosphere<00:01:31.780> here

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
so that's pretty much my atmosphere here

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.669 
so that's pretty much my atmosphere here
mm-hmm

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
mm-hmm

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.499 
mm-hmm
so<00:01:33.130> what<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.399> want<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.700> do<00:01:33.820> though<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.210> can

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
so what you want to do though is you can

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.639 
so what you want to do though is you can
apply<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:35.590> about<00:01:36.070> 20<00:01:36.340> minutes<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:38.500> can

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
apply this about 20 minutes and you can

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:39.990 
apply this about 20 minutes and you can
actually<00:01:38.799> put<00:01:39.130> them<00:01:39.250> under<00:01:39.429> the<00:01:39.460> dryer<00:01:39.729> so

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
actually put them under the dryer so

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.550 
actually put them under the dryer so
which<00:01:40.119> actually<00:01:40.569> cuz<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:40.840> know<00:01:40.899> he<00:01:41.140> does<00:01:41.319> heat

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
which actually cuz you know he does heat

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.770 
which actually cuz you know he does heat
expands<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.280> opens<00:01:42.310> up<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.700> cuticle<00:01:43.210> so

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
expands and opens up the cuticle so

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.809 
expands and opens up the cuticle so
allows<00:01:44.079> the<00:01:44.380> unclear<00:01:44.860> molecules<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.490> shrink

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
allows the unclear molecules to shrink

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.429 
allows the unclear molecules to shrink
in<00:01:45.969> the<00:01:46.060> cortex<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.750> rinse<00:01:46.960> out<00:01:47.140> with<00:01:47.319> the

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
in the cortex and rinse out with the

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.100 
in the cortex and rinse out with the
water<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:48.909> leave<00:01:49.240> this<00:01:49.329> time<00:01:49.479> about<00:01:49.719> 20

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
water and you leave this time about 20

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.300 
water and you leave this time about 20
minutes<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.469> then<00:01:50.590> what<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:50.740> want<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.039> do<00:01:51.159> is

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
minutes and then what you want to do is

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.029 
minutes and then what you want to do is
make<00:01:51.520> sure<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.840> go<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.259> other<00:01:53.380> step<00:01:53.740> which

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
make sure you go to the other step which

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.600 
make sure you go to the other step which
is<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.459> 10<00:01:54.670> volume<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:55.959> you<00:01:56.049> wanna<00:01:56.229> now<00:01:57.130> some

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
is the 10 volume and you wanna now some

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.749 
is the 10 volume and you wanna now some
people<00:01:58.200> say<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.770> you<00:01:59.890> can<00:02:00.069> take<00:02:00.310> out<00:02:00.520> you

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
people say that you can take out you

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:01.949 
people say that you can take out you
