00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:11.990
 hello everyone we are catching up with her 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:16.590
 missing reasons lowering 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.109
 as a Muratova mount now let's go this 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:27.570
 also says always cryogenic body well 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:34.759
 yesterday we are one bolt March 2 where 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.759
 literally half by 4 meters 3 was 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.730
 young he does what we do 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.950
 distributes the load to the load on the whole 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.110
 the wall that is so that it does not crush 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.960
 we have stepped on one point and not one 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.079
 the brick for this is put young and he 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.350
 evenly distributes to the wall in 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.600
 mostly now put like this 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.850
 wall club party heroes yes and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.489
 I stack to spin I do not 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.820
 never how many at home secondly 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:12.600
 disassembled nowhere there is no ruberoid 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.580
 houses all around mortar and bare 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.420
 mulattos no vampires nothing 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.680
 so I am so as they say and old 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.080
 don't forget and on do and implement as i do 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.409
 under the Murland do clean 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.750
 lime mortar does not give to him 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.350
 poke percent cement and this time 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.259
 I put the creative thin sour cream 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.540
 mur fret and so distribute 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.119
 load completely on the whole wall i.e. 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.899
 as if you did not put bricks but somewhere 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.329
 Murat begins operation much 200 here 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.640
 here you can see the whole gap here 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.470
 gap and there on a few bricks 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.040
 and so when I put a solution to chick it 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.320
 me 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.490
 evenly distributed and immediately on 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.380
 Freshly squeezed and well, I considered myself 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.399
 load is distributed very even 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.310
 right here's another by murat well yes and 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.370
 spoke to the old man if you dislodge it 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.250
 us 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.230
 go on the wall it is his mount as not 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.569
 you can always impose outside 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.349
 bricks if you even have sandwich there 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:30.180
 masonry or some other 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:34.019
