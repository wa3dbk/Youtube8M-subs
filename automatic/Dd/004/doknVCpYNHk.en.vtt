00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello everyone with you sought mastic 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.359
 team 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.849
 meat warcraft experiments needed 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.700
 a long time ago to make a guide about the updated version 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.360
 arrow channel and everything was somehow lazy and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.529
 other mods and all that stuff in general of course 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.000
 got to this he and so in the updated 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.600
 version to your color is added 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.789
 several new mechanisms and items 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.630
 also made a bunch of changes 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.710
 changes regarding work and mechanics 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.000
 these mechanisms as well as recycled 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.870
 almost all textures 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.670
 mechanisms and subject by the way one of 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.700
 developers experimental version 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.230
 for the owl is just an allegory stack 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.149
 but the grip tech makers 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.570
 so you can notice a lot 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.649
 moments like these crypts well and for 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.210
 several episodes 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.860
 this horse i am going to tell you 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.430
 if only 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.760
 new 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.670
 blocks of she mechanisms subjects as well 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.050
 about updated 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:18.110
 objects and maybe it in textures 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.290
 Else if you want to learn and at 40 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.290
 watt it look my old on usual 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.470
 nastrela crafting places the rest everything 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.760
 identical to how I drive first 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.880
 match will tell the generation of the world 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.880
 I'll take it right away 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.860
 here so that it adds copper ore 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.560
 10 appears let 50 level 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.950
 happen all the same stone pickax would you 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.930
 seeks then the same tin 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.880
 ore from 1 to 40 level 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.940
 there is also a stone pick 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.150
 mined then number changed slightly 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.350
 yes she appears sang 64 mined all 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.940
 stone and iron can not pick and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.620
 not changed now that it falls 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.700
 in the form of a block of ore and now do not give experience 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:14.440
 and now you need to handle 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.300
 the crusher also he adds a bunch of light 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.300
 new block ore 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.500
 this is lead yes she appears with 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.510
 first to 64 level and you can get it 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.930
 stone which she drops out as a block 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.910
 like any other water and it has 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.820
 your blog bullion 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.130
 could that strange color become blocks 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.990
 not changed at all 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.880
 hevea also committed changed she 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.410
 everything is also growing where no 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.060
 especially swamp builds 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.750
 the first series is not finished in the second 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.880
 series, I will tell you about everyday 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.670
 mechanisms that you will 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.920
 enjoy every day 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.900
 permanent and so subscribe 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.900
 tell friends good luck bye
