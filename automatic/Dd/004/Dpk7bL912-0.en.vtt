00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.240
 and we're going to dinner because there's 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.190
 national concentration of skate career 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.720
 with a view to what will be the world 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.720
 in november in rosario 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.660
 more than anything to know them see the part 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.360
 technique well in the essential part of the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.700
 straight line work curves 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.280
 movements in a group to go 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.140
 detecting and seeing what are the 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.610
 flaws or what are the most 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.680
 loose you have to keep working 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.780
 as to strengthen them in the future 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.790
 we have the world cup in November if in the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.590
 city ​​of rosario that is to say with the group 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.559
 of adults and youth we are already 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.050
 aiming and working surely for 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.550
 it and we have planned are some 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.420
 tour that is where 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.579
 take part 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.559
 with older and juvenile but good 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.979
 fundamentally the global and work 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.320
 with the lower ones to be able to do 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.080
 a replacement platform but that 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.299
 there is an elite group and the rest without 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.770
 be with a very high level step and 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.900
 then it costs us a lot and we have one 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.110
 bump what is 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.110
 international I think that Argentina 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.690
 he left a lot of time and now the year 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.770
 past began to rebound what we saw 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.770
 us in the world that 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.800
 but well, everyone started working 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.150
 together and the truth that times are 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.150
 improving and every time we feel better 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.300
 I believe that the most important objective 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.130
 will choose will be to compete in other 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.810
 clues that is in the case of when 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.110
 let's run questions that distances 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.060
 are with many runners and races 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.350
 of track if we ran for example in 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.740
 German and let's run the best track 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.479
 of the world that is the fastest and that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.220
 better has improved in every sense of the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.560
 technique improve the times that each 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.570
 one does and obviously the parameter 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.399
 against other runners the rest the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.289
 world needs to improve a lot but I think 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.850
 that we're fine because we're going with the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.459
 way to do it is not that we stay 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.550
 on the road so against better 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.870
 let's work this year for the world 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.019
 November that is done here we are 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.970
 locals is in rosario este contra más 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.920
 let's work better we are doing many 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.170
 we are working on the curve 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.640
 technique now we are with the help 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.980
 Andrea González also joined the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.630
 technical body that serves a lot because it is 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.620
 a woman in the coaching staff at 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.570
 girls who sometimes have a little 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.340
 shame suits them and we are 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.810
 working in all the truth is that it was 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.209
 quite broad the concentration the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.380
 fact of being in groups adds a lot to me 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.300
 It helps me a lot to train with the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.350
 males really try to follow them 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.840
 for more 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.370
 to improve a little and good more than 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.050
 nothing to improve the technique also that 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.050
 well we are a little loose
