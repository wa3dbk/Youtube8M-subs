00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.540
 only she is so approaching so on all 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.330
 good afternoon with you male pasha 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.620
 electric car expert and today we 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.149
 let's start a new heading which is called 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.770
 dispelling electric car myths 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.170
 since i'm the founder of the company winding 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.710
 I very often and get a lot 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.680
 questions on different topics electric cars and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.320
 one of the biggest myths that i 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.039
 I heard people, but how can I not have enough 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.309
 charging 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.260
 but how am I going to cut in the middle of the city ah 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.089
 yes two hundred kilometers it is not enough for one 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.780
 charging or give 100 kilometers is not enough 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.090
 on one charge people and whether it's true 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.649
 just a myth that there is a virus 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.560
 who lives in our heads 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:17.290
 I will explain why I bring only 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.170
 statistics we take with you the city example 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.720
 it will be Moscow, Kiev, Minsk, there is still that 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.450
 then to give the city such a feature 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.689
 the city is true that man who 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.369
 lives here here is this place of residence 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.170
 human gene lives where it is located 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:41.560
 apartment or house a person always chooses 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:45.700
 work place closer home and for example he 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.630
 lives here works here and true in 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.240
 that 90 percent of people 90 percent 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.470
 people this world official statistics 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.799
 by the way data on the internet 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.470
 90 percent of people a day drive by 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.659
 50 kilometers and guess what they have 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.070
 here's the route 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:09.280
 they constantly travel from home to work 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.570
 the house will work and so sometimes this 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.950
 the route changes they charge 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.849
 supermarket which 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.620
 same house and he is so three kilometers away from me 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.239
 them more mileage and they went ticks 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.910
 from work there went to the mother-in-law and 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.099
 come back anyway that's it 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.910
 does not exceed 100 kilometers in normal 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.220
 the city's understand those over there 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.950
 30-40 kilometers back to him 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.110
 day by and large to a man whose 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.360
 electric car with charging 50 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.549
 kilometers it's enough even if he 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.739
 came to the mother in law he has a long 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.410
 gliterny took a throwing balcony Tomsk on 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.959
 extension cord charged this is not a problem 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.530
 when a person begins to read and understand 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.620
 that he save 20,000 dollars for 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.890
 next 10 years 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.170
 moved to an electric car he understands yes 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.670
 here is this little discomfort which 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.319
 associated with the program for charging it as it were 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.380
 covers 20,000 dollars cover 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.200
 a little discomfort 20,000 this by the way 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.239
 the minimum amount of which your year at 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.130
 signal car or other option 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.260
 man has a sensor 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.630
 further down here to the city man 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.620
 arrives and to let him go 50 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:29.049
 kilometers he's here of these 50 kilometers to him 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.690
 anyway enough electric car 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.889
 watched the most which we will redo a hundred 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.660
 one hundred fifty kilometers on one 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.260
 charging 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.139
 refitting costs about 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.870
 ten stove so an electric car with 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:44.350
 more than covers daily 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.639
 need for movement a person sleeps in 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.040
 yourself at home the car is charging everything 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.829
 you understand us in the news all boldly 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.550
 our infrastructure is not enough 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.580
 knowingly take prague away 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.780
 charging 90 percent of people passing by here 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.170
 this route is constantly the people who 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.710
 enter ten percent of the other they have enough 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.530
 cars 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.390
 filmed nine percent 90 these are the ones that 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.950
 drive through here and so nine 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.760
 percent is those who drive here 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.400
 such route 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.769
 there are two times more from one end 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.980
 cities to another they don't just travel alone 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.510
 percentage is the taxi drivers delivery service and 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.970
 so on those that day knife there 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.830
 two to three hundred kilometers or those to whom 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.490
 it is necessary every day there is another city 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.740
 as therefore remember 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.260
 electric car today 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.810
 actual transport for the city which 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.770
 helps to save from 20 thousand dollars 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.080
 over 10 years battery life with you 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.780
 was a male pasha write comments under 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.090
 this video what do you think about it and in 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.220
 next video i will tell you about others 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.030
 myths that are about electric cars 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.030
 is happy
