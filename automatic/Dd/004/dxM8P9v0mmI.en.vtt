00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 Hi guys, I 'm going to present to 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.299
 you a brand new string of the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.570
 violin that arrives in the national market 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.190
 What is this rope she is doing to me? 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.250
 surprised from the moment that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.800
 I tried it I was searched for some 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.390
 days ago by the barbosa music team 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.170
 that the company that is distributing 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.490
 Do you wake up in Brazil for me? 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.869
 trying to provide a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.029
 feedback respect 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.489
 at first I presented a certain 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.309
 resistance because I have many years one 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.649
 of a rope brand imported from Germany which 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.649
 responds to all needs as 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.800
 musician and we are instrumentalist has a 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.780
 and I fear in everything that might expose our 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.489
 performance maybe that's the thing 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.940
 more important for the musician that way. 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.070
 a very soulful thing in the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.239
 moment that is playing then we 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.309
 presents a certain resistance 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.070
 principle I really stayed 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.960
 impressed by the quality of the rope is 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.440
 a rope that she responds so well 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.000
 the rope he wore and the price 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.780
 that will be sold in brazil comes to 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.430
 be six times smaller and so it is in these 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.369
 Days that I'm playing with this rope I 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.159
 I did not realize I lost any of the quality 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.049
 compared to another string the answer 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.030
 sound is something that has a lot of team 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.210
 bright it has a response of 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.090
 fantastic dynamics she responds so 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.850
 well as severe acute dynamics 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.380
 gradual dynamics at last is a 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.090
 fantastic thing 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.490
 it's worth it at least you're 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.900
 Experiencing for me I'm sure that 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.340
 Just like me you'll be surprised 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.200
 with the quality of the court 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.060
 So for all that I asked myself 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.320
 French any rope brand that you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.409
 uses his violin 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.579
 I am revealing publicly today not 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.970
 it's almost used 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.049
 but as of today is the cut in the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.049
 professional synthetic leather 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.450
 Thanks guys it's very worth it 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.450
 experience that everyone embrace rope
