00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.629
 he cleans your house 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.750
 the specifications of this samsung 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.870
 robotic vacuum cleaner he bagless 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.250
 it a 0.5 liter container 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.920

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.780
 decibel sound he wants an environment 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.180
 scanner and on a battery 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.180
 it does 120 square meters 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.620
 this robot vacuum cleaner that just makes 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.940
 automatically clean and it saves 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.040
 of course a lot of time for those 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.570
 that normally needs cleaning 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.150
 This robot vacuum cleaner works through it 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.220
 of four different programs 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.710
 automatic program 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.090
 the local program the program that 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.619
 He remains just suck it until the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.210
 battery is empty and then returns 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.150
 to his docking station 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.869
 or the mail from my hand with a 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.869
 remote control 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.100
 this goes with the automatic program 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.960
 robot vacuum cleaner the middle of his 36 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.729
 scan sensors first 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.500
 together with the camera where it should suck 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.510
 and then he just goes to pattern 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.880
 just as long as making times everywhere 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.650
 then it has been local 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.479
 program what he does then is at the 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.550
 place a robot vacuum cleaner in a jet 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.590
 of one and a half meters stays just as long 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.180
 when it is completely clean and 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.800
 of course ideal refresh somewhere 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.140
 I messed up then we still have it 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.450
 extensive program then it stays just 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.009
 clean as long as he battery 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.350
 is low and he just drives 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.300
 automatically back to swingsteesjun 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.340
 where it can recharge itself then 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.560
 have the manual program that do 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.550
 you through this 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.250
 remote control via the we actually 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.300
 by applying a vacuum cleaner as yes 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.300
 such as steerable car 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.739
 you can also use this robot vacuum cleaner 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.030
 tuna as required 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.590
 for example, do you want that Monday 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.300
 you only want the edges 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.069
 for example, a week in the kitchen on Tuesday 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.600
 or that you do for example on Wednesday 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.610
 by doing the living room you can 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.640
 set it the way you would 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.640
 want 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.329
 you can also do this robot vacuum cleaner yourself 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.519
 indicate when you want it to start 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.840
 with cleaning meant if you were 12 hours 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.180
 go to bed then you can say on 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.609
 Monday he starts at 12 a.m. 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.290
 at maybe an hour you were allowed 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.599
 Well just be away during the day then you can 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.790
 also just give up job i want him on 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.769
 that time , no matter how 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.659
 so you come back have a job for this 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.870
 done at the time you like it 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.870
 would like 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.900
 were allowed to go to small obstacles such as 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.090
 do not dress any cables or a thin one 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.710
 problem this robot vacuum cleaner 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.330
 is just about the obstacles of one 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.610
 one and a half centimeters 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.290
 zoÃ« this robot vacuum cleaner has that 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.120
 all your house scanned and of course 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.350
 but if you still had an obstacle 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.540
 encountering that is no problem at all 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.520
 namely have anti-moth systems 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.980
 as very softly ticking on something 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.390
 then he immediately ticks back so that he 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.010
 no obstacles 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.320
 this robot also has a heart attack 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.390
 vacuum cleaner and security 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.240
 These are then lifted closing 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.260
 straight out so there are no fingers anywhere 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.260
 could intervene 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.030
 the virtual guard is included 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.700
 to you that he does not progress beyond 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.959
 the wood here and not on the tiles 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.510
 we put it here 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.950
 create a virtual wall and you will 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.950
 never get further than here
