00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.300 
game is a 2-1 Barcelona mean
I<00:02:07.880> think<00:02:08.420> they<00:02:08.930> will<00:02:09.140> be<00:02:09.290> just<00:02:09.530> too<00:02:09.740> strong<00:02:10.010> for

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
I think they will be just too strong for

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.330 
I think they will be just too strong for
me<00:02:10.430> lon<00:02:10.610> but<00:02:11.180> on<00:02:11.360> there<00:02:11.660> Damien<00:02:12.140> can<00:02:12.560> hurt

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
me lon but on there Damien can hurt

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.210 
me lon but on there Damien can hurt
anything<00:02:13.880> because<00:02:14.510> with<00:02:15.200> Balotelli<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:15.980> El

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
anything because with Balotelli and El

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.610 
anything because with Balotelli and El
Shaarawy<00:02:16.580> up<00:02:16.940> front<00:02:17.240> they<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.960> very<00:02:18.380> very

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
Shaarawy up front they have a very very

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.150 
Shaarawy up front they have a very very
strong<00:02:18.800> attack<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:21.140> major<00:02:21.440> problem<00:02:21.980> for

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
strong attack but the major problem for

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.890 
strong attack but the major problem for
Milan<00:02:22.520> is<00:02:22.700> their<00:02:22.940> defense<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.540> not<00:02:23.720> the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
Milan is their defense is not the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.020 
Milan is their defense is not the
strongest<00:02:24.140> they<00:02:24.920> are<00:02:25.100> struggling<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.850> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
strongest they are struggling in the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.630 
strongest they are struggling in the
Syria<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.570> think<00:02:27.140> they<00:02:27.560> are<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.980> fifth<00:02:28.370> or

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
Syria I think they are in the fifth or

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.240 
Syria I think they are in the fifth or
sixth<00:02:29.030> position<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:30.140> they<00:02:30.380> might<00:02:30.620> not<00:02:30.830> be<00:02:31.040> in

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
sixth position so they might not be in

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.920 
sixth position so they might not be in
the<00:02:31.370> champions<00:02:31.820> league<00:02:31.850> next<00:02:32.240> season<00:02:32.390> and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
the champions league next season and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.780 
the champions league next season and
what<00:02:33.560> are<00:02:33.590> saved<00:02:34.040> by<00:02:34.220> victor<00:02:34.610> brothers

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
what are saved by victor brothers

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.660
