00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.950
 hello today we are going to learn how to prepare a 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.469
 pasta dish like this that takes 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.230
 tuna and piquillo peppers sauce 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.190
 homemade fried tomato made in a very 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.190
 easy and fast 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.380
 The ingredients we need are 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.390
 pasta for two people to taste 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.369
 we have chosen sharks but they 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.400
 can choose for example kill drones 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.090
 that there are also very good 300 or 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.610
 400 grams of crushed tomato a can 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.110
 of tuna in medium drained oil 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:46.239
 onion a clove of garlic and 45 peppers 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.239
 from piquillo we started 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.079
 the first step is to heat water 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.089
 and when the salt water and once it's 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.329
 boiling we put the pasta so that it 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.329
 make 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.030
 then we drain and we will reserve 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.100
 and while the pasta is cooking we can go 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.700
 making the tomato sauce that the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.700
 partner 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.909
 the fried tomato sauce that goes to 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.579
 accompany our pasta we have put 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.780
 in a pan to heat the oil 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.399
 Olive and when I was ready 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.520
 hot enough we have put to 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.310
 press the half onion and the tooth of 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.929
 garlic well chopped as you see until the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.789
 bochazos always what we do now 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.789
 then add the crushed tomato 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.890
 and we let it integrate we can do 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.410
 also the fried tomato sauce with 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.500
 tomato is also drip with tomato 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.140
 normal with boat voice better if they are 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.330
 peeled canned and we will throw them 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.370
 same way in this case we would have to 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.590
 Crush a little more to go undoing 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.520
 the tomatoes until or continue our 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.340
 let sauce is hot sauce 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.709
 a little bit without the onion the little 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.479
 cornellÃ  here we do not forget either 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.479
 to pour some salt 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.569
 and we can add spices to taste and 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.400
 which I recommend in our case 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.920
 We recommend you take a little 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.110
 sugar to remove the acidity that 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.110
 yes you have this type of crushed tomato 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.370
 once we have our sauce 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.439
 tomato what we do and we are 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.420
 thrown in this casserole the pasta already 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.959
 could and drained and we are incorporating 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.170
 the rest of the ingredients incorporate the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.170
 you 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.620
 so that they are closing 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.140
 with fire too very low to avoid 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.020
 that we will stick the base on everything 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.150
 stirring the whole home then we add 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.160
 the piquillo peppers that we 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.400
 and we started a little chopped 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.400
 bruce 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.780
 and not 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.440
 and finally we would incorporate the sauce 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.440
 tomato 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.850
 and 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.460
 in the same way so that everything is delivered 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.110
 and now we leave one or two minutes as 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.030
 a lot so that according to all 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.810
 flavors and we will have ready our
