00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.460 
that was our number one and right behind
that<00:01:49.220> was<00:01:49.610> our<00:01:49.909> metal<00:01:50.240> polish<00:01:50.600> okay

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
that was our metal polish okay

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.919 
that was our metal polish okay
so<00:01:52.280> I<00:01:52.310> think<00:01:52.759> you<00:01:53.090> know<00:01:53.209> no<00:01:53.420> polish<00:01:53.780> is

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
so I think you know no polish is

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.120 
so I think you know no polish is

that<00:03:33.480> we<00:03:33.720> have<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.079> ability<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.829> cut<00:03:35.280> down

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
that we have the ability to cut down

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.190 
that we have the ability to cut down
through<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.000> ink<00:03:36.180> on<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.419> can<00:03:36.720> but<00:03:37.049> not

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
through the ink on the can but not

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.259 
through the ink on the can but not
scratch<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.829> south<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.190> oil<00:03:38.489> underneath<00:03:38.790> yeah

scratch the south of oil underneath yeah
now<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:40.139> might<00:03:40.230> be<00:03:40.349> a<00:03:40.470> little<00:03:40.590> harder<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.130> see

power seal the power seal product can be
used<00:04:03.519> for<00:04:03.730> two<00:04:03.909> purposes

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
used for two purposes

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.780 
used for two purposes
number<00:04:05.140> one<00:04:05.349> after<00:04:05.590> using<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.129> metal<00:04:06.400> polish

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
number one after using a metal polish

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.520 
number one after using a metal polish
you've<00:04:07.060> opened<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.599> pores<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.049> metal<00:04:08.290> and

you've opened the pores of the metal and

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.960 
you've opened the pores of the metal and
they're<00:04:08.620> much<00:04:08.769> more<00:04:08.980> susceptible<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.640> start

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
they're much more susceptible to start

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.539 
they're much more susceptible to start
oxidizing<00:04:10.330> again<00:04:10.930> by<00:04:11.560> applying<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.370> power

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
oxidizing again by applying the power

oxidizing again by applying the power
seal<00:04:12.909> at<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.269> point<00:04:13.629> put<00:04:14.290> it<00:04:14.379> on<00:04:14.530> let<00:04:15.069> it<00:04:15.190> dry

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
seal at that point put it on let it dry

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.490 
seal at that point put it on let it dry
completely<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:16.840> can<00:04:16.959> even<00:04:17.109> let<00:04:17.229> it<00:04:17.290> dry

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
completely you can even let it dry

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.170 
completely you can even let it dry
overnight<00:04:17.739> it's<00:04:18.130> not<00:04:18.340> going<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.609> harden<00:04:19.060> or

powder residue mm-hmm okay depending on
your<00:04:27.880> climbing<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.389> little<00:04:28.630> bit<00:04:28.750> you'd<00:04:28.990> want<00:04:29.199> to

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
your climbing a little bit you'd want to

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.710 
your climbing a little bit you'd want to
apply<00:04:29.530> this<00:04:29.770> maybe<00:04:29.979> once<00:04:30.340> per<00:04:30.729> quarter<00:04:31.060> okay

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
apply this maybe once per quarter okay

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.570 
apply this maybe once per quarter okay
you<00:04:31.930> know<00:04:32.050> it's<00:04:32.320> it's<00:04:32.680> so<00:04:32.919> much<00:04:33.070> easier<00:04:33.100> to

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
you know it's it's so much easier to

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.159 
you know it's it's so much easier to
apply<00:04:33.789> this<00:04:33.940> thing<00:04:34.389> to<00:04:34.539> get<00:04:34.660> in<00:04:34.810> there<00:04:34.960> with<00:04:35.139> a

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
apply this thing to get in there with a
