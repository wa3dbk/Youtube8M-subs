00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 for all we find ourselves today 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.970

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.589

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.590
 fifa ultimate team 14 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.309
 so it's very simple just go 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.650
 on a site 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.000
 so we'll do it together so everything 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.130
 first i'm going to show you that my 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.920
 best player is nice styger 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.369
 of which 88 and could well stalled in the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.890
 page 1 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.910
 so I have nothing better so you 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.510
 go to the site that in the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.019
 description 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:33.210
 so it's easy to find one in the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.680
 description helping you form you 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.710
 asked us we'll do it together 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.050
 except that I will start by writing 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.770
 my players and my desired credits and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.260
 the platform 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.579
 then I'm going to cut the video for 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.320
 that I provide information 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.480
 confidential 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.480
 so as a player I asked to neuter 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.870
 daniele totti vs 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.769
 tutti 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.300
 blam if the defensive point then the soul 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.670
 mdc i will ask who you understand 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.909
 because it's the boost under the last 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:22.030
 boustila in central defensive midfield 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:28.470
 alaba boosts ski sales it is not 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:35.229

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:38.679

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.950
