00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.430
The subtitles are fully ready now =)

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.430
Kinda just shooting short video

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.430
Today is the 25th of July
Our first day in the studio

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.450
There is a big lack of time.
I've got 1.5 minutes to set up drums

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.490
I bet you will =)
Let's go.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:49.430
\m/ (o_o) \m/

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.430
Ludwig will be recording drums
I'm too old

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.430
I can't do anything properly
My arms, legs ...and everything else hurt

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.430
That's why this guy 
is gonna do the whole album for me

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.430
That's a brand new technique
in playing drums my friends

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.430
Who's that guy?
Do you have any clue?

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.430
What sort of crap did he eat this morning 
that he behaves this way? 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.430
I know that when you are a really good at playing
you hear much more things

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.430
I know that because I've worked with other drummers who are...
You know the same as you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.430
You know what it sounds like when you play it really well
I mean it's your record you can do what you want

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.430
That's my new image 
and it's gonna stay forever

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.430
Guess
Heads or tails?
