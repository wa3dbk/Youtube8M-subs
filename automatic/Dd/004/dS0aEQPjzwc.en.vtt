comfortable it's no warmer in here than

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.910 
comfortable it's no warmer in here than
it<00:02:29.350> is<00:02:29.440> outside

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
it is outside

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.530 
it is outside
right<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.519> mean<00:02:30.549> what<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:30.940> can<00:02:31.090> do<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.329> you<00:02:31.420> can

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
right I mean what you can do is you can

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.840 
right I mean what you can do is you can
raise<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.989> side<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.470> bottom<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:32.980> wall

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
raise the side the bottom of the wall

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.000 
raise the side the bottom of the wall
and<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.540> let<00:02:34.750> air<00:02:34.930> in<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.380> then<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> updraft

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
and that let air in and then the updraft

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.620 
and that let air in and then the updraft
all<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.579> hot<00:02:36.730> air<00:02:36.880> goes<00:02:37.060> out<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.359> roof<00:02:37.510> so

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
all the hot air goes out the roof so

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.620 
all the hot air goes out the roof so
it's<00:02:37.780> very<00:02:37.930> cool<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.970> very<00:02:40.120> sturdy<00:02:40.480> I

the top of it there's a heating tray -

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.559 
the top of it there's a heating tray -
yeah<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.190> we<00:03:09.310> haven't<00:03:09.730> got<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.180> right

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.849 
now but there's a stove shield which is
fireproof<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.840> actual<00:03:14.139> stovepipe<00:03:14.590> can<00:03:14.769> go

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
fireproof so the actual stovepipe can go
