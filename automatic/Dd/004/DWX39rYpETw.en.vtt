00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.580 
you do have to become hospitalized it
doesn't<00:02:21.530> look<00:02:21.620> good<00:02:21.680> for<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.220> then<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:24.410> it's

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
doesn't look good for you then so it's

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.190 
doesn't look good for you then so it's
sort<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.800> like<00:02:24.860> we're<00:02:25.070> let<00:02:25.720> it's<00:02:26.720> rocking<00:02:27.110> a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
sort of like we're let it's rocking a

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.730 
sort of like we're let it's rocking a
low<00:02:27.410> probability<00:02:27.730> but<00:02:28.730> high<00:02:28.940> impact<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.780> that

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
low probability but high impact and that

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.020 
low probability but high impact and that
regard<00:02:31.370> we<00:02:32.140> suggest<00:02:33.140> low-cost<00:02:34.030> mitigation

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
regard we suggest low-cost mitigation

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.690 
regard we suggest low-cost mitigation
efforts<00:02:35.920> we've<00:02:36.920> mentioned<00:02:37.100> this<00:02:37.310> before<00:02:37.430> in

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
efforts we've mentioned this before in

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.210 
efforts we've mentioned this before in
other<00:02:37.790> videos<00:02:38.290> we<00:02:39.290> keep<00:02:39.470> mentioning<00:02:39.710> this

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
other videos we keep mentioning this

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.710 
other videos we keep mentioning this
because<00:02:40.280> it's<00:02:40.820> something<00:02:41.030> not<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.390> lot<00:02:41.600> of

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
because it's something not a lot of

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.600 
because it's something not a lot of
people<00:02:41.960> know<00:02:41.990> about<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.770> it's<00:02:43.430> something

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
people know about and it's something

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.490 
people know about and it's something
that<00:02:43.880> can<00:02:44.000> give<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.300> an<00:02:44.390> edge<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.260> is

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
that can give you an edge and that is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.370 
that can give you an edge and that is
chlorhexidine<00:02:46.220> gluconate<00:02:46.720> it's<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.870> surgical

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
chlorhexidine gluconate it's a surgical

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.490 
chlorhexidine gluconate it's a surgical
scrub<00:02:48.710> that<00:02:49.490> you<00:02:50.480> wash<00:02:50.660> your<00:02:50.840> hands<00:02:51.080> with<00:02:51.320> it

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
scrub that you wash your hands with it

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.860 
scrub that you wash your hands with it
and<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.770> keeps<00:02:51.980> killing<00:02:52.280> multiple<00:02:53.150> germs<00:02:53.660> and

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
and it keeps killing multiple germs and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.940 
and it keeps killing multiple germs and
bugs<00:02:54.050> including<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.890> SARS<00:02:55.490> MERS<00:02:55.880> kovy<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.950> h7n9

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
bugs including a SARS MERS kovy and h7n9

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.480 
bugs including a SARS MERS kovy and h7n9
bird<00:02:58.160> flu<00:02:58.520> it<00:02:59.420> kills<00:02:59.810> them<00:03:00.340> kills<00:03:01.340> these

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
bird flu it kills them kills these

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.699 
bird flu it kills them kills these
things<00:03:01.850> for<00:03:02.240> six<00:03:02.570> hours<00:03:02.720> after<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.170> wash<00:03:03.440> with

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
things for six hours after you wash with

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.400 
things for six hours after you wash with
it<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.340> if<00:03:05.180> not<00:03:05.420> only<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:05.990> a<00:03:06.020> glove

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
it so if not only is it like a glove

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.190 
it so if not only is it like a glove
it's<00:03:07.070> like<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> glove<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:08.000> kills<00:03:08.300> deadly

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
it's like a glove that kills deadly

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.020 
it's like a glove that kills deadly
bacteria<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:10.970> we<00:03:11.060> have<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.209> link<00:03:11.450> here<00:03:11.720> to

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
bacteria and so we have a link here to

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.460 
bacteria and so we have a link here to
stuff<00:03:14.030> we've<00:03:14.270> purchased<00:03:14.480> on<00:03:14.780> Amazon<00:03:15.200> Amazon

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
stuff we've purchased on Amazon Amazon

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.500 
stuff we've purchased on Amazon Amazon
does<00:03:16.190> seem<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.430> be<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.700> cheapest<00:03:17.090> best<00:03:17.300> place

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
does seem to be the cheapest best place

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.220 
does seem to be the cheapest best place
to<00:03:17.660> get<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:18.790> but<00:03:19.790> again<00:03:20.060> we<00:03:20.390> think<00:03:20.600> this<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:20.930> low

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
to get it but again we think this is low

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.710 
to get it but again we think this is low
risk<00:03:21.560> but<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.730> potential<00:03:23.060> impact<00:03:23.510> is<00:03:23.690> high<00:03:24.370> so

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
risk but the potential impact is high so

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.230 
risk but the potential impact is high so
you<00:03:26.720> have<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:26.930> be<00:03:26.959> careful
