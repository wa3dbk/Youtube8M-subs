00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
strap i'm not really sure yet but i

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.820 
strap i'm not really sure yet but i
picked<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.360> pair<00:04:56.720> because<00:04:57.050> i<00:04:57.289> didn't<00:04:57.740> like

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
picked this pair because i didn't like

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.300 
picked this pair because i didn't like
them<00:04:58.270> that<00:04:59.270> much<00:04:59.330> and<00:04:59.900> I<00:05:00.139> figured<00:05:00.590> if<00:05:00.740> I<00:05:00.889> kind

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
them that much and I figured if I kind

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.680 
them that much and I figured if I kind
of<00:05:01.370> screwed<00:05:01.610> up<00:05:01.820> on<00:05:01.970> these<00:05:02.090> because<00:05:02.330> these<00:05:02.510> are

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
of screwed up on these because these are

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.110 
of screwed up on these because these are
my<00:05:02.780> prototype<00:05:03.349> then<00:05:04.160> no<00:05:04.310> big<00:05:04.520> deal<00:05:04.729> and<00:05:04.970> then

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
my prototype then no big deal and then

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.719 
my prototype then no big deal and then
here's<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.750> back<00:05:06.289> but<00:05:07.190> I<00:05:07.250> think<00:05:07.460> it'll<00:05:07.580> be

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
here's the back but I think it'll be

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.060 
here's the back but I think it'll be
cute<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:08.150> know<00:05:08.270> it's<00:05:08.449> a<00:05:08.539> with<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.169> handle<00:05:09.620> and

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
cute you know it's a with the handle and

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.629 
cute you know it's a with the handle and
antennas<00:05:10.550> scrunched<00:05:11.060> up<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:15.400> then<00:05:16.400> I<00:05:16.490> was

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
antennas scrunched up and then I was

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.580 
antennas scrunched up and then I was
thinking<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.180> somebody<00:05:17.570> at<00:05:17.780> somebody's<00:05:18.320> video

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
thinking to somebody at somebody's video

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.400 
thinking to somebody at somebody's video
had<00:05:19.160> found<00:05:19.550> a<00:05:19.849> place<00:05:20.210> map<00:05:20.599> that<00:05:20.810> she<00:05:21.020> like<00:05:21.199> just

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
had found a place map that she like just

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.860 
had found a place map that she like just
so<00:05:21.560> she<00:05:21.620> used<00:05:21.889> that<00:05:22.010> as<00:05:22.310> a<00:05:22.370> flap<00:05:22.849> so<00:05:23.479> she<00:05:23.570> sewed

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
so she used that as a flap so she sewed

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.560 
so she used that as a flap so she sewed
it<00:05:23.990> to<00:05:24.139> the<00:05:24.229> back

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.200 

waistband<00:05:28.570> and<00:05:28.870> then<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:30.310> came<00:05:30.639> over<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:31.090> it

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
waistband and then it came over and it

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.939 
waistband and then it came over and it
flapped<00:05:31.479> over<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.930> front<00:05:32.169> so<00:05:32.350> that<00:05:32.380> was<00:05:32.710> cute

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
flapped over the front so that was cute

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.650 
flapped over the front so that was cute
so<00:05:33.100> I<00:05:33.190> might<00:05:33.400> do<00:05:33.729> something<00:05:33.970> like<00:05:34.240> that<00:05:34.419> but<00:05:34.540> I

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
so I might do something like that but I

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.450 
so I might do something like that but I
need<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:35.110> figure<00:05:35.350> out<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.770> logistics<00:05:35.889> of

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
need to figure out the logistics of

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.530 
need to figure out the logistics of
actually<00:05:38.070> sewing<00:05:39.070> the<00:05:39.370> bottom<00:05:39.699> together<00:05:39.910> and

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
actually sewing the bottom together and

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.230 
actually sewing the bottom together and
then<00:05:40.810> deciding<00:05:41.710> you<00:05:42.250> know<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.550> details<00:05:42.970> what

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
then deciding you know the details what

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.000 
then deciding you know the details what
do<00:05:43.300> I<00:05:43.419> want<00:05:43.630> to<00:05:43.690> put<00:05:43.870> on<00:05:44.020> it<00:05:44.050> do<00:05:44.470> I<00:05:44.560> want<00:05:44.770> to<00:05:44.830> put

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
what am I going to do with these did I

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.659 
what am I going to do with these did I
remember<00:05:52.300> in<00:05:52.620> high<00:05:53.620> school<00:05:53.650> I<00:05:54.040> think<00:05:54.130> we<00:05:54.490> took

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
remember in high school I think we took

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:02.129 
remember in high school I think we took
the<00:05:54.910> legs<00:05:55.320> and<00:05:58.500> like<00:05:59.500> cut<00:05:59.770> them<00:05:59.889> off<00:06:00.100> and<00:06:01.139> then

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
the legs and like cut them off and then

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.830 
the legs and like cut them off and then
would<00:06:02.650> sew<00:06:02.949> the<00:06:03.400> bottom<00:06:03.580> or<00:06:04.120> this<00:06:04.539> would<00:06:04.690> be

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
would sew the bottom or this would be

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.719 
would sew the bottom or this would be
the<00:06:04.960> bottom<00:06:05.380> so<00:06:05.770> this<00:06:05.949> would<00:06:06.100> be<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.310> top<00:06:06.550> and

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
the bottom so this would be the top and

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:15.719 
the bottom so this would be the top and
cut<00:06:09.729> it<00:06:09.850> off<00:06:10.030> and<00:06:10.449> then<00:06:10.479> sew<00:06:11.139> across<00:06:14.520> and<00:06:15.520> make

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
cut it off and then sew across and make

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.610 
cut it off and then sew across and make
the<00:06:15.970> bottom<00:06:16.539> seam<00:06:16.840> and<00:06:17.050> then<00:06:17.169> this<00:06:17.289> would<00:06:17.470> be

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
the bottom seam and then this would be

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.100 
the bottom seam and then this would be
the<00:06:17.770> top<00:06:18.039> but<00:06:18.880> they<00:06:19.030> were<00:06:19.090> you<00:06:19.660> know<00:06:19.810> where<00:06:19.990> the

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
the top but they were you know where the

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:26.580 
the top but they were you know where the
bell<00:06:20.289> bottom<00:06:20.680> so<00:06:20.919> they<00:06:21.070> were<00:06:21.130> wider<00:06:25.530> but<00:06:26.530> I

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
bell bottom so they were wider but I

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.080 
bell bottom so they were wider but I
thought<00:06:26.830> that<00:06:26.979> might<00:06:27.160> be<00:06:27.220> a<00:06:27.340> cute<00:06:27.580> idea<00:06:27.729> or

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
thought that might be a cute idea or

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.960 
thought that might be a cute idea or
maybe<00:06:28.120> even<00:06:28.479> to<00:06:29.370> make<00:06:30.370> you<00:06:30.639> know<00:06:30.760> like<00:06:30.940> a

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
maybe even to make you know like a

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.270 
maybe even to make you know like a
although<00:06:31.780> i<00:06:31.930> don't<00:06:32.080> use<00:06:32.289> a<00:06:32.320> curling<00:06:32.770> iron<00:06:32.919> or<00:06:33.220> a

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
although i don't use a curling iron or a

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.940 
although i don't use a curling iron or a
flat<00:06:33.460> iron<00:06:33.520> but<00:06:34.419> that<00:06:34.570> would<00:06:34.720> be<00:06:34.750> cute<00:06:35.050> idea<00:06:35.470> to

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
flat iron but that would be cute idea to

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.730
