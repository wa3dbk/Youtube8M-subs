00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.629
 we have this opposition setting opposition 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.730
 now the table some decision makers title 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.319
 some families some of these columns 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:11.010
 being a special name 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.570
 It is important that you dress up as well as destroy who you are. 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.340
 elements 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.240
 who are in these families 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.470
 so when your name of the main families you realize this 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.919
 very well 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.380
 so the family lives 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.819
 the alkali metal family 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:29.479
 the family 2 air the unit of metals the technological boats 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.170
 the 6h family 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.540
 current coxinense disc family 16 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.899
 current 17 old 7h 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.750
 family says to jeans 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.760
 18th building with eight apartments gazes london 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.340
 In addition, these names and the elements that make up these families 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.170
 now the table understands the case - years of cuf formations then one learns one 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.920
 series of information and on the table and looking at her 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.290
 the point is that this means of information 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.690
 another thing that the table can provide us 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.959
 are properties 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:04.959
 this impropriety of the elements which accompany 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.520
 her 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.960
 the riots 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.759
 then it all boils down to two important properties 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.680
 Why do you remember meeting the sea? 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.970
 the size of the atom that electronegativity 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.840
 - let's go to the behavior of these properties 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.810
 over the periods 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.990
 so looking at the table is not over every period the size of the current and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.390
 that grows in the sense of getting everything right 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.780
 then right to stop 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.100
 left and ascending low and top to bottom 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.450
 so if you look in that corner of the table 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.520
 you have the metals in which metals are atoms with large 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.140
 such names would be acts 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.500
 small 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.600
 in the sequence appears as electronegativity 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.400
 you see that the noble gases do not possess the eletronic activity and she 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.680
 grows up and to the right 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.050
 in this corner we're not lethal 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.479
 this electronegativity of the non-metallic metals 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.299
 are they that are negative in 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.049
 this is a great tendency to receive by quercus we have the name quay custom has 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.549
 a great and electrifying one of the extreme ease who receives the concerts 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.420
 these two pieces of information 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.560
 the metals 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.239
 are acts with great 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.650
 has a fragility in US dollars 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.769
 the name tradition among the small 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.899
 with a great tendency to intercede electrical 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.009
 we have a notion of some characteristics of the periodic table 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.359
 Let's do an exercise now. 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.309
 consolidate the concepts 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.719
 looking gift 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:36.159
 elements 1 2 and 3 have the following electronic configurations in their 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.579
 valence layer 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.029
 then the last layer of three sea elements is represented 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:45.939
 3s2 3p 3 4c 2 4 and 5 three winners 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.959
 based on this information 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.329
 mark the wrong alternative 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.269
 cinema 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.010
 we passed high from the alternatives of that start he told me talgo fed himself 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.809
 and not lethal if they stay this is the way 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:04.430
 they can solve this we will join the elements and characterized better 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.650
 Let's go with the resolution 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.260
 podium will be the element in its electronic configuration in the last 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.380
 layer three winners three p3 you have three layers that meets the 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.719
 period periodic table 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.459
 this totalizes the elets of that last layer 2 in the simple extension meters he 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.560
 belongs to the family 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.129
 sitting in a room 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.729
 being a family moment 5 in the third period and not natal 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.819
 the experiment August 2 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.840
 at the moment two what the 4x2 4p five configuration 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.840
 four comrades in the fourth period 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.400
 total playing with the two but by seven elements belongs to the family 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.420
 if taken 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.290
 malu current genius family 17 also non-lethal 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.579
 accommodation 3 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.969
 its configuration and 3tc 2 with three layers it is the third 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:55.769
 period 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.900
 two electrodes in the last layer 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.900
 this family 2 apocalyptic christmas 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.339
 we return with the alternatives 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:07.829
 and that the wrong alternative if you get irritated 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.079
 so he increased the metal flow 5 I just checked this 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:14.149
 2 is a shop in perfect 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.199
 3 is the christmas needy goals correct 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.169
 saleh has opened since element one and 3 belongs to the 3rd period of the 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.639
 table the Indians the truth said calculating a third period 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.319
 the wrong rosemary alternative there 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.620
 the three elements belong to the same 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.029
 the group the same family 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:36.029
 different families the answer 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.719
 the elements belong to the different group 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.779
 and for today's prison we gave a little bit to the previous table that until the next 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:44.369
 class
