life<00:00:07.569> at<00:00:07.779> mini<00:00:07.960> -<00:00:08.170> underwater<00:00:08.710> digital<00:00:09.190> camera

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
life at mini - underwater digital camera

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.440 
life at mini - underwater digital camera
let's<00:00:10.150> go<00:00:10.269> ahead<00:00:10.360> and<00:00:10.719> take<00:00:10.840> a<00:00:10.870> closer<00:00:11.080> look<00:00:12.450> so

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
let's go ahead and take a closer look so

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.320 
let's go ahead and take a closer look so
the<00:00:13.629> mini<00:00:14.169> 2<00:00:14.469> is<00:00:14.709> a<00:00:14.740> fantastic<00:00:15.459> little<00:00:15.579> compact

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
the mini 2 is a fantastic little compact

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.900 
the mini 2 is a fantastic little compact
underwater<00:00:17.020> digital<00:00:17.530> camera<00:00:17.890> all<00:00:18.460> contained

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
underwater digital camera all contained

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.770 
underwater digital camera all contained
within<00:00:19.210> this<00:00:19.660> rugged<00:00:20.320> outer<00:00:20.680> case<00:00:21.450> got<00:00:22.450> a<00:00:22.480> max

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:22.780 
within this rugged outer case got a max

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.110 
within this rugged outer case got a max
depth<00:00:23.080> up<00:00:23.260> to<00:00:23.350> 40<00:00:23.800> meters<00:00:23.980> so<00:00:24.460> more<00:00:25.000> than

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.120 
depth up to 40 meters so more than

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.640 
depth up to 40 meters so more than
suitable<00:00:25.600> for<00:00:25.780> any<00:00:25.900> kind<00:00:26.170> of<00:00:26.290> dive<00:00:26.440> you're

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
suitable for any kind of dive you're

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.950 
suitable for any kind of dive you're
gonna<00:00:26.740> do<00:00:27.010> there's<00:00:27.700> also<00:00:27.820> shockproof<00:00:28.210> as<00:00:28.750> well

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
gonna do there's also shockproof as well

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.240 
gonna do there's also shockproof as well
so<00:00:29.320> it's<00:00:29.470> going<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.650> keep<00:00:29.740> itself<00:00:30.070> nicely

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
so it's going to keep itself nicely

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.389 
so it's going to keep itself nicely
protected<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:32.140> a<00:00:32.200> 9<00:00:32.349> megapixel<00:00:32.980> camera<00:00:33.280> this

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
protected it's a 9 megapixel camera this

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.980 
protected it's a 9 megapixel camera this
as<00:00:33.610> well<00:00:33.760> so<00:00:33.940> got<00:00:34.329> quite<00:00:34.600> a<00:00:34.629> fair<00:00:34.870> few

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
as well so got quite a fair few

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.630 
as well so got quite a fair few
megapixels<00:00:35.500> in<00:00:35.650> there<00:00:35.770> for<00:00:35.890> taking<00:00:36.190> a<00:00:36.250> decent

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
megapixels in there for taking a decent

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.880 
megapixels in there for taking a decent
shot<00:00:36.850> it's<00:00:37.480> also<00:00:37.600> got<00:00:37.840> video<00:00:38.110> capability<00:00:38.710> in

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
shot it's also got video capability in

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.190 
shot it's also got video capability in
here<00:00:39.070> as<00:00:39.190> well<00:00:39.340> with<00:00:39.579> sound<00:00:40.000> so<00:00:40.630> you<00:00:40.750> can<00:00:40.989> take

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
here as well with sound so you can take

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.460 
here as well with sound so you can take
a<00:00:41.230> standard<00:00:41.650> definition<00:00:42.130> video<00:00:42.250> 480p<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:43.660> get

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
a standard definition video 480p and get

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.500 
a standard definition video 480p and get
some<00:00:44.650> nice<00:00:44.800> video<00:00:45.370> as<00:00:45.640> well<00:00:45.790> while<00:00:46.300> you're<00:00:46.450> on

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
some nice video as well while you're on

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.290 
some nice video as well while you're on
your<00:00:46.540> dive<00:00:46.810> a<00:00:47.550> phenomenally<00:00:48.550> simple<00:00:49.090> camera

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
your dive a phenomenally simple camera

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.910 
your dive a phenomenally simple camera
to<00:00:49.540> operate<00:00:49.930> this<00:00:50.140> so<00:00:50.380> if<00:00:50.560> you're<00:00:50.739> new<00:00:50.890> to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
to operate this so if you're new to

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.100 
to operate this so if you're new to
underwater<00:00:51.820> photography<00:00:52.540> this<00:00:52.989> is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
underwater photography this is

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.830 
underwater photography this is
definitely<00:00:53.410> one<00:00:53.649> to<00:00:53.920> take<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.130> look<00:00:54.399> at<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
definitely one to take a look at the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.819 
definitely one to take a look at the
setup<00:00:56.050> we've<00:00:56.260> got<00:00:56.350> on<00:00:56.440> here<00:00:56.880> go<00:00:57.880> a<00:00:57.910> on<00:00:58.829> on/off

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
display obviously the displays the image

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.920 
display obviously the displays the image
in<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.340> front<00:01:39.580> if<00:01:40.150> you<00:01:40.479> want<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.780> switch

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
in the front if you want to switch

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.510 
in the front if you want to switch
between<00:01:41.110> these<00:01:41.470> two<00:01:41.530> modes<00:01:41.740> as<00:01:42.130> we<00:01:42.250> mentioned

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
between these two modes as we mentioned

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.950 
between these two modes as we mentioned
before<00:01:42.549> you've<00:01:42.880> got<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.030> landscape<00:01:43.510> mode<00:01:43.780> and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
before you've got the landscape mode and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.899 
before you've got the landscape mode and
the<00:01:44.140> macro<00:01:44.500> mode<00:01:44.740> actually<00:01:45.369> just<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.729> case<00:01:45.880> of

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
the macro mode actually just a case of

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.969 
the macro mode actually just a case of
flicking<00:01:46.720> that<00:01:46.840> switch<00:01:47.110> on<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.380> side<00:01:47.590> so

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
flicking that switch on the side so

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.530 
flicking that switch on the side so
sexually<00:01:48.729> easy<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:49.060> use<00:01:49.240> when<00:01:49.420> you're

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
sexually easy to use when you're

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.420 
sexually easy to use when you're
underwater<00:01:49.950> obviously<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.009> switch<00:01:51.189> to<00:01:51.369> the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
underwater obviously you switch to the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.530 
underwater obviously you switch to the
macro<00:01:51.759> mode<00:01:51.909> when<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.150> want<00:01:52.299> to<00:01:52.360> take
