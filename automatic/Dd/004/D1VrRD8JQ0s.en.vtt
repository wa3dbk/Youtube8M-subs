 very good to all and welcome once 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.830
 more to the android news this time 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.410
 I bring you as always three very news 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.510
 interesting the three have to do with 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.880
 google so if we have triplet of 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.439
 google the first try android pay 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.330
 which is a mode of payment through 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.119
 smartphone recently introduced by 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.759
 google the second entry of google jump 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.740
 is related to virtual reality 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.620
 and the last one deals with google maps and a 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.150
 improvement in your in your online one thing very 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.130
 interesting also only 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.379
 I remind you that I have a YouTube channel 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.030
 called model henri and you'll have a link in 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.469
 the description and how good I upload videos 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.210
 of android in general reviews of 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.789
 devices top of applications 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.379
 root customization everything you want 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.510
 you will find it in model henri if it is 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.190
 related to android but good without 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.800
 more delay let's start with the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.030
 android 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.739
 google launches android pay making payments 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.960
 from a smartphone is undoubtedly 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.060
 much more comfortable than using any 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.550
 kind of card and it is for this reason 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.920
 that there are more and more 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.659
 companies that join this world and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.640
 also to this race because it's a 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.159
 I race a race to lead the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.470
 market google already tried it once with 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.630
 google wallet that as we know we do not 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.909
 It was not very successful but neither 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.190
 It was a failure but the mountain view 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.830
 they do not give up and they try again with 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.020
 android pain this time google sum 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.789
 one more point since both mastercard 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.039
 as visas are going to collaborate with android 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.960
 the android day is designed 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.789
 mainly to make payments 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.460
 physical is to say go to any 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.649
 establishment and use your android 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.149
 pay on your smartphone to pay instead 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.880
 to use any kind of card 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.710
 bank debit etc. but it is not 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.060
 made exclusively for this too 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.679
 we will find within many 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.659
 applications the button to pay for the 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.060
 Android and yes we can pay with 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.950
 Android pay in numerous applications and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.360
 currently there are more than 700,000 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.550
 locals in states 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.830
 those who have accepted the payment by android 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.810
 tape between them mcdonald's gamestop 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.000
 cocacola and many more multinationals 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.250
 so in a little while we can go 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.080
 in the USA to any of these 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.750
 establishments and pay with android 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.680
 Android that has arrived recently but 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.680
 It comes stomped 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.940
 google jump virtual reality started 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.280
 like a dream like something you only see 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.379
 in science fiction movies and 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.970
 little by little it has been developing until 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.970
 reach the levels to which it is 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.069
 actually lately the reality 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.620
 virtual has been getting closer and closer 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.390
 to our places with devices like 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.280
 the glasses go the virtual one that some 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.900
 are lucky to have 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.760
 unfortunately it is not my case and with 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.819
 improvements to platforms such as 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.860
 incorporation of 360 degree videos to 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.360
 youtube because google has put a 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.670
 new objective in this field one 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.860
 quite ambitious than anyone who 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.720
 can afford it can obviously create 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.299
 material in virtual reality from its 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.400
 google and gopro house come together to 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.410
 offer us this possibility to create 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.019
 material in the virtual from our 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.269
 home to achieve it bought designed a 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.160
 system before 16 linked cameras and 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.380
 arranged forming a circle that is 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.660
 that we will have a circle with 16 cameras 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.870
 one next to the other to catch 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.480
 the 360 ​​degrees that surround the circle of 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.950
 cameras but obviously we need 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.450
 something more than the hardware of gaulle but 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.580
 we need the software 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.890
 and that's where google goes in for 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.140
 design this software that basically gets 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.970
 is going to commission to unite the photographs of 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.800
 so that you do not notice the points of 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.390
 union of them and that of this 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.500
 way a single picture appears 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.790
 but in 360 degrees we also know that 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.400
 youtube is going to be compatible with google 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.170
 jump so google go to 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.830
 have a good outlet for google and more 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.830
 thanks to this platform 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.349
 improvements in offline browsing of 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.780
 google maps one of the things that I 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.959
 I personally lacked in google 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.760
 maps was the power to receive indications 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.760
 point by point without having connection to 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.439
 fortunately internet along 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.450
 this year is going to introduce this 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.730
 characteristic anxiety together with other 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.160
 very with others and in this way 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.109
 we can find information on a street 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.239
 and get it without being connected to 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.460
 internet something ideal for people with 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.470
 few data or for anyone with a 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.479
 little head I think because I'm going to 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.580
 spend data if I have the option without 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.830
 internet what are we going to have to 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.449
 throughout this year personally and I 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.919
 I'm glad you're going to incorporate this 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.620
 option because I think it will bring things 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.560
 very positive to the set of google maps 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.940
 and because I think it's a lack that 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.590
 google map was already getting 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.260
 too long so I'm glad 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.090
 that they will solve it because 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.010
 and well this has been all I hope that you 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.140
 I liked that you were interested and 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.790

 I find it very interesting that the 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.720
 option for anyone to do 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.940
 materials in virtual reality from its 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.920
