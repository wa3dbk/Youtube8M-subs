00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.629
 how old is the man from Berlin youtube-user the comet Marti 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.040
 a special video this time it's about my like playing 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.450
 Percent usually I always do my collection 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:18.909
 Videos Benedict Koep's game collection videos before it's a different one 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.970
 without a renewed says the maker tip 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.560
 and then I also make it for Xbox by mistake PlayStation 3 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.579
 made a video 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.099
 and now I'll take it 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.250
 wii-games together because I have it because I have the Sixt 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.010
 it arises guessing whose contract is not 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.010
 I do not have a lot of videos right now 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.960
 11 to explain a lot of games before 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.960
 where we are a bit confused about Sheikh right now 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.180
 so often that the forest is all unpleasant really shot again 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.980
 that bring more and more driving speakers 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.799
 but 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.290
 I take that out of my shelves now 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.239
 with dad now free 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.340
 I'll show you now all the games I have dapd including of course 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.700
 play 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.140
 on the hands 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.360
 DAX could be worried 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.409
 that's the eu plans versions of percent no more heroes 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.720
 To give 8 lonely 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.670
 Thanks to this beautiful game is also the diversion from Austria mine 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.800
 Playing field not cut 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.120
 but 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.240
 investors mainly on the soul world-famous worst-case we down here 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.690
 is 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.869
 who the game is also very funny 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.650
 but I honestly but not yet played through 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.050
 I have to be honest 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.420
 Aldi how is actually the console Dichand least of all to use 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.330
 Honestly, I'm off 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.100
 already streetdance crowd how to play 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.500
 some just just white in the collection 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.390
 but 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.010
 The wii games may be like play 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.000
 in the month 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.990
 because they give me 5% and 10% 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.949
 there are excellent players 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.039
 for the Wii 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.039
 but also a lot of black 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.569
 that the device is nevertheless so successful 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.349
 I did not think so 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.589
 but still, they are said to be excellent players 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:29.359
 let's see if I catch some of them here in March for example 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.619
 which team it is of course that class 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.619
 that was actually the reason why i bought like 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:41.829
 as I said the players have for the most part already together and videos 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.419
 shown or yet to be published 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.719
 Sonja, for example, very bloody candidates 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:52.489
 No and the percent 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.599
 Austria known year 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.069
 So not under control that was a nice day and more 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.469
 this is not a bad game for example it is a collection 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.759
 critical 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:08.619
 and yes I have to then already in the collection came due dollar 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.299
 now come play some interesting role 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.819
 So there I have to say who will now achieve the percent we set 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.959
 m in the console because I have to contradict but I already 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.249
 some 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:29.060
 Percent of cold-blooded shows those of I also have the second of the lies 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:33.019
 However, exactly the camera is of course the super with quarters 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.879
 therefore 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.939
 then I have you and year with the camera 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:42.819
 Of course, great games are also available for such things 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.329
 works then we always so directly from Nintendo com should that is synonymous 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.859
 a game where the fun goes down well 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:53.459
 Soru bacteria 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.459
 that is surprising for Iran 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.129
 yes what was that again as a spokeswoman for the broadcaster said other things 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:02.069
 Play in itself 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.069
 and 3 0 percent 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.089
 as far as I Weis on Voigt numbered somehow 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:14.759
 so the work is very nice should get 30 percent and under time pressure 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:20.009
 no longer good that their findings on that are so standard stories 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.199
 What happens in games drives this question 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.099
 also a game which is not inconvenient in Germany 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.940
 but a role player also relatively controversial because because it seemed so 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.809
 running 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:40.409
 was that he was still one of the starting titles 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.169
 the BI 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.870
 It should be some game that I personally 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.120
 I also think it's quite classy in German and I have not quite got that through yet 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.240
 played but I like that very much 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.460
 Nintendo he used to be so the internal consoles were one year earlier for that 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.370
 known 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.479
 Per cent that sounds very many role plays 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.330
 on the market when I get Super Nintendo wet again 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.969
 Dankert that he is on tour to go Tube Tent 64 and not him anymore 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.470
 yes no longer allowing the son of way roleplayer get along 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.169
 when I think of a Super Nintendo thinker again 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.379
 my husband Oh man what great games 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.439
 newly elected 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:28.589
 which is also new but that is now in the living room of TuS Corbis 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.679
 I'm going there now because you know that that's great again winter too 

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:35.679
 still prices 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.729
 but also without percent 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.210
 after relieving euro 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.229
 I'm back again 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:45.840
 according to Habermas 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.000
 and around it is me about a heavy physical or otherwise 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.280
 something but 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.520
 this game 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.520
 and then I can sing right now look at the graphic style 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.479
 "That's what 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.289
 You have never seen this unique 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.999
 he praises that is eye report 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:09.509
 Although this r hear this funny here, no opponents a clean 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:10.559
 At the game 

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:14.199
 but there is supposed to be a new game he does oh so that 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.610
 By the way, son 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.639
 DK 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.229
 I'm really over a rocker band or I thought I'm doing it 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:21.629
 I helped myself 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.569
 Prof the songs 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:26.719
 Tobias percent Cape Town 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.259
 sorry but the Wars now for the first time ever 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:32.690
 whether children or understands and takes 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:38.650
 I gave show will soon be another to spokeswoman game as there 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.270
 I have not shown yet 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.279
 So far, there are two games of the first one-player 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:49.080
 Almanya b I play my psp player Lech 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.039
 and 11 boxers a game similar and the option 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.819
 not synonymous so there are still some videos 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:00.119
 the Orbis thanks new ones did not interest those from Belgium and the Havel anymore 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:01.639
 if you are disappointed 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.860
 especially the Wii from the Wii 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.919
 or the Wii and how it uses them or even your favorite 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:12.029
 Console is or the console that hates the most 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.699
 I would be interested to know if your favorite games 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:19.039
 until then because he is dulled 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:19.959
 Uli Haug should
