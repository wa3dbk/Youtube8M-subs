hi my name is Brad cheer and welcome to
thick<00:00:12.719> paint<00:00:12.980> today<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.009> want<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.400> talk<00:00:14.519> a

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
thick paint today I want to talk a

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.570 
thick paint today I want to talk a
little<00:00:14.849> bit<00:00:15.030> about<00:00:15.059> seeing<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.719> big<00:00:15.900> picture

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
little bit about seeing the big picture

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.630 
little bit about seeing the big picture
there<00:00:17.580> are<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.850> few<00:00:18.210> tools<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.900> use<00:00:19.170> that

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
there are a few tools that I use that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.849 
there are a few tools that I use that
enable<00:00:20.640> me<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.789> see<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.810> 5a<00:00:22.260> your<00:00:22.470> plane's<00:00:22.710> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
enable me to see the 5a your plane's a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.920 
enable me to see the 5a your plane's a
little<00:00:23.070> bit<00:00:23.189> better<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.609> focus<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:24.119> values<00:00:24.660> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
little bit better to focus on values and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.950 
little bit better to focus on values and
to<00:00:25.680> generally<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:26.250> simplify<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.599> painted

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
to generally just simplify the painted

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.250 
to generally just simplify the painted
image<00:00:29.090> most<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.330> problems<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.929> painting

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
image most of the problems in painting

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.690 
image most of the problems in painting
are<00:00:31.529> about<00:00:31.859> seeing<00:00:32.430> things<00:00:32.700> simply<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.700> our

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
are about seeing things simply and our

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.030 
are about seeing things simply and our
eyes<00:00:35.880> are<00:00:35.910> built<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> way<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:37.739> really

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
eyes are built in a way that we really

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.459 
eyes are built in a way that we really
see<00:00:38.399> very<00:00:38.430> complex<00:00:39.149> images<00:00:39.600> there's<00:00:40.200> good

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
see very complex images there's good

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.209 
see very complex images there's good
reasons<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:40.890> that

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
reasons for that

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.060 
reasons for that
but<00:00:42.000> when<00:00:42.120> we're<00:00:42.239> painting<00:00:42.559> we<00:00:43.559> really<00:00:43.890> need

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
but when we're painting we really need

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.139 
but when we're painting we really need
to<00:00:44.309> simplify<00:00:46.100> in<00:00:47.100> order<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.520> demonstrate<00:00:47.670> how

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
to simplify in order to demonstrate how

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.930 
to simplify in order to demonstrate how
I<00:00:48.180> use<00:00:48.300> these<00:00:48.660> tools<00:00:49.110> I'm<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.520> take<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
I use these tools I'm going to take a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.080 
I use these tools I'm going to take a
painting<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.420> did<00:00:51.480> several<00:00:51.989> months<00:00:52.230> ago<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
painting I did several months ago and

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.020 
painting I did several months ago and
we're<00:00:54.090> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.239> take<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> single<00:00:54.660> look<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
we're going to take a single look at it

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.360 
we're going to take a single look at it
now<00:00:57.260> generally<00:00:58.260> speaking<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.739> think<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:59.190> this

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
now generally speaking I think of this

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.760 
now generally speaking I think of this
painting<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.850> failed<00:01:00.090> painting<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.750> let<00:01:01.649> me

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
painting is a failed painting so let me

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.500 
painting is a failed painting so let me
use<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.070> tools<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.730> look<00:01:02.879> at<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.239> painting

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
use the tools to look at this painting

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.890 
use the tools to look at this painting
afresh<00:01:04.610> what<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> want<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.600> try<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
afresh what I want to do is is try to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.789 
afresh what I want to do is is try to
decide<00:01:07.380> where<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> painting<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.909> failing<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
decide where the painting is failing and

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.950 
decide where the painting is failing and
and<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.040> future<00:01:11.250> video<00:01:12.000> I'm<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and in a future video I'm going to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.710 
and in a future video I'm going to
correct<00:01:13.320> those<00:01:13.619> mistakes<00:01:14.330> but<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:15.689> I

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
correct those mistakes but for now I

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.640 
correct those mistakes but for now I
just<00:01:15.930> want<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.500> identify<00:01:16.850> using<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.150> tools

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
just want to identify using these tools

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.649 
just want to identify using these tools
and<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> tools<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.820> these<00:01:21.450> are<00:01:21.630> my

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and the tools I have are these are my

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.190 
and the tools I have are these are my
painting<00:01:22.140> glasses<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:24.200> 10.25

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
painting glasses it's just a 10.25

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.429 
painting glasses it's just a 10.25
reading<00:01:26.100> glasses<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:28.520> then<00:01:29.520> I've<00:01:29.640> got<00:01:30.439> 1.5

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
reading glasses and then I've got 1.5

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.539 
reading glasses and then I've got 1.5
reading<00:01:31.799> glasses<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.610> reduction<00:01:33.509> lens<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:35.220> in

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
reading glasses a reduction lens and in

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.039 
reading glasses a reduction lens and in
prison

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.310 

well<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.450> our<00:01:42.570> pinion<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.079> we're<00:01:43.200> going

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
well this is our pinion that we're going

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.919 
well this is our pinion that we're going
to<00:01:43.670> correct<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.710> hopefully<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.859> can<00:01:47.899> see<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
to correct and hopefully we can see a

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.590 
to correct and hopefully we can see a
little<00:01:49.140> bit<00:01:49.259> easier<00:01:49.789> than<00:01:50.789> areas<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.450> are

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
little bit easier than areas that are

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.929 
little bit easier than areas that are
not<00:01:51.990> working<00:01:52.200> quite<00:01:52.619> right<00:01:52.649> with<00:01:53.100> these<00:01:53.310> these

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
not working quite right with these these

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:02.330 
not working quite right with these these
optical<00:01:54.390> tools<00:02:00.469> okay<00:02:01.469> here's<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> reduction

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
optical tools okay here's the reduction

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.380 
optical tools okay here's the reduction
lens<00:02:02.490> let's<00:02:03.119> see<00:02:03.270> how<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:05.179> kind<00:02:06.179> of<00:02:06.240> got

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
lens let's see how it just kind of got

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.960 
lens let's see how it just kind of got
you<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.869> without<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.250> darks<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you know without like the darks of the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.550 
you know without like the darks of the
ground<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.599> way<00:02:09.720> too<00:02:09.780> dark

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
ground or way too dark

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.350 
ground or way too dark
let's<00:02:10.920> created<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:12.180> strange<00:02:12.540> line<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:15.150> line

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
let's created the strange line this line

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.970 
let's created the strange line this line
right<00:02:15.569> here<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.870> off<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:18.120> then<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.390> darkness

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
right here is off and then the darkness

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.280 
right here is off and then the darkness
if<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.130> remember<00:02:20.430> our<00:02:20.459> five<00:02:20.760> zones<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.810> this

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
if you remember our five zones this this

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.699 
if you remember our five zones this this
mountain<00:02:22.739> range<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.069> too<00:02:23.250> dark<00:02:23.630> he's<00:02:24.709> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
mountain range is too dark he's the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.410 
mountain range is too dark he's the
director<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.370> range<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.790> almost<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.239> same

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
director that range is almost the same

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.479 
director that range is almost the same
darkness<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:28.170> these<00:02:28.530> trees<00:02:28.739> was<00:02:29.160> just<00:02:29.340> not

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
darkness as these trees was just not

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.569 
darkness as these trees was just not
right<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:31.230> these<00:02:31.410> these<00:02:31.890> mountains<00:02:32.340> should<00:02:32.459> be

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
right so these these mountains should be

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.670 
right so these these mountains should be
considerably<00:02:33.239> lighter<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.170> shadow<00:02:34.410> here

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
considerably lighter and the shadow here

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.000 
considerably lighter and the shadow here
just<00:02:34.950> has<00:02:35.130> gone<00:02:35.340> way<00:02:35.640> too<00:02:35.760> dark<00:02:36.829> they<00:02:37.829> should

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
just has gone way too dark they should

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.860 
just has gone way too dark they should
be<00:02:38.099> quite<00:02:38.310> low<00:02:38.519> maybe<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.970> two<00:02:39.180> or<00:02:39.329> a<00:02:39.360> three<00:02:39.420> but

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
be quite low maybe a two or a three but

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.140 
be quite low maybe a two or a three but
this<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.470> like<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.769> one<00:02:41.099> so<00:02:41.579> that<00:02:41.790> it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
this is this is like a one so that it

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.349 
this is this is like a one so that it
creates<00:02:42.269> this<00:02:42.599> weird<00:02:42.900> line<00:02:43.079> kind<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.620> breaks

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.970 

yeah<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:52.380> since<00:02:53.130> there's<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.579> very<00:02:53.760> dark

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
yeah and since there's that very dark

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.009 
yeah and since there's that very dark
bit<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.100> grass<00:02:56.310> right<00:02:56.639> here<00:02:56.700> they<00:02:57.690> kind<00:02:57.870> of

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
bit of grass right here they kind of

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.990 
bit of grass right here they kind of
extend<00:02:58.350> accentuates<00:02:59.130> those<00:02:59.310> two<00:02:59.519> parallel

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
extend accentuates those two parallel

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.690 
extend accentuates those two parallel
motion<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.660> sort<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:00.989> divides<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:02.430> shape

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
motion that sort of divides the shape

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.860 
motion that sort of divides the shape
here<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.359> then<00:03:04.139> this<00:03:04.260> shape<00:03:05.510> he's<00:03:06.510> my<00:03:06.660> little

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
here and then this shape he's my little

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:14.930 
here and then this shape he's my little
dark<00:03:07.260> G<00:03:07.470> let's<00:03:07.650> take<00:03:07.829> another<00:03:07.920> looking<00:03:08.250> back

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.690 

yeah<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:16.110> think<00:03:16.500> that's<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:16.980> little<00:03:17.130> dark<00:03:18.470> okay

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.430 

when<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.730> look<00:03:23.940> through<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.180> reduction<00:03:24.780> lens<00:03:25.200> I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
when I look through the reduction lens I

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.740 
when I look through the reduction lens I
can<00:03:25.650> see<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.190> trees<00:03:26.640> here<00:03:27.000> just<00:03:27.240> kind<00:03:27.660> of

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
can see that the trees here just kind of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.870 
can see that the trees here just kind of
combined<00:03:28.260> with<00:03:28.470> this<00:03:28.590> massive<00:03:28.950> amount<00:03:29.550> here

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
combined with this massive amount here

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.300 
combined with this massive amount here
and<00:03:29.970> that's<00:03:30.120> not<00:03:30.210> good<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.860> prefer<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.980> see<00:03:32.190> this

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
and that's not good I prefer to see this

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.310 
and that's not good I prefer to see this
kind<00:03:32.550> broken<00:03:33.000> up<00:03:35.300> this<00:03:36.300> is<00:03:36.480> my<00:03:36.720> prison<00:03:37.140> right

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
kind broken up this is my prison right

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.730 
kind broken up this is my prison right
here

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
here

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:45.530 
here
and<00:03:38.370> when<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.850> hold<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.150> up<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.660> lens<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:44.540> mean

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
and when you hold it up the lens I mean

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.030 
and when you hold it up the lens I mean
when<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:45.960> move<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.290> in<00:03:46.470> close<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.830> your<00:03:46.950> eye

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
when you move that in close to your eye

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
when you move that in close to your eye
you<00:03:47.100> can<00:03:47.430> see<00:03:47.460> that<00:03:47.820> it's<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:50.310> image<00:03:50.550> has

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
you can see that it's a the image has

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.430 
you can see that it's a the image has
been<00:03:51.090> reversed<00:03:51.600> just<00:03:51.900> like<00:03:52.020> looking<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.410> a

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
been reversed just like looking in a

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.200 
been reversed just like looking in a
mirror

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
mirror

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.350 
mirror
yeah<00:03:55.280> there's<00:03:56.280> nothing<00:03:56.460> that<00:03:56.700> really<00:03:56.850> bothers

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
yeah there's nothing that really bothers

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.990 
yeah there's nothing that really bothers
me<00:03:57.390> when<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:59.400> reverse<00:03:59.820> that<00:04:00.150> except<00:04:00.570> for<00:04:00.600> maybe

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
me when I reverse that except for maybe

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.950 
me when I reverse that except for maybe
maybe<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.120> don't<00:04:03.240> like<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.660> straight<00:04:03.930> line

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
maybe I don't like this straight line

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.490 
maybe I don't like this straight line
right<00:04:04.350> here<00:04:06.860> what<00:04:07.860> do<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.010> see

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
right here what do I see

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.600 
right here what do I see
when<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.590> look<00:04:10.770> at<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:10.980> out<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.220> hook<00:04:11.400> sight

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
when I look at it out of hook sight

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.580 
when I look at it out of hook sight
those<00:04:11.880> dark<00:04:12.420> shapes<00:04:12.720> on<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.050> bottom<00:04:13.350> really

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
those dark shapes on the bottom really

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:21.920 
those dark shapes on the bottom really
bother<00:04:13.980> me<00:04:16.670> so<00:04:17.670> that's<00:04:17.880> interesting<00:04:20.930> let's

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
bother me so that's interesting let's

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.150 
bother me so that's interesting let's
try<00:04:22.230> two<00:04:22.290> lenses<00:04:22.890> together<00:04:26.600> yeah

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
try two lenses together yeah

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.040 
try two lenses together yeah
the<00:04:29.670> more<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:29.850> look<00:04:30.090> through<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.810> looks

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
the more I look through that it looks

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.480 
the more I look through that it looks
like<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.680> vegetation<00:04:32.640> is<00:04:32.730> a<00:04:32.820> little<00:04:33.030> bare

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
like the vegetation is a little bare

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.460 
like the vegetation is a little bare
right<00:04:35.490> in<00:04:35.730> here

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
right in here

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.950 
right in here
and<00:04:37.470> this<00:04:37.710> again<00:04:38.160> looks<00:04:38.460> too<00:04:38.730> straight<00:04:39.600> so

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
and this again looks too straight so

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.290 
and this again looks too straight so
since<00:04:40.200> we're<00:04:40.350> broken<00:04:40.590> up<00:04:40.890> maybe<00:04:41.850> a<00:04:41.970> little

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
since we're broken up maybe a little

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.700 
since we're broken up maybe a little
energy<00:04:42.720> running<00:04:42.930> through<00:04:43.050> here<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.440> little<00:04:43.590> bit

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
energy running through here a little bit

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.630 
energy running through here a little bit
more<00:04:43.920> mass<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.610> there<00:04:46.070> well<00:04:47.070> that's<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.460> for

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
more mass in there well that's it for

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.110 
more mass in there well that's it for
today

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
today

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.810 
today
