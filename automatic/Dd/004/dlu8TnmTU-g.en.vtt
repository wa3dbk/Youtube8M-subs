00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
when the sweep hand goes from zero to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.380 
when the sweep hand goes from zero to
one<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.650> gallon<00:01:16.650> has<00:01:16.860> been<00:01:17.070> delivered<00:01:17.490> when

look for a little wheel on the face of
the<00:01:26.130> meter<00:01:26.340> typically<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.869> red<00:01:28.049> or<00:01:28.170> blue
