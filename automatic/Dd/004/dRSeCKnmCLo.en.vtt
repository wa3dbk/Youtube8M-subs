00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
display so the height matches a regular

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.980 
display so the height matches a regular
a<00:01:21.890> 27<00:01:22.890> inch<00:01:23.009> display<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.670> headed<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.180> between

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
a 27 inch display so I headed in between

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.380 
a 27 inch display so I headed in between
two<00:01:25.259> 27-inch<00:01:25.890> displaced<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.610> match<00:01:27.210> the

two 27-inch displaced and match the

two 27-inch displaced and match the
height<00:01:27.600> perfectly<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.320> course<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.770> much<00:01:28.950> wider

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
height perfectly of course is much wider

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.010 
height perfectly of course is much wider
the<00:01:29.970> easiest<00:01:30.210> way<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.420> ascribe<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the easiest way you ascribe the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.140 
the easiest way you ascribe the
dimension<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.740> monitor<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> 34<00:01:32.909> inch

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
dimension of this monitor of the 34 inch

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.370 
dimension of this monitor of the 34 inch
21<00:01:33.720> by<00:01:33.840> 9<00:01:34.079> aspect<00:01:34.590> ratio<00:01:35.159> monitor<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.689> say

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
21 by 9 aspect ratio monitor is to say

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.969 
21 by 9 aspect ratio monitor is to say
it's<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.000> 27-inch<00:01:39.049> regular<00:01:40.049> monitor<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it's like a 27-inch regular monitor and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.090 
it's like a 27-inch regular monitor and
a<00:01:41.549> half<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> take<00:01:42.750> ahead<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> 2017<00:01:43.740> one

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
a half so you take ahead of the 2017 one

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.249 
a half so you take ahead of the 2017 one
next<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> regular<00:01:45.240> 27-inch<00:01:45.720> monitor<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
next to the regular 27-inch monitor and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.740 
next to the regular 27-inch monitor and
that's<00:01:46.619> how<00:01:46.829> why<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.100> mantra<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.420> keep

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
that's how why this mantra is but keep

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.690 
that's how why this mantra is but keep
in<00:01:48.869> mind<00:01:48.899> terms<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.409> huge<00:01:49.619> advantage<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
in mind terms a huge advantage here you

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.580
