00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 not once read on the forums that even in summer 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.200
 we are from the stove blowing warm air 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.840
 tap itself is located under the hood in 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.150
 the internet has a lot of information like others 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.980
 hedgehog owners prefer to solve this 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.670
 the problem 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.650
 even electric cranes from gazelle considered 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.830
 alternative solutions to this 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.960
 question I decided to try you create 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.260
 on audi classic Zhigulevsk option 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.899
 installation extremely to the stove as it is on 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.910
 you classic models 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.899
 Frankly, this is not the easiest and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.899
 easy option of all 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.570
 holding a black plastic hedgehog crane in 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.239
 hands and appreciating the probable degree of it so 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.160
 say reliability no desire u 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.430
 I have no use for it 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.379
 future rework 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.789
 for a start I bought a vaz heater tap 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.730
 classics ceramic faucet turning away two 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.369
 bolt removed black plastic 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.680
 Angle fitting radiator heater 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.630
 water 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.520
 measurements showed that the distance between 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.780
 mounting holes 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.340
 not the same alignment in mounting 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.439
 tap from you 35 millimeters and from 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.500
 water 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.689
 38 millimeters vaz a crane to 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.250
 radiator as it is not directly 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.049
 set to still secure 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.290
 tap on the radiator 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.270
 There are several options you can have a little 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.420
 expand the mounting holes in the faucet 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.759
 to two bolt attracting tap 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.659
 their regular threads twirled 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.540
 water radiator can be about dinner and quite 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.930
 saw through and also pull 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.360
 tap directly to the radiator can be stretched 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.360
 extremely to the radiator through the adapter 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.240
 since the distance between the centers 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.890
 there are more holes under the code socket 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.209
 than the Zhiguli 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.340
 radiator for 3 millimeters then with each 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.690
 hand we have a half a difference 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.920
 millimeter with eyelets 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:25.250
 experimented on unnecessary for a long time and 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.840
 we write the tap first option thickness 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.290
 wall eyelet edges 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.160
 the thinnest and part of the VAZ crane 2 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.870
 and 8 millimeters can be chiseled round 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.380
 file the holes in the faucet 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.799
 distribute carry sides in the photo you can see 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.420
 that oozing the edges just the body 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.420
 metal in the countersink area 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.989
 and remained though narrow but deep 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.190
 lintel extreme part of the wall of the eye 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.549
 will become thinner and will be approximately 1 and 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.830
 3 millimeters but it will still be possible 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.970
 through the puck to stretch the faucet across 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.180
 planes clamps each eyelets 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.730
 the second option can be quite 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.680
 saw through 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.680
 I do not think that the presence of thin outer 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.820
 walls of eyes used to play much 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.450
 more important role 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.820
 than without them and accidentally move sides 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.820
 faucets in this case also fail 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:31.820
 no gum bumpers do not tighten the two 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:35.209
 Bolt will not give will keep decided 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.040
 mount tap through adapter third 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.769
 option 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.250
 found in the household segment of the channel with 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.890
 wall thickness of 8 millimeters snapped 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.280
 a small piece of 40 millimeters by 50 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.620
 millimeters on the turn l 'in the center and 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.209
 scratched with measuring compass two 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.629
 circles with a diameter of 35 millimeters and 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.459
 diameter of 38 millimeters 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:05.329
 through the center held two lines at an angle 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:08.810
 60 degrees to each other and drilled two 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:11.930
 holes on a large radius in places 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.269
 intersections with one line and two 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.009
 holes in a small radius in places 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.009
 intersections from the second line 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.099
 how in this picture accidentally hit 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.099
 frame 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.900
 in two holes threaded for 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.550
 fastening the tap to the adapter 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.490
 these images show internal 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.120
 side of the adapter so which will 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.830
 pressed to the radiator stove in 2 smooth 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.930
 Adapter holes set 2 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.159
 furniture ties temporary for 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.650
 visual inspection 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:51.300
 to see if the option is real 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.740
 mount tap with advanced and 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.620
 cut eyes directly 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.080
 to the stove radiator 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.830
 I think that the distance between them is real 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.080
 accordingly makes 38 millimeters 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.300
 I prefer the option with a large 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.479
 reliability margin option with 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.599
 an adapter despite the fact that it is more 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:17.529
 laborious here kranik looks like 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:19.689
 bolted to adapter between tap 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:23.050
 and an adapter installed Zhigulevskaya 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.099
 rubber gasket is a sealing 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.279
 gasket has 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:30.430
 protruding rim on both sides around 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:31.870
 central large hole one 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.500
 the side lies in the recess of the central 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.449
 tap holes for rim 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.909
 adapter side gaskets 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:45.219
 I had to carefully razzenkovat 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:47.050
 holes in the adapter itself on the other 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.149
 side adapter was used 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.060
 plain flat rubber gasket 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:57.180
 between the adapter and the radiator codes 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.139
 sky stove already installed tap 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.569
 metal inlet pipe 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.580
 tap who also used together 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:07.089
 with faucet pre bent 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.370
 gas burner as the exit angle and 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:12.159
 so slightly did not coincide with the angle under 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.949
 which includes interior stove pipe yes 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:17.560
 still due to a 60 degree bias against 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:20.139
 clockwise hull faucets mind 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.870
 its mounting through the adapter is 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.729
 the discrepancy still increased and bend 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:29.279
 the metal nipple was just 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:32.409
 I needed this I knew the very beginning 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:35.649
 turning the edge 120 degrees 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.880
 sentinel and posting it for another 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:39.910
 the side 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.870
 from the fixing line of the oven metal 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.630
 boundary pipe 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:48.070
 would be directed almost vertically 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.840
 down into the floor so it was impossible to tap 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:54.630
 installed on the classic VAZ 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.630
 the seat is attached to the radiator stove and 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:01.300
 invisible from the cabin the only thing 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.910
 required a minimum finishing touch so it 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.750
 gray plastic casing of the tunnel below 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.970
 under the torpedo the crane did not give the stove a couple 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:14.140
 centimeters right side of the casing 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:15.730
 press against the console of the sides 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.620
 rested in the crane to his small 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.620
 a semicircular protrusion on the end 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.560
 I neatly cut this protrusion 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.930
 the process of measuring and installing faucet 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.690
 apparently diligently skirted this bukovina 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.180
 hand dismantle the skin completely 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.909
 did not want so after 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.909
 cut the area under the faucet side to 

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:46.300
 Unfortunately, she didn’t stand up straight 

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:49.460
 returned to its former position 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.860
 while the glove box lid when opening 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.639
 slightly touches the bukovina casing with his 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.169
 lower left corner 

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:59.740
 fix her case business under 

00:07:57.169 --> 00:07:59.740
 moods
