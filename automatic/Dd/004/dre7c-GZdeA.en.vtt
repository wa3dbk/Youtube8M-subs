00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 jac motors is betting heavily on 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.020
 new j3 and j3 turin that have gained a 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.020
 most modern visual 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.750
 two years ago, jac motors arrived in 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.810
 brazil bringing two models the j3 and j3 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.929
 turin which is the sedan version 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.960
 at the time the Chinese brand inaugurated in a 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.170
 single day 50 dealerships in our 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.170
 parents 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.370
 now it's time to slap the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.710
 of these models, which are the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.050
 carmaker's bosses of all 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.140
 launches that jac motors have 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.650
 now scheduled for 2013 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.840
 the restyling of j3 is one of the most 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.640
 important in this car was launched in the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.790
 Brazilian market together with the premiere 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.430
 of the brand in March 2011 and therefore 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.210
 just over two years later we already 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.729
 we are bringing the new version of j3 already 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.680
 named as 2014 model 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.440
 the aesthetic changes were well 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.140
 in front of a new 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.080
 Optical assembly with larger flashlights 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.229
 the grid grew just like the logo of the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.630
 chrome friezes were added to the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.500
 drawing trying to give an air of more 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.840
 refinement 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.100
 Shock is more elegant with 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.590
 cleaner lines 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.180
 the lower front grille also 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.610
 increased in size 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.530
 the housings of the fog lights 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.560
 hood and sludge were also 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.659
 redesigned 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.330
 the aesthetic proposal of the front also 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.229
 was adopted in the rear of the j3 turin 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.080
 as well as the j3 the sedan version the j3 turin 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.780
 also received intense changes in the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.360
 your style beyond the panel and front 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.490
 it brings a completely new rear 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.890
 with a new set of lanterns a 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.720
 lid of the new trunk and also a 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.720
 for redesigned crashes 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.150
 we understand that this model 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.500
 I must make a great success in the market 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.790
 Brazilian 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.600
 proof of this is that we are 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.120
 modifying our initial mix where 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.459
 formerly we sold for every 2 j3 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.410
 we saw a cury and now we are 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.989
 imagining that our mix of vehicles 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.160
 is fully balanced and the 50% 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.970
 for each one 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.480
 we're betting a lot on j3 turin 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.610
 2014 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.079
 changes also occurred in the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.970
 car interior 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.709
 the car also changed completely by 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.290
 inside the panel is brand new 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.560

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.760
 the entire instrument cluster is 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.100
 new more fashionable more functional to 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.140
 new equipment available to the 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.200

 central locking wheel for doors 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.480
 is to see the statute to regulate the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.040
 panel light intensity finally the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.340

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.640

 speeds 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.400
 the performance of this set is modest 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.820
 the models have an excellent relationship 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.550
