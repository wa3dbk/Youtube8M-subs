 Hello everyone today in my review 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.649
 ZIL-157 kW from dip models 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.040
 it looks like the packaging to it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.309
 complete with removal instructions 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.789
 this model from the pedestal 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.789
 even mirrors 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.619
 so consider this model in more detail 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:57.440
 on the bumper there is a peace sign on himself 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.340
 the bumper comes forward because here 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.340
 winch installed 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:18.150
 There is also a cable winch hook on the headlights 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.150
 closed by safety grilles 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.960
 grille made in great detail 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.500
 you can see behind her 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.500
 silver radiator 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.650
 on the hood lid even made very 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.650
 high quality locks available 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.230
 and there are brushes behind fire extinguishers. 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.060
 footboards have such a ribbed 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.060
 surface 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.370
 the canister is shown on the left 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.000
 same gas tank 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:51.720
 you can see two spare wheels behind here 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.720
 Nak not very thin lattice 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.470
 Well, behind the cabin there are two boxes for 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.470
 accessories 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.069
 he is in the saddle 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:22.020

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.020

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:38.370

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.600
 high quality and detailed 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:16.949
 because the engine gearbox 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:19.520
 transfer box drive shafts on 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.520
 front axle 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:30.160

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.160
 winch drive 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.270
 even on the rear middle bridges 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.560
