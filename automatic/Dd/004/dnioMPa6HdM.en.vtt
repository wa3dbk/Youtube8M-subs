I'm<00:00:14.340> gonna<00:00:14.520> go<00:00:14.699> out<00:00:15.080> review<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> outside

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
I'm gonna go out review on the outside

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.790 
I'm gonna go out review on the outside
and<00:00:16.800> then<00:00:16.949> we're<00:00:17.070> gonna<00:00:17.160> go<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.550> inside<00:00:17.939> so

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
and then we're gonna go on the inside so

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.690 
and then we're gonna go on the inside so
here<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.660> microphone<00:00:21.660> jack

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
here we have the microphone jack

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.390 
here we have the microphone jack
headphone<00:00:23.700> jack<00:00:23.910> two<00:00:24.539> USB<00:00:24.960> ports<00:00:25.400> floppy

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
headphone jack two USB ports floppy

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:40.939 
headphone jack two USB ports floppy
drive<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:37.039> Oh<00:00:39.079> audio<00:00:40.079> out<00:00:40.289> audio<00:00:40.769> in

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
drive and a Oh audio out audio in

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.559 
drive and a Oh audio out audio in
another<00:00:41.760> microphone<00:00:42.089> part<00:00:43.249> we<00:00:44.249> have<00:00:44.519> a

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:44.569 
another microphone part we have a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:49.849 
another microphone part we have a
Ethernet<00:00:45.569> port<00:00:45.839> um<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.979> 10<00:00:47.280> by<00:00:47.489> 100<00:00:48.859> another

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
Ethernet port um it is 10 by 100 another

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.180 
Ethernet port um it is 10 by 100 another
two<00:00:50.219> USB<00:00:50.760> ports<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.420> another<00:00:51.989> four<00:00:52.409> USB<00:00:52.769> port

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
two USB ports and another four USB port

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.469 
two USB ports and another four USB port
so<00:00:53.249> you<00:00:53.399> got<00:00:53.549> a<00:00:53.579> total<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.210> 8<00:00:55.139> on<00:00:55.499> that<00:00:55.679> computer

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
so you got a total of 8 on that computer

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.459 
so you got a total of 8 on that computer
we<00:00:57.479> do<00:00:57.659> have<00:00:57.929> a<00:00:59.089> printer<00:01:00.089> port<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.929> the<00:01:01.229> Viets

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
we do have a printer port and the Viets

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.390 
we do have a printer port and the Viets
standard<00:01:01.859> VGA<00:01:02.039> port<00:01:03.949> we're<00:01:04.949> gonna<00:01:05.040> go<00:01:05.220> outside

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
standard VGA port we're gonna go outside

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.570 
standard VGA port we're gonna go outside
and<00:01:05.909> then<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.380> boot<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and then we are going to boot the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:20.390 
and then we are going to boot the
computer<00:01:16.430> right<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.300> a<00:01:19.400> Intel

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
computer right here we do have a Intel

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.660 
computer right here we do have a Intel
Pentium<00:01:20.820> are<00:01:21.510> with<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> CPU<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.690> 2.8<00:01:24.690> d<00:01:24.960> Hertz

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
Pentium are with the CPU of 2.8 d Hertz

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
Pentium are with the CPU of 2.8 d Hertz

there<00:01:46.700> let's<00:01:47.700> go<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.240> video<00:01:48.570> video<00:01:49.050> size

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
there let's go to the video video size

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.750 
there let's go to the video video size
is<00:01:50.250> 8<00:01:50.610> megabytes<00:01:51.440> it's<00:01:52.440> not<00:01:52.680> much<00:01:54.890> but<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.370> gets

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
is 8 megabytes it's not much but it gets

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.130 
is 8 megabytes it's not much but it gets
most<00:01:57.030> everything<00:01:57.570> done<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:59.580> HDD<00:02:00.300> acoustic
