the record I I think that was a problem
with<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.820> getting<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.390> many<00:00:45.570> messages

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
or them possibly choosing to go with the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.360 
or them possibly choosing to go with the
later<00:00:48.570> ones<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.930> don't<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:50.010> I'm<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.309> to
