00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello friends so here's after 72 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.690
 hours so as promised I'm talking about 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.610
 measures and then in addition I'm going to ask myself 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:19.529
 like that I do it right away like 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:24.570
 that you'll see let's admit phase there so 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:34.260
 that's seventy-three a bit more and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:37.020
 we will say 113 200 ok so the last 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.129
 blow after doing it after the 45 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.649
 minutes I had not done before but 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.879
 be careful it's not a big deal so there 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.870
 we were at 74 so I went to 73.2 150 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:54.920
 we will say now we will take the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.920
 measures so we'll start from the top 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:15.170
 always look for the lowest point 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:19.380
 of course so here I am at 97.5 so 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:26.490
 97.5 then the low 87 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.670
 sorry so I'm at 87.5 so we were 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 so for the top 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.369
 so we were at 89 at the beginning 88.5 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.909
 and there I spent 72 hours sitting 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:44.310
 to hand patch of course rap I 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:56.270
 went to 90 the 87.5 so at ten the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:56.270
 number oil the 89 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.210
 89 we went from 90 to 80 9 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:13.569
 then below where there was 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.550
 the most actually there is always the most 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.410
 two serious 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:32.319
 so here we are at 90 a point there in 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:33.459
 below 90 it's 89.8 so here 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.840
 the action of the product 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.010
 over the 72 hours we went from 93 to 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.709
 89 8 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.730
 where there is the most serious ok so me 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.140
 what I'm going to do is that everything 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.530
 just after that I'm going 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.239
 are going to rap a rap directly and then 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.890
 this time I 'm going to keep a little bit more 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.860
 long 45 minutes we 'll see if the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.390
 guardian and that's where we go back 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.100
 measures together and who will we see 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.549
 evolution right away in with a 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.579
 second take of arms here is everything from 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.579
 after
