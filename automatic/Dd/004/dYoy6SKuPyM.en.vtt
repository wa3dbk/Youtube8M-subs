I slowed him so he's forced to fight me
but<00:00:43.920> he<00:00:44.010> don't<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.430> he<00:00:44.550> has<00:00:44.640> too<00:00:44.879> much<00:00:45.030> is

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
but he don't think he has too much is

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.119 
but he don't think he has too much is
because<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.200> kind<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.649> talk<00:00:46.800> through<00:00:47.010> them

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
pretty fast and then I head over here

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.970 
pretty fast and then I head over here
because<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.950> saw<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.399> couple<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:51.620> lines<00:00:52.620> over

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
character and then I run over and I see

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.700 
character and then I run over and I see
that<00:01:11.939> lock<00:01:12.119> again<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.170> got<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> battle<00:01:13.560> on

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
that lock again so I got a battle on

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
that lock again so I got a battle on
another<00:01:14.549> warrior<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:14.939> helping<00:01:15.270> me<00:01:15.360> fight<00:01:15.630> him

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
another warrior is helping me fight him

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.420 
another warrior is helping me fight him
but<00:01:16.080> he<00:01:16.290> gets<00:01:16.470> feared<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.130> don't<00:01:17.310> think

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
but he gets feared and I don't think

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.649 
but he gets feared and I don't think
he's<00:01:17.610> too<00:01:17.759> good<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.299> their<00:01:18.479> age

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
he's too good if it was their age

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.390 
he's too good if it was their age
because<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.080> stays<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.130> good

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
