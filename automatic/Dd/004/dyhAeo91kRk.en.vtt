and<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.719> designed<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.170> work<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.620> 15-foot

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
and it's designed to work on 15-foot

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.729 
and it's designed to work on 15-foot
tall<00:00:35.760> fruiting<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.510> flowering<00:00:36.989> gardens<00:00:37.469> so

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
tall fruiting and flowering gardens so

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.700 
tall fruiting and flowering gardens so
if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.899> area<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.140> you're<00:00:40.320> currently

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
if you have a area that you're currently

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.729 
if you have a area that you're currently
running<00:00:41.010> horizontal<00:00:42.000> trays<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:43.590> it

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
running horizontal trays this it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.229 
running horizontal trays this it
wouldn't<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> application<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.030> but

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
wouldn't be the application for this but

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.979 
wouldn't be the application for this but
if<00:00:45.329> you're<00:00:45.480> doing<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.350> 15<00:00:46.829> 20<00:00:47.070> foot<00:00:47.370> tall

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
if you're doing you know 15 20 foot tall

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.940 
if you're doing you know 15 20 foot tall
verticals<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.410> would<00:00:49.559> work<00:00:49.680> nicely

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
verticals then this would work nicely

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.430 
verticals then this would work nicely
and<00:00:50.370> what<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.239> does<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.690> takes<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> best<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and what it does is it takes the best of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.680 
and what it does is it takes the best of
both<00:00:52.620> FDL<00:00:53.309> which<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.699> our<00:00:53.820> induction<00:00:54.090> lamp<00:00:54.420> and

the luma let's get put in horizontally

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.090 
the luma let's get put in horizontally
they're<00:01:54.420> static<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:54.930> don't<00:01:55.110> move<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.979> can

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
they're static they don't move you can

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
they're static they don't move you can
see<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> fruit<00:01:57.240> productions<00:01:57.689> up

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
see the fruit productions up

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.980 
see the fruit productions up
substantially<00:01:59.000> so<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.390> we're<00:02:00.509> gonna<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:00.810> now

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
substantially so what we're gonna do now

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.410 
substantially so what we're gonna do now
is<00:02:01.579> walk<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.790> around<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.210> hoist

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
is walk you around the hoist

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.600 
is walk you around the hoist
and<00:02:05.140> this<00:02:05.680> is<00:02:05.830> designed<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.340> mount<00:02:06.460> to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
and this is designed to mount to

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.910 
and this is designed to mount to
anything<00:02:06.880> structural<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.570> will<00:02:07.690> swivel<00:02:08.050> based

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
anything structural it will swivel based

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.270 
anything structural it will swivel based
on<00:02:09.160> where<00:02:09.369> your<00:02:09.580> trellis<00:02:10.569> aisles<00:02:11.110> are<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.590> as

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
on where your trellis aisles are and as

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.460 
on where your trellis aisles are and as
the<00:02:12.580> trellis<00:02:13.390> aisles<00:02:13.720> don't<00:02:13.930> always<00:02:14.050> align<00:02:14.350> it

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
the trellis aisles don't always align it

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.380 
the trellis aisles don't always align it
line<00:02:14.650> up<00:02:14.709> with<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.980> structure<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.880> want<00:02:16.090> that

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
line up with the structure you want that

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.190 
line up with the structure you want that
capability<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.530> bury<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.990> at<00:02:19.990> this

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
capability to bury that and at this

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.410 
capability to bury that and at this
point<00:02:20.500> there's<00:02:21.310> enough<00:02:21.580> sunlight<00:02:21.790> coming<00:02:22.180> in

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
point there's enough sunlight coming in

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.800 
point there's enough sunlight coming in
and<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:24.040> lights<00:02:24.220> are<00:02:24.370> off<00:02:24.520> but<00:02:24.550> when<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.630> main

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
and the lights are off but when the main

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.110 
and the lights are off but when the main
sensor<00:02:26.370> detects<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.490> there's<00:02:27.670> not<00:02:27.850> enough

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
sensor detects that there's not enough

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.860 
sensor detects that there's not enough
sunlight<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:29.380> gonna<00:02:29.530> turn<00:02:29.740> these<00:02:29.890> lights<00:02:30.100> on

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
sunlight it's gonna turn these lights on

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.260 
sunlight it's gonna turn these lights on
right<00:02:31.870> now<00:02:32.020> got<00:02:32.650> very<00:02:32.830> bright<00:02:33.100> lights<00:02:33.940> are<00:02:34.150> on

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
right now got very bright lights are on

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.720 
right now got very bright lights are on
instantly<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:36.840> they're<00:02:37.840> at<00:02:37.959> full<00:02:38.110> bright

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
instantly and they're at full bright

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.520 
instantly and they're at full bright
so<00:02:39.730> our<00:02:41.100> hoist<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.310> gonna<00:02:42.459> start<00:02:42.730> traveling<00:02:43.530> as

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
so our hoist is gonna start traveling as

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.420 
so our hoist is gonna start traveling as
it<00:02:44.769> does<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:46.810> might<00:02:46.989> drop<00:02:47.260> 15<00:02:47.769> feet<00:02:48.040> or<00:02:48.220> so

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
it does so it might drop 15 feet or so

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.300 
it does so it might drop 15 feet or so
to<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.000> lowest<00:02:49.330> point<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:49.950> once<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.100> gets

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
to the lowest point and once it gets

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.890 
to the lowest point and once it gets
there<00:02:51.550> it'll<00:02:51.670> slowly<00:02:52.000> travel<00:02:52.360> on<00:02:52.600> its<00:02:52.780> way

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
there it'll slowly travel on its way

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.720 
there it'll slowly travel on its way
back<00:02:53.080> up<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:54.040> highest<00:02:54.400> point<00:02:54.610> on<00:02:54.670> the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
back up to the highest point on the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.280 
back up to the highest point on the
trellis<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.209> this<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.480> all<00:02:55.630> user<00:02:55.870> definable

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.940 
trellis and this is all user definable
and<00:02:56.590> setting<00:02:57.840> okay<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.230> what<00:02:59.530> we're<00:02:59.650> gonna<00:02:59.769> do

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
and setting okay and what we're gonna do

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.140 
and setting okay and what we're gonna do
is<00:03:00.040> we're<00:03:00.160> gonna<00:03:00.220> stop<00:03:00.550> it<00:03:00.730> at<00:03:00.820> its<00:03:00.970> lowest

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
is we're gonna stop it at its lowest

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.660 
is we're gonna stop it at its lowest
travel<00:03:01.630> right<00:03:01.780> now<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.080> show<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.550> with<00:03:03.550> our

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
travel right now and show you with our

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.270 
travel right now and show you with our
electrical<00:03:04.120> engineer<00:03:04.390> Jeff<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:05.590> main<00:03:05.800> sensor

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
electrical engineer Jeff the main sensor

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.150 
electrical engineer Jeff the main sensor
is<00:03:06.400> designed<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:07.000> raise<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.600> lower<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.980> light

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
is designed to raise and lower the light

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.250 
is designed to raise and lower the light
output<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.760> meet<00:03:09.910> crop<00:03:10.150> DLI<00:03:10.570> so<00:03:10.870> if<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.079> would

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
output to meet crop DLI so if you would

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.539 
output to meet crop DLI so if you would
Jeff<00:03:11.470> using<00:03:11.829> a<00:03:11.890> flashlight

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
Jeff using a flashlight

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.420 
Jeff using a flashlight
we'll<00:03:12.730> get<00:03:12.820> on<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.090> main<00:03:13.299> sensor<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.430> you'll

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
we'll get on that main sensor and you'll

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.630 
we'll get on that main sensor and you'll
see<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.730> light<00:03:15.880> output<00:03:16.060> drop<00:03:16.540> play<00:03:16.959> up<00:03:17.079> to<00:03:17.110> 50%

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
see the light output drop play up to 50%

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.740 
see the light output drop play up to 50%
and<00:03:18.640> this<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:18.910> important<00:03:19.299> because<00:03:19.329> we're<00:03:19.630> not

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
and this is important because we're not

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.360 
and this is important because we're not
wasting<00:03:19.930> energy<00:03:20.260> what<00:03:20.620> we're<00:03:20.769> doing<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.190> we're

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
wasting energy what we're doing is we're

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.180 
wasting energy what we're doing is we're
only<00:03:21.519> giving<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.970> crops<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.450> DLI<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.470> you

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
only giving the crops the DLI that you

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.460 
only giving the crops the DLI that you
as<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.400> owner<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.360> crop<00:03:25.600> manager<00:03:26.290> has

as the owner the crop manager has

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.509 
as the owner the crop manager has
defined<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.579> DLI<00:03:28.060> for<00:03:28.299> that<00:03:28.420> specific<00:03:28.959> crop

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
defined the DLI for that specific crop

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.680 
defined the DLI for that specific crop
during<00:03:30.519> certain<00:03:30.820> times<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.329> year<00:03:31.510> you're

during certain times of the year you're

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.539 
during certain times of the year you're
obviously<00:03:31.810> going<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.200> need<00:03:32.380> more<00:03:32.500> light<00:03:32.799> this

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
obviously going to need more light this

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
may run at a hundred percent but how is

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.930 
may run at a hundred percent but how is

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
on the trellis so as opposed to

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.910

statically<00:04:01.060> mounting<00:04:01.600> these<00:04:01.750> diodes<00:04:02.260> we're

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
statically mounting these diodes we're

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.310 
statically mounting these diodes we're
moving<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.460> diodes<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.660> primary
