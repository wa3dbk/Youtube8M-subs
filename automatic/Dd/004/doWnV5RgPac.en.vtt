00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
used to it so he probably couldn't

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.420 
used to it so he probably couldn't
remember<00:04:33.090> all<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.540> his<00:04:33.979> training<00:04:34.979> in<00:04:35.400> that

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
remember all of his training in that

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.170 
remember all of his training in that
short<00:04:36.120> time<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:37.080> he<00:04:37.229> was<00:04:37.440> only<00:04:37.740> using<00:04:38.190> what<00:04:39.000> he

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
short time so he was only using what he

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.780 
short time so he was only using what he
had<00:04:39.360> at<00:04:39.510> his<00:04:39.660> disposal<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:40.650> what<00:04:41.490> he<00:04:41.610> could
