00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
ancestors so I thought perhaps if we

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.550 
ancestors so I thought perhaps if we
fill<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> right<00:01:09.060> info<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:10.140> would<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
fill in the right info we would get a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.370 
fill in the right info we would get a
clue<00:01:10.950> or<00:01:11.250> some<00:01:11.640> info<00:01:12.119> about<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.900> egg<00:01:13.080> we're

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
clue or some info about the egg we're

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.649 
clue or some info about the egg we're
searching<00:01:13.799> through<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> tried<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.390> put

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
searching through so I tried to put

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.899

Michaels<00:01:16.110> name<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.310> didn't<00:01:17.820> get

Michaels name in it but I didn't get

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.120 
Michaels name in it but I didn't get
something<00:01:18.299> special<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.259> maybe<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
something special out of it maybe you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
something special out of it maybe you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
I don't know but I didn't get anything

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.600 
I don't know but I didn't get anything
special<00:01:24.930> out<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.189> yeah<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
special out of it but yeah then I

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850 
special out of it but yeah then I
thought<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.270> making<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.750> character<00:01:28.229> ngt

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
thought when making a character ngt

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.429 
thought when making a character ngt
online<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.820> need<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.090> choose<00:01:30.299> your<00:01:30.509> ancestors

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
online you need to choose your ancestors

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.920 
online you need to choose your ancestors
as<00:01:31.710> well<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.820> yeah<00:01:32.970> maybe<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.420> choose<00:01:33.750> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
as well so yeah maybe if you choose a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.870 
as well so yeah maybe if you choose a
special<00:01:34.560> combination<00:01:34.770> something<00:01:35.729> will

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
special combination something will

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.749 
special combination something will
happen<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:36.630> character<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.229> GTA<00:01:37.560> online

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
happen with your character in GTA online

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.880 
happen with your character in GTA online
but<00:01:38.759> actually<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.299> don't<00:01:39.479> think<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.110> we

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
but actually I don't think so because we

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.889 
but actually I don't think so because we
don't<00:01:41.189> got<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.460> much<00:01:41.759> options<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
don't got that much options for a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.410 
don't got that much options for a
character<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.740> yeah<00:01:44.399> after<00:01:44.729> such<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> long

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
character and yeah after such a long

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.260 
character and yeah after such a long
time<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.899> playing<00:01:46.170> GTA<00:01:46.500> online<00:01:46.530> already

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
time of playing GTA online already

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.940 
time of playing GTA online already
someone<00:01:48.270> would<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.659> made<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.380> special

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
someone would have made that special

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.190 
someone would have made that special
character<00:01:50.399> already<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> key

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
character already so that's not the key

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.680 
character already so that's not the key
i<00:01:52.229> guess<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.040> was<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.549> theory

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
i guess but it was just a theory

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.290 
i guess but it was just a theory
