things and I head out the door and at
this<00:02:28.019> point<00:02:28.349> I'm<00:02:28.590> usually<00:02:28.799> deciding<00:02:29.580> if<00:02:29.700> I'm

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
this point I'm usually deciding if I'm

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.370 
this point I'm usually deciding if I'm
gonna<00:02:30.000> stop<00:02:30.269> at<00:02:30.420> Starbucks<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.140> way<00:02:31.260> or

gonna stop at Starbucks on the way or

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.350 
gonna stop at Starbucks on the way or
not<00:02:31.470> because<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.220> have<00:02:32.730> some<00:02:32.880> time<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.239> kill

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
