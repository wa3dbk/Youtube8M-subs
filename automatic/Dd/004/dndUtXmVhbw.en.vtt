00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
main challenge with that would just be

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.520 
main challenge with that would just be
finding<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:33.010> venue<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.610> host<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.090> voice<00:02:36.050> maybe

very<00:03:13.730> new<00:03:14.000> here<00:03:14.269> at<00:03:14.359> least<00:03:14.480> people<00:03:15.470> don't

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
very new here at least people don't

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.280 
very new here at least people don't
really<00:03:15.829> do<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.549> they<00:03:17.239> I<00:03:17.720> think<00:03:18.049> all<00:03:18.170> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
really do that so they I think all the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.120 
really do that so they I think all the
kids<00:03:18.410> really<00:03:18.620> enjoyed<00:03:18.859> it<00:03:19.010> but<00:03:20.500> I'm<00:03:21.500> one<00:03:21.859> class

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
kids really enjoyed it but I'm one class

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.500 
kids really enjoyed it but I'm one class
one<00:03:22.579> of<00:03:22.640> my<00:03:22.700> first<00:03:22.850> thought<00:03:23.150> was<00:03:23.269> what<00:03:23.329> I

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
one of my first thought was what I

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.870 
one of my first thought was what I
taught<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.870> kind<00:03:24.079> of<00:03:24.140> ran<00:03:24.290> out<00:03:24.319> of<00:03:24.620> ideas<00:03:25.280> you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
taught I kind of ran out of ideas you

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.800 
taught I kind of ran out of ideas you
know<00:03:26.000> because<00:03:26.209> they're<00:03:26.329> kind<00:03:26.569> of<00:03:26.600> getting

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
know because they're kind of getting

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.069 
know because they're kind of getting
tired<00:03:26.959> with<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.590> routine<00:03:28.150> but<00:03:29.150> there's<00:03:29.359> so<00:03:29.660> a

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
tired with the routine but there's so a

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.140 
tired with the routine but there's so a
lot<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.709> energy<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.069> I<00:03:31.310> basically<00:03:31.760> made<00:03:32.000> them

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
lot of energy so I basically made them

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.830 
lot of energy so I basically made them
do<00:03:32.420> like<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.930> jumping<00:03:33.530> jack<00:03:34.090> contest<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.359> then

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
do like a jumping jack contest and then

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.629 
do like a jumping jack contest and then
I<00:03:35.959> guess<00:03:36.139> the<00:03:36.350> girl<00:03:36.500> who<00:03:36.709> had<00:03:36.859> them<00:03:37.040> guys<00:03:37.220> like

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
I guess the girl who had them guys like

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.250 
I guess the girl who had them guys like

and I never really feel like I fit in or

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.210 
and I never really feel like I fit in or
maybe<00:04:20.660> not<00:04:20.780> always<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.410> lot<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.829> times<00:04:22.009> it's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
maybe not always a lot of times it's

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.260 
maybe not always a lot of times it's
kind<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.460> how<00:04:22.610> how<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:23.539> feel<00:04:23.870> at<00:04:24.020> first<00:04:24.259> and<00:04:25.270> so

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
kind of how how you feel at first and so

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.300 
kind of how how you feel at first and so
I<00:04:26.300> like<00:04:26.750> really<00:04:27.349> just<00:04:27.560> well<00:04:27.740> like<00:04:27.979> I<00:04:28.099> was<00:04:28.190> like

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
I like really just well like I was like

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.740 
I like really just well like I was like
in<00:04:28.340> my<00:04:28.580> element<00:04:28.909> and<00:04:29.000> having<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.389> lot<00:04:29.509> of<00:04:29.539> fun

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
in my element and having a lot of fun

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.559 
in my element and having a lot of fun
and<00:04:30.080> bonding<00:04:30.770> with<00:04:30.949> the<00:04:31.250> kids<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.759> I<00:04:32.210> really

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
and bonding with the kids and I really

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.360 
and bonding with the kids and I really
think<00:04:32.750> that<00:04:32.870> that's<00:04:33.620> where<00:04:33.949> a<00:04:33.979> lot<00:04:34.159> of<00:04:34.190> my<00:04:34.340> work

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
think that that's where a lot of my work

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.980 
think that that's where a lot of my work
is<00:04:34.639> gonna<00:04:34.789> be<00:04:34.879> concerned<00:04:35.210> here<00:04:35.479> so<00:04:35.750> far

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
is gonna be concerned here so far

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.779 
is gonna be concerned here so far
everything<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:36.979> I've<00:04:37.069> really<00:04:37.400> enjoyed

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
everything that I've really enjoyed

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.689 
everything that I've really enjoyed
doing<00:04:38.180> has<00:04:38.539> been<00:04:38.590> with<00:04:39.590> kids<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.610> think

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
doing has been with kids and I think

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.629 
doing has been with kids and I think
that<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.449> kids<00:04:41.599> here<00:04:41.870> have<00:04:42.409> like<00:04:42.860> a<00:04:43.129> lot<00:04:43.610> of

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
that the kids here have like a lot of

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.899 
that the kids here have like a lot of
like<00:04:43.879> dreams<00:04:44.389> and<00:04:44.750> ambitions<00:04:45.409> and<00:04:45.889> it's<00:04:46.819> a

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:46.909 
like dreams and ambitions and it's a

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:48.040 
like dreams and ambitions and it's a
little<00:04:47.090> different<00:04:47.330> because<00:04:47.389> they<00:04:47.629> aren't

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
little different because they aren't

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.680 
little different because they aren't
weren't<00:04:48.620> from<00:04:49.490> or<00:04:49.759> they<00:04:50.030> didn't<00:04:50.270> grow<00:04:50.360> up<00:04:50.449> with

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
weren't from or they didn't grow up with

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.469 
weren't from or they didn't grow up with
like<00:04:50.930> you<00:04:51.349> know<00:04:52.599> communism<00:04:53.599> and<00:04:55.479> figures

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
like you know communism and figures

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.320 
like you know communism and figures
dictators<00:04:57.229> though<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.560> think<00:04:57.979> that<00:04:58.330> their

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
dictators though I think that their

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.659 
dictators though I think that their
visions<00:04:59.840> of<00:05:00.229> like<00:05:00.409> you<00:05:00.620> know<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.039> now<00:05:01.430> there's

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
visions of like you know and now there's

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.230 
visions of like you know and now there's
like<00:05:01.909> visa<00:05:02.270> liberalization<00:05:03.080> and

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
like visa liberalization and

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.760 
like visa liberalization and
liberalisation<00:05:05.240> that<00:05:06.139> right<00:05:06.349> here<00:05:06.530> by

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
liberalisation that right here by

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.939 
liberalisation that right here by
English<00:05:07.159> is<00:05:07.310> levering<00:05:07.870> and<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:09.590> think<00:05:09.800> that

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
English is levering and I think that

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.439 
English is levering and I think that
they<00:05:10.039> just<00:05:10.069> have<00:05:10.400> like<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.610> lot<00:05:10.909> of<00:05:10.969> hope<00:05:11.210> and

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
they just have like a lot of hope and

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.439 
they just have like a lot of hope and
that<00:05:12.139> is<00:05:12.620> I<00:05:13.400> don't<00:05:13.610> know<00:05:13.729> out<00:05:14.060> being<00:05:14.300> used

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
that is I don't know out being used

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.689 
that is I don't know out being used
futures<00:05:14.840> really<00:05:15.199> with<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.740> kids<00:05:16.009> and<00:05:16.430> I<00:05:16.669> think

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699
