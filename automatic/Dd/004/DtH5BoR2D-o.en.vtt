the context of telling a true story yes
well<00:00:12.940> I<00:00:12.969> think<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:14.549> my<00:00:15.549> basic<00:00:16.029> belief<00:00:16.330> is

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
well I think that my basic belief is

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.109 
well I think that my basic belief is
that<00:00:16.869> there<00:00:17.680> isn't<00:00:17.830> much<00:00:18.220> difference<00:00:18.700> between

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
that there isn't much difference between

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.550 
that there isn't much difference between
real<00:00:19.330> life<00:00:19.599> and<00:00:19.779> stories<00:00:20.079> there's<00:00:20.259> a<00:00:20.320> big

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
real life and stories there's a big

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.190 
real life and stories there's a big
debate<00:00:21.040> about<00:00:21.070> that<00:00:21.550> but<00:00:21.880> my<00:00:22.480> feeling<00:00:22.960> is<00:00:23.140> that

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
debate about that but my feeling is that

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.740 
debate about that but my feeling is that
stories<00:00:23.980> are<00:00:24.009> reflecting<00:00:24.939> things<00:00:25.480> that

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
stories are reflecting things that

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.420 
stories are reflecting things that
actually<00:00:25.930> happen<00:00:26.529> in<00:00:26.649> life<00:00:26.860> and<00:00:27.160> it's<00:00:27.340> a

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
actually happen in life and it's a

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.600 
actually happen in life and it's a
pretty<00:00:27.640> true<00:00:28.059> and<00:00:28.270> accurate<00:00:28.480> reflection<00:00:29.349> and

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
pretty true and accurate reflection and

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.600 
pretty true and accurate reflection and
what<00:00:30.610> I<00:00:30.640> found<00:00:30.969> with<00:00:31.840> stories<00:00:32.349> and

take that and spin it into their own

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.299 
take that and spin it into their own
form<00:00:50.079> that's<00:00:50.289> how<00:00:50.440> they<00:00:50.620> know<00:00:50.829> how<00:00:51.010> to<00:00:51.070> digest

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
form that's how they know how to digest

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.029 
form that's how they know how to digest
something<00:00:51.820> so<00:00:52.449> I<00:00:52.480> say<00:00:52.809> why<00:00:52.989> fight<00:00:53.289> that<00:00:53.530> why

dramatic that's the key thing I think is

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.259 
dramatic that's the key thing I think is
that<00:00:58.539> you<00:00:58.960> know<00:00:59.079> anybody<00:00:59.969> creating<00:01:00.969> something
