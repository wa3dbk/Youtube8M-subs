what I'd like to show you is a couple of

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.580 
what I'd like to show you is a couple of
key<00:00:06.330> concepts<00:00:07.099> starting<00:00:08.099> with<00:00:08.990> the<00:00:09.990> idea<00:00:10.290> that

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
key concepts starting with the idea that

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.820 
key concepts starting with the idea that
pressure<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.520> not<00:00:11.790> what<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.120> seems<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.870> this

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
pressure is not what it seems in this

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.440 
pressure is not what it seems in this
section<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.370> DVD<00:00:14.760> we're<00:00:15.180> going<00:00:15.300> to<00:00:15.360> go

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
section of the DVD we're going to go

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.670 
section of the DVD we're going to go
through<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.720> few<00:00:15.990> things<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.439> are<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> little

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
through a few things that are a little

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.679 
through a few things that are a little
more<00:00:16.859> advancing<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.400> liberty<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.300> one<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
more advancing in liberty and one of the

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.570 
more advancing in liberty and one of the
pieces<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.050> need<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.380> know<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.740> pressures<00:00:20.430> not

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
pieces you need to know is pressures not

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.720 
pieces you need to know is pressures not
what<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.850> seems<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.710> until<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.920> point<00:00:23.190> if<00:00:23.550> you

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
what it seems so until this point if you

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.939 
what it seems so until this point if you
think<00:00:23.940> of<00:00:24.030> the<00:00:24.119> driveline<00:00:24.420> being<00:00:25.020> right<00:00:25.830> at

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
think of the driveline being right at

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.740 
think of the driveline being right at
the<00:00:26.010> withers<00:00:26.160> until<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.210> point<00:00:27.420> we've<00:00:27.510> been

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
the withers until this point we've been

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.500 
the withers until this point we've been
trying<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.380> essentially<00:00:28.860> get<00:00:29.580> pressure<00:00:29.970> like

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
trying to essentially get pressure like

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.450 
trying to essentially get pressure like
by<00:00:30.630> reaching<00:00:30.900> around<00:00:31.199> behind<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> driveline

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
by reaching around behind the driveline

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.779 
by reaching around behind the driveline
to<00:00:33.300> cause<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.690> horse<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.989> come<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.350> us<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.949> you

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
to cause the horse to come to us so you

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:36.979 
to cause the horse to come to us so you
know<00:00:35.879> we've<00:00:36.089> been<00:00:36.210> doing<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.659> a<00:00:36.719> pretty

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
know we've been doing that in a pretty

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.809 
know we've been doing that in a pretty
close<00:00:37.260> range<00:00:37.589> sometimes<00:00:38.280> kind<00:00:38.429> of<00:00:38.489> reaching

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:38.819 
close range sometimes kind of reaching

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:40.279 
close range sometimes kind of reaching
around<00:00:38.909> the<00:00:39.269> bubble<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.749> to<00:00:39.809> speak<00:00:40.019> kind<00:00:40.229> of

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
around the bubble so to speak kind of

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:41.989 
around the bubble so to speak kind of
get<00:00:40.379> around<00:00:40.679> there<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.949> little<00:00:41.100> bit<00:00:41.249> to<00:00:41.699> press

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:41.999 
get around there a little bit to press

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:44.389 
get around there a little bit to press
the<00:00:42.179> horse<00:00:42.359> to<00:00:42.629> us<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.649> course<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.190> we're<00:00:44.309> at

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the horse to us of course when we're at

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.309 
the horse to us of course when we're at
a<00:00:44.429> greater<00:00:44.670> distance<00:00:44.999> and<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.749> horses<00:00:46.019> say

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:46.319 
a greater distance and the horses say

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:48.410 
a greater distance and the horses say
out<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.979> the<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.550> know<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.909> edge<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.329> the

me<00:00:51.179> I<00:00:51.359> can't<00:00:52.139> get<00:00:52.409> behind<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.920> drive<00:00:53.159> line

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
me I can't get behind the drive line

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.419 
me I can't get behind the drive line
once<00:00:54.749> she's<00:00:54.989> facing<00:00:55.229> me<00:00:55.530> oh<00:00:55.649> she's<00:00:56.100> feeling

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
makes me laugh so back to what we were

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.530 
makes me laugh so back to what we were
talking<00:01:04.650> about<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:05.460> once<00:01:05.640> she<00:01:05.820> say<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.360> have

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
talking about see once she say if I have

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.300 
talking about see once she say if I have
a<00:01:06.570> further<00:01:06.869> away<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.530> wanted<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> come<00:01:08.070> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
a further away and I wanted to come to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.790 
a further away and I wanted to come to
me<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.640> can't<00:01:09.540> reach<00:01:09.810> behind<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.350> drive<00:01:10.590> line

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
me I can't reach behind the drive line

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.500 
me I can't reach behind the drive line
at<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.070> point<00:01:11.340> I've<00:01:11.490> got<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.940> her<00:01:12.120> feel

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
at this point I've got to have her feel

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.990 
at this point I've got to have her feel
that<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.440> pressure<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.340> not<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.790> seems

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
that this pressure is not what it seems

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.580 
that this pressure is not what it seems
the<00:01:15.120> pressure<00:01:15.390> doesn't<00:01:15.900> mean<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.410> away

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the pressure doesn't mean go away

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.250 
the pressure doesn't mean go away
because<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.460> front<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.760> drive<00:01:17.940> line

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
because it's in front of the drive line

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.810 
because it's in front of the drive line
she<00:01:19.260> has<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.740> focus<00:01:19.980> on<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:20.430> intent

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
she has to really focus on my intent

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.340 
she has to really focus on my intent
that<00:01:21.150> means<00:01:21.390> i<00:01:21.510> have<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.660> be<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:21.900> clear<00:01:22.290> about

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that means i have to be very clear about

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.620 
that means i have to be very clear about
i<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:23.550> clear<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.480> my

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
i have to be really really clear but my

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
i have to be really really clear but my
body<00:01:24.900> language<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.800> remember<00:01:25.920> one

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
body language because remember one

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.190 
body language because remember one
moment<00:01:26.880> i<00:01:26.970> may<00:01:27.150> put<00:01:27.330> pressure<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.840> front<00:01:28.140> of

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
moment i may put pressure in front of

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.930 
moment i may put pressure in front of
the<00:01:28.290> drive<00:01:28.500> line<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.430> her<00:01:29.550> go<00:01:29.670> back

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
the drive line and have her go back

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.030 
the drive line and have her go back
because<00:01:30.870> my<00:01:31.110> body<00:01:31.290> language<00:01:31.680> might<00:01:31.830> say<00:01:32.010> oh

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
because my body language might say oh

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.030 
because my body language might say oh
I'll<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.240> work<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:33.710> get<00:01:34.710> her<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:34.920> go

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
I'll get this to work here get her to go

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
I'll get this to work here get her to go
back<00:01:35.250> by<00:01:35.550> I'm<00:01:35.850> still<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.330> in<00:01:36.480> front<00:01:36.510> of<00:01:36.900> the

drive line and then the next minute I
might<00:01:39.180> press<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.140> I'm<00:01:40.350> still<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:41.010> front

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
might press here and I'm still in front

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
might press here and I'm still in front
of<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.640> drive<00:01:41.850> line<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.330> it's<00:01:42.900> my<00:01:43.080> intention

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
of the drive line but it's my intention

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.740 
of the drive line but it's my intention
that<00:01:43.680> gets<00:01:43.950> her<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.160> come<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.180> she<00:01:45.270> didn't<00:01:45.600> come

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that gets her to come so she didn't come

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.630 
that gets her to come so she didn't come
off<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:46.110> intent<00:01:46.470> how<00:01:46.590> would<00:01:46.740> then<00:01:46.890> increased

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
off my intent how would then increased

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.190 
off my intent how would then increased
pressure<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.090> increase<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.510> intensity<00:01:48.960> of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
pressure or increase the intensity of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.800 
pressure or increase the intensity of
the<00:01:49.860> use<00:01:49.980> of<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.250> stick<00:01:50.510> that<00:01:51.510> type<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the use of the stick that type of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
the use of the stick that type of
pressure<00:01:51.990> until<00:01:52.890> she<00:01:53.040> started<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.400> come<00:01:53.550> in

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
pressure until she started to come in

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.770 
pressure until she started to come in
and<00:01:53.760> release<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.240> get<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.510> work<00:01:54.570> off<00:01:54.750> my

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
and release and get it to work off my

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.230 
and release and get it to work off my
body<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.520> thing<00:01:56.550> that<00:01:56.850> we're<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.150> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
body but the thing that we're going to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.710 
body but the thing that we're going to
talk<00:01:57.630> about<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.050> DVD<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:59.510> that<00:02:00.510> pressure

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
talk about in this DVD is that pressure

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.840 
talk about in this DVD is that pressure
is<00:02:00.900> not<00:02:01.020> what<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.200> seems<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.520> this

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
is not what it seems so it's this

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.910 
is not what it seems so it's this
pressure<00:02:03.240> here<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:04.080> our<00:02:04.229> body<00:02:04.500> language

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
pressure here with our body language

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.940 
pressure here with our body language
means<00:02:05.130> go<00:02:05.340> back<00:02:05.580> then<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.570> change<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.320> it's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
means go back then we change it and it's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.469 
means go back then we change it and it's
this<00:02:08.099> pressure<00:02:08.399> here<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:09.149> our<00:02:09.269> body

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
this pressure here with our body

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.199 
this pressure here with our body
language<00:02:09.840> means<00:02:10.140> comes<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.739> us<00:02:10.950> means<00:02:11.790> come<00:02:12.030> to

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
language means comes to us means come to

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.040 
language means comes to us means come to
us<00:02:12.359> because<00:02:12.389> we've<00:02:13.079> changed<00:02:13.290> our<00:02:13.499> intention
