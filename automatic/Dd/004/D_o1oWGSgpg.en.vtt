00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.229
 cameras and very important the temperature 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.479
 of the baby room the level of 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.670
 battery at this time then we have it 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.310
 loading 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.770

 camera brightness 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:05.500
