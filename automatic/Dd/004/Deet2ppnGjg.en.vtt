of curious if the belt supposed to be
this<00:00:19.680> loose<00:00:20.060> on<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:22.100> bottom

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
this loose on the bottom

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.640 
this loose on the bottom
blanket<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.390> never<00:00:24.720> see<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.320> don't<00:00:25.560> know

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
blanket you never see that I don't know

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.560 
blanket you never see that I don't know
it's<00:00:25.740> not<00:00:25.890> too<00:00:26.039> loose<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.910> seems<00:00:27.119> pretty<00:00:27.300> tight

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
it's not too loose it seems pretty tight

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.060 
it's not too loose it seems pretty tight
everywhere<00:00:27.990> else<00:00:29.240> but<00:00:30.529> it<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.650> kinda<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:31.949> of

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
everywhere else but it was kinda out of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.120 
everywhere else but it was kinda out of
time<00:00:32.279> when<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.489> started<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.620> tensioner<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.890> I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
time when I started it tensioner this I

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.490 
time when I started it tensioner this I
got<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> question<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> pulley<00:00:36.350> torque<00:00:37.350> this

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
got a question on the pulley torque this

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.160 
got a question on the pulley torque this
to<00:00:37.680> 16<00:00:38.129> foot-pounds<00:00:38.870> according<00:00:39.870> into<00:00:40.020> one

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
to 16 foot-pounds according into one

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.040 
to 16 foot-pounds according into one
part<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.530> all<00:00:40.649> data<00:00:41.629> but<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.840> see<00:00:43.020> another

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
part of all data but then I see another

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
part of all data but then I see another
part<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.500> all<00:00:43.620> data<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.980> says<00:00:44.160> torque<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.550> much

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
part of all data it says torque it much

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.850 
part of all data it says torque it much
higher<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.390> looks<00:00:46.230> like<00:00:46.289> about<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> right

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
higher so looks like about the right

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.700 
higher so looks like about the right
position<00:00:47.520> for<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.450> ascent<00:00:48.750> eccentric<00:00:49.530> pull

this is the trouble bolt I had I ended

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
this is the trouble bolt I had I ended
up<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.729> putting<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.240> there<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:07.049> now

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
up just putting it in there for now

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.490 
up just putting it in there for now
and<00:01:08.250> still<00:01:08.540> still<00:01:09.540> accessible<00:01:09.869> should<00:01:10.409> be

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and still still accessible should be

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.690 
and still still accessible should be
able<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> back<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.920> out<00:01:11.360> I<00:01:13.010> had<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> wrong<00:01:14.250> torque

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
able to back it out I had a wrong torque

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.030 
able to back it out I had a wrong torque
spec<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.869> started<00:01:16.140> over<00:01:16.320> torquing<00:01:16.710> him<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
spec just started over torquing him and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.620 
spec just started over torquing him and
of<00:01:17.250> course<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> stripped<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.030> which<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.270> I

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
of course it stripped it out which is I

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.760 
of course it stripped it out which is I
think<00:01:18.869> what<00:01:19.049> they're<00:01:19.140> supposed<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> do

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
think what they're supposed to do

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.170 
think what they're supposed to do
because<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.040> don't<00:01:20.189> want<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> break<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> bolt<00:01:21.090> in

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
because I don't want to break a bolt in

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.990 
because I don't want to break a bolt in
the<00:01:22.009> aluminum<00:01:23.009> block<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.400> done<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.640> before

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the aluminum block have done that before

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.020 
the aluminum block have done that before
it's<00:01:24.180> no<00:01:24.330> fun<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.259> car

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
it's no fun not in this car

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.950 
it's no fun not in this car
so<00:01:27.030> anyways<00:01:27.330> next<00:01:27.720> steps<00:01:28.020> are<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:29.720> take<00:01:30.720> out

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
so anyways next steps are to take out

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.510 
so anyways next steps are to take out
the<00:01:31.140> crank<00:01:32.240> lock<00:01:33.240> tool<00:01:34.100> just<00:01:35.100> following<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the crank lock tool just following a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.130 
the crank lock tool just following a
little<00:01:35.729> turn<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> over<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.420> couple<00:01:36.540> times<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
little turn it over a couple times and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.100 
little turn it over a couple times and
make<00:01:37.320> sure<00:01:37.439> these<00:01:37.560> big<00:01:37.829> holes<00:01:38.840> are<00:01:39.840> both

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
make sure these big holes are both

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.240 
make sure these big holes are both
pointing<00:01:40.909> inside<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> inside<00:01:43.250> 90

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
pointing inside or to the inside 90

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.730 
pointing inside or to the inside 90
degrees<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.850> should<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.420> able<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> rotate<00:01:45.780> full

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
degrees I should be able to rotate full

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.170 
degrees I should be able to rotate full
around<00:01:47.240> four<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.420> two<00:01:49.020> rotations<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.909> put<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
around four to two rotations and put the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.179 
around four to two rotations and put the
bar<00:01:51.329> right<00:01:51.360> back<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.840> place<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.079> that's<00:01:52.979> why<00:01:53.159> I

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
bar right back in place and that's why I

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.740 
bar right back in place and that's why I
know<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> time<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.850> gonna<00:01:53.970> work<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.540> I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
know the time it's gonna work so I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.010 
know the time it's gonna work so I
haven't<00:01:55.500> opposed<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.860> video<00:01:56.159> up<00:01:56.719> let<00:01:57.719> people

haven't opposed this video up let people
comment<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.770> what<00:01:59.340> they<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.850> that's

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009

too<00:02:02.009> loose<00:02:02.280> or<00:02:02.610> what<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.890> seems<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.100> top

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
too loose or what so seems on the top

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.400 
too loose or what so seems on the top
seems<00:02:05.759> pretty<00:02:06.170> pretty<00:02:07.170> tight<00:02:07.380> so
