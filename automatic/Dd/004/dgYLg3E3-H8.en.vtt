00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello and heartily combined both 2013 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.319
 then with the mother is yes we test 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.070
 or 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:17.039
 put you here shed this earth 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.869
 30 80 by design yes simple 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.470
 kept up here the study weird 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.289
 on the roof of the not so streak 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.359
 in there at the door and so we see 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.429
 a bit strange but otherwise you can 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.740
 actually apply does not pay 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.940
 architecture of its even more old though 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.270
 the bad thing is not exactly that 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:41.550
 new scanners exactly stone in front of us 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.579
 subject to handbrake that means we 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.350
 have to touch the new first 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:55.710
 release handbrake and then we can 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:57.770
 drive to driving behavior so far to 30 km 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.920
 h about 32 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.640
 that's still remember the simple 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.630
 So that's the way we try 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.920
 attach a sowing machine 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.720
 that pretty much streaked off after 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.380
 outside if that is also attached correctly 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.890
 I have to ask which comes exactly 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.890
 me too far 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:30.950
 that's exactly what suits some drive with it 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.950
 works yes 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.189
 so many corners blinker has also installed 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.140
 yes then we have 5 and 6 now 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:47.649
 change work light 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:56.560
 front normal light works too 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:58.930
 wonderful ease yes my cockpit 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:09.340
 you can see the treasures on the top right 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:14.080
 the engine speed is the 200 so that 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.319
 are the km h there is a come on 28,0 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:22.959
 and says but even there we see only 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.860
 bad here yes more gives to the motto 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.989
 not to say 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:32.260
 as far as we are working in the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:34.569
 shop mass shed 30 80 installed 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.680
 have on the day 80 euro maintenance costs 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.049
 or dollars after farmers are 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.920
 probably 20 euro took for this 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.660
 Mass of my to be we still look 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.359
 Let's not loosen the backpack 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.519
 error that's good 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.560
 So no errors so yes continue with 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.570
 idea on main channel could times 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.459
 drop by 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.900
 and yes that was a lot of fun with the motto 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.250
 see you in the next 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.250
 imagination so canada
