00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:13.427
Hello friends welcome back to our channel Variedades Carol T.V

00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:16.167
Today I bring a spectacular bracelet

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:18.847
With synthetic leather, turquoise and gold plastimetal

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.280
I hope you like it and it is very easy to do

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.220
The materials for todays bracelet are

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.760
70 cm synthetic leather 6mm turquoise

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.440
16 PLASTIMETAL separators of 10 mm

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.380
8 PLASTIMETAL separators of 16 mm

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.060
One PLASTIMETAL brooch of 32

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.520
Well, we have already cut

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.960
our turquoise synthetic leather

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.480
we have 70 cm

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.560
but the bracalet size will be 60 cmm

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.900
this is because while we start to put the stones and cutting it, it will be shorter

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.820
so we are going to cut like this

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.940
to make space for the separators

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.880
lets begin with the small one

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.460
twist the separator

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.660
when the leather pass over the separator, we can grab the leather with the pin

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.520
the idea its to pass it till the end

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.980
so after that we put the bigger one

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.280
till the end too

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.680
and we put the smaller one again

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.760
remember to twist it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.220
when its inside, use the pin

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.580
if get stuck we can flat the leather

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.960
and it will pass easily

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:35.880
the idea is to leave a space between each small separator

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.800
for the bigger one can move between the smalls one

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.300
now we can continue

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.640
we place the other small separator

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.440
you can see how is decaying ?

00:02:48.740 --> 00:03:01.540
so that its the reason for the extra leather, you can use 10 or 15 cm more, to avoid short bracelet

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.040
this is a new leather in our collection

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.940
you can find it in red, coffee, turquoise, that its the one that we are using

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.600
they are available right now in our website

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:26.120
www.variedadescarol.net

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.540
remember to leave this space like this

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.740
first we put the little one the with the bigger one

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
put the bigger one

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.360
we can start to cut a little bit

00:03:56.865 --> 00:03:58.865
now the little one

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.460
we are going to repeat

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.960
withe the 8 bigger separators

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.200
for each big separator we are going to put two small

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.180
so we are going to do this with the 8 that i already told you

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.640
now we are going to put the brooch

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
its a plastimetal brooch

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
we are going to put some glue

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600
a few drops

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.560
and we are going to fit the leather

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.780
let it dry

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.020
ando we do the same in the other side of the leather

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.680
stick the other part of the brooch

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.680
here we are sticking the other part of the brooch

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.680
and here we have

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.280
our bracelet that its beautiful, in synthetic leather

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.740
