tried them on they feel really good nice
and<00:01:15.570> comfortable<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.530> can't<00:01:16.710> wait<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.950> see

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and comfortable I just can't wait to see

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.520 
and comfortable I just can't wait to see
what<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.460> play<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.000> uh<00:01:18.530> boost

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
what it's like I play with this uh boost

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.300 
what it's like I play with this uh boost
technology<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.549> they<00:01:20.700> added<00:01:21.860> it<00:01:22.860> feels<00:01:23.100> like

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
technology that they added it feels like

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.070 
technology that they added it feels like
foam<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:26.060> think<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.240> basically<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
foam I think that's basically what it is

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.399 
foam I think that's basically what it is
like<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> foam<00:01:28.799> material<00:01:30.020> maybe<00:01:31.020> it'll<00:01:31.259> give

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
like a foam material maybe it'll give

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.160 
like a foam material maybe it'll give
you<00:01:31.500> ever<00:01:31.680> more<00:01:31.860> bounce<00:01:32.750> but<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> she<00:01:34.049> was

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
you ever more bounce but the she was

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.690 
you ever more bounce but the she was
still<00:01:34.380> relatively<00:01:34.890> light<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.400> ain't<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
still relatively light it ain't the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.730 
still relatively light it ain't the
lightest<00:01:36.590> DeRose<00:01:37.590> ever<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:39.439> he's<00:01:40.439> had<00:01:40.590> other

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
lightest DeRose ever but he's had other

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.230 
lightest DeRose ever but he's had other
seems<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.250> lighter<00:01:41.460> than<00:01:41.670> these<00:01:41.820> but

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
seems that are lighter than these but

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.080 
seems that are lighter than these but
it's<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> heavy<00:01:42.810> string<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.439> still<00:01:43.680> like

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
it's not a heavy string it's still like

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.420 
it's not a heavy string it's still like
