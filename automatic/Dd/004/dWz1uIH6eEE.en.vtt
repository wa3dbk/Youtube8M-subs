00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.040
 where the team has been coming for 41 years, the players 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.990
 were traditionally on the bike 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.830

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.420
 Ajax 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.160
 because after the departure of siem de jong is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.359
 Davy owns that number 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.340
 classify 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.800

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.180
 youth and played with 10 and yes 10 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.250
 always a special number for sure 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.649
 If you like playing in midfield 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.480
 is that was between what makes it so 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.390
 special 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.649
 yes you know it so special may link it 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.110
 that we are in the middle of human beings with a 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.300
 number one special number is one 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.789
 yes my'm proud that I can do it 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.500
 off the monday after austria 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.320
 came to ajax and lay in my place in me 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.100
 ten new bag I got robust because 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.180

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.290
 to-day yes yes it is so beautiful 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.350
 appreciation that you get the number 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.939
 because actually says people 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.310
 the number ten of ajax was this summer 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.020
 also close to the world cup in brazil 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.460
 but fell just before the end of the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.350
 preparation 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.960
 yet that decision did not come very hard 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 to the heart because I already notice it 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.799
 to myself that I no longer have the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.570
 yes no more fit fool and disqus yes one 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.340

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.840
 seasons 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.479

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.130
 it also right molasses marlies 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.750

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.500
 like to stand but yes I know that 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.200
 my so it just runs on 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.360
 was a yes i just like that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.340
 Boys show 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.050
 yes but come on the rotten steam done 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.490
 vacation has already done you very well 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.960
 to do 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.280
 yes pretty well i got there during my 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.500
 vacation still a bit tricky 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.540
 actually keep going through the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.190
 first training 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.990
 yes it is just enough 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.570
 a workout and since then string is day 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.800
 is clear about a summer 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.880
 how do you feel now that you are completely back again 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.729
 fresh well I feel good though tough week 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.340
 have been going for three weeks now and then 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.750
 then this was stronger what can it be black 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.550
 she is walking much conditionally 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.560
 buildup still yes the first three 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.480
 weeks done that much and that much longer 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.239
 walking is one 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.130
 yes they have content growing and that is now 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.370
 already happened and now more after the net 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.989
 speed and yes that's something 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.250
 whatever I think is cuter short time 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.250
 still nice restaurants lamp 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.600
 ajax lost with symbiont and christian 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.190
 Paul will be two experienced forces of the 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.070
 farmer wants that to be taken care of by 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.010
 players from this group and that is one 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.220
 message that also arrives at class 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.290
 yes a bit yes i have now anyway 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.760
 experienced an entire season and 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.620
 I'm right with some guys that is 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.019
 quite a lot because so many new boys 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.890
 so yes I certainly do not walk for it 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.790
 gone to help yes and to get that extra 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.010
 take responsibility 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.269
 how are you then how are you going to do that yes 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.810
 how are you going to just tell and 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.700
 it should not suddenly become a big mag 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.340
 have an old-time 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.350
 no that just had of course and yes what 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.390
 I am not exaggerating but just well 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.220
 take a little more responsibility 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.450
 Just now it even though you sometimes younger 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.180
 players just look at that which you 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.530
 bit at hand 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.030
 take my hand is a big word but 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.080
 try giving the directions as 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.820
 you see things 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.470
 yes that but also happened and then 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.360
 I first joined it 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.040
 yes that is different from a childhood and 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.459
 Sure it was tough again with help and me 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.690
 think that because several boys do that 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.510
 I think especially the group that the longer 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.769
 it is sitting that you can by a group 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.060
 people 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.470
 what purpose do you have more of yourself 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.580
 asked this season what more do you want 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.730
 get to know players last year 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.700
 yes again becoming champion yes and jamie 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.320
 Sleek overcomes is also late 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.820
 what should we do if you are still 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.500
 want to play better which steps do you need 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.420
 then make it 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.820
 yes i want a little more racist liver 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:08.230
 and yes still wants to become stronger and yes 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.230
 just important
