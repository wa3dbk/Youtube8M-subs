00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
now we're back to factory defaults

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.570 
now we're back to factory defaults
thanks<00:02:01.540> there's<00:02:01.840> our<00:02:01.960> laser<00:02:02.230> if<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.220> can<00:02:03.370> see

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
thanks there's our laser if you can see

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.910 
thanks there's our laser if you can see
it<00:02:04.680> press<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.710> yellow<00:02:05.980> button<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.640> goes<00:02:06.820> away

it press the yellow button so goes away

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.490 
it press the yellow button so goes away
and<00:02:08.920> these<00:02:09.220> are<00:02:09.369> ten<00:02:09.550> digit<00:02:09.910> barcodes<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.990> for

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
and these are ten digit barcodes and for

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.590 
and these are ten digit barcodes and for
example<00:02:11.800> now<00:02:12.220> there<00:02:12.370> were<00:02:12.490> defaults<00:02:13.120> this<00:02:13.480> is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
example now there were defaults this is

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.330 
example now there were defaults this is
a<00:02:13.690> programmed<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.560> should<00:02:14.800> not<00:02:14.950> be<00:02:14.980> able<00:02:15.160> to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
a programmed I should not be able to

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.620 
a programmed I should not be able to
scan<00:02:15.490> these<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:18.310> cannot<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.670> we<00:02:22.420> have<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
scan these and I cannot so we have to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.140 
scan these and I cannot so we have to
program<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:23.940> way<00:02:24.940> we<00:02:25.090> do<00:02:25.210> that<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.680> start<00:02:27.150> on

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
program this way we do that you start on

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.730 
program this way we do that you start on
the<00:02:28.270> second<00:02:28.660> sheet<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.320> you're<00:02:29.410> going<00:02:29.590> to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
the second sheet and you're going to

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.030 
the second sheet and you're going to
scan<00:02:30.300> top<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.510> bottom<00:02:31.900> left<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.380> right<00:02:32.470> this

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
scan top the bottom left to right this

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.060 
scan top the bottom left to right this
is<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:33.250> column<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.030> one<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:35.530> one<00:02:35.830> this

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
is this column in this one this one this

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.920 
is this column in this one this one this
one<00:02:36.130> this<00:02:36.790> one<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.810> one<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:39.220> then<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.460> last

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
one this one this one and then the last

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.840 
one this one this one and then the last
STP<00:02:40.930> barcode<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:44.560> most<00:02:44.770> important<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.580> this

thing<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.380> do<00:02:50.530> let's<00:02:51.190> go<00:02:51.340> back<00:02:51.370> scan<00:02:52.030> the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
thing is to do let's go back scan the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.470 
thing is to do let's go back scan the
factory<00:02:52.540> defaults<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.170> start<00:02:53.410> over<00:02:54.210> so<00:02:55.210> what

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
factory defaults and start over so what

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.770 
factory defaults and start over so what
we'll<00:02:55.600> do<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.930> we'll<00:02:57.090> scan<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.630> heard

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
multiple beeps that's that's a good

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.830 
multiple beeps that's that's a good
sound<00:03:05.760> that's<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.940> good<00:03:07.090> sound<00:03:07.300> that<00:03:07.540> quick

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
high pitch that's good that was good

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.490 
high pitch that's good that was good
that<00:03:15.270> one's<00:03:16.270> good<00:03:16.540> now<00:03:16.810> I'm<00:03:16.989> gonna<00:03:17.140> scan<00:03:17.350> it

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
that one's good now I'm gonna scan it

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.620 
that one's good now I'm gonna scan it
again<00:03:17.590> just<00:03:18.070> a<00:03:18.160> second<00:03:18.970> here<00:03:19.090> what<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.239> bad<00:03:19.420> one

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
again just a second here what a bad one

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.560 
again just a second here what a bad one
sounds<00:03:19.989> like<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.930> long<00:03:24.239> slow<00:03:25.239> pitch

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
sounds like that that long slow pitch

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.229 
sounds like that that long slow pitch
one<00:03:26.130> it's<00:03:27.130> not<00:03:27.250> good<00:03:27.550> so<00:03:27.760> if<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:27.910> hear<00:03:28.060> that

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
one it's not good so if you hear that

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.130 
one it's not good so if you hear that
the<00:03:28.540> easiest<00:03:28.750> thing<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:28.989> do<00:03:29.230> just<00:03:29.500> start<00:03:29.709> over

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
the easiest thing to do just start over

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:39.240 
the easiest thing to do just start over
there<00:03:32.140> get<00:03:32.410> over<00:03:32.440> backache<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:38.130> scanned<00:03:39.130> the

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
there get over backache I scanned the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.170 
there get over backache I scanned the
zero<00:03:39.459> twice<00:03:39.790> this<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:40.810> messed<00:03:41.020> it<00:03:41.140> up<00:03:42.150> set<00:03:43.150> it

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
zero twice this I messed it up set it

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.160 
zero twice this I messed it up set it
back<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.390> default<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.110> start<00:03:44.350> over<00:03:44.590> here<00:03:46.170> what

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
back to default so start over here what

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.949 
back to default so start over here what
you<00:03:47.320> can<00:03:47.350> do<00:03:48.060> when<00:03:49.060> you're<00:03:49.209> scanning<00:03:49.450> these<00:03:49.720> if

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
you can do when you're scanning these if

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.199 
you can do when you're scanning these if
you<00:03:50.050> have<00:03:50.140> troubles<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.760> can<00:03:51.910> move<00:03:52.060> the

you have troubles you can move the

00:03:52.209 --> 00:04:04.699 
you have troubles you can move the
scanner<00:03:52.510> in<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.020> out<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:55.660> left<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.590> right

that's what's used work with a Bluetooth
device<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:53.770> really<00:04:54.009> scan<00:04:54.280> this<00:04:54.460> whenever<00:04:54.789> you

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
device you really scan this whenever you

to<00:04:56.530> scan<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:57.509> now<00:04:58.509> we're<00:04:58.720> done

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
to scan it now we're done

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.920 
to scan it now we're done
so<00:05:01.479> now<00:05:02.310> pull<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.340> battery<00:05:03.729> out<00:05:03.930> without

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
so now pull the battery out without

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.810 
so now pull the battery out without
pressing<00:05:05.470> any<00:05:05.560> of<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.740> buttons<00:05:05.949> we'll<00:05:06.699> do

pressing any of the buttons we'll do
this<00:05:06.909> twice<00:05:12.930> there's<00:05:13.930> our<00:05:14.110> beep<00:05:16.800> now<00:05:18.360> after

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
this twice there's our beep now after

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.909 
this twice there's our beep now after
this<00:05:19.479> is<00:05:19.659> done<00:05:19.690> I<00:05:20.169> should<00:05:20.440> be<00:05:20.530> able<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:20.680> scan

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
this is done I should be able to scan

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.260 
this is done I should be able to scan
this<00:05:21.070> tended<00:05:21.520> bar<00:05:21.669> career<00:05:23.520> so<00:05:24.520> let's<00:05:25.000> see<00:05:25.150> what

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
this tended bar career so let's see what

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.950 
this tended bar career so let's see what
happens<00:05:26.849> like<00:05:27.849> come<00:05:28.090> on<00:05:28.270> press<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.720> yellow

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
happens like come on press the yellow

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.600 
happens like come on press the yellow
button<00:05:29.080> turn<00:05:29.530> off<00:05:31.830> there<00:05:32.830> we<00:05:32.919> go<00:05:33.070> now<00:05:33.250> I<00:05:33.280> can

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
button turn off there we go now I can

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.800 
button turn off there we go now I can
scan<00:05:34.050> those<00:05:35.050> vol<00:05:35.409> beats<00:05:35.800> are<00:05:36.759> not<00:05:37.030> good<00:05:37.330> but

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
scan those vol beats are not good but

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.060 
scan those vol beats are not good but
they're<00:05:37.990> not<00:05:38.020> good<00:05:38.380> for<00:05:38.560> a<00:05:38.620> different<00:05:38.919> reason

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
they're not good for a different reason

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.550 
they're not good for a different reason
because<00:05:39.970> right<00:05:40.479> now<00:05:40.630> we're<00:05:40.840> not<00:05:40.990> connected<00:05:41.530> to
