work<00:01:38.000> on<00:01:38.210> this<00:01:38.390> figure<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.840> lot<00:01:39.140> cleaner<00:01:39.560> in

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
work on this figure is a lot cleaner in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.160 
work on this figure is a lot cleaner in
my<00:01:39.920> opinion<00:01:40.400> I<00:01:40.520> think<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.180> yellow<00:01:41.360> over<00:01:41.870> brown

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
my opinion I think the yellow over brown

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.770 
my opinion I think the yellow over brown
on<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:42.530> came<00:01:42.830> out<00:01:43.010> very<00:01:43.400> nice<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:44.060> this<00:01:44.570> is

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
on this came out very nice and this is

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.350 
on this came out very nice and this is
the<00:01:45.110> hyperion<00:01:45.800> body<00:01:46.280> mold<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:46.820> we<00:01:46.940> have<00:01:47.090> seen

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
the hyperion body mold so we have seen

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.380 
the hyperion body mold so we have seen
this<00:01:47.570> very<00:01:48.380> very<00:01:48.800> huge<00:01:49.250> muscular<00:01:49.640> body<00:01:50.150> mold

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
this very very huge muscular body mold

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.180 
this very very huge muscular body mold
used<00:01:50.720> before<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.320> as<00:01:51.440> I<00:01:51.590> complement<00:01:52.100> the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
used before and as I complement the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.920 
used before and as I complement the
paint<00:01:52.400> we<00:01:52.520> do<00:01:52.670> have<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:53.060> weird<00:01:53.330> stuff<00:01:53.659> is

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
paint we do have that weird stuff is

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.690 
paint we do have that weird stuff is
going<00:01:54.200> on<00:01:54.290> over<00:01:54.440> there<00:01:54.680> but<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.400> know<00:01:55.670> the

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
going on over there but you know the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.760 
going on over there but you know the
line<00:01:55.940> work<00:01:56.120> overall<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.570> think<00:01:56.750> is<00:01:57.049> very<00:01:57.260> clean

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
line work overall I think is very clean

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.980 
line work overall I think is very clean
like<00:01:58.280> right<00:01:58.460> there<00:01:58.640> on<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.850> arm<00:01:59.120> and<00:01:59.510> then<00:01:59.960> the

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
like right there on the arm and then the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.170

here<00:02:04.520> it's<00:02:04.640> like<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.850> could<00:02:05.000> see<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.299> bones

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
here it's like you could see the bones

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.660 
here it's like you could see the bones
inside<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.380> hand<00:02:06.620> or<00:02:06.799> something<00:02:07.040> I<00:02:07.370> think

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
inside the hand or something I think

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.639 
inside the hand or something I think
that's<00:02:07.850> very<00:02:07.940> cool<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:09.200> can<00:02:09.259> see<00:02:09.500> the

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
that's very cool and you can see the

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.080 
that's very cool and you can see the
stretch<00:02:09.920> marks<00:02:10.280> from<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.549> suit<00:02:10.849> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
stretch marks from the suit the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.300 
stretch marks from the suit the
fingernails<00:02:11.659> look<00:02:11.930> great<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.530> lot<00:02:12.620> detail<00:02:13.129> in

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
fingernails look great a lot detail in

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.009 
fingernails look great a lot detail in
here<00:02:13.519> I<00:02:13.670> really<00:02:13.909> like<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.269> of<00:02:14.599> course<00:02:14.720> the

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
here I really like this of course the

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.600 
here I really like this of course the
ABS<00:02:15.200> are<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.590> same<00:02:15.769> as<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.010> we've<00:02:16.190> seen<00:02:16.489> on

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
ABS are the same as that we've seen on

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.039 
ABS are the same as that we've seen on
the<00:02:16.700> hyperion<00:02:17.180> figure<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.659> then<00:02:17.750> he's<00:02:17.870> got

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
the hyperion figure and then he's got

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.930 
the hyperion figure and then he's got
this<00:02:18.200> dick<00:02:18.590> arrow<00:02:18.860> going<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:19.370> over<00:02:19.610> here<00:02:19.790> which

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
this dick arrow going on over here which

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.220 
this dick arrow going on over here which
is<00:02:19.970> really<00:02:20.420> weird<00:02:20.599> I<00:02:20.840> don't<00:02:20.989> know<00:02:21.049> what<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
is really weird I don't know what the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.990 
is really weird I don't know what the
deal<00:02:21.379> with<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.650> is<00:02:21.830> I'm<00:02:22.220> not<00:02:22.400> too<00:02:22.730> familiar

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
deal with that is I'm not too familiar

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.630 
deal with that is I'm not too familiar
with<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:24.140> design<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.950> be<00:02:25.040> honest<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:25.549> not

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
with this design to be honest it's not

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.610 
with this design to be honest it's not
my<00:02:26.060> favorite<00:02:26.510> Sabretooth<00:02:26.989> costume

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
especially with that dick arrow over

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.330

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
very nice I do like the darker tone of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.390 
very nice I do like the darker tone of
this<00:02:35.810> figure<00:02:36.230> it's<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.530> pretty<00:02:36.709> cool<00:02:36.920> look<00:02:37.160> but

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
this figure it's a pretty cool look but

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.290 
this figure it's a pretty cool look but
just<00:02:37.550> still<00:02:38.480> not<00:02:38.870> my

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.940 
yeah and then you can see the holes
right<00:02:45.300> there<00:02:45.480> for<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.900> Hyperion<00:02:46.410> cape<00:02:46.710> and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
right there for the Hyperion cape and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.380 
right there for the Hyperion cape and
the<00:02:47.010> spikes<00:02:47.340> look<00:02:47.550> very<00:02:47.760> clean<00:02:47.940> on<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.180> back

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390

the spikes look very clean on the back
as<00:02:48.630> well<00:02:48.660> there's<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.470> back<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.770> head<00:02:49.920> so

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
as well there's the back of the head so

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.650 
as well there's the back of the head so
our<00:02:50.220> articulation<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.000> same<00:02:51.210> exact<00:02:51.510> thing

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
our articulation is the same exact thing

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.270 
our articulation is the same exact thing
that<00:02:51.690> we<00:02:51.900> see<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.290> Hyperion<00:02:52.440> figure<00:02:53.100> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
that we see in the Hyperion figure the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.400 
that we see in the Hyperion figure the
head<00:02:53.490> moves<00:02:53.730> up<00:02:53.940> pretty<00:02:54.330> well<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.810> like<00:02:55.200> that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
from the Wolverine legends line and I

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.210 
from the Wolverine legends line and I
think<00:03:45.120> they<00:03:45.540> work<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.989> scale<00:03:46.380> perfectly

think they work and scale perfectly
together<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.820> guess<00:03:47.970> will<00:03:48.209> ring<00:03:48.390> be<00:03:48.870> just<00:03:49.230> tiny

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
together I guess will ring be just tiny

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.979 
together I guess will ring be just tiny
bit<00:03:49.920> shorter<00:03:50.220> but<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.640> still<00:03:51.420> really<00:03:51.660> like<00:03:51.840> this
