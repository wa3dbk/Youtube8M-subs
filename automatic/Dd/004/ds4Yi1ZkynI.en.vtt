your<00:02:07.600> brushes<00:02:07.960> so<00:02:08.590> what<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:08.860> recommend<00:02:08.950> is

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
your brushes so what I recommend is

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.520 
your brushes so what I recommend is
washing<00:02:10.090> them<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:10.300> warm<00:02:10.630> soapy<00:02:10.929> water<00:02:11.110> and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
washing them in warm soapy water and

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.680 
washing them in warm soapy water and
just<00:02:12.100> squeezing<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.819> hairs<00:02:13.060> out<00:02:13.270> just<00:02:13.540> like

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
just squeezing the hairs out just like

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.380 
just squeezing the hairs out just like
this<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.140> laying<00:02:15.069> them<00:02:15.190> flat<00:02:15.310> unlike<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> towel

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
this and laying them flat unlike a towel

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.970 
this and laying them flat unlike a towel
with<00:02:16.420> something<00:02:16.990> that<00:02:17.080> will<00:02:17.230> absorb<00:02:17.319> water

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
with something that will absorb water

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.890 
with something that will absorb water
leave<00:02:18.459> them<00:02:18.640> overnight<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.330> they'll<00:02:19.540> stay

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
leave them overnight and they'll stay

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.290 
leave them overnight and they'll stay
perfectly<00:02:20.650> shaped<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.610> these<00:02:21.790> are<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.030> five

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
perfectly shaped so these are the five

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.940 
perfectly shaped so these are the five
brushes<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.900> completely<00:02:23.530> rely<00:02:23.800> on

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
brushes that I completely rely on

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.310

absolutely<00:02:24.730> recommend<00:02:25.209> they<00:02:25.750> can<00:02:25.930> complete

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320

any<00:02:26.500> look
