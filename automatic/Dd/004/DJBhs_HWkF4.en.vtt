00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
hair for restyling so basically you

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.530 
hair for restyling so basically you
could<00:03:37.890> spray<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.610> your<00:03:38.760> dry<00:03:39.030> hair<00:03:39.270> and

then blow-dry it through it again so

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.300 
then blow-dry it through it again so
that's<00:03:42.960> a<00:03:43.020> great<00:03:43.200> way<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.380> just<00:03:43.770> restyle<00:03:44.250> your

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
again and 21 adds shine I wouldn't say

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.380 
again and 21 adds shine I wouldn't say
that<00:03:49.500> this<00:03:49.770> is<00:03:49.980> like<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.400> shine<00:03:50.760> spray<00:03:51.150> that's

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
that this is like a shine spray that's

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.120 
that this is like a shine spray that's
going<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.570> add<00:03:51.690> tons<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:52.260> tons<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.530> shine<00:03:52.770> and

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
going to add tons and tons of shine and

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.210 
going to add tons and tons of shine and
I<00:03:53.490> would<00:03:53.700> say<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> lot<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.450> those<00:03:55.220> benefits

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
I would say that a lot of those benefits

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.300 
I would say that a lot of those benefits
are<00:03:56.670> kind<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.570> same<00:03:57.960> you<00:03:58.380> know<00:03:58.410> like<00:03:59.040> two

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
are kind of the same you know like two

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.560 
are kind of the same you know like two
and<00:03:59.490> three<00:03:59.640> are<00:03:59.760> kind<00:03:59.910> of<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.120> same<00:04:00.330> in<00:04:00.360> this

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
and three are kind of the same in this

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.870 
and three are kind of the same in this
one<00:04:00.750> are<00:04:00.840> kind<00:04:00.990> of<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.140> same<00:04:01.260> but<00:04:01.320> overall<00:04:01.880> the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
one are kind of the same but overall the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.190 
one are kind of the same but overall the
point<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.270> it's<00:04:03.480> going<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.690> give<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> lot<00:04:04.050> of

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
point is it's going to give a lot of

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.080 
point is it's going to give a lot of
benefits<00:04:04.590> first<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.430> all<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.580> just<00:04:05.700> bought<00:04:06.060> a

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
benefits first of all I just bought a

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.150 
benefits first of all I just bought a
trial<00:04:06.420> sized<00:04:06.720> sample<00:04:07.380> of<00:04:07.500> this<00:04:07.710> because<00:04:08.070> I

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
trial sized sample of this because I

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.730 
trial sized sample of this because I
didn't<00:04:08.400> want<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.840> get<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.900> huge<00:04:10.200> bottle<00:04:10.590> of<00:04:10.650> it

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
didn't want to get a huge bottle of it

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.520 
didn't want to get a huge bottle of it
if<00:04:10.830> I<00:04:10.950> didn't<00:04:11.220> really<00:04:11.400> like<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:13.260> first

thing<00:04:13.740> I<00:04:13.830> noticed<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.340> smell<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.060> every

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
thing I noticed is the smell and every

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.090 
thing I noticed is the smell and every
time<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.750> spray<00:04:16.170> this<00:04:16.320> on<00:04:16.470> my<00:04:16.530> clients<00:04:16.920> it's

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
this product I feel like I get a lot of

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.370 
this product I feel like I get a lot of
benefits<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.720> would<00:04:31.870> probably<00:04:32.140> get<00:04:32.260> from

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
benefits that I would probably get from

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.900 
benefits that I would probably get from
other<00:04:32.560> products<00:04:32.980> all<00:04:33.160> combined<00:04:33.550> into<00:04:33.700> one

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
other products all combined into one

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.360 
other products all combined into one
product<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.480> felt<00:04:35.350> like<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.650> bottle<00:04:35.980> this<00:04:36.160> size

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
product I felt like the bottle this size

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.160 
product I felt like the bottle this size
lasts<00:04:36.730> a<00:04:36.910> couple<00:04:37.270> of<00:04:37.420> weeks<00:04:37.660> so<00:04:37.960> if<00:04:38.020> you're

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
lasts a couple of weeks so if you're

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.330 
lasts a couple of weeks so if you're

wanting to try it I think that's long

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.680 
wanting to try it I think that's long
enough<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.730> actually<00:04:39.880> get<00:04:40.120> a<00:04:40.180> feel<00:04:40.390> for<00:04:40.420> the

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
enough to actually get a feel for the

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.620 
but you know you can concentrate on
where<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:51.610> want<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.060> like<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.450> could<00:04:52.570> just

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
where you want it so like you could just

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.230 
where you want it so like you could just
spray<00:04:53.320> it<00:04:53.350> towards<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.860> ends<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.790> can<00:04:54.940> spray

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
spray it towards the ends you can spray

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.180 
spray it towards the ends you can spray
it<00:04:55.270> all<00:04:55.480> over<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:55.930> tend<00:04:56.200> to<00:04:56.290> not<00:04:56.470> spray<00:04:57.040> it<00:04:57.100> on

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
it all over I tend to not spray it on

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.340 
it all over I tend to not spray it on
the<00:04:57.280> roots<00:04:57.490> as<00:04:57.790> much<00:04:58.390> just<00:04:58.720> because<00:04:58.900> I<00:04:59.110> don't

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
the roots as much just because I don't

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.550 
the roots as much just because I don't
heat<00:04:59.710> style<00:05:00.040> my<00:05:00.220> roots<00:05:00.460> that<00:05:00.700> often<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.600> I

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
heat style my roots that often and I

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.440 
heat style my roots that often and I
don't<00:05:02.710> get<00:05:03.280> as<00:05:03.400> much<00:05:03.550> of<00:05:03.610> those<00:05:03.850> problems<00:05:04.270> up

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
don't get as much of those problems up

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.990 
don't get as much of those problems up
in<00:05:04.570> my<00:05:04.690> root<00:05:04.840> area<00:05:05.250> but<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.280> really<00:05:06.610> liked<00:05:06.790> it<00:05:06.940> I

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
in my root area but I really liked it I

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.610 
in my root area but I really liked it I
feel<00:05:07.240> like<00:05:07.270> it's<00:05:07.570> made<00:05:07.720> my<00:05:07.810> hair<00:05:08.020> soft<00:05:08.320> and

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620
