we can call this shade so that if you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.090 
we can call this shade so that if you
need<00:02:33.329> plants<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.870> actually<00:02:33.930> need<00:02:34.410> shading

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
need plants that actually need shading

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.710 
need plants that actually need shading
during<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.730> day<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:39.329> product

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
during the day then this is the product

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.900 
during the day then this is the product
let's<00:02:39.840> have<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.049> look<00:02:40.230> at<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.680> that's<00:02:41.609> it

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
let's have a look at it and that's it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.650 
let's have a look at it and that's it
it's<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.930> finer<00:02:43.260> mesh<00:02:43.620> as<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.150> see<00:02:45.359> it's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
it's a finer mesh as you can see it's

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.990 
it's a finer mesh as you can see it's
quite<00:02:45.930> shading<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:46.829> if<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.069> put<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.400> over<00:02:47.579> like

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
quite shading but if we put it over like

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.960 
quite shading but if we put it over like
so<00:02:49.879> then<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:52.170> will<00:02:52.530> protect<00:02:53.040> from<00:02:53.220> some<00:02:53.760> but

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
so then that will protect from some but

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.880 
so then that will protect from some but
the<00:02:54.090> other<00:02:54.269> advantage

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the other advantage

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.730 
the other advantage
is<00:02:56.010> all<00:02:56.610> moisture<00:02:57.270> rain<00:02:57.510> will<00:02:58.170> still<00:02:58.500> go

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
is all moisture rain will still go

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.280 
is all moisture rain will still go
through<00:02:59.069> so<00:02:59.460> you<00:02:59.520> will<00:02:59.880> still<00:03:00.300> get<00:03:00.569> your

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
through so you will still get your

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.520 
through so you will still get your
plants<00:03:01.740> watered<00:03:02.250> now<00:03:02.730> finally<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.990> last<00:03:04.020> one

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
plants watered now finally the last one

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.740 
plants watered now finally the last one
which<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.860> really<00:03:05.400> like<00:03:05.610> which<00:03:05.880> extends<00:03:06.600> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
which I really like which extends the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.920 
which I really like which extends the
whole<00:03:06.780> growing<00:03:07.410> season<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:09.360> plastic

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
whole growing season is the plastic

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.900 
whole growing season is the plastic
covering<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:10.709> let's<00:03:10.890> have<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.040> look<00:03:11.220> at<00:03:11.370> that

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.090 

position<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.480> cover<00:03:18.720> over<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.170> hoops<00:03:19.470> making

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
position the cover over the hoops making

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.720 
position the cover over the hoops making
sure<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.030> evenly<00:03:21.810> placed<00:03:22.280> fix<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.489> cover

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
sure this is evenly placed fix the cover

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.390 
sure this is evenly placed fix the cover
using<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.480> battens<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.110> mail<00:03:25.260> supplied<00:03:25.800> we

using the battens and mail supplied we

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.360 
using the battens and mail supplied we
recommend<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.080> sandwich<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.130> cover

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
recommend that you sandwich the cover

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:40.940 
recommend that you sandwich the cover
between<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.300> timber<00:03:30.660> road<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.140> batter

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.850 

apply<00:03:41.950> tape<00:03:42.280> over<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.150> end<00:03:43.420> of<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.959> tux<00:03:44.410> to

make it easier to pull tight and then

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.110 
make it easier to pull tight and then
nailed<00:03:58.690> through<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.739> polythene<00:04:00.099> and<00:04:00.519> laughs
