00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello my dear 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.490
 with you the teacher of physical and technical 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.000
 Institute from Moscow all eduardovich 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:18.029
 expert kia and mr today wanted 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.769
 tell how to solve one of the first 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:26.369
 tasks on gia 9 class arrange numbers 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.670
 descending order will be overgrown here 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.340
 If here is the problem with physics, especially with 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.930
 math this call from my contacts 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.800
 by skype 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.629
 better first because of the parents on the phone 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.809
 call because counseling lessons 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.920
 paid if the question is specifically what is it 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.129
 fast and so 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.059
 cheap or write to mail 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.410
 Alison Dog Marina. no living in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.879
 Marina in the south-east of Moscow in 5 minutes 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:04.769
 walk from metro mariino 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:08.250
 let's look at the puzzle stop 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.549
 video for 5 minutes and think for yourself very 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.530
 it is important that you decide to make your own 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.049
 mistakes because you can only learn 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.880
 on my mistakes 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.200
 if you look at other people's decisions 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.409
 other people's mistakes 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.590
 yourself never learn to be remembered 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.600
 best when you decide 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.640
 therefore it is best if you decide 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.329
 and then when something does not work out 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.329
 questions call or write on skype 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:49.159
 watch show how to solve more here 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.720
 write numbers 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.650
 first thing to look at 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.729
 denominator 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:02.340
 what is below these are the bottom numbers 36 17 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:05.040
 6 bad when they are different good when 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.429
 they are the same or at least similar to but 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.590
 case, they are similar and because they all 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.280
 first divided by three 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:18.030
 Mathematicians say multiples of the three most 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.069
 the main thing is that they have a common multiple 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.070
 there is a number which is divided into all these 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.800
 denominator or as mathematicians say 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.540
 there is a good least common 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.120
 denominator namely 36 because 36 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.920
 divided into 18 of our sinatra 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.290
 that is , there is such a common denominator 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.200
 least common multiple least 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.450
 a common denominator of 36 is missing here 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.760
 12 because if 3 multiply 12 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.840
 get 36 on what this 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.870
 multiply the first fraction of them for us 3 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:03.680
 multiply by 12 just 36 left 2 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.680
 multiply by 12 will be 24 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.160
 pause for a few minutes continue 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.100
 yourself then check the sacred done 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.320
 will not be much more useful than not 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.920
 the following look how i do it 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:25.100
 and then the legs, and they themselves do not repeat it 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:29.160
 You can pause in a boring twix 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:33.989
 but listen means and the six need 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:39.989
 multiply by 6 everything turned out 36 here 5 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:43.590
 multiply by 6 it turns out 3018 us 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:49.270
 To multiply by 2, what happened is 36 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:53.030
 one son pressing on 2 turns 22 36 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.069
 here it is not necessary to multiply 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.959
 write multiply by 1 and actually 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.800
 it's all bullshit because you just 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:07.240
 rewrite 23 as it is, we have turned 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.240
 such fractions with a common denominator of 6 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.010
 the assignment was arranged in order 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.690
 descending here we must be completely different 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.760
 man so as not to figure out what 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.799
 you must first write the largest 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.870
 number 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.470
 then smaller less finally the most 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.750
 little here in descending order 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:31.310
 this number was the largest five 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.800
 sixths here it is because it gave 33 sixths 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.400
 tach we write five sixths 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:42.950
 then following him 24 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.950
 ie two-thirds then following on 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:50.750
 23000 say with a decrease of 3 grabs 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:55.010
 rewrite the smallest of them was 29 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:59.890
 years 6 grade 117 fear 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:03.669
 of course there is a tricky way 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:07.280
 we are calculating it all divided into 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:10.910
 calculator 2 divided by 3 enroll 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.070
 5 or on the neck and write and so on as 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.330
 usually make sly boys principle 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:21.090
 sometimes itâ€™s right to solve it too 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.010
 can not write instead of waiting solutions 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.100
 as ports counted on the calculator 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.440
 it turned out well for me on a calculator 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.860
 This is approximately and about and decision 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.979
 but few people care because you 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.979
 asks to demonstrate their 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:41.449
 logical ability and not knowledge 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.850
 buttons on the calculator and merge questions 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:49.020
 write me on skype 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:52.560
 solution 1 let parents call by 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.560
 phone twitter in principle 21 if 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.070
 problem with physics even with english
