good side so I was a bit nervous going
into<00:04:54.890> it<00:04:55.130> but<00:04:55.760> my<00:04:56.480> mind<00:04:56.660> subota<00:04:57.080> comes<00:04:57.590> up

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
into it but my mind subota comes up

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.220 
into it but my mind subota comes up
rises<00:04:58.280> for<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.580> header<00:04:58.760> and<00:04:59.060> manages<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.780> take

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
rises for the header and manages to take

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.930 
rises for the header and manages to take
the<00:05:00.350> one-goal<00:05:00.740> lead<00:05:00.800> which<00:05:01.160> is<00:05:01.310> really

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
the one-goal lead which is really

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.430 
the one-goal lead which is really
important<00:05:02.480> i<00:05:02.570> noticed<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:03.020> if<00:05:03.110> i<00:05:03.230> get<00:05:03.410> a

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
important i noticed that if i get a

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.930 
important i noticed that if i get a
one-goal<00:05:03.800> lead<00:05:03.860> i<00:05:04.040> tend<00:05:04.340> to<00:05:04.430> go<00:05:04.580> on<00:05:04.730> and

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
one-goal lead i tend to go on and

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.360 
one-goal lead i tend to go on and
usually<00:05:05.420> win<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.690> game<00:05:06.070> i'm<00:05:07.070> not<00:05:07.190> too<00:05:07.340> sure

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
usually win the game i'm not too sure

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.390 
usually win the game i'm not too sure
why<00:05:08.150> that<00:05:08.180> is<00:05:08.540> because<00:05:08.840> I'm<00:05:09.800> all<00:05:09.950> right<00:05:10.130> at

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
why that is because I'm all right at

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.490 
why that is because I'm all right at

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
always I'd say above 85 maybe even

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.270 
always I'd say above 85 maybe even
sometimes<00:06:08.690> 80<00:06:09.169> because<00:06:09.590> the<00:06:09.770> load<00:06:09.890> like<00:06:10.100> I've

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
sometimes 80 because the load like I've

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.090 
sometimes 80 because the load like I've
said<00:06:10.400> previously<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:11.390> lower<00:06:11.570> you<00:06:11.780> go<00:06:11.810> the

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
said previously the lower you go the

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.740 
said previously the lower you go the
higher<00:06:13.100> risk<00:06:13.580> of<00:06:13.730> them<00:06:13.940> being<00:06:13.970> injured<00:06:14.540> and

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
higher risk of them being injured and

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.600
