00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
to do that multiplier so we've taken the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.240 
to do that multiplier so we've taken the
best<00:03:20.330> parts<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.050> vehicle<00:03:21.410> combat<00:03:21.620> from

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
with a friend run through a level that's

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.530 
with a friend run through a level that's
maybe<00:03:37.530> changed<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.130> little<00:03:38.280> bit<00:03:38.520> from<00:03:39.060> things

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
that they've seen in the game and then

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.100 
that they've seen in the game and then
we<00:03:41.819> roll<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.030> little<00:03:42.360> bit<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.540> fiction<00:03:42.870> into
