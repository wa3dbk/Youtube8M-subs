that<00:00:33.239> stork<00:00:33.510> might<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.530> stork<00:00:34.829> has<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
that stork might have the stork has a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.889 
that stork might have the stork has a
pretty<00:00:35.280> sizable<00:00:35.700> force<00:00:35.910> out<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> outside<00:00:36.780> of

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
pretty sizable force out the outside of

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.299 
pretty sizable force out the outside of
his<00:00:36.960> natural<00:00:37.200> now<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:38.010> he's<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.250> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
his natural now so I think he's going to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.130 
his natural now so I think he's going to
be<00:00:38.399> okay<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.760> far<00:00:38.820> as<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.090> goes<00:00:39.149> Scott<00:00:39.960> hi

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
be okay as far as that goes Scott hi

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
be okay as far as that goes Scott hi
laying<00:00:40.739> mines<00:00:41.040> at<00:00:41.340> prospective<00:00:41.910> basis<00:00:42.300> from

laying mines at prospective basis from
stork<00:00:43.550> but<00:00:44.550> now<00:00:44.670> stork<00:00:45.090> he<00:00:45.750> has<00:00:45.989> gotten<00:00:46.469> his

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
stork but now stork he has gotten his

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.200 
stork but now stork he has gotten his
probe<00:00:47.039> saturation<00:00:47.610> back<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.120> he's

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
probe saturation back up and he's

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
probe saturation back up and he's
running<00:00:48.450> from<00:00:48.539> two<00:00:48.719> bases<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.590> he's<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
running from two bases so he's going to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.410 
running from two bases so he's going to
be<00:00:50.010> able<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.219> support<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.730> these<00:00:50.969> new<00:00:51.149> gateway

a lot more factories going so if he does

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.650 
a lot more factories going so if he does
scout<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.860> he's<00:03:20.130> going<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.640> be<00:03:21.270> in<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.450> great

scout this he's going to be in a great

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.420 
scout this he's going to be in a great

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.670 
punk Elias and he already has his armory
ready<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.250> go<00:03:26.570> but<00:03:27.570> it's<00:03:27.750> all<00:03:27.960> about<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.440> Scout

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
ready to go but it's all about the Scout

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.430 
ready to go but it's all about the Scout
will<00:03:29.070> he<00:03:29.340> Scout<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:30.420> carrier's<00:03:30.990> I<00:03:31.020> mean<00:03:31.350> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
will he Scout the carrier's I mean the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.040 
will he Scout the carrier's I mean the
main<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.190> large<00:03:32.520> skyhigh<00:03:33.450> has<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.690> lot<00:03:34.020> of

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
main is so large skyhigh has a lot of

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.110 
main is so large skyhigh has a lot of
ground<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.470> cover<00:03:34.530> with<00:03:34.920> his<00:03:35.070> scans<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:36.000> he

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
ground to cover with his scans so he

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.900 
ground to cover with his scans so he
probably<00:03:36.420> hasn't<00:03:36.780> scanned<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.440> yet

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
probably hasn't scanned this yet

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.250 
probably hasn't scanned this yet
especially<00:03:38.910> considering<00:03:39.750> we<00:03:39.840> haven't<00:03:39.960> seen

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
especially considering we haven't seen

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
especially considering we haven't seen
many<00:03:40.410> Goliath<00:03:40.950> yet<00:03:41.190> he<00:03:41.280> probably<00:03:41.490> hasn't<00:03:41.970> scan

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
many Goliath yet he probably hasn't scan

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.670 
many Goliath yet he probably hasn't scan
but<00:03:44.280> he<00:03:44.880> might<00:03:45.060> scan<00:03:45.450> soon<00:03:45.810> enough<00:03:46.140> it's<00:03:46.530> going

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
but he might scan soon enough it's going

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.110 
but he might scan soon enough it's going
to<00:03:46.709> be<00:03:46.800> looking<00:03:47.130> around<00:03:47.400> for<00:03:47.670> any<00:03:47.820> kind<00:03:48.000> of

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
to be looking around for any kind of

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.120 
to be looking around for any kind of
extra<00:03:48.510> tech<00:03:48.780> there's<00:03:49.380> only<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.680> couple<00:03:49.709> places

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
extra tech there's only a couple places

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.420 
extra tech there's only a couple places
to<00:03:50.760> scan<00:03:51.240> right<00:03:51.480> now<00:03:51.740> so<00:03:52.740> I<00:03:52.770> think<00:03:52.950> he<00:03:53.190> will

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
to scan right now so I think he will

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.550 
to scan right now so I think he will
catch<00:03:53.730> on<00:03:53.910> eventually<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:55.050> might<00:03:55.320> be<00:03:55.530> a

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
catch on eventually but it might be a

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.890 
catch on eventually but it might be a
little<00:03:55.770> bit<00:03:55.980> too<00:03:56.160> late<00:03:56.400> here<00:03:57.330> comes<00:03:57.570> stork

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
little bit too late here comes stork

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.270 
little bit too late here comes stork
he's<00:03:58.080> breaking<00:03:58.440> into<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.709> main<00:03:58.860> right<00:03:59.100> now

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
he's breaking into the main right now

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.300 
he's breaking into the main right now
big<00:04:00.120> shot<00:04:00.810> at<00:04:01.020> by<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.320> tank<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:01.950> don't<00:04:02.100> think<00:04:02.250> he

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
big shot at by a tank I don't think he

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.610 
big shot at by a tank I don't think he
knew<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:02.670> was<00:04:02.850> there<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.660> took<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.870> little<00:04:04.470> bit

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
knew that was there so took a little bit

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.530 
knew that was there so took a little bit
of<00:04:04.680> unnecessary<00:04:04.980> damage<00:04:05.370> they're<00:04:05.730> all<00:04:05.880> man

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
of unnecessary damage they're all man

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.530 
of unnecessary damage they're all man

man<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.709> Reaper<00:04:10.980> almost<00:04:11.430> went<00:04:11.670> down<00:04:11.850> and

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
man that Reaper almost went down and

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.460 
man that Reaper almost went down and
it's<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.330> low<00:04:12.540> health<00:04:12.780> anyway<00:04:13.110> because<00:04:13.260> of

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
it's in low health anyway because of

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.940 
it's in low health anyway because of
that<00:04:13.590> tank<00:04:13.830> shot<00:04:14.870> but<00:04:15.870> stork<00:04:16.170> has<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.620> back<00:04:16.770> off

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
that tank shot but stork has to back off

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.199 
that tank shot but stork has to back off
yet<00:04:17.190> again<00:04:17.280> he<00:04:17.459> hasn't<00:04:17.700> gotten<00:04:17.850> any<00:04:18.030> good

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
yet again he hasn't gotten any good

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.599 
yet again he hasn't gotten any good
economic<00:04:18.989> harassment<00:04:19.500> done<00:04:19.680> which<00:04:20.460> is

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
economic harassment done which is

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.390 
economic harassment done which is
exactly<00:04:20.760> what<00:04:21.299> sky-high<00:04:21.570> once<00:04:22.200> it's<00:04:22.800> hard<00:04:23.040> to

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
exactly what sky-high once it's hard to

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.280 
exactly what sky-high once it's hard to
her<00:04:23.880> ass<00:04:24.120> on<00:04:24.360> this<00:04:24.479> map<00:04:24.690> anyway

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
her ass on this map anyway

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.660 
her ass on this map anyway
because<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.680> how<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.830> minerals<00:04:26.250> are<00:04:26.370> set<00:04:26.550> up

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
because of how the minerals are set up

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.170 
because of how the minerals are set up
okay<00:04:27.510> sky-high<00:04:27.840> is<00:04:28.080> positioning<00:04:28.710> his<00:04:28.830> troops

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
okay sky-high is positioning his troops

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.790 
okay sky-high is positioning his troops
to<00:04:30.180> defend<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.780> new<00:04:30.990> base<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.410> down<00:04:31.560> as<00:04:31.650> the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
to defend that new base it down as the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.120 
to defend that new base it down as the
eight<00:04:32.040> o'clock<00:04:32.250> position<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.620> think<00:04:34.980> he

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
eight o'clock position and I think he

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.400 
eight o'clock position and I think he
did<00:04:35.370> scan<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.180> carrier's<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.930> think<00:04:37.140> he<00:04:37.200> did

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
did scan the carrier's I think he did

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.190 
did scan the carrier's I think he did
scan<00:04:37.710> those<00:04:37.980> they<00:04:38.850> see<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.210> red<00:04:39.390> splotch<00:04:39.840> on

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
scan those they see the red splotch on

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.590 
scan those they see the red splotch on
his<00:04:40.530> map<00:04:40.980> I'm<00:04:41.940> not<00:04:42.240> sure<00:04:42.300> if<00:04:42.570> he<00:04:42.660> saw<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.340> a

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
his map I'm not sure if he saw the a

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.600 
his map I'm not sure if he saw the a
fleet<00:04:45.600> beacon<00:04:46.050> though<00:04:46.260> I<00:04:46.560> think<00:04:47.100> that<00:04:47.340> was

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
fleet beacon though I think that was

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.340 
fleet beacon though I think that was
great<00:04:47.910> out<00:04:48.120> on<00:04:48.360> this<00:04:48.510> map<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.900> think<00:04:49.050> he<00:04:49.140> saw<00:04:49.290> the

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
great out on this map I think he saw the

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.870 
great out on this map I think he saw the
stargates<00:04:49.980> but<00:04:50.220> he's<00:04:50.310> going<00:04:50.460> to<00:04:50.520> see<00:04:50.700> those

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
stargates but he's going to see those

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.700 
stargates but he's going to see those
carriers<00:04:51.240> soon<00:04:51.480> enough<00:04:51.840> but<00:04:52.380> he<00:04:52.440> doesn't<00:04:52.680> have

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
carriers soon enough but he doesn't have

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.230 
carriers soon enough but he doesn't have
a<00:04:52.830> lot<00:04:52.980> of<00:04:53.010> glass<00:04:53.370> out<00:04:53.640> so<00:04:53.820> I<00:04:53.880> don't<00:04:54.030> think<00:04:54.120> he

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
a lot of glass out so I don't think he

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.970 
a lot of glass out so I don't think he
no<00:04:54.510> I<00:04:54.540> don't<00:04:54.930> think<00:04:55.080> he<00:04:55.140> scouted<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.770> fleet

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
no I don't think he scouted the fleet

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.400 
no I don't think he scouted the fleet
bacon<00:04:56.430> he<00:04:57.390> might<00:04:57.630> have<00:04:57.750> scouted<00:04:58.080> it<00:04:58.140> a<00:04:58.230> little

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
bacon he might have scouted it a little

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.950 
bacon he might have scouted it a little
bit<00:04:58.650> late<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:59.040> see<00:04:59.220> one<00:04:59.610> Goliath<00:05:00.360> in<00:05:00.600> but<00:05:00.840> that

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
bit late to see one Goliath in but that

too soon but now the Goliath or on the
way<00:05:12.720> so<00:05:12.780> i<00:05:12.990> think<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.350> sky<00:05:13.590> high<00:05:13.880> did<00:05:14.880> scan

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
way so i think the sky high did scan

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.100 
way so i think the sky high did scan
that<00:05:15.570> a<00:05:16.250> minute<00:05:17.250> ago<00:05:17.340> or<00:05:17.670> so<00:05:17.940> because<00:05:18.600> now<00:05:18.930> he's

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
that a minute ago or so because now he's

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.200 
that a minute ago or so because now he's
losing<00:05:19.410> all<00:05:19.530> of<00:05:19.560> his<00:05:19.650> troops<00:05:20.070> inside<00:05:20.730> here<00:05:21.180> is

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
losing all of his troops inside here is

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.150 
losing all of his troops inside here is
going<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.570> lose<00:05:21.780> his<00:05:22.170> tanks<00:05:22.680> at<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:22.890> front

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
going to lose his tanks at the front

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.800 
going to lose his tanks at the front
doesn't<00:05:23.580> have<00:05:23.760> any<00:05:23.940> glass<00:05:24.300> here<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:24.660> now<00:05:24.750> the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
doesn't have any glass here and now the

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.990 
doesn't have any glass here and now the
reinforcement<00:05:25.380> Goliath<00:05:25.650> coming<00:05:25.920> in<00:05:26.040> to

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
reinforcement Goliath coming in to

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.810 
reinforcement Goliath coming in to
whittle<00:05:27.540> down<00:05:27.570> the<00:05:27.720> Interceptor<00:05:28.440> count<00:05:28.820> so

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
whittle down the Interceptor count so

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.950 
whittle down the Interceptor count so
storks<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.150> got<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.330> keep<00:05:30.420> his<00:05:30.570> distance<00:05:30.720> a

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
storks you got to keep his distance a

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.540 
storks you got to keep his distance a
little<00:05:31.170> bit<00:05:31.290> longer<00:05:31.440> so<00:05:32.040> he<00:05:32.070> can<00:05:32.220> pick<00:05:32.370> off<00:05:32.520> a

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
little bit longer so he can pick off a

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.030 
little bit longer so he can pick off a
few<00:05:32.700> more<00:05:33.360> tanks<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.290> once<00:05:34.560> he<00:05:34.650> picks<00:05:34.860> off<00:05:35.010> a

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
few more tanks and once he picks off a

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.650 
few more tanks and once he picks off a
few<00:05:35.310> more<00:05:35.430> tanks<00:05:35.730> I<00:05:35.820> think<00:05:36.060> he<00:05:36.120> will<00:05:36.270> come<00:05:36.540> in

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
few more tanks I think he will come in

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.260 
few more tanks I think he will come in

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
carriers at the same time backing off

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.790 
carriers at the same time backing off
though<00:06:00.360> because<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:00.930> doesn't<00:06:01.200> quite<00:06:01.380> have

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
though because it doesn't quite have

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.710 
though because it doesn't quite have
enough<00:06:01.830> cells<00:06:02.460> to<00:06:02.700> really<00:06:03.000> push<00:06:03.210> this<00:06:03.390> front

enough cells to really push this front

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.900 
enough cells to really push this front

so he is backing off and he loses his

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.280 
so he is backing off and he loses his
shuttle<00:06:06.150> to<00:06:06.420> so<00:06:06.630> if<00:06:06.720> Lee<00:06:06.840> has<00:06:07.020> a<00:06:07.050> backup
