00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.830
 in brescia while we also find marco 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.510
 echelon 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.180
 but let's retrace it is a young chef who 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.039
 takes care of eating well is 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.500
 good for those who do celiacs 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.720
 yes exactly I started twelve years ago 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.109
 with a group of children to be wii 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.570
 who came here in a campaign 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.329
 summer and from there I got passionate about 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.820
 this kitchen that is naturally lacking 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.250
 of gluten therefore going to use 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.870
 all the products from the mixture has 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.070
 produced the first naturally gluteal 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.469
 create an entire gastronomic panorama 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.730
 for them these children to make them 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.430
 eat what you invented 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.190
 therefore a bali was initially a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.989
 big problem because it was the beginning is 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.230
 true really in trouble about what 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.180
 go use or not but then with the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.400
 stubbornness that I found myself and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.790
 also the desire to discover research 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.770
 I saw what 's in the kitchen in ours 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.890
 a good 60 70 percent refrigerator that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.030
 first naturally gluten therefore it is 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.259
 was much simpler than it was 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.909
 I thought 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.189
 so basically every 12 years you have 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.450
 seen a little from the beginning when you are 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.640
 started working for celiac disease 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.159
 to get to a number today 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.520
 remarkable of products yes I have seen many 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.890
 companies that 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.600
 they have really improved a lot 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.170
 their product also improved 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.320
 very much the packaged that today 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.679
 it also helps them to eat well you are 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.140
 even a gladiator of the chefs you are 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.360
 doing so many races so many things 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.500
 lately you have also won in 2011 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.840
 2012 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.030
 I won two haute cuisine trophies without 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.909
 gluten in Rome organized by the aci 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.560
 Lazio where this competition was 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.600
 I am presented twice I won 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.789
 both next time 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.569
 competition next competition there 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.079
 I'm thinking 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.030
 also because it is challenging you did 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.649
 even a book yes I made the leader yes 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.590
 calls chef gluten free 120 recipes 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.049
 all gluten-free where you go from 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.519
 appetizer to bread with dessert a 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.000
 great commitment because it took so long 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.660
 time 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.530
 what you will do when you grow up i still don't know 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.530
 but there is still a great desire to grow
