00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.940
 hi friends now I'm going to show you how easy or fast it is to install the 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.629
 door lock 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.979
 to perform the installation we will use the following tools 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:18.989
 tape measure 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.699
 pencil 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.369
 drill 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.599
 manual screwdriver podés electric propiciador 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.789
 game highlights sought after 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.499
 and martínez 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.710
 to start the installation of the sheet 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.830
 we can take as reference the counter that we had previously installed 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.000
 we make a mark half 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.330
 later to do the piercing on the door 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.550
 we will need a pencil sharpener this is eta sought after I could not get said crowd 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.090
 because they also come with this guide 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 that will facilitate the installation of the cha 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.190
 we place jihad on our brand 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.280
 and screwed 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.680
 to set 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.710
 Once the guide is placed then we can do the drilling 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.689
 once the first drilling is finished 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.689
 we will change the punch for one smaller 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.690
 now do not repeat the guide 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.829
 to place the pop grill latch you have to 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
 make him the box the outline is drawn 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 pencil 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.460
 and then with the forum on 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.460
 the hammer 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.110
 we make the outline cappa 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.509
 we place 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:13.539
 the latch 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.539
 we do not make sure 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.800
 once the screws are placed 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800
 the insured were disarmed 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.989
