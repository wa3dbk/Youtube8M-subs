00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
you're up to the final level here it is

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.070 
you're up to the final level here it is
again<00:04:30.090> just<00:04:31.090> want<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.389> go<00:04:31.479> a<00:04:31.510> little<00:04:31.690> bit<00:04:31.900> too

again just want to go a little bit too
high<00:04:34.139> and<00:04:35.139> I<00:04:35.380> break<00:04:35.560> my<00:04:35.590> angles<00:04:36.010> but<00:04:36.280> it's<00:04:36.520> all

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
high and I break my angles but it's all

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.939 
high and I break my angles but it's all
good<00:04:36.850> I'm<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.780> guardian<00:04:38.080> fortune<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.710> light<00:04:38.830> of

the traveler I'll be fine ok and I'll

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.020 
the traveler I'll be fine ok and I'll
show<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.520> one<00:04:42.669> more<00:04:42.850> time<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:45.430> one<00:04:45.610> we<00:04:45.789> try

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
show it one more time this one we try

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.170 
show it one more time this one we try
and<00:04:46.090> both<00:04:46.389> get<00:04:46.630> up<00:04:46.750> there<00:04:46.960> at<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.139> same<00:04:47.289> time

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
and both get up there at the same time

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.820 
and both get up there at the same time
and<00:04:49.180> it<00:04:49.360> doesn't<00:04:49.690> work<00:04:50.139> out<00:04:50.320> too<00:04:50.590> well<00:04:50.620> for

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
and it doesn't work out too well for

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.409 
and it doesn't work out too well for
Walter<00:04:51.370> but<00:04:51.760> I<00:04:52.000> get<00:04:52.600> up<00:04:52.630> there<00:04:54.180> once<00:04:55.180> again

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
Walter but I get up there once again

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.600 
Walter but I get up there once again
solar<00:04:55.780> grenades<00:04:56.199> on<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.440> ground<00:04:56.710> really

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
solar grenades on the ground really

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.840 
solar grenades on the ground really
really<00:04:57.789> helps<00:04:58.120> out<00:04:58.300> against<00:04:58.720> these<00:04:58.960> rules

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
really helps out against these rules

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.250 
really helps out against these rules
wait<00:05:00.850> until<00:05:01.120> your<00:05:01.240> weights<00:05:01.419> right<00:05:01.870> at<00:05:02.020> zero

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
wait until your weights right at zero

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.340 
wait until your weights right at zero
jump<00:05:03.100> on<00:05:03.220> top<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.610> lamp<00:05:03.880> then<00:05:04.840> on<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.229> this

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
jump on top to the lamp then on to this

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.530 
jump on top to the lamp then on to this
rock<00:05:05.650> and

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
rock and

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.690 
rock and
if<00:05:08.440> you're<00:05:08.620> really<00:05:08.860> good<00:05:08.980> with<00:05:09.010> timing<00:05:09.490> you

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
if you're really good with timing you

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.060 
if you're really good with timing you
can<00:05:09.850> make<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.120> work<00:05:10.270> okay<00:05:11.170> so<00:05:11.230> like<00:05:11.530> I<00:05:11.650> said<00:05:11.710> aid

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
can make it work okay so like I said aid

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.610 
can make it work okay so like I said aid
is<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.340> backup<00:05:12.550> for<00:05:12.730> that<00:05:12.970> but<00:05:13.840> really<00:05:14.260> the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
is the backup for that but really the

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.140 
is the backup for that but really the
best<00:05:14.830> one<00:05:15.100> you<00:05:15.220> want<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.460> go<00:05:15.550> for<00:05:15.700> is<00:05:15.850> 12

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
best one you want to go for is 12

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.970 
best one you want to go for is 12
although<00:05:16.480> it's<00:05:16.660> very<00:05:17.200> very<00:05:17.470> difficult<00:05:17.530> and

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
although it's very very difficult and

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.820 
although it's very very difficult and
yeah<00:05:18.670> haven't<00:05:19.060> gotten<00:05:19.240> any<00:05:19.480> footage<00:05:19.830> once

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
yeah haven't gotten any footage once

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.670 
yeah haven't gotten any footage once
you've<00:05:20.980> done<00:05:21.190> all<00:05:21.250> that<00:05:22.320> this<00:05:23.320> is<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:23.530> path

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
you've done all that this is the path

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.850 
you've done all that this is the path
we're<00:05:23.920> running<00:05:24.190> by<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.340> way<00:05:25.200> from<00:05:26.200> two<00:05:26.530> to<00:05:26.650> ten

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
we're running by the way from two to ten

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.610 
we're running by the way from two to ten
and<00:05:26.890> then<00:05:27.160> nine<00:05:27.430> up<00:05:27.670> this<00:05:28.600> is<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:28.960> ideal<00:05:29.320> path

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
and then nine up this is the ideal path

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.610 
and then nine up this is the ideal path
that<00:05:29.920> I<00:05:29.950> want<00:05:30.190> to<00:05:30.280> get<00:05:30.400> running<00:05:31.020> with<00:05:32.020> practice

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
that I want to get running with practice

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.440 
that I want to get running with practice
I<00:05:32.860> should<00:05:33.220> be<00:05:33.340> able<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.580> do<00:05:33.700> that<00:05:33.850> and<00:05:34.030> get<00:05:34.270> some

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
I should be able to do that and get some

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.470 
I should be able to do that and get some
footage<00:05:34.710> this<00:05:35.710> is<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.190> most<00:05:36.550> interesting<00:05:37.240> and

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
footage this is the most interesting and

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.930 
footage this is the most interesting and
most<00:05:37.570> difficult<00:05:37.990> jump<00:05:38.470> 16<00:05:39.160> across<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:39.700> bridge

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
most difficult jump 16 across the bridge

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.480 
most difficult jump 16 across the bridge
if<00:05:40.390> you'd<00:05:40.990> be<00:05:41.140> doing<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.470> solar<00:05:41.680> run<00:05:41.980> the<00:05:42.340> way

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
if you'd be doing the solar run the way

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.110 
if you'd be doing the solar run the way
you<00:05:42.750> do<00:05:43.750> it<00:05:43.780> would<00:05:44.170> be<00:05:44.560> use<00:05:45.130> those<00:05:45.340> previous

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
you do it would be use those previous

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.840 
you do it would be use those previous
launches<00:05:46.470> get<00:05:47.470> up<00:05:47.620> here<00:05:47.650> activate<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.640> plate

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
launches get up here activate the plate

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.120 
launches get up here activate the plate
enough<00:05:49.480> to<00:05:49.690> open<00:05:49.810> that<00:05:50.080> door<00:05:50.290> and<00:05:50.590> then<00:05:50.890> do

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
enough to open that door and then do

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.570 
enough to open that door and then do
what<00:05:51.280> Walter<00:05:51.610> just<00:05:51.760> did<00:05:52.000> to<00:05:52.210> get<00:05:52.330> over<00:05:52.750> there

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
what Walter just did to get over there

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.010 
what Walter just did to get over there
we<00:05:54.580> are<00:05:54.760> still<00:05:55.030> working<00:05:55.210> on<00:05:55.540> different<00:05:55.690> things

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
we are still working on different things

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.040 
we are still working on different things
to<00:05:56.550> turn<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.730> spawning<00:05:58.210> off<00:05:58.540> for<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:58.900> top

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
to turn the spawning off for the top

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.950 
to turn the spawning off for the top
level<00:05:59.410> we<00:06:00.100> haven't<00:06:00.400> worked<00:06:00.520> out<00:06:00.730> exactly<00:06:01.270> what

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
level we haven't worked out exactly what

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.720 
level we haven't worked out exactly what
triggers<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.650> spawning<00:06:03.040> up<00:06:03.250> the<00:06:03.400> top<00:06:03.580> and

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
triggers the spawning up the top and

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.120 
triggers the spawning up the top and
what<00:06:03.910> doesn't<00:06:04.410> but<00:06:05.410> I'm<00:06:05.530> pretty<00:06:05.740> sure<00:06:05.860> its

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
what doesn't but I'm pretty sure its

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.340 
what doesn't but I'm pretty sure its
spawning<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:06.640> night<00:06:06.850> either<00:06:07.780> way<00:06:08.050> you<00:06:08.110> should

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
spawning the night either way you should

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.490 
spawning the night either way you should
really<00:06:08.770> practice<00:06:09.160> in<00:06:10.090> taking<00:06:11.050> care<00:06:11.230> of<00:06:11.260> a<00:06:11.410> lot

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
really practice in taking care of a lot

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.400 
really practice in taking care of a lot
of<00:06:11.560> Rawls<00:06:12.570> hog<00:06:13.570> blade<00:06:13.810> works<00:06:14.020> pretty<00:06:14.290> well

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
of Rawls hog blade works pretty well

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.760 
of Rawls hog blade works pretty well
tight<00:06:14.950> and<00:06:15.100> slam<00:06:15.310> with<00:06:15.520> pretty<00:06:15.790> well<00:06:16.770> that
