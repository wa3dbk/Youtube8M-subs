00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.180
 the best systems to earn money on online roulettes 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:13.119
 in the systems laws are applied that make the game although it remains 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.849
 chance be easier and simpler 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.579
 in roulette there is what we know as' law of third 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.210
 tells you that about a total of possible numbers to get out 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.429
 a third will never come out 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.769
 a third will come out only once and a third will be repeated approximately one 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.929
 or more times 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.219
 that is to say that if we rotate the roulette 36 times an average of 12 numbers does not 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:37.430
 will appear 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.110
 twelve other numbers will appear once and the rest will repeat one or more 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 times 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.420
 to start with our system 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.860
 and take an order 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.380
 we will make a table numbered with the numbers from 1 to 36 and zero 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
 which represent each of the numbers of the roulette 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.450
 we will have to spin the roulette for 36 shots the idea is to take notes of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.150
 each one of the numbers that are coming out 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.010
 during this part of the system we will not have to make any bets 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.440
 in some casinos it is allowed to spin the roulette without putting chips 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
 in other casinos it is essential to make a bet 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.460
 we solve that by making a play and then we eliminate it and we can 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 spin the plate 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.640
 after making the 36 launches and having taken the notes we will see how 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.720
 the law of the third is fulfilled since on average there will be twelve numbers that have not 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.590
 stepped out 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.330
 now we will start betting a euro on all the numbers that are still to come 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.420
 our bet will be one euro for each number that has not left if it comes out 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.899
 one of the numbers we are betting on we stop betting on him 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.899
 but we keep betting on those who are still to leave 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.890
 and we continue doing the same with each number that we are approaching 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:14.059
 if we complete 36 shots betting and the number without leaving in the next stage 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.609
 we must bet 2 euros on the numbers that have not yet left 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.319
 and we will stop judging by the numbers that we are winning 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.349
 if after another 36 kilos have not yet left all the numbers 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.819
 we will start at that moment to play three euros per number we continue with the same 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.039
 rule for another 36 pitches 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:39.359
 for the next stages we will bet 4 euros per number 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:45.019
 then 5 6 and we will continue betting the same until all the 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.590
 numbers at that moment we close the cycle and start over again 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.939
 our bets 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:58.169
