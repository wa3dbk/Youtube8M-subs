00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.579
 Hi people 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.120
 I think it would be interesting and 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:00.250
 some friend video exactly 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:04.610
 I own a laptop hp here 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.560
 probook 4740 that is me on the go 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.799
 covered up hard but he still not 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.130
 covered up working but already with and writing 232 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.619
 broken plaster and now i want it 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.200
 take off because some programs 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.840
 they just don't see him already 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.390
 I want to take it off and protest on the other 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.220
 computer but everything turned out wrong 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.080
 just clarifying it is problematic 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.590
 because well, just do not know how 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.670
 now came to the workshop 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.020
 well, and as long as there is no clear some 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.940
 snaps nothing we are looking for while poking around in 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.909
 online but i think that if someone 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.679
 will also want to make out the top video will 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.649
 helpful Well bye bye looking until turning off 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:56.080
 we will find somehow there we will open we will continue 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:02:00.530
 the video is still needed personally 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.599
 In short, we continue to take off so that 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.020
 you need to disassemble the laptop this bolt 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.619
 over there inside there is no bolt the same 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.470
 thread 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.270
 unscrew the pelvis and then remove this one 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.300
 cover shoveled the internet floor 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.170
 it turned out all just need to click 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.080
 keep the battery battery and and voila here it is 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.290
 the hard drive will try everything further 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.629
 already very very yes so that's it 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.629
 Now we will shoot it and testik 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.860
 the green one is the other 0 that is generally 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.730
 hard drives ideal 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.650
 I wonder what it turns out that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.260
 ran the same program on his 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.650
 computer from this hard disk then 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.799
 showed 232 upholstered clusters now but 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.890
 Here is how the result is one blue that is 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:30.340
 everything else is ideally up to 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.709
 green that's what 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.360
 Leonova is generally but 1 blue should 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.000
 be at the end trailing yes says 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.180
 seriously so anyway one at the end 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 This one should be removed so 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.340
 that something like this so here that is this 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.110
 now passes without my participation 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:54.220
 hard drive meaning it is connected 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.370
 here it is separately so that such miracles 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.810
 happen and I was already upset 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.390
 there was a new hard drive to buy and 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.020
 q will create so that it will live yet 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.020
 proved 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:22.160
 Yes, I was on this one and put the camera well 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.460
 Here's how to 14 1 green that is 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:30.710
 general and hard drive and ideally one and a half 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.300
 years yes yes everything is like this but one 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.790
 blue ones ending 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.900
 so it's okay so something like this 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.300
 here is no 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.820
 shorter than nothing panicked everything is fine 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.850
 Now we put the hard drive and put 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.260
 system and forward to mount video all 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.260
 bye bye see you
