00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.920
 The poplar avenue in Neustrelitz 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.569
 actually rather unspectacular but not 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.240
 for the football fans of the turn and 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.240
 sports community neustrelitz the tsg 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.490
 For her the poplar avenue 17 is something like that 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.600
 as the holy grail offers 7,000 places 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.150
 the park stadium 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.980
 tsg neustrelitz is already here 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.980
 achieved some sporting success 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.760
 and if the tsg is one then 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.400
 successful in 1997 and 2002 she became 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.480
 national champion and 2007 and 2008 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.850
 trophy winner 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.180
 the original roots of the association 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.290
 which today counts about 420 members 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.059
 lie in 1919 in almost 100 years 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.670
 every amount has happened 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.309
 for more recent sporting successes 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.229
 in the regionalliga northeast are these 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.900
 The first one is responsible 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.729
 tsg neustrelitz the men's team 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.780
 We'll do a bit of training today 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.780
 to look the shoulder 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.460
 led by captain rico morack 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.440
 Here is a team with a lot 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.900
 energy and joy of playing found 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.909
 besides the playful performances there 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.640
 there is another reason for the captain 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.560
 for the sporting successes 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.290
 I just think that we as a team very much 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.380
 stand closely together and the cohesion 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.970
 quite big with us and thereby to 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.760
 for example, games as against torgelow 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.290
 ii 2 0 1 have lain behind and no 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.750
 We also had some games with us 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.040
 can turn and they still have there 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.370
 I think that's it 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.010
 the biggest plus with us without question one 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.890
 the performer is salvatore rogoli 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.270
 already in the last season 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.190
 He also has the most successful scorer 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.750
 in the current season, the nose again 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.700
 front 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.920
 in the form of an attack, he fights 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.950
 including side by side with striker 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.700
 marmaduke whose brother at hanover 96 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.700
 plays 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.320
 also during the training 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.230
 it is clear that the boys for the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.450
 Football and your club are very much alive 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.820
 joy of the slovakian origin 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.260
 trainer rastislav rudow at 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.840
 usually seven workouts 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.330
 he asks the players this way every week 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.180
 some from but how is it so nice 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.560
 without diligence no price and prices there 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.660
 there are still many to gain 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.170
 the plan for the near future stands 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.550
 fixed relative relatively clear we are new 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.340
 in the regionalliga and we want 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.620
 necessarily keep the class and thus 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.480
 with possibilities right 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.820
 establish in the league and that is 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.739
 important that we are no coincidence sometimes 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.690
 see the league and roll 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.880
 but we want to play absolutely as 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.350
 keep the class 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.120
 at the momentary constitution of the 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.690
 team a thoroughly realistic 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.239
 aim 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.640
 The TSG plays a very good running 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.400
 season and so it should be loud rastislav 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.630
 hodul also stay 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.209
 what is in his view the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.220
 special strengths of the team 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.959
 that will try your game to play 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.070
 not just not just fighting 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.930
 that, of course, with a lot 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.000
 passion and unconditional will 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.130
 but we also work the quality 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.769
 playfully have to determine the game 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.540
 and I think we already have this 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.850
 time for respect created the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.160
 league because the other teams the 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.080
 maybe a lot longer already 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.760
 have experience with regional secret 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.260
 a little bit or groups 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.030
 they are a bit disrespectful 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.799
 and not just think that here 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.170
 easier to play against us 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.910
 is because we really try soccer 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.799
 to kick 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.570
 as second football power in mecklenburg 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.060
 pomerania is behind hansa rostock 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.410
 the tsg neustrelitz course under 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.630
 a certain pressure of success 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.620
 But coach udo prepares none 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.959
 sleepless nights 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.630
 because even in this league do the 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.860
 guys have done a good job so far 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.630
 what has happened through the rise in the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.160
 regionalliga northeast actually 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.600
 changed 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.150
 I think a lot when you are in the 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.739
 stadium then looks for the 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.230
 regionalliga many renovations 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.510
 it is necessary to be in safety a lot 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.430
 we had to do that for the guests 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.170
 block and for everything else so had 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.870
 I think it's still a lot planned because im 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.700
 not only seating for a lot 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.140
 want to build more spectators here what 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.020
 everything is already prepared 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.030
 is of course also the most original 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.320
 from regionalliga are that we too 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.769
 Floodlight must have within two 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.690
 years 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.100
 I think not only in this 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.960
 but also what the audience 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.370
 Of course, this applies entirely to this now 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.190
 Other football offered 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.560
 and that one is not only last 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.300
 session or since here what 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.700
 changes but that ends already 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.430
 been here for four years and that was 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.990
 now a logical step what to do with 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.580
 this one also left completely different 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.200
 basis for the rule for the 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.540
 spectators for the accident for the city 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.160
 and of course that was not the case 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.230
 easy for the fine to handle everything 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.419
 because that's not just financial 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.160
 expenditure but also personal expenditure that 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.340
 here in this stadium the 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.400
 Despite the 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.169
 Success therefore has a lot to do with the 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.050
 tsg neustrelitz will also be in the future 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.390
 to count on and much to the joy 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.010
 the numerous fans become the boys 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.610
 probably still some ball in the net 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.610
 sink
