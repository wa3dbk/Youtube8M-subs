let me ask you another question can you
tell<00:02:10.369> us<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.580> little<00:02:10.610> bit<00:02:10.880> about<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.330> quality

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
tell us a little bit about the quality

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.740 
tell us a little bit about the quality
of<00:02:11.900> construction<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.430> required<00:02:14.120> here<00:02:14.630> in

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
of construction that is required here in

Costa<00:02:15.230> Rica<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:16.010> know<00:02:16.130> all<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.550> concrete

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
Costa Rica you know all the concrete

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.449 
Costa Rica you know all the concrete
rebar<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.020> kind<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.320> stuff<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:19.370> know

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
rebar and that kind of stuff you know

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.340

as strong as the California earthquake
codes<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.670> then<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:46.910> have<00:02:47.000> electrical<00:02:47.720> codes

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
codes and then you have electrical codes

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.810 
codes and then you have electrical codes
and<00:02:48.290> all<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.650> kind<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:48.950> stuff<00:02:49.070> definitely

people have asked me before when I'm
showing<00:03:07.310> properties<00:03:07.820> is<00:03:08.030> how<00:03:08.600> long<00:03:08.810> does<00:03:08.989> it

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
showing properties is how long does it

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.680 
showing properties is how long does it
really<00:03:09.170> take<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.709> build<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.250> house<00:03:10.519> here<00:03:10.690> you

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
really take to build a house here you

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.420 
really take to build a house here you
know<00:03:11.810> from<00:03:11.959> start<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.320> finish<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.680> first<00:03:13.190> day

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
know from start to finish the first day

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.039 
know from start to finish the first day
we<00:03:13.640> meet<00:03:13.820> we<00:03:14.030> start<00:03:14.269> doing<00:03:14.390> renderings<00:03:14.900> and

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
we meet we start doing renderings and

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.930 
we meet we start doing renderings and
get<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.560> building<00:03:15.799> permit<00:03:16.070> process<00:03:16.519> done<00:03:16.730> and

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
get the building permit process done and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.130 
get the building permit process done and
through<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.390> house<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.750> finish<00:03:17.930> and

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
through the house and finish and

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.720 
through the house and finish and
everything<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:19.010> know<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.250> can<00:03:19.400> figure<00:03:19.549> out<00:03:19.640> a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
everything you know you can figure out a

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.789 
everything you know you can figure out a
year<00:03:20.000> let's<00:03:20.239> say<00:03:20.299> about<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.959> year<00:03:21.260> buddy<00:03:21.560> you

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
year let's say about a year buddy you

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.400 
year let's say about a year buddy you
got<00:03:22.040> on<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.790> permitting<00:03:23.630> process<00:03:23.660> once

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
got on and the permitting process once

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.490 
got on and the permitting process once
you're<00:03:24.650> done<00:03:24.890> with<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.489> actual

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
you're done with the actual

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.080 
you're done with the actual
architectural<00:03:27.500> drawings<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.459> present

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
architectural drawings and you present

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.800 
architectural drawings and you present
it<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.480> College<00:03:29.840> of<00:03:29.930> Engineers<00:03:31.810> that's

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
it to the College of Engineers that's

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.600 
it to the College of Engineers that's
when<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.410> actual<00:03:33.560> construction<00:03:34.280> will<00:03:34.580> start

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
when the actual construction will start

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.940 
when the actual construction will start
once<00:03:35.180> all<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.540> permitting<00:03:36.110> process<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:36.769> done

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
once all the permitting process is done

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.550 
once all the permitting process is done
and<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.519> takes<00:03:37.760> about<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.060> year<00:03:38.360> or<00:03:38.390> so<00:03:38.560> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
and that takes about a year or so the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.770 
and that takes about a year or so the
whole<00:03:39.709> process<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.430> whole<00:03:40.459> process<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.329> did
