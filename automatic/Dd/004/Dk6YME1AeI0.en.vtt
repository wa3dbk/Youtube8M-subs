00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.680 
with a six out of 10 these bikes really
do<00:03:25.920> seem<00:03:26.160> pretty<00:03:26.430> good<00:03:26.519> given<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.150> last<00:03:27.360> year

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
do seem pretty good given the last year

do seem pretty good given the last year
that<00:03:27.840> they've<00:03:27.959> been<00:03:28.140> out<00:03:28.260> on<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.410> market<00:03:28.890> but

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
that they've been out on the market but

that they've been out on the market but
the<00:03:29.430> history<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:29.910> Bill<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.330> not<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.660> greatest

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
the history of Bill is not the greatest

the history of Bill is not the greatest
given<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.500> just<00:03:31.680> four<00:03:31.920> or<00:03:32.070> five<00:03:32.250> years<00:03:32.519> ago

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920

made<00:03:35.310> value<00:03:36.299> for<00:03:36.450> money<00:03:36.570> six<00:03:37.320> out<00:03:37.530> of<00:03:37.560> ten<00:03:37.829> it's

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
made value for money six out of ten it's

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.590 
made value for money six out of ten it's
not<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.370> most<00:03:38.519> expensive<00:03:38.880> bike<00:03:39.329> out<00:03:39.570> there

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
not the most expensive bike out there

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.539 
not the most expensive bike out there
but<00:03:40.260> for<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.590> niche<00:03:40.769> machine<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.400> is

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
but for the niche machine that it is

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:42.830 
but for the niche machine that it is
it's<00:03:41.850> still<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.150> fair<00:03:42.420> amount<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.720> money

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
it's still a fair amount of money

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.410 
it's still a fair amount of money
