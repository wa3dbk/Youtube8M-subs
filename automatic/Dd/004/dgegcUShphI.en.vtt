00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.830
 I am your palmas and come to one 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.450
 another video here on a channel and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.160
 on it the canal of the ahrensburger alex 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.510
 and if I'm already alex say 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.029
 Of course, also from the lot 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.060
 exactly month did nothing as always 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.740
 here and I have a little big 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.119
 project placed on the legs what 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.369
 we want to talk to you here today 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.619
 and the only person where 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.899
 Actually, you are only alone 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.880
 only you are here right now 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.500
 screen looks and alex again 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.660
 now at the big whole explain what 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.490
 it really is so short 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.870
 to get to the point we are looking for each other 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:45.270
 a good objective playing team and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.190
 that consists of us and you 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.810
 and yes we came to it by 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.620
 we just at black ops 2 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.820
 of course from the call of duty title 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.810
 gambled together online and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.230
 really in very rare cases times 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.420
 Objectively playing with teammates 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.769
 had and thought so we load 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.260
 but a few subscribers no since we 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.090
 also get a lot of requests 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.010
 We are looking forward to gambling 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.190
 Let's just look for capable people 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.659
 out and they are allowed or I hamm 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.770
 call it even have the privilege is 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.570
 to play us more often 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.220
 and yes, that 's the idea 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.150
 that would be a team building now 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.010
 which only consists of people of you and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.470
 to explain you exactly how 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.330
 the whole thing will be in detail is 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.460
 Just listen now because it is 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.020
 really a little bit complicated 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.600
 it's like a kind and I'm mine 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.979
 say casting built in and without 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.150
 now want to talk about the porridge 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.549
 I always explain exactly how that works 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.619
 The whole is composed of three 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.170
 round out for several days each 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.670
 after it takes place in the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.500
 For example , the first round will be the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.020
 Mode kill confirmed 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.240
 confirmed each of you will play 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.090
 with it and three rounds conclusion 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.460
 confirmed so play confirmed and 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.400
 then out of the three rounds of you will 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.200
 each of the score with the other ins 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.099
 grain of you adds three outside 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.819
 Round alex cohrs are added and the 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.680
 people with the highest and scores 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.040
 but the next round as dennis 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.280
 example again next to were at the beginning 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.260
 there are 50 people then 25 people in 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.469
 the second round and the other 25 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.700
 unfortunately have to retire in the second 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.799
 round is dominated by the mode 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.950
 played remaining participants 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.109
 There you have four rounds and out of this 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.650
 Round come then exactly two thirds 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.209
 continue 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.459
 that means one third will be the same 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.739
 say goodbye to the first round 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.919
 and the other two thirds are coming 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.329
 the same way we continue 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:49.810
 first round talk to the most 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.449
 score points and if right into the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.579
 final round then sent where then the 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.260
 mode is played hard in ours 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.879
 Eyes of any of the west modes 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.659
 or the most of 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.620
 one demanded 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.840
 played there at 95 rounds and at the end 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.060
 there will be about eight 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.949
 with which we then in the further course of the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.269
 call of duty universums depending on how 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:10.870
 Many will still go in until today 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.419
 black Ops 2 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.799
 then plays become important at this 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.069
 place to note is so whole 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.109
 So will be Xbox 360 only applies to 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.379
 the people who really play x30 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.819
 that may also be regular and now 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.680
 short registration and as we through the 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.750
 alex now to tell all further info 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.220
 So the registration itself is very 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.669
 I just have to say so you have to 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.060
 really hardly write anything and that 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.799
 namely, we just have to say no matter 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.019
 which channel of both of us 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.359
 So a pn send a private one 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.919
 message you can find here so 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.840
 Can you write that now? 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.400
 mingling in that on ours 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.680
 channel goes and on the right side 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.389
 are the faq they are back in 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.220
 have written and then there should be 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.549
 Somewhere in the channel founding and everything 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.459
 stand there and there is a stands 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.719
 our name plus a little arrow and 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.269
 if you can also click this case 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:05.769
 send her a message and that 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.799
 just write the message as 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:13.239
 concerning casting be o2 and content in 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:17.289
 content only our gamertag not 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.509
 rude ours and yes the whole 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:24.440
 can you until sunday the 25th 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:27.410
 half of this year make up yes 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.160
 23 59 everything is purely comes after 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.830
 deleted 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.190
 So there is not a single minimum 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.350
 chance to participate 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.970
 and yes, we invite you then so 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.910
 do not send us any friend requests 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.490
 xbox we invite you 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.590
 and yes, that was all for the 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.150
 registration and consumption still a few 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.250
 facts still in the open space 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.670
 it is important that you are bad 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.230
 if you should come in the final round 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.670
 then skype can use speak 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.250
 have a headset there or somehow 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.250
 microphone what a bit of your vote 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.000
 um zweit has mediated really really 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.850
 express once 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.560
 but that only applies from the final round 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.290
 means the week before do not worry 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.450
 if skype or other art and 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.270
 wise that means it is really true first 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.800
 from the final round probably the most 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.570
 Asked question that is coming is like 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.520
 I have to be old, I'm twelve 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.900
 I join in. I'm 30 and participate 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.740
 in German said it really plays 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.680
 not matter 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.190
 It really does not matter how old you are 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.330
 So there is no minimum age and 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.650
 again this point is to be noted 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.410
 also that this is little 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.580
 no plan so it really only acts 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:41.680
 a pure soccers kurt so beautiful 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.880
 online can defy the opponents away 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.290
 That's what really only that one 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.450
 should have with which one can always say 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.780
 where we can rely on that 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.300
 also very important aspect I think and 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.730
 Should there be more questions left open 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.780
 please use only the 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.919
 Comments 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.210
 that means you just look please 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.910
 ask if you should have me in 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.260
 the comments below this video and 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.660
 we will answer that 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.980
 also under this video that's us 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.600
 Your questions will be answered directly by one 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.180
 written response to this comment 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.580
 have to answer directly and always that 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.240
 The fastest way to do it all 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.480
 can go 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.480
 exactly 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.340
 Say something like that where you have more 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.669
 can find information regarding the 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.010
 more history glasses series like to do 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.419
 Although similar between results 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.940
 you can also find us on our website 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.850
 facebook page the links for our 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.620
 facebook pages are in the description 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.180
 and her could like a click on it and 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.790
 evaluates always informed about 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.949
 News becomes accurate and natural 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.169
 certainly on facebook always on the 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:45.900
 be the latest version but also per 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:48.870
 video on youtube that is if the 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.250
 we will be the first round to the end 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.810
 let's upload a video of our first one 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.289
 describe impressions and of course that 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.169
 leading 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.610
 whoever comes in the second round will 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.780
 then done last the second round 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.699
 to come or behind in the 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.669
 final round to each repeatedly 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:05.340
 but then this has to be boxing 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.300
 youtube are totally on the waste we have 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.650
 we thought again the 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.250
 interim results on facebook 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.199
 publish 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.030
 Pink really reaches everyone and if 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:14.160
 your share in the shipment of advantage if 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.300
 you know where in the moment stands and 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.860
 that's why you will like the advantage 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.180
 already said just look at the 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:23.520
 facebook page of two just times 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:25.800
 The whole thing should go further 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.139
 things france stand in the room 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.150
 but a description look there is 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.310
 everything listed exactly 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.650
 So how about the round 1 like 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.570
 27 will be the final round with the 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.520
 registration to defined in the 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.780
 Participants all the information beautiful 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.470
 summarized so that everyone too 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.120
 understood 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.860
 And yes, I say goodbye to this word 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.400
 I hope you take many 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.620
 participate in it 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.620
 and yes I'm out of 12
