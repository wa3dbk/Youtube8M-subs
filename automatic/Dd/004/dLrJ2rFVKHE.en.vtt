00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.540
 short video 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.370
 glitch probably few people have heard of such 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.830
 glitches are very may in my bmw 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.540
 it was very periodical that I do not know 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.630
 what the fuck is it scares me like 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.210
 but for the time being 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.920
 shorter now started the car to the doctor music 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.160
 enable ie how do you see 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.320
 now 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.340
 the volume is turned on 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:37.500
 I twist nothing I twist the joystick that is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.300
 he is like a little dummy 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.210
 he is not at all for figs not fixed 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.040
 nothing spinning at all does not work 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.140
 track switching does not work either 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.579
 the volume doesn't work anything that is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.969
 computer does not work 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.129
 trying to go to the menu also does not work either 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.039
 horseradish 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:59.670
 that is, all this is now more than once 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.140
 it happens it happens and now usually 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.170
 it helps when I car completely 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.439
 will turn off that is I will take out a key she will stand 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.900
 and then it passes again new as it were 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.650
 everything starts working computer in general 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.729
 I do not know what the crap here was still a glitch 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.210
 so that after turning off the lock 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.369
 Ignition key I pull out remains 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.560
 Cassette recorder work that is as if for 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.840
 music plays not so weak 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.350
 playing but not turning off too same 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.000
 It was here that there are two types of glitches but 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.100
 most often you are what is now and then me 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.630
 joystick does not turn de radio station 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.600
 there is a computer not working 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.990
 there is no loudness at all 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.700
 that crap will wait an hour to sit 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.490
 there were usually five actions enough to 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.130
 how would the machine die 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.720
 and again came to life who knows 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.820
 be heard something like that 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.270
 write something like it will be interesting 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.479
 read 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.070
