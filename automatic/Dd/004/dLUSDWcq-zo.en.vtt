00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.210
 Hi good night 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.820
 I wanted to enjoy what you're here to say 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.030
 who accompanied you on twitter 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.340
 I love it, and I wanted to ask you something. 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.080
 also about fashion and other about etiquette 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.939
 Are you saying that today is the most 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.830
 important in fashion so are you 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.830
 express said party that you dress 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.980
 I eat as young as I like fashion I 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.360
 I feel a little differently a little 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.750
 What are you talking about because I still see 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.750
 that we are evaluated by the agent 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.180
 time for how we dress 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.539
 I feel a little this difficulty I see 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:51.079
 A lot and my friends all look alike 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.079
 so in fact and the other about etiquette 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.570
 how do I ask when 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.570
 I'm in a public place a lecture the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.309
 cinema the theater has people talking to me 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.799
 I asked the person to be quiet of a 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.299
 polite way because when I ask 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.060
 I consider myself educated 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.070
 the person gets angry or she 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.409
 respond in a super thick way 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.939
 as if it were disturbing being that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.939
 she who is really 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.340
 look at the first question 16 so you 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.140
 says that it matters how important the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.400
 importance of fashion since it is fashion and 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.600
 expresses the way the person is 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.600
 I do not want to scare anyone 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.740
 but hey huh I have this deformation 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.410
 I'd hit the eye at any 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.090
 person I know what she means by 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.000
 that outfit 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.500
 I'm not worried about what it's like 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.190
 that clothes I know what she wants to say 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.900
 it 's not because I'm a witch, it 's because 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.970
 You wanted to say is this so when you 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.400
 if you choose a morning outfit 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.040
 How do you go in the wardrobe and 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.930
 the first handle clothes caught that 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.000
 does and does an unconscious calculation right and 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.950
 unconscious is but the new basis in 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.770
 advice and was moving the bus which 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.470
 may vote in the morning is to come up with 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:34.900

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:39.470
 now fall there take a black outfit is e 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.700
 There, pick up the clothes as you want to be seen. 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.970
 that day 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.610
 who chooses this message is who is 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.050
 posing with all the problems 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.780
 emotional choices that involve choice if 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.640
 person needs designer clothes 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.890
 clothes clothes is because she to her she 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.540
 would not she be if she thinks she's going 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.769
 to be judged by that is 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.980
 important to her she did not like 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.320
 who chose her who is giving value 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.830
 here still have some kind of 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.070
 value to her and she will be judged 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.780
 so she will be judged better is going to be 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.870
 view of this mother because that is what she 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.870
 showing is a choice
