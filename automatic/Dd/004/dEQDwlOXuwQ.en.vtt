00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.499 
really excited about it obviously canada
and<00:01:37.409> us<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> great<00:01:38.369> rivalry<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.090> i<00:01:39.299> think

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and us have a great rivalry and i think

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.359 
and us have a great rivalry and i think
this<00:01:39.600> game<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.619> want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.890> go<00:01:40.950> down<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
this game will if you want to go down to

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.179 
this game will if you want to go down to
be<00:01:42.329> remembered<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.649> we're<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.070> excited

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
be remembered so we're really excited

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.859 
be remembered so we're really excited
for<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.790> hopefully<00:01:45.030> we'll<00:01:45.299> get<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.450> win<00:01:45.659> I

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
for it and hopefully we'll get the win I

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.870 
for it and hopefully we'll get the win I
think<00:01:46.500> they're<00:01:46.799> obviously<00:01:47.549> there<00:01:47.729> are<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
think they're obviously there are a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.270 
think they're obviously there are a
strong<00:01:48.360> team<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.899> more<00:01:49.530> strong<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.890> well<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
strong team but more strong as well and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.679 
strong team but more strong as well and
I<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> counter-attack<00:01:51.450> is

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
I think on the counter-attack is

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.929 
I think on the counter-attack is
definitely<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.409> time<00:01:53.189> where<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.520> get<00:01:53.759> them

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
definitely a time where we can get them

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.340 
definitely a time where we can get them
but<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.180> think<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.630> will<00:01:54.899> also<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
but I think that will also have the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.990 
but I think that will also have the
opportunity<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.860> control<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.549> game<00:01:56.670> at<00:01:56.820> times

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
opportunity to control the game at times

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.550 
opportunity to control the game at times
so<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.240> got<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.899> well<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
so we got to do that as well and of

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.590 
so we got to do that as well and of
course<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.549> bit<00:01:59.700> extra<00:01:59.939> playing<00:02:00.329> into<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
course it's a bit extra playing into the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
course it's a bit extra playing into the
Americans<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:02.219> know<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.430> could<00:02:02.759> be

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
Americans it's a you know it could be

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.160 
Americans it's a you know it could be
called<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> North<00:02:03.329> American<00:02:03.719> classic<00:02:04.079> oh

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
called the North American classic oh

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.929 
called the North American classic oh
it's<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.890> pretty<00:02:05.280> much<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.520> big<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.909> gets

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
it's it's pretty much as big as it gets

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.029 
it's it's pretty much as big as it gets
internationally<00:02:06.689> for<00:02:06.840> us<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> think<00:02:07.469> all

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
internationally for us so I think all

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.440 
internationally for us so I think all
the<00:02:08.160> boys<00:02:08.190> are<00:02:08.429> really<00:02:08.670> excited<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.149> I'm

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
