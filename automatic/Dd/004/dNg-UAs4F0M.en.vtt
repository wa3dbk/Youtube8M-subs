new<00:02:05.340> zealand<00:02:05.670> new<00:02:06.150> zealand<00:02:06.180> will<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
new zealand new zealand will have the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.970 
new zealand new zealand will have the
put<00:02:06.990> another<00:02:07.140> scrum<00:02:07.410> they<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.830> make<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
put another scrum they have to make a

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.760 
put another scrum they have to make a
change<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:08.520> prop<00:02:09.000> Tony<00:02:09.300> Woodcock<00:02:09.570> is<00:02:09.990> on

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
change because prop Tony Woodcock is on

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.910 
change because prop Tony Woodcock is on
so<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.720> guess<00:02:12.720> Jerome<00:02:13.320> Kaino<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.430> off

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
so I guess Jerome Kaino is going off

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.560 
so I guess Jerome Kaino is going off
from<00:02:16.920> John<00:02:17.430> before<00:02:18.230> comes<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.880> well<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.210> seemed

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
from John before comes on well it seemed

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.200 
from John before comes on well it seemed
it<00:02:21.810> seemed<00:02:22.020> harder<00:02:22.620> then<00:02:23.190> Philip<00:02:23.670> not<00:02:24.030> to

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
it seemed harder then Philip not to

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.740 
it seemed harder then Philip not to

as far as he did but he was wondering
here<00:02:30.780> i<00:02:30.810> think<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.790> two<00:02:32.940> sides

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
here i think the of the two sides

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.630 
here i think the of the two sides
probably<00:02:34.260> ireland<00:02:34.620> more<00:02:34.770> disadvantaged<00:02:35.520> by
