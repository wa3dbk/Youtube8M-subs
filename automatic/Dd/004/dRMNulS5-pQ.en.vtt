when<00:00:18.789> it<00:00:18.880> comes<00:00:19.029> to<00:00:19.119> animating<00:00:19.480> Jack

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
when it comes to animating Jack

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.570 
when it comes to animating Jack
obviously<00:00:20.289> we've<00:00:20.410> got<00:00:20.560> a<00:00:20.590> huge<00:00:20.890> backstory<00:00:21.520> to

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
obviously we've got a huge backstory to

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.460 
obviously we've got a huge backstory to
this<00:00:21.699> game<00:00:22.000> we<00:00:22.599> have<00:00:22.720> to<00:00:22.779> think<00:00:22.930> who<00:00:23.140> is<00:00:23.289> this

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
this game we have to think who is this

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.679 
this game we have to think who is this
guy<00:00:23.680> where<00:00:24.070> is<00:00:24.220> he<00:00:24.340> why<00:00:24.640> would<00:00:24.820> he<00:00:24.910> do<00:00:25.060> this<00:00:25.090> how

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
guy where is he why would he do this how

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.749 
guy where is he why would he do this how
would<00:00:25.840> he<00:00:25.930> do<00:00:26.079> that<00:00:26.110> not<00:00:27.039> only<00:00:27.220> that<00:00:27.279> but<00:00:27.460> we

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
would he do that not only that but we

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.069 
would he do that not only that but we
had<00:00:27.880> to<00:00:27.910> ensure<00:00:28.270> that<00:00:28.419> the<00:00:28.509> movement<00:00:28.720> star

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
had to ensure that the movement star

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.240 
had to ensure that the movement star
would<00:00:29.230> sit<00:00:29.439> well<00:00:29.590> with<00:00:29.619> its<00:00:29.860> stylized

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
would sit well with its stylized

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.249 
would sit well with its stylized
graphics<00:00:30.730> and<00:00:30.849> audio<00:00:30.939> of<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.300> game<00:00:31.449> these

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
graphics and audio of the game these

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.810 
graphics and audio of the game these
combined<00:00:32.619> elements<00:00:32.800> meant<00:00:33.250> that<00:00:33.430> we<00:00:33.520> decided

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
combined elements meant that we decided

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.790 
combined elements meant that we decided
to<00:00:34.059> stylize<00:00:34.480> his<00:00:34.660> words<00:00:35.020> and<00:00:35.230> make<00:00:35.350> them<00:00:35.530> just

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
to stylize his words and make them just

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.200 
to stylize his words and make them just
beyond<00:00:36.100> realism<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:37.300> made<00:00:37.480> them<00:00:37.660> hyper-real

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
beyond realism you made them hyper-real

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.340 
beyond realism you made them hyper-real
we<00:00:40.210> used<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.450> wide<00:00:40.600> range<00:00:40.870> of<00:00:41.020> tools<00:00:41.200> for

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
we used the wide range of tools for

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.229 
we used the wide range of tools for
animating<00:00:41.770> all<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:41.980> characters<00:00:42.399> from<00:00:42.879> motion

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
animating all the characters from motion

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.549 
animating all the characters from motion
captured<00:00:43.629> to<00:00:43.719> hand<00:00:43.899> keyed<00:00:44.110> from<00:00:44.289> scratch

captured to hand keyed from scratch

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.650 
captured to hand keyed from scratch
either<00:00:45.219> way<00:00:45.550> all<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:45.969> animations<00:00:46.270> went

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
either way all the animations went

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.119 
either way all the animations went
through<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:46.930> same<00:00:47.079> process<00:00:47.530> of<00:00:47.710> having<00:00:47.860> to<00:00:48.039> be

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
through the same process of having to be

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.889 
through the same process of having to be
pushed<00:00:48.370> further<00:00:48.579> to<00:00:49.179> fit<00:00:49.329> the<00:00:49.420> hyper<00:00:49.629> real

pushed further to fit the hyper real
style<00:00:50.230> that<00:00:50.379> we<00:00:50.469> wanted<00:00:52.530> motion<00:00:53.530> capture<00:00:53.679> is<00:00:53.980> a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
style that we wanted motion capture is a

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.040 
style that we wanted motion capture is a
fantastic<00:00:54.429> reference<00:00:54.999> point<00:00:55.269> but<00:00:55.780> no<00:00:55.899> matter

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
fantastic reference point but no matter

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.479 
fantastic reference point but no matter
who<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:56.289> put<00:00:56.440> in<00:00:56.679> the<00:00:56.769> suit<00:00:57.010> with<00:00:57.249> all<00:00:57.399> the

have to push things further for a game

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.669 
have to push things further for a game
like<00:01:00.339> ours<00:01:00.899> you're<00:01:01.899> going<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.170> have<00:01:02.350> to<00:01:02.499> push

like ours you're going to have to push

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.200 
like ours you're going to have to push
the<00:01:02.800> poses<00:01:03.219> you're<00:01:03.640> going<00:01:03.789> to<00:01:03.850> have<00:01:03.969> to<00:01:04.089> make

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
the poses you're going to have to make

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.090 
the poses you're going to have to make
the<00:01:04.330> performance<00:01:04.809> stronger<00:01:05.199> we<00:01:05.740> spent<00:01:05.979> a<00:01:06.070> lot

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
the performance stronger we spent a lot

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.160 
the performance stronger we spent a lot
of<00:01:06.250> time<00:01:06.340> on<00:01:06.670> that<00:01:06.780> identifying<00:01:07.780> those<00:01:07.900> key

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
of time on that identifying those key

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.240 
of time on that identifying those key
poses<00:01:08.440> and<00:01:08.740> making<00:01:09.010> them<00:01:09.070> more<00:01:09.220> dynamic<00:01:11.250> take

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
poses and making them more dynamic take

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.550 
poses and making them more dynamic take
shadow<00:01:12.490> for<00:01:12.729> example<00:01:13.150> he<00:01:13.659> was<00:01:13.780> huge<00:01:14.140> challenge

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
shadow for example he was huge challenge

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.960 
shadow for example he was huge challenge
to<00:01:14.590> animate<00:01:14.979> and<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.460> think<00:01:15.640> that's<00:01:15.760> drawn

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
to animate and I think that's drawn

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.030 
to animate and I think that's drawn
extra<00:01:16.210> strengths<00:01:16.570> out<00:01:16.690> of<00:01:16.810> our<00:01:16.900> team<00:01:17.080> there

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
extra strengths out of our team there

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.469 
extra strengths out of our team there
was<00:01:18.159> talk<00:01:18.310> originally<00:01:18.760> of<00:01:18.880> motion<00:01:19.180> capturing

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
was talk originally of motion capturing

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.330 
was talk originally of motion capturing
him<00:01:19.690> which<00:01:20.380> we<00:01:20.530> could<00:01:20.620> have<00:01:20.740> done<00:01:20.860> but<00:01:21.190> the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
him which we could have done but the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.860 
him which we could have done but the
early<00:01:21.550> handke<00:01:21.880> test<00:01:22.150> was<00:01:22.330> so<00:01:22.480> good<00:01:22.660> that<00:01:22.690> we

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
early handke test was so good that we

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.810 
early handke test was so good that we
decided<00:01:23.260> not<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.560> we<00:01:24.220> studied<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.610> lot<00:01:24.700> of

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
decided not to we studied a lot of

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.640 
decided not to we studied a lot of
reference<00:01:25.150> for<00:01:25.210> shadow<00:01:25.480> particularly<00:01:26.350> police

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
reference for shadow particularly police

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.650 
reference for shadow particularly police
dogs<00:01:26.920> what<00:01:27.580> we<00:01:27.700> noticed<00:01:27.850> instantly<00:01:28.420> with

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
dogs what we noticed instantly with

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.240 
dogs what we noticed instantly with
these<00:01:28.840> dogs<00:01:29.080> was<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.590> they<00:01:29.710> totally<00:01:30.040> threw

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
these dogs was that they totally threw

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.350 
these dogs was that they totally threw
themselves<00:01:30.400> into<00:01:30.700> what<00:01:30.940> they've<00:01:31.060> been<00:01:31.180> told

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
themselves into what they've been told

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.840 
themselves into what they've been told
to<00:01:31.510> do<00:01:31.800> completely<00:01:32.800> selfless<00:01:33.100> sleep<00:01:33.370> and<00:01:33.550> with

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
to do completely selfless sleep and with

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.270 
to do completely selfless sleep and with
no<00:01:34.060> thought<00:01:34.300> of<00:01:34.360> their<00:01:34.630> own<00:01:34.720> safety<00:01:35.280> they

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
no thought of their own safety they

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.700 
no thought of their own safety they
latch<00:01:36.460> on<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:36.910> they<00:01:37.270> don't<00:01:37.450> let<00:01:37.660> go<00:01:37.840> that's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
latch on and they don't let go that's

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.020 
latch on and they don't let go that's
definitely<00:01:38.920> something<00:01:39.250> we've<00:01:39.550> captured<00:01:39.790> with

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
definitely something we've captured with

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.190 
definitely something we've captured with
shadow<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.420> I<00:01:40.450> think<00:01:40.690> people<00:01:40.930> are<00:01:41.020> going<00:01:41.140> to

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
shadow and I think people are going to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.860 
shadow and I think people are going to
be<00:01:41.290> excited<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.830> play<00:01:42.010> as<00:01:42.070> him

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.720 

I've<00:01:45.320> actually<00:01:45.650> got<00:01:45.920> quite<00:01:46.070> deep<00:01:46.400> martial

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
I've actually got quite deep martial

I've actually got quite deep martial
arts<00:01:46.880> background<00:01:47.270> myself<00:01:47.690> i<00:01:47.950> can<00:01:48.950> say<00:01:49.100> hand<00:01:49.370> on
