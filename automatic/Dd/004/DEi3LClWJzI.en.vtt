defiance occasionally but most of the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.209 
defiance occasionally but most of the
time<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.440> Brooks<00:00:37.920> pure

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219

heavier something above erasing flat

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
heavier something above erasing flat

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
to get that minimalistic feel and i feel

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.700 
to get that minimalistic feel and i feel
like<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> lightness<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> shoe<00:00:53.190> helps

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
like the lightness of the shoe helps

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.350 
like the lightness of the shoe helps

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
International was really wet out and I

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.259

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269
