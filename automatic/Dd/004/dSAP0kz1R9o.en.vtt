00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
pore thing is quite interesting to me

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.190 
pore thing is quite interesting to me
because<00:01:42.119> they<00:01:42.240> might<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.450> find<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.020> I've

aged my positive enlarged so would I
find<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.960> your<00:01:49.259> pores<00:01:49.649> get

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
clogged it's not an anti-aging device

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.920 
clogged it's not an anti-aging device
yeah<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.579> though<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.240> saying<00:01:54.630> that

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
yeah this is more though in saying that

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.510 
yeah this is more though in saying that
if<00:01:55.140> your<00:01:55.350> skin<00:01:55.590> looks<00:01:55.770> clear<00:01:56.009> clear<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
bright and vibrant that in itself is

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.980 
bright and vibrant that in itself is
anti-aging<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.159> because<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.689> great<00:02:00.840> for

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
anti-aging and because this is great for

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.789

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
and so how does it actually work what

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260 
and so how does it actually work what

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
other things are great they do work with

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.259 
other things are great they do work with
spots<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.829> know<00:03:26.920> work<00:03:27.130> on<00:03:27.250> spots<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.790> they<00:03:27.850> do

can cause dryness flaking irritation

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.259 
can cause dryness flaking irritation
which<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.350> just<00:03:35.650> exactly<00:03:36.010> which<00:03:36.280> then<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:37.000> what

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
this and then you have to kind of treat

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.560 
this and then you have to kind of treat
that<00:03:40.930> concern<00:03:41.440> wears<00:03:42.250> with<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:43.450> know

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
that concern wears with this you know

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.120 
that concern wears with this you know
you're<00:03:43.720> literally<00:03:44.019> just<00:03:44.170> eliminating<00:03:45.040> the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
you're literally just eliminating the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.680

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
bacteria and you can just continue with

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.870 
bacteria and you can just continue with
your<00:03:46.780> anti-aging<00:03:47.280> serums<00:03:48.280> or<00:03:48.609> regime

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
do have to keep using it because I know

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.420 
do have to keep using it because I know

that we all can buy things and get

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.920 
that we all can buy things and get
excited<00:03:54.670> then<00:03:54.970> forget<00:03:55.269> to<00:03:55.420> use<00:03:55.540> them<00:03:55.690> but<00:03:55.780> as

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
excited then forget to use them but as

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.229 
excited then forget to use them but as
soon<00:03:56.109> as<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.230> stop<00:03:56.410> using<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.730> bacteria

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
soon as you stop using it the bacteria

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.050 
soon as you stop using it the bacteria
will<00:03:58.390> come<00:03:58.570> back<00:03:58.780> okay<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.380> with<00:03:59.709> these
