back<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.170> she<00:01:52.470> stomps<00:01:52.890> from<00:01:53.189> right<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
back of you she stomps from right to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.420 
back of you she stomps from right to
left<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.540> she'll<00:01:54.869> stomp<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> front<00:01:55.710> right<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
left so she'll stomp the front right and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.580 
left so she'll stomp the front right and
then<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> front<00:01:57.000> left<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.570> your<00:01:57.869> platform<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
then the front left of your platform and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.609 
then the front left of your platform and
then<00:01:58.710> move<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> next<00:02:00.469> incredibly<00:02:01.469> easy

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
then move on to the next incredibly easy

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.539 
then move on to the next incredibly easy
to<00:02:01.770> avoid<00:02:03.530> frustratingly<00:02:04.530> annoying<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
to avoid frustratingly annoying if the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.300 
to avoid frustratingly annoying if the
event<00:02:06.000> fails<00:02:06.299> note<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> event<00:02:07.979> fails

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
event fails note that if the event fails

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.369 
event fails note that if the event fails
and<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.819> were<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.720> went<00:02:10.050> through

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
and you were in it so you went through

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.580 
and you were in it so you went through
your<00:02:10.739> lanes<00:02:11.039> portal<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.910> you

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
your lanes portal and you

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.369 
your lanes portal and you
in<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.860> event<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:14.269> fails<00:02:14.569> you'll<00:02:15.080> still

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
in the event and it fails you'll still

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.020 
in the event and it fails you'll still
get<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.680> sickness<00:02:16.099> debuff<00:02:16.430> meaning<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.879> you

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
get the sickness debuff meaning that you

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.130 
get the sickness debuff meaning that you
won't<00:02:17.209> be<00:02:17.300> able<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.480> run<00:02:17.629> into<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.930> next

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
won't be able to run into the next

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.860 
won't be able to run into the next
portal<00:02:18.500> where<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.830> event<00:02:19.129> is<00:02:19.310> going<00:02:19.550> next<00:02:19.940> so

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
portal where that event is going next so

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.369 
portal where that event is going next so
for<00:02:21.440> example<00:02:21.530> if<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.580> need<00:02:22.849> event<00:02:23.360> 3<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.290> the

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
for example if you need event 3 for the

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.680 
for example if you need event 3 for the
achievement<00:02:24.739> three<00:02:25.340> chances<00:02:26.239> are<00:02:26.390> you're<00:02:26.540> not

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
achievement three chances are you're not

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.420 
achievement three chances are you're not
going<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:27.050> get<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.440> simply<00:02:27.890> because<00:02:28.129> if<00:02:28.280> you

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
going to get it simply because if you

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.580 
going to get it simply because if you
fail<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.940> or<00:02:29.060> your<00:02:29.269> lane<00:02:29.569> fails<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.080> goes<00:02:30.379> to

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
fail it or your lane fails it goes to

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.550 
fail it or your lane fails it goes to
the<00:02:30.620> next<00:02:31.069> one<00:02:31.220> by<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:31.970> time<00:02:32.150> if<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:33.230> failed

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
the next one by this time if you failed

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.710 
the next one by this time if you failed
at<00:02:33.709> all<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.129> that<00:02:34.160> fails<00:02:34.519> again<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.390> twisted

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
at all and that fails again the twisted

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.990 
at all and that fails again the twisted
marionette<00:02:35.900> fight<00:02:36.349> is<00:02:36.500> probably<00:02:36.920> over<00:02:37.160> which

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
marionette fight is probably over which

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.360 
marionette fight is probably over which
obviously<00:02:38.739> you'll<00:02:39.739> have<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:40.010> wait<00:02:40.129> until<00:02:40.160> next

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
obviously you'll have to wait until next

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.809 
obviously you'll have to wait until next
time<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.849> get<00:02:41.000> your<00:02:41.150> achievements<00:02:42.010> now<00:02:43.010> bear

time to get your achievements now bear

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.280 
time to get your achievements now bear
in<00:02:43.849> mind<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.269> when<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.720> gets<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:45.049> number

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
in mind that when that gets to number

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.650 
in mind that when that gets to number
five<00:02:45.530> there's<00:02:46.220> practically<00:02:46.670> no<00:02:47.090> chance<00:02:47.420> of

five there's practically no chance of
you<00:02:48.200> getting<00:02:48.530> into<00:02:48.920> number<00:02:49.489> five<00:02:49.670> again

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
you getting into number five again

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.229 
you getting into number five again
simply<00:02:50.810> because<00:02:51.110> by<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.349> time<00:02:51.470> your<00:02:52.160> event<00:02:52.940> or

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
simply because by the time your event or

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.289 
simply because by the time your event or
rather<00:02:53.420> your<00:02:54.190> your<00:02:55.190> timer<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.730> go<00:02:55.819> back<00:02:56.030> into

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
the portals wears off you won't actually

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.089 
the portals wears off you won't actually
be<00:02:59.569> able<00:02:59.810> to<00:03:00.019> fight<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.319> marionette<00:03:00.739> anymore

be able to fight the marionette anymore

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.339 
be able to fight the marionette anymore
simply<00:03:01.519> because<00:03:01.610> another<00:03:02.209> four<00:03:02.480> fails<00:03:02.780> would

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
simply because another four fails would

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.830 
simply because another four fails would
mean<00:03:03.590> you're<00:03:04.250> dead<00:03:04.549> anyway<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.569> the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
mean you're dead anyway and the the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.500 
mean you're dead anyway and the the
event<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.260> over<00:03:06.560> even<00:03:06.920> if<00:03:07.790> number<00:03:08.180> five<00:03:08.360> is

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
event is over even if number five is

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.970 
event is over even if number five is
your<00:03:08.660> last<00:03:08.840> chain<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:11.230> I'd<00:03:12.230> recommend<00:03:12.440> trying

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
your last chain so I'd recommend trying

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.470 
your last chain so I'd recommend trying
to<00:03:13.099> get<00:03:13.220> them<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.459> first<00:03:13.640> time<00:03:13.819> if<00:03:14.030> not

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
to get them on the first time if not

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.930 
to get them on the first time if not
you've<00:03:14.690> got<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.870> two<00:03:15.079> hour<00:03:15.230> wait<00:03:15.940> which

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
you've got a two hour wait which

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.090 
you've got a two hour wait which
obviously<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.450> not<00:03:17.600> ideal<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:18.739> could<00:03:18.889> take

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
obviously is not ideal so it could take

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.319 
obviously is not ideal so it could take
quite<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.430> bit<00:03:19.549> of<00:03:19.609> time<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:20.060> get<00:03:20.180> these

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
quite a bit of time to get these

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.140 
quite a bit of time to get these
achievements<00:03:20.420> i<00:03:20.870> guess<00:03:21.049> i'm<00:03:21.200> trying<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.500> say

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
achievements i guess i'm trying to say

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.879 
achievements i guess i'm trying to say
but<00:03:23.150> regardless<00:03:24.109> of<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:24.350> we'll<00:03:24.709> go<00:03:24.859> through

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
but regardless of that we'll go through

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.240 
but regardless of that we'll go through
them<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:25.730> marionette<00:03:26.510> side<00:03:26.810> step<00:03:27.109> is<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.950> sever

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
them so marionette side step is to sever

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.160 
them so marionette side step is to sever
the<00:03:28.489> second<00:03:28.940> chain<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.720> you'll<00:03:29.840> be<00:03:29.930> faced

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
the second chain and you'll be faced

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.539 
the second chain and you'll be faced

straightforward<00:03:43.400> it's<00:03:43.940> just<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.239> line<00:03:44.480> attack

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
straightforward it's just a line attack

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.479 
straightforward it's just a line attack
from<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.290> front<00:03:45.410> where<00:03:45.919> the<00:03:45.950> marionette<00:03:46.370> is

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
from the front where the marionette is

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.030 
from the front where the marionette is
towards<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.299> generator<00:03:47.620> stay<00:03:48.620> out<00:03:48.739> of<00:03:48.769> that

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
towards the generator stay out of that

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.479 
towards the generator stay out of that
roof<00:03:49.280> area<00:03:49.639> and<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:49.970> should<00:03:50.209> be<00:03:50.239> fine

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
roof area and you should be fine

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.520 
roof area and you should be fine
marinette<00:03:52.489> short-circuit<00:03:53.180> er<00:03:53.349> requires<00:03:54.349> you

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
marinette short-circuit er requires you

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.470 
marinette short-circuit er requires you
to<00:03:54.650> dodge<00:03:54.829> all<00:03:55.069> of<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.340> lightning<00:03:55.700> attacks<00:03:56.180> now

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
to dodge all of a lightning attacks now

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.020 
to dodge all of a lightning attacks now
the<00:03:56.540> lightning<00:03:56.989> attacks<00:03:57.290> cover<00:03:57.910> maybe<00:03:58.910> a

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
the lightning attacks cover maybe a

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.690 
the lightning attacks cover maybe a
third<00:03:59.329> to<00:03:59.569> a<00:03:59.599> half<00:03:59.660> of<00:04:00.169> the<00:04:00.380> platform<00:04:00.700> but

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
third to a half of the platform but

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.460 
third to a half of the platform but
they're<00:04:01.880> in<00:04:02.030> small<00:04:02.359> circles<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.169> they<00:04:03.290> can

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
they're in small circles so they can

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.699 
they're in small circles so they can
overlap<00:04:03.799> meaning<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.340> they<00:04:05.030> can<00:04:05.269> not<00:04:06.019> you

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
overlap meaning that they can not you

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.650 
overlap meaning that they can not you
know<00:04:06.829> it<00:04:07.040> can<00:04:07.430> vary<00:04:07.730> how<00:04:08.060> much<00:04:08.269> of<00:04:08.540> the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
know it can vary how much of the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.009 
know it can vary how much of the
platform<00:04:08.900> they<00:04:09.530> cover<00:04:09.950> but<00:04:10.780> there's<00:04:11.780> quite<00:04:11.989> a

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
platform they cover but there's quite a

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.110 
platform they cover but there's quite a
few<00:04:12.079> of<00:04:12.349> them<00:04:12.500> meaning<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:13.370> if<00:04:13.730> you<00:04:13.880> dodge

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
few of them meaning that if you dodge

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.210 
few of them meaning that if you dodge
from<00:04:14.450> one<00:04:14.630> into<00:04:14.989> another<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:15.560> then<00:04:16.010> dodge

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
from one into another and then dodge

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.099 
from one into another and then dodge
from<00:04:16.400> that<00:04:16.579> into<00:04:16.849> another<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.450> may<00:04:17.750> be<00:04:17.810> out<00:04:17.989> of

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
from that into another you may be out of

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.729 
from that into another you may be out of
luck<00:04:18.289> but<00:04:19.299> they're<00:04:20.299> pretty<00:04:20.750> easy<00:04:21.079> to<00:04:21.289> avoid<00:04:21.530> as

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
luck but they're pretty easy to avoid as

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.740 
luck but they're pretty easy to avoid as
I<00:04:21.769> say<00:04:22.010> all<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:22.310> these<00:04:22.640> attacks<00:04:22.880> are<00:04:23.240> very<00:04:23.539> well

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
I say all of these attacks are very well

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
I say all of these attacks are very well
telegraphed<00:04:24.080> but<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.650> problem<00:04:25.070> here

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
telegraphed but the problem here

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.860 
telegraphed but the problem here
is<00:04:25.949> the<00:04:26.160> warden<00:04:26.610> because<00:04:27.030> this<00:04:27.180> warden<00:04:27.569> does<00:04:27.720> a

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
is the warden because this warden does a

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.559 
is the warden because this warden does a
lot<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.169> damage<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:29.099> knocks<00:04:29.340> down<00:04:29.699> those

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
lot of damage and it knocks down those

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.270 
lot of damage and it knocks down those
two<00:04:30.780> together<00:04:30.930> mean<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.740> may<00:04:31.919> be<00:04:31.979> on<00:04:32.160> the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
two together mean you may be on the

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.520 
two together mean you may be on the
floor<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.729> little<00:04:33.030> more<00:04:33.180> than<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.419> like<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:34.050> if

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
floor a little more than you like and if

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.020 
floor a little more than you like and if
you're<00:04:34.680> on<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.860> floor<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.400> lightning<00:04:35.819> comes

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
you're on the floor and lightning comes

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.999 
you're on the floor and lightning comes
above<00:04:36.210> your<00:04:36.360> head<00:04:36.650> chances<00:04:37.650> are<00:04:37.830> you're<00:04:37.979> not

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
above your head chances are you're not

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.820 
above your head chances are you're not
going<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.490> dodge<00:04:38.639> it<00:04:38.870> so<00:04:39.870> I'd<00:04:40.650> recommend

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
going to dodge it so I'd recommend

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.920 
going to dodge it so I'd recommend
taking<00:04:41.520> a<00:04:41.879> little<00:04:42.090> bit<00:04:42.180> of<00:04:42.210> stability<00:04:42.389> and

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
taking a little bit of stability and

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.619 
taking a little bit of stability and
maybe<00:04:43.199> a<00:04:43.349> tankier<00:04:44.009> build<00:04:44.310> simply<00:04:45.150> because<00:04:45.419> if

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
maybe a tankier build simply because if

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.290 
maybe a tankier build simply because if
you<00:04:45.780> survive<00:04:46.520> better<00:04:47.520> chances<00:04:47.729> if<00:04:48.060> you're<00:04:48.180> not

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
you survive better chances if you're not

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.550 
you survive better chances if you're not
getting<00:04:48.539> hit<00:04:48.659> by<00:04:48.690> lightning<00:04:49.139> when<00:04:49.259> downed

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
getting hit by lightning when downed

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.950 
getting hit by lightning when downed
which<00:04:50.069> is<00:04:50.280> obviously<00:04:50.669> ideal<00:04:51.120> that's<00:04:51.659> what<00:04:51.840> we

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
which is obviously ideal that's what we

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.010 
which is obviously ideal that's what we
want<00:04:52.520> I'd<00:04:53.520> recommend<00:04:53.819> ranging<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.509> warden<00:04:54.870> if

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
want I'd recommend ranging the warden if

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.540 
want I'd recommend ranging the warden if
at<00:04:55.139> all<00:04:55.259> possible<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.949> dodging<00:04:56.400> the

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
at all possible and dodging the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.980 
at all possible and dodging the
lightning<00:04:56.909> attacks<00:04:57.180> that<00:04:57.599> seemed<00:04:57.840> to<00:04:57.900> work

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
lightning attacks that seemed to work

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.610 
lightning attacks that seemed to work
the<00:04:58.560> best<00:04:59.389> my<00:05:00.389> own<00:05:00.479> at<00:05:00.599> Dodger<00:05:00.870> going<00:05:01.380> forward

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
the best my own at Dodger going forward

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.730 
the best my own at Dodger going forward
is<00:05:01.889> a<00:05:02.729> sword<00:05:03.270> attack<00:05:03.569> which<00:05:04.050> covers<00:05:04.500> the

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
is a sword attack which covers the

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.100 
is a sword attack which covers the
entirety<00:05:05.220> of<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.849> front<00:05:06.210> of<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:06.630> platform

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
entirety of the front of the platform

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.999 
entirety of the front of the platform
and<00:05:07.289> hits<00:05:07.889> about<00:05:08.310> three<00:05:08.639> to<00:05:08.789> four<00:05:08.970> times<00:05:09.030> per

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
and hits about three to four times per

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.990 
and hits about three to four times per
platform<00:05:11.009> so<00:05:11.190> it<00:05:11.280> kind<00:05:11.430> of<00:05:11.460> like<00:05:11.610> swings

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
platform so it kind of like swings

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.450 
platform so it kind of like swings
across<00:05:12.150> you<00:05:12.990> get<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:13.259> see<00:05:13.440> a<00:05:13.470> few<00:05:13.919> images<00:05:14.159> of<00:05:14.370> it

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
across you get to see a few images of it

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.629 
across you get to see a few images of it
but<00:05:14.759> it's<00:05:15.539> relatively<00:05:15.990> easy<00:05:16.229> to<00:05:16.680> dodge<00:05:17.009> it's<00:05:17.400> a

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
but it's relatively easy to dodge it's a

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.430 
but it's relatively easy to dodge it's a
pretty<00:05:18.000> quick<00:05:18.360> attack<00:05:18.719> though<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.229> you<00:05:19.289> need

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
pretty quick attack though so you need

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.559 
pretty quick attack though so you need
to<00:05:19.500> be<00:05:19.530> quick<00:05:19.770> on<00:05:19.889> the<00:05:20.039> mark<00:05:20.219> or<00:05:20.400> stand<00:05:21.210> near

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
to be quick on the mark or stand near

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.909 
to be quick on the mark or stand near
the<00:05:21.719> back<00:05:21.900> of<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:23.389> platform<00:05:24.389> now<00:05:24.900> again<00:05:25.560> the

the back of the platform now again the
warden<00:05:26.310> here<00:05:26.520> is<00:05:26.669> quite<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.360> bit<00:05:27.569> of<00:05:27.659> a<00:05:27.690> problem

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
warden here is quite a bit of a problem

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.430 
warden here is quite a bit of a problem
because<00:05:28.169> it<00:05:28.620> drops<00:05:29.009> huge<00:05:29.759> AO<00:05:29.969> ease<00:05:30.270> both<00:05:31.229> in

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
because it drops huge AO ease both in

because it drops huge AO ease both in
the<00:05:31.560> middle<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:31.979> towards<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:33.030> outer<00:05:33.360> ring<00:05:33.870> of

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
the platform meaning that the safe area

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.990 
the platform meaning that the safe area
at<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.389> back<00:05:36.539> not<00:05:37.500> so<00:05:37.740> safe<00:05:38.009> anymore<00:05:38.340> it<00:05:38.849> also

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
at the back not so safe anymore it also

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.360 
at the back not so safe anymore it also
throws<00:05:39.449> out<00:05:39.659> homing<00:05:40.500> missiles<00:05:40.830> and<00:05:41.099> will

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
throws out homing missiles and will

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.939 
throws out homing missiles and will
shriek<00:05:41.699> causing<00:05:42.509> a<00:05:42.750> nasty<00:05:43.680> amount<00:05:43.889> of

shriek causing a nasty amount of

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.430 
shriek causing a nasty amount of
confusion<00:05:44.130> so<00:05:44.759> once<00:05:45.000> again<00:05:45.150> maybe<00:05:45.870> a<00:05:45.990> tankier

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
confusion so once again maybe a tankier

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.529 
confusion so once again maybe a tankier
billed<00:05:46.710> condition<00:05:47.279> removal<00:05:47.940> is<00:05:48.029> always<00:05:48.300> good

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
billed condition removal is always good

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.200 
billed condition removal is always good
and<00:05:49.219> surviving<00:05:50.219> is<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.460> main<00:05:50.610> thing<00:05:50.639> because

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
and surviving is the main thing because

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.850 
and surviving is the main thing because

I'll<00:06:07.319> be<00:06:07.500> honest<00:06:07.770> which<00:06:08.190> is<00:06:08.400> really

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
I'll be honest which is really

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.300 
I'll be honest which is really
frustrating<00:06:08.969> but<00:06:09.599> the<00:06:10.440> warden<00:06:10.800> isn't<00:06:11.039> too<00:06:11.159> bad

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
frustrating but the warden isn't too bad

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.769 
frustrating but the warden isn't too bad
it<00:06:11.490> splits<00:06:11.729> when<00:06:11.880> defeated<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:12.509> it<00:06:12.599> does

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:12.779 
it splits when defeated and it does

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:14.570 
it splits when defeated and it does
quite<00:06:13.229> a<00:06:13.289> bit<00:06:13.440> of<00:06:13.529> damage<00:06:13.560> meaning<00:06:14.279> that<00:06:14.310> you

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
quite a bit of damage meaning that you

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.399 
quite a bit of damage meaning that you
either<00:06:14.699> need<00:06:14.940> to<00:06:15.000> burn<00:06:15.270> it<00:06:15.419> down<00:06:15.449> all<00:06:15.870> you<00:06:16.289> need

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
to be able to survive to burn it down so

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:20.959 
to be able to survive to burn it down so
maybe<00:06:19.650> take<00:06:19.919> some<00:06:20.159> of<00:06:20.400> your<00:06:20.430> invulnerability

some active mitigation or run a little
bit<00:06:24.060> of<00:06:24.240> a<00:06:24.330> tankier<00:06:24.810> build<00:06:25.169> now<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:26.550> screen<00:06:26.940> is

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
bit of a tankier build now the screen is

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.240 
bit of a tankier build now the screen is
actually<00:06:27.620> practically<00:06:28.620> the<00:06:28.770> same<00:06:28.919> as<00:06:29.099> the

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
actually practically the same as the

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.550 
actually practically the same as the
lightning<00:06:29.610> it's<00:06:29.849> small<00:06:30.270> circles<00:06:30.750> quite<00:06:31.259> a<00:06:31.289> few

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
lightning it's small circles quite a few

lightning it's small circles quite a few
of<00:06:31.650> them<00:06:31.770> and<00:06:31.949> they<00:06:32.039> cover<00:06:32.250> quite<00:06:32.580> a<00:06:32.639> bit<00:06:32.819> of

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
of them and they cover quite a bit of

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.969 
of them and they cover quite a bit of
the<00:06:33.029> platform<00:06:33.479> so<00:06:34.110> as<00:06:34.229> long<00:06:34.320> as<00:06:34.440> you<00:06:34.560> stay<00:06:34.800> out

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
the platform so as long as you stay out

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:36.829 
the platform so as long as you stay out
of<00:06:35.009> the<00:06:35.279> yellow<00:06:35.820> orange<00:06:36.060> circles<00:06:36.479> you<00:06:36.630> should

of the yellow orange circles you should

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:39.540 
of the yellow orange circles you should
be<00:06:36.960> fine<00:06:37.259> again<00:06:37.560> as<00:06:37.949> I<00:06:38.370> say<00:06:38.669> the

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
be fine again as I say the

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.850 
be fine again as I say the
chain<00:06:39.910> is<00:06:40.240> usually<00:06:40.990> people<00:06:41.320> not<00:06:41.530> being<00:06:41.680> able

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
chain is usually people not being able

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.740 
chain is usually people not being able
to<00:06:42.100> kill<00:06:42.280> the<00:06:42.430> warden<00:06:42.940> in<00:06:43.060> time<00:06:43.270> to<00:06:43.510> kill<00:06:43.690> the

overflow surface so it will get to the

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.950 
overflow surface so it will get to the
point<00:07:00.490> where<00:07:00.760> everybody's<00:07:01.390> capable
