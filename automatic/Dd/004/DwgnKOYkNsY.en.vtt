00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
there are a number of sizes of different

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.980 
there are a number of sizes of different
trees<00:00:28.349> usually<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.460> larger<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.970> get<00:00:30.179> they

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
trees usually the larger you get they

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.979 
trees usually the larger you get they
get<00:00:31.199> into<00:00:31.380> ball<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.920> burlap<00:00:32.340> material<00:00:32.989> and

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.630 
get into ball and burlap material and
that<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.410> means<00:00:34.649> these<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:35.040> been<00:00:35.160> growing

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that just means these have been growing

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.540 
that just means these have been growing
in<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> nursery<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.680> so<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:37.890> dig<00:00:38.160> them<00:00:38.370> out

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
in the nursery and so they dig them out

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.270 
in the nursery and so they dig them out
of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.910> soil<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> nursery<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.200> opposed<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
of the soil in the nursery as opposed to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.150 
of the soil in the nursery as opposed to
being<00:00:41.489> grown<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.210> their<00:00:42.530> from<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.649> seedling<00:00:44.040> in

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
being grown for their from a seedling in

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.420 
being grown for their from a seedling in
a<00:00:44.280> pot<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.350> order<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.680> dig<00:00:46.950> them<00:00:47.100> from<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
a pot so in order to dig them from the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.100 
a pot so in order to dig them from the
field<00:00:47.700> they<00:00:48.090> usually<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
field they usually do that with a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.400 
field they usually do that with a
machine<00:00:49.940> but<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.120> they<00:00:51.300> need<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.780> hold<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
machine but then they need to hold the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.740 
machine but then they need to hold the
soil<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.890> place<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.360> usually<00:00:54.539> use

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
soil in place and they usually use

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.770 
soil in place and they usually use
burlap<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.329> an<00:00:57.480> example

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
burlap to do that so we have an example

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.049 
burlap to do that so we have an example
of<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:59.420> this<00:01:00.420> dogwood<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.260> also<00:01:02.190> has<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
of that here this dogwood is also has a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.149 
of that here this dogwood is also has a
metal<00:01:05.450> metal<00:01:06.450> wire<00:01:06.659> cage<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.710> help<00:01:07.920> support

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
metal metal wire cage to help support

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.179 
metal metal wire cage to help support
that<00:01:08.460> system<00:01:09.360> also<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:11.010> also

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that system also and then it's also

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.190 
that system also and then it's also
attached<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.939> twine<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
attached with twine now one of the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.630 
attached with twine now one of the
things<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.500> need<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> purchase

that<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.900> place<00:01:28.790> this<00:01:29.790> tree<00:01:30.060> also<00:01:30.420> has

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
that in place this tree also has

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.740 
that in place this tree also has
protection<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.369> here<00:01:32.759> which<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.210> good<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> have

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
protection on here which is good to have

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.179 
protection on here which is good to have
which<00:01:34.590> will<00:01:34.770> help<00:01:34.890> keep<00:01:35.159> rabbits<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:37.189> bowls

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189

and<00:01:38.610> other<00:01:39.119> creatures<00:01:39.479> from<00:01:40.079> attacking<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
and other creatures from attacking the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.200 
and other creatures from attacking the
bark<00:01:41.369> especially<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> newly<00:01:42.750> planted<00:01:43.020> tree

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
bark especially on a newly planted tree

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
bark especially on a newly planted tree
so<00:01:45.210> when<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.840> home<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.770> is

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
so when you get this home and it is

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.469 
so when you get this home and it is
heavy<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.700> need<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.060> account<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:49.250> I

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
heavy so you need to account for that I

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.300 
heavy so you need to account for that I
think<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.810> pick<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.229> up<00:01:52.350> here<00:01:54.110> but

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
think we can pick it up here but

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.740 
think we can pick it up here but
depending<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:56.579> situation<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.450> may<00:01:57.689> or

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
depending on your situation this may or

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.260 
depending on your situation this may or
may<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.500> best<00:01:58.530> thing<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.399> so<00:02:00.180> it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
may not be the best thing for you so it

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.999 
may not be the best thing for you so it
can<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.659> heavy<00:02:00.810> especially<00:02:01.500> when<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.770> ball<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
can be heavy especially when the ball is

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.600 
can be heavy especially when the ball is
saturated<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.299> now<00:02:04.310> alright<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.549> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
saturated like it is now alright so to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.270 
saturated like it is now alright so to
plant<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:07.020> would<00:02:07.170> dig<00:02:07.350> your<00:02:07.500> hole<00:02:07.740> you

what the size of the ball is and
okay<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.540> then<00:02:14.230> you'll<00:02:14.440> set<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:14.920> down<00:02:15.130> in

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
okay and then you'll set that down in

okay and then you'll set that down in
the<00:02:15.460> ground<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.230> do<00:02:17.440> not<00:02:17.590> want<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.950> plant

the ground and you do not want to plant
it<00:02:18.340> any<00:02:18.520> deeper<00:02:19.000> than<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.990> top<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.560> root

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
it any deeper than the top of the root

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.040 
it any deeper than the top of the root
ball<00:02:20.950> okay<00:02:21.550> where<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.120> was<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.780> natural

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
to bury them you may need to just put a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.760 
to bury them you may need to just put a
light<00:02:30.430> coating<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:31.000> soil<00:02:31.330> over<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.750> top<00:02:31.990> but

the ground you can take the wire cage we
will<00:02:41.430> cut<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.610> for<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.540> show<00:02:43.780> how<00:02:44.050> you

will cut this for you to show how you

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.750 
will cut this for you to show how you
would<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:46.740> but<00:02:47.740> you<00:02:47.890> do<00:02:48.040> need<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> remove

would do that but you do need to remove

would do that but you do need to remove
the<00:02:48.820> twine<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:50.560> we<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:50.890> loosen<00:02:51.100> this<00:02:51.400> up

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
the twine so that we can loosen this up

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.600 
the twine so that we can loosen this up
we<00:02:51.880> do<00:02:52.030> not<00:02:52.180> want<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.540> leave<00:02:52.690> twine<00:02:53.200> around<00:02:54.130> the

we do not want to leave twine around the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.260 
we do not want to leave twine around the
trunk<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.150> tree<00:02:56.640> occasionally<00:02:57.640> now<00:02:58.090> this

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
trunk of the tree occasionally now this

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.330 
trunk of the tree occasionally now this
is<00:02:58.330> real<00:02:58.720> twine<00:02:59.110> which<00:02:59.410> will<00:02:59.650> decay<00:03:00.040> after

is real twine which will decay after

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.360 
is real twine which will decay after
time<00:03:01.020> sometimes<00:03:02.020> synthetic<00:03:02.620> twine<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.100> used

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
time sometimes synthetic twine is used

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.530 
time sometimes synthetic twine is used
and<00:03:03.670> that<00:03:04.210> has<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.720> be<00:03:04.750> removed<00:03:06.120> now<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.210> also

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
and that has to be removed now you also

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.500 
and that has to be removed now you also
want<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.050> take<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:09.280> top<00:03:09.520> of<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.820> cage<00:03:10.090> once

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
want to take the top of the cage once

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.010 
want to take the top of the cage once
that's<00:03:10.780> loose<00:03:11.110> you<00:03:11.530> can<00:03:11.740> peel<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.250> back<00:03:13.020> and

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
that's loose you can peel that back and

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
that's loose you can peel that back and
if<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.100> have<00:03:15.310> wire<00:03:15.640> cutters<00:03:15.670> you<00:03:16.300> can<00:03:16.600> cut<00:03:17.560> the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
if you have wire cutters you can cut the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.230 
if you have wire cutters you can cut the
top<00:03:18.460> part<00:03:19.270> of<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.600> cage<00:03:19.960> if<00:03:20.590> necessary<00:03:21.400> just

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
top part of that cage if necessary just

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.270 
top part of that cage if necessary just
to<00:03:22.360> open<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.840> up<00:03:23.020> a<00:03:23.110> little<00:03:23.260> bit<00:03:23.500> more<00:03:23.770> but

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
to open that up a little bit more but

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.040 
to open that up a little bit more but
usually<00:03:24.700> we<00:03:24.910> can<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.270> leave<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.720> there<00:03:25.780> and

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
usually we can just leave that there and

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.820 
usually we can just leave that there and
over<00:03:26.380> time<00:03:26.740> that<00:03:27.100> will<00:03:27.370> rot<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:29.230> also<00:03:29.410> need<00:03:29.770> to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
over time that will rot you also need to

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.200 
over time that will rot you also need to
remove<00:03:30.430> untie<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.510> pull<00:03:32.440> back<00:03:32.740> the<00:03:33.210> the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
remove untie and pull back the the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.690 
remove untie and pull back the the
burlap<00:03:34.630> now<00:03:35.380> I'm<00:03:35.560> not<00:03:35.800> going<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.130> cut<00:03:36.340> this<00:03:36.490> one

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
burlap now I'm not going to cut this one

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.430 
burlap now I'm not going to cut this one
all<00:03:36.880> up<00:03:37.090> today<00:03:38.610> but<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:40.300> can<00:03:40.330> take<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.020> burlap

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
all up today but you can take the burlap

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.040 
all up today but you can take the burlap
it<00:03:41.740> needs<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.280> be<00:03:42.460> wrapped<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.780> can<00:03:43.930> either

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
it needs to be wrapped you can either

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.990 
it needs to be wrapped you can either
cut<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.500> off<00:03:44.680> right<00:03:44.950> around<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.370> top<00:03:45.610> or<00:03:45.970> you

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
cut it off right around the top or you

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.150 
cut it off right around the top or you
can<00:03:46.330> peel<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.630> back<00:03:46.780> but<00:03:47.620> we<00:03:47.740> don't<00:03:47.950> want<00:03:48.100> to

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
can peel it back but we don't want to

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.970 
can peel it back but we don't want to
leave<00:03:48.310> any<00:03:48.460> of<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.730> burlap<00:03:49.120> exposed<00:03:49.980> because

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
leave any of the burlap exposed because

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.090 
leave any of the burlap exposed because
it<00:03:51.160> can<00:03:51.400> dry<00:03:51.760> out<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:53.140> when<00:03:53.380> it<00:03:53.500> dries<00:03:53.830> out

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
it can dry out and when it dries out

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.920 
it can dry out and when it dries out
it's<00:03:54.370> very<00:03:54.640> difficult<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:55.210> get<00:03:55.420> it<00:03:55.540> rewetting

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
it's very difficult to get it rewetting

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.100 
it's very difficult to get it rewetting
again<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:57.220> it's<00:03:57.370> best<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.790> have<00:03:57.820> that<00:03:58.270> bent

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
again so it's best to have that bent

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.740 
again so it's best to have that bent
down<00:03:59.380> so<00:03:59.710> that<00:03:59.740> it's<00:04:00.010> covered<00:04:00.310> with<00:04:00.340> soil<00:04:00.750> or

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
down so that it's covered with soil or

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.890 
down so that it's covered with soil or
just<00:04:02.050> cut<00:04:02.950> off<00:04:03.100> around<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.550> top<00:04:03.820> so<00:04:04.720> that's

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
just cut off around the top so that's

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.510 
just cut off around the top so that's
some<00:04:05.110> of<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:05.260> key<00:04:05.470> things<00:04:05.740> with<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.160> plant

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
some of the key things with that plant

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.040 
some of the key things with that plant
if<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:07.510> purchase<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.290> potted<00:04:08.920> plant<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:10.570> can<00:04:10.870> be

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
if you purchase a potted plant it can be

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.550 
if you purchase a potted plant it can be
a<00:04:11.080> little<00:04:11.260> different<00:04:11.560> situation<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:14.380> one

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
a little different situation this one

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.610 
a little different situation this one
comes<00:04:14.770> out<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.190> pot<00:04:15.430> nicely<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:17.200> can<00:04:17.410> see

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
comes out of the pot nicely you can see

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.599 
comes out of the pot nicely you can see
the<00:04:17.799> roots<00:04:18.239> now<00:04:19.239> what<00:04:19.570> we<00:04:19.690> want<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:20.170> check<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:21.549> a

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
the roots now what we want to check on a

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.000 
the roots now what we want to check on a
plant<00:04:22.000> like<00:04:22.180> this<00:04:22.240> is<00:04:22.780> that<00:04:23.440> there<00:04:23.650> are<00:04:23.800> no

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
plant like this is that there are no

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.070 
plant like this is that there are no
circling<00:04:24.730> roots<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.300> those<00:04:25.450> are<00:04:25.660> roots<00:04:25.900> that

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
circling roots and those are roots that

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.730 
circling roots and those are roots that
grow<00:04:26.290> a

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
grow a

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.960 
grow a
on<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:27.069> inside<00:04:27.490> of<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.789> container<00:04:29.669> if<00:04:30.669> there

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
on the inside of the container if there

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.330 
on the inside of the container if there
are<00:04:31.150> roots<00:04:31.449> like<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:32.020> then<00:04:32.470> we<00:04:32.620> want<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:32.919> cut

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
are roots like that then we want to cut

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.010 
are roots like that then we want to cut
those<00:04:33.550> ok<00:04:34.240> it's<00:04:34.599> ok<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:34.900> cut<00:04:35.199> them<00:04:37.020> because

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
those ok it's ok to cut them because

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.990 
those ok it's ok to cut them because
otherwise<00:04:38.319> those<00:04:38.770> will<00:04:38.979> continue<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:39.729> grow

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
otherwise those will continue to grow

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.450 
otherwise those will continue to grow
around<00:04:40.120> in<00:04:40.509> circles<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.830> that<00:04:41.979> can<00:04:42.220> be<00:04:42.250> the

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
around in circles and that can be the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.960 
around in circles and that can be the
reason<00:04:42.849> a<00:04:42.910> plant<00:04:43.210> dies<00:04:43.509> two<00:04:44.470> three<00:04:45.039> four<00:04:45.699> years

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
reason a plant dies two three four years

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.480 
reason a plant dies two three four years
later<00:04:46.410> from<00:04:47.410> those<00:04:47.620> circling<00:04:48.130> roots<00:04:48.370> that

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
later from those circling roots that

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.890 
later from those circling roots that
will<00:04:48.639> girdle<00:04:48.970> itself<00:04:51.090> we<00:04:52.090> want<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.389> fan<00:04:52.599> these

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
will girdle itself we want to fan these

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.629 
will girdle itself we want to fan these
are<00:04:53.080> these<00:04:53.380> are<00:04:53.440> nice<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:54.069> that<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.340> can<00:04:54.520> get

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
are these are nice so that you can get

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.890 
are these are nice so that you can get
this<00:04:54.819> down<00:04:55.120> in<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.419> ground<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:57.280> fan<00:04:57.610> it<00:04:57.639> out

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
this down in the ground and fan it out

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.930 
this down in the ground and fan it out
same<00:04:58.900> thing<00:04:59.259> do<00:04:59.740> not<00:04:59.919> plant<00:05:00.250> it<00:05:00.370> any<00:05:00.490> deeper

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
same thing do not plant it any deeper

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.879 
same thing do not plant it any deeper
than<00:05:01.419> the<00:05:01.690> top<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.169> soil<00:05:02.409> in<00:05:02.710> that<00:05:02.740> pot<00:05:04.889> now

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
than the top of the soil in that pot now

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.490 
than the top of the soil in that pot now
if<00:05:06.729> it<00:05:06.909> really<00:05:07.210> has<00:05:07.479> a<00:05:07.509> lot<00:05:07.810> of<00:05:07.840> roots<00:05:08.139> growing

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
if it really has a lot of roots growing

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.080 
if it really has a lot of roots growing
along<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.009> bottom<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:09.639> one's<00:05:09.880> nice

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
along the bottom and this one's nice

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.659 
along the bottom and this one's nice
because<00:05:10.569> it<00:05:10.780> doesn't<00:05:11.110> have<00:05:11.289> that<00:05:11.550> but<00:05:12.550> if

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
because it doesn't have that but if

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.070 
because it doesn't have that but if
there<00:05:12.880> are<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.090> number<00:05:13.120> of<00:05:13.419> roots<00:05:13.780> on<00:05:13.990> the

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
there are a number of roots on the

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.749 
there are a number of roots on the
bottom<00:05:14.470> then<00:05:15.069> those<00:05:15.340> need<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:15.669> be<00:05:15.819> severed<00:05:16.720> ok

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
bottom then those need to be severed ok

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.010 
bottom then those need to be severed ok
we<00:05:18.759> want<00:05:18.970> to<00:05:19.060> sever<00:05:19.270> that<00:05:19.479> so<00:05:19.720> they<00:05:19.840> don't

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
we want to sever that so they don't

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.089 
we want to sever that so they don't
continue<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.650> circle<00:05:21.069> and<00:05:21.370> then<00:05:22.090> plant<00:05:22.509> that

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
continue to circle and then plant that

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.409 
continue to circle and then plant that
so<00:05:24.099> those<00:05:24.310> are<00:05:24.490> just<00:05:24.550> some<00:05:24.789> keys<00:05:25.060> about

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
so those are just some keys about

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.110 
so those are just some keys about
