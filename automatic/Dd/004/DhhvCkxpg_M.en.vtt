of garlic and some beans have trouble

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.870 
of garlic and some beans have trouble
getting<00:01:22.990> soft<00:01:23.440> if<00:01:23.649> you<00:01:23.830> salt<00:01:24.100> them<00:01:24.280> too<00:01:24.580> early

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
getting soft if you salt them too early

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.609 
getting soft if you salt them too early
in<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.030> process<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:25.690> we<00:01:25.720> typically<00:01:26.140> cook<00:01:26.410> the

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
in the process so we typically cook the

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.380 
in the process so we typically cook the
beans<00:01:26.799> completely<00:01:27.430> done<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:27.939> then<00:01:28.180> when<00:01:28.299> we

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
beans completely done and then when we

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.969 
beans completely done and then when we
take<00:01:28.540> them<00:01:28.689> off<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.930> stove<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.290> rest<00:01:29.740> in<00:01:29.890> their

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
take them off the stove to rest in their

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.039 
take them off the stove to rest in their
own<00:01:30.070> liquid<00:01:30.310> we<00:01:31.000> season<00:01:31.390> them<00:01:31.510> at<00:01:31.689> that<00:01:31.840> point

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
own liquid we season them at that point

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.469 
own liquid we season them at that point
and<00:01:32.260> then<00:01:32.380> they'll<00:01:32.500> absorb<00:01:32.650> by<00:01:33.430> osmosis<00:01:33.939> they

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
and then they'll absorb by osmosis they

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.590 
and then they'll absorb by osmosis they
absorb<00:01:34.900> this<00:01:35.080> all<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.030> soups<00:01:37.210> come<00:01:37.390> up<00:01:37.479> to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
absorb this all so the soups come up to

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.929 
absorb this all so the soups come up to
a<00:01:37.659> boil<00:01:37.869> and<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:39.100> carrots<00:01:39.430> are<00:01:39.520> well<00:01:39.700> on<00:01:39.850> their

rustic<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.610> lot<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.269> times<00:03:10.450> when<00:03:10.570> we<00:03:10.660> put<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:10.870> a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
rustic a lot of times when we put in a

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.170 
rustic a lot of times when we put in a
blender<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.620> turns<00:03:11.920> into<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.250> green<00:03:12.670> monster

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
blender it turns into this green monster

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.569 
blender it turns into this green monster
which<00:03:13.360> is<00:03:13.540> awesome<00:03:13.780> but<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:14.530> not<00:03:15.100> as<00:03:15.250> rustic

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
which is awesome but it's not as rustic

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:16.740 
which is awesome but it's not as rustic
looking<00:03:15.910> so<00:03:16.239> I'm<00:03:16.299> going<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.450> throw<00:03:16.600> some

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
cheese in a lot of times if you do

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.400 
cheese in a lot of times if you do
decide<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.640> make<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.940> in<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.420> machine<00:03:19.570> I'll<00:03:20.110> fold

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
decide to make it in a machine I'll fold

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.740 
decide to make it in a machine I'll fold
the<00:03:20.530> cheese<00:03:20.739> in<00:03:20.890> last<00:03:21.370> because<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:22.180> lot<00:03:22.720> of

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
the cheese in last because a lot of

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.259 
the cheese in last because a lot of
times<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.590> cheese<00:03:23.920> get<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:24.579> worked<00:03:24.820> up<00:03:25.000> in

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
times the cheese get so worked up in

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.550 
times the cheese get so worked up in
your<00:03:25.480> food<00:03:25.660> processor<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.380> might

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
your food processor that it might

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.970 
your food processor that it might
overheat<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.360> our<00:03:28.360> soup<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:29.530> ready<00:03:29.739> to<00:03:29.890> go

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
overheat it our soup is ready to go

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.560 
overheat it our soup is ready to go
because<00:03:30.430> vegetables<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.090> know<00:03:31.180> when<00:03:31.360> they're

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
because vegetables you know when they're

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.630 
because vegetables you know when they're
cooked<00:03:31.840> they're<00:03:32.200> they're<00:03:32.410> sweet<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.010> with

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
cooked they're they're sweet and with

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.310 
cooked they're they're sweet and with
the<00:03:33.760> pesto<00:03:34.120> there's<00:03:34.450> some<00:03:34.660> richness<00:03:34.989> and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
the pesto there's some richness and

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.020 
the pesto there's some richness and
creaminess<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.799> that<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.430> typically<00:03:36.670> maybe

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
creaminess to that and typically maybe

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.520 
creaminess to that and typically maybe
it's<00:03:37.209> harder<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.480> marry<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.780> soup<00:03:38.049> with<00:03:38.320> that

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
it's harder to marry a soup with that

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.199 
it's harder to marry a soup with that
style<00:03:38.799> of<00:03:38.980> wine<00:03:39.160> but<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.610> figure<00:03:39.910> this<00:03:40.030> one

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
style of wine but I figure this one

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.569 
style of wine but I figure this one
works<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.780> know<00:03:40.810> just<00:03:41.170> rich<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.769> but<00:03:42.340> light

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
works you know just rich and but light

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.390 
works you know just rich and but light
and<00:03:42.760> fresh<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.060> vegetable<00:03:43.630> yes<00:03:44.260> yeah<00:03:44.980> that's

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
and fresh and vegetable yes yeah that's

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.560 
and fresh and vegetable yes yeah that's
one<00:03:45.549> of<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.670> reasons<00:03:45.880> I<00:03:45.940> love<00:03:46.060> this<00:03:46.180> soup<00:03:46.390> it

one of the reasons I love this soup it

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.940 
one of the reasons I love this soup it
kind<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.780> finishes<00:03:47.049> up<00:03:47.290> summer<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.709> fall<00:03:47.920> with
