designs and ideas been kind of going

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.189 
designs and ideas been kind of going
every<00:00:14.940> which<00:00:15.030> way<00:00:15.090> but<00:00:15.300> today<00:00:15.720> we're<00:00:15.900> going<00:00:16.049> to

every which way but today we're going to

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.019 
every which way but today we're going to
make<00:00:16.379> one<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.680> my<00:00:16.859> favorites<00:00:17.369> an<00:00:17.550> all-time

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
make one of my favorites an all-time

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.480 
make one of my favorites an all-time
classic<00:00:18.169> origami<00:00:19.169> and<00:00:19.859> that's<00:00:20.009> a<00:00:20.220> cootie

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
classic origami and that's a cootie

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.980 
classic origami and that's a cootie
catcher<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.970> what<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.269> call<00:00:21.449> them<00:00:21.599> usually<00:00:21.749> in

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
catcher is what we call them usually in

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.439 
catcher is what we call them usually in
the<00:00:22.169> States<00:00:22.759> they<00:00:23.759> actually<00:00:24.179> probably

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the States they actually probably

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.419 
the States they actually probably
originally<00:00:25.320> served<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> purpose<00:00:26.279> of

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
originally served more of a purpose of

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.950 
originally served more of a purpose of
containing<00:00:26.999> different<00:00:27.150> kinds<00:00:27.659> of<00:00:27.720> things

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
containing different kinds of things

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.569 
containing different kinds of things
because<00:00:28.289> there's<00:00:28.499> four<00:00:28.739> nice<00:00:28.919> little<00:00:29.220> pockets

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
because there's four nice little pockets

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.880 
because there's four nice little pockets
when<00:00:29.759> you<00:00:29.849> turn<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.119> upside<00:00:30.419> down<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.679> can

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
when you turn it upside down so you can

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.470 
when you turn it upside down so you can
put<00:00:32.130> different<00:00:32.430> things<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.820> there<00:00:32.970> not<00:00:33.270> some

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
put different things in there not some

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.040 
put different things in there not some
candies<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.050> sweets<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.530> such<00:00:35.210> but<00:00:36.210> then<00:00:36.960> you

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
candies and sweets and such but then you

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.900 
candies and sweets and such but then you
can<00:00:37.170> flip<00:00:37.289> it<00:00:37.410> around<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.370> fun<00:00:38.730> little

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
can flip it around and do fun little

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.389 
can flip it around and do fun little
fortune-telling<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.949> we<00:00:41.280> would

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
fortune-telling or you know we we would

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.220 
fortune-telling or you know we we would
use<00:00:41.550> them<00:00:41.699> to<00:00:41.820> catch<00:00:42.000> cooties<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.719> stuff<00:00:42.989> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
use them to catch cooties and stuff and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.540 
use them to catch cooties and stuff and
then<00:00:43.350> there's<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:43.949> many<00:00:44.039> different<00:00:44.399> fun<00:00:44.519> ways

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
then there's so many different fun ways

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.060 
then there's so many different fun ways
to<00:00:44.850> play<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.359> so<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.800> pure

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
to play with it so this is a pure

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.189 
to play with it so this is a pure
origami<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.269> need<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.449> regular<00:00:48.870> piece

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
origami so you just need a regular piece

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.770 
origami so you just need a regular piece
of<00:00:49.440> square<00:00:50.039> origami<00:00:50.579> paper<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.660> use

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
of square origami paper but you can use

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.349 
of square origami paper but you can use
any<00:00:52.019> paper<00:00:52.579> actually<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.609> think<00:00:53.730> printer<00:00:54.210> paper

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
any paper actually I think printer paper

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.939 
any paper actually I think printer paper
holds<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.019> better<00:00:55.230> especially<00:00:55.500> they're<00:00:55.800> gonna

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
holds up better especially they're gonna

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.229 
holds up better especially they're gonna
be<00:00:56.039> using<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.579> long<00:00:56.730> time

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
be using it for a long time

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.540 
be using it for a long time
origami<00:00:57.899> paper<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.260> little<00:00:58.469> thinner<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.920> it

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
origami paper is a little thinner and it

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.849 
origami paper is a little thinner and it
kind<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.089> doesn't<00:01:00.449> tend<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.989> hold<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.499> as<00:01:01.649> well

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
kind of doesn't tend to hold up as well

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.270 
kind of doesn't tend to hold up as well
so<00:01:02.420> I'm<00:01:03.420> using<00:01:03.600> 15<00:01:04.050> by<00:01:04.170> 15<00:01:04.230> centimeter<00:01:05.010> paper

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
so I'm using 15 by 15 centimeter paper

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
so I'm using 15 by 15 centimeter paper
and<00:01:05.640> I'll<00:01:06.510> let<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.750> guys<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and I'll let you guys know the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.330 
and I'll let you guys know the
dimensions<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.770> everything<00:01:08.100> when<00:01:08.220> we're

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
dimensions of everything when we're

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.060 
dimensions of everything when we're
finished<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.850> kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> give<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.329> an<00:01:09.420> idea<00:01:10.070> but

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
finished to kind of give you an idea but

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.560 
finished to kind of give you an idea but
I<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.579> definitely<00:01:12.000> use<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
I think you can definitely use this to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.810 
I think you can definitely use this to
make<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:13.079> use<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.680> big<00:01:13.860> nice<00:01:14.159> paper<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
make like use really big nice paper and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.399 
make like use really big nice paper and
make<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> really<00:01:15.210> pretty<00:01:15.329> container<00:01:16.079> if<00:01:16.259> you're

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
make a really pretty container if you're

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.609 
make a really pretty container if you're
if<00:01:16.710> you're<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.460> interested<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.060> so

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
if you're you know interested in that so

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.020 
if you're you know interested in that so
what<00:01:19.619> we're<00:01:19.740> gonna<00:01:19.829> do<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.280> then<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.759> start

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
what we're gonna do here then is start

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.429 
what we're gonna do here then is start
off<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.479> our<00:01:21.600> paper<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
off with our paper and I'm going to

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.160 
off with our paper and I'm going to
start<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.740> my<00:01:22.890> color<00:01:23.220> side<00:01:23.579> facing<00:01:24.149> down<00:01:24.180> go

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
start with my color side facing down go

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.319 
start with my color side facing down go
ahead<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.439> put<00:01:25.950> some<00:01:26.189> creases<00:01:26.970> by<00:01:27.090> just

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
ahead and put some creases by just

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.350 
ahead and put some creases by just
folding<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.020> paper<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.439> half<00:01:28.680> both<00:01:29.610> ways<00:01:29.909> so

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
folding the paper in half both ways so

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.609 
folding the paper in half both ways so
that<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.689> kind<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.899> get<00:01:31.049> an<00:01:31.140> idea<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.439> where

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that we can kind of get an idea of where

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:40.630 
that we can kind of get an idea of where
our<00:01:31.710> center<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.190 

open<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.760> up<00:01:41.850> then<00:01:42.540> we're<00:01:42.630> going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.780> take<00:01:42.990> each

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
open it up then we're going to take each

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.469 
open it up then we're going to take each
of<00:01:43.440> these<00:01:43.590> four<00:01:43.950> corners<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.700> fold<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.299> into

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
of these four corners and fold it into

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.640 
of these four corners and fold it into
the<00:01:45.840> center<00:01:47.869> kind<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.990> line<00:01:49.170> up<00:01:49.350> along<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
the center kind of line up along the

00:01:49.650 --> 00:02:08.719 
the center kind of line up along the
edges<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.580> this<00:02:07.459> so<00:02:08.459> once<00:02:08.610> you've

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
edges as you do this so once you've

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.669 
edges as you do this so once you've
gotten<00:02:08.940> all<00:02:09.090> four<00:02:09.420> corners<00:02:09.929> folded<00:02:10.410> into<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
gotten all four corners folded into the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.240 
gotten all four corners folded into the
center

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
center

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.520 
center
flip<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.700> over<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.150> repeat<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:13.080> steps<00:02:13.290> this

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
flip it over and repeat the steps this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.460 
flip it over and repeat the steps this
time<00:02:13.800> folding<00:02:14.160> each<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.760> those<00:02:14.880> edges<00:02:15.470> towards

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
time folding each of those edges towards

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.560 
time folding each of those edges towards
the<00:02:16.680> center<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.250> just<00:02:17.280> take<00:02:18.090> care<00:02:18.360> when

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
the center and just take care when

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.060 
the center and just take care when
you're<00:02:18.690> creasing<00:02:18.989> out<00:02:19.320> these<00:02:19.530> edges<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.010> you

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
you're creasing out these edges that you

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.890 
you're creasing out these edges that you
don't<00:02:20.310> accidentally<00:02:20.760> snag<00:02:21.300> right<00:02:21.570> here<00:02:21.810> on

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
don't accidentally snag right here on

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.259 
don't accidentally snag right here on
these<00:02:21.989> pockets<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.739> tear<00:02:23.040> your<00:02:23.220> paper<00:02:23.430> for

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
these pockets and tear your paper for

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:44.000 
these pockets and tear your paper for
you<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.660> go<00:02:24.750> ahead<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.110> fold<00:02:25.319> in

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.710 

once<00:02:45.010> you've<00:02:45.130> got<00:02:45.280> all<00:02:45.550> four<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:45.940> those<00:02:46.180> folded

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
once you've got all four of those folded

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.960 
once you've got all four of those folded
in<00:02:46.870> then<00:02:47.590> we<00:02:47.830> can<00:02:47.980> go<00:02:48.100> ahead<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:48.400> crease

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
in then we can go ahead and just crease

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.530 
in then we can go ahead and just crease
right<00:02:49.270> along<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.870> center<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:52.150> way<00:02:52.390> as

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
right along the center and this way as

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.850 
right along the center and this way as
well<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.720> once<00:02:58.840> you've<00:02:58.990> gotten<00:02:59.200> those<00:02:59.410> two

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
well so once you've gotten those two

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.730 
well so once you've gotten those two
creases<00:03:00.220> there<00:03:00.820> then<00:03:01.300> we<00:03:01.480> can<00:03:01.690> also<00:03:01.870> crease

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
creases there then we can also crease

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.250 
creases there then we can also crease
the<00:03:03.160> diagonal<00:03:03.940> by<00:03:04.240> folding<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.810> other<00:03:04.840> way

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
the diagonal by folding the other way

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.780 
the diagonal by folding the other way
and<00:03:05.620> that's<00:03:06.070> just<00:03:06.220> going<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.370> make<00:03:06.430> everything

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
and that's just going to make everything

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.210 
and that's just going to make everything
a<00:03:07.000> little<00:03:07.120> easier<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.780> come<00:03:07.960> together<00:03:08.140> if<00:03:08.770> you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
a little easier to come together if you

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.390 
a little easier to come together if you
you<00:03:10.060> know<00:03:10.150> didn't<00:03:10.540> want<00:03:10.780> really<00:03:11.020> strong

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
you know didn't want really strong

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.340 
you know didn't want really strong
creases<00:03:12.400> in<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.940> top<00:03:13.150> part<00:03:13.480> especially<00:03:14.110> of

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
creases in the top part especially of

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.200 
creases in the top part especially of
stuff<00:03:14.680> I'll<00:03:14.860> show<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.070> as<00:03:15.280> we<00:03:15.430> finish<00:03:16.090> this

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
stuff I'll show you as we finish this

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.230 
stuff I'll show you as we finish this
off<00:03:16.450> but<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:17.200> could<00:03:17.470> just<00:03:18.160> pinch<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:19.000> get

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
off but you could just pinch it to get

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.090 
off but you could just pinch it to get
to<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.510> shape<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.720> we<00:03:19.990> need<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:20.440> I've

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
to the shape that we need but I've

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.530 
to the shape that we need but I've
gotten<00:03:21.460> the<00:03:21.520> creases<00:03:21.910> there<00:03:22.090> just<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:22.360> make<00:03:22.390> it

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
gotten the creases there just to make it

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.580 
gotten the creases there just to make it
a<00:03:22.600> little<00:03:22.690> easier<00:03:23.080> but<00:03:23.200> you'll<00:03:23.320> see<00:03:23.500> it

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
a little easier but you'll see it

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.200 
a little easier but you'll see it
creates<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.010> crease<00:03:24.280> right<00:03:24.460> along<00:03:24.520> these<00:03:24.880> flats

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
creates a crease right along these flats

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.550 
creates a crease right along these flats
and<00:03:25.540> if<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.720> didn't<00:03:25.990> want<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.380> what<00:03:26.500> you

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
and if you didn't want that what you

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.740 
and if you didn't want that what you
could<00:03:26.740> do<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:27.010> just<00:03:27.280> kind<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.000> gently<00:03:28.390> give<00:03:28.720> a

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
could do is just kind of gently give a

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.860 
could do is just kind of gently give a
little<00:03:28.960> pinch<00:03:29.380> here<00:03:29.770> and<00:03:30.480> allow<00:03:31.480> each<00:03:31.840> of

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
little pinch here and allow each of

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.870 
little pinch here and allow each of
these<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.470> come<00:03:32.650> together<00:03:32.800> to<00:03:33.280> create<00:03:33.580> kind<00:03:33.760> of

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
these to come together to create kind of

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.840 
these to come together to create kind of
that<00:03:34.170> shape<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.410> then<00:03:35.470> if<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.310> didn't<00:03:36.610> want<00:03:36.790> a

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
that shape and then if you didn't want a

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.460 
that shape and then if you didn't want a
sharp<00:03:37.180> crease<00:03:37.480> there<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:37.900> could<00:03:38.110> then<00:03:38.260> just

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
sharp crease there you could then just

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:47.220 
sharp crease there you could then just
pop<00:03:38.680> these<00:03:38.890> out<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:45.270> this<00:03:46.270> is<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.630> part<00:03:46.930> where

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
pop these out and this is the part where

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.440 
pop these out and this is the part where
you<00:03:47.800> do<00:03:48.040> if<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.460> just<00:03:48.490> look<00:03:48.970> at<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.150> from

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
you do if you just look at it from

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.190 
you do if you just look at it from
backwards<00:03:50.110> way<00:03:50.260> this<00:03:50.860> is<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.190> nice<00:03:51.640> little

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
backwards way this is a nice little

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.780 
backwards way this is a nice little
container<00:03:53.200> for<00:03:53.590> snacks<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.400> treats<00:03:54.550> and

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
container for snacks and treats and

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.190 
container for snacks and treats and
goodies<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.210> such<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:55.660> can<00:03:55.720> make<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.020> really

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
goodies and such you can make it really

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.770 
goodies and such you can make it really
big<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.710> put<00:03:56.830> nuts<00:03:57.070> in<00:03:57.220> there<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:57.550> stuff<00:03:57.790> or

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
big and put nuts in there and stuff or

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.680 
big and put nuts in there and stuff or
you<00:03:59.430> flip<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.550> over<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:01.120> you've<00:04:01.270> got<00:04:01.480> your

you flip it over and you've got your

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.840 
you flip it over and you've got your
traditional<00:04:01.840> cootie<00:04:02.410> catcher<00:04:02.680> here<00:04:03.100> where

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.390 
make good use of it but you can put
numbers<00:04:09.730> or<00:04:10.060> color<00:04:10.810> words<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.380> such<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.890> you

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
numbers or color words and such and you

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.910 
numbers or color words and such and you
know<00:04:12.490> count<00:04:12.730> them<00:04:12.910> off<00:04:13.110> until<00:04:14.110> you<00:04:14.530> get<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.830> the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
know count them off until you get to the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.500 
know count them off until you get to the
edge<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.400> then<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.550> can<00:04:15.820> choose<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.150> number

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
edge and then you can choose a number

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.510 
edge and then you can choose a number
count<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:17.020> off<00:04:17.049> as<00:04:17.350> well<00:04:17.530> every<00:04:18.010> place<00:04:18.370> I

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
count that off as well every place I

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.770 
count that off as well every place I
think<00:04:18.700> has<00:04:18.820> different<00:04:19.120> ways<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.359> doing<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.720> but

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
think has different ways of doing it but

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.660 
think has different ways of doing it but
ideally<00:04:20.650> what<00:04:20.799> you<00:04:20.890> get<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.160> is<00:04:21.190> choosing

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
ideally what you get to is choosing

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.640 
ideally what you get to is choosing
something<00:04:21.970> here<00:04:22.180> where<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:22.390> stop<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:23.380> flip

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
something here where you stop you flip

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.410 
something here where you stop you flip
it<00:04:23.770> open<00:04:23.920> and<00:04:24.340> there's<00:04:24.670> a<00:04:24.730> message<00:04:25.000> written

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
it open and there's a message written

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.510 
it open and there's a message written
underneath<00:04:26.350> each<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.800> these<00:04:26.890> sections<00:04:27.220> you

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
underneath each of these sections you

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.130 
underneath each of these sections you
get<00:04:27.730> a<00:04:27.760> total<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.150> eight<00:04:28.300> different<00:04:28.540> kinds<00:04:28.930> of

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
get a total of eight different kinds of

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.830 
get a total of eight different kinds of
fortunes<00:04:29.590> or<00:04:30.220> something<00:04:30.610> along<00:04:30.790> those<00:04:30.850> lines

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
fortunes or something along those lines

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.590 
fortunes or something along those lines
to<00:04:32.260> kind<00:04:32.470> of<00:04:32.530> have<00:04:32.830> fun<00:04:32.860> with<00:04:33.220> so<00:04:33.570> definitely<00:04:34.570> a

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
to kind of have fun with so definitely a

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.600 
to kind of have fun with so definitely a
tried-and-true<00:04:35.170> origami<00:04:35.830> that<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.460> know<00:04:36.580> I

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
tried-and-true origami that you know I

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.180 
tried-and-true origami that you know I
know<00:04:36.820> I<00:04:37.270> did<00:04:38.020> all<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.470> time<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:38.920> probably

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
know I did all the time and probably

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.890 
know I did all the time and probably
didn't<00:04:39.400> even<00:04:39.460> think<00:04:39.730> it<00:04:39.880> was<00:04:39.940> origami<00:04:40.600> at<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
didn't even think it was origami at the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.230 
didn't even think it was origami at the
time<00:04:41.080> because<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:42.610> know<00:04:42.700> I<00:04:42.730> had<00:04:42.970> such<00:04:43.120> an

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
time because you know I had such an

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.790 
time because you know I had such an
image<00:04:43.540> that<00:04:43.690> that<00:04:43.750> was<00:04:44.050> just<00:04:44.170> cranes<00:04:44.530> and

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
image that that was just cranes and

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.610 
image that that was just cranes and
stuff<00:04:45.040> like<00:04:45.190> that<00:04:45.430> but<00:04:45.760> a<00:04:46.170> big<00:04:47.170> part<00:04:47.410> of<00:04:47.470> my

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
stuff like that but a big part of my

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.970 
stuff like that but a big part of my
time<00:04:47.800> growing<00:04:48.340> up<00:04:48.550> for<00:04:48.940> sure<00:04:49.210> Canseco<00:04:49.980> but

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
time growing up for sure Canseco but

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.100 
time growing up for sure Canseco but
that<00:04:51.130> is<00:04:51.370> our

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
that is our

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.320 
that is our
finished<00:04:52.550> projects<00:04:53.550> there<00:04:53.760> let<00:04:54.030> me<00:04:54.060> tell<00:04:54.210> you

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
finished projects there let me tell you

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.350 
finished projects there let me tell you
the<00:04:54.540> dimensions<00:04:55.140> in<00:04:55.380> case<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.860> were<00:04:56.240> you<00:04:57.240> know

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
the dimensions in case you were you know

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.270 
the dimensions in case you were you know
trying<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.900> use<00:04:58.080> it<00:04:58.290> as<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.500> was<00:04:58.920> saying<00:04:59.130> like<00:04:59.220> a

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
trying to use it as I was saying like a

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.880 
trying to use it as I was saying like a
container<00:04:59.760> or<00:04:59.880> something<00:05:00.330> like<00:05:00.450> that<00:05:00.510> I<00:05:01.500> think

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
container or something like that I think

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.800 
container or something like that I think
you<00:05:02.280> know<00:05:02.370> for<00:05:02.580> kids<00:05:02.760> hands<00:05:03.060> especially<00:05:03.630> this

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
you know for kids hands especially this

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.660 
you know for kids hands especially this
is<00:05:03.870> really<00:05:04.320> just<00:05:04.350> perfect<00:05:05.010> for<00:05:05.220> your<00:05:05.280> fingers

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
is really just perfect for your fingers

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.640 
is really just perfect for your fingers
and<00:05:05.850> such<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.390> do<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.110> don't<00:05:07.320> really<00:05:07.440> need

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
and such to do so you don't really need

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.290 
and such to do so you don't really need
to<00:05:07.860> change<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.280> size<00:05:08.490> if<00:05:08.730> you're<00:05:08.820> using<00:05:09.030> it

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
to change the size if you're using it

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.610 
to change the size if you're using it
for<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.480> purpose<00:05:09.630> of<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:10.020> being<00:05:10.170> a<00:05:10.290> fortune

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
for the purpose of it being a fortune

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.450 
for the purpose of it being a fortune
teller<00:05:10.740> but<00:05:11.670> um<00:05:11.850> it<00:05:12.270> stands<00:05:12.600> about<00:05:13.460> five

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
teller but um it stands about five

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:25.040 
teller but um it stands about five
centimeters<00:05:15.120> tall<00:05:23.570> so<00:05:24.570> that<00:05:24.600> kind<00:05:24.900> of<00:05:24.930> gives

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
centimeters tall so that kind of gives

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.990 
centimeters tall so that kind of gives
you<00:05:25.200> an<00:05:25.320> idea<00:05:25.410> of<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:26.250> dimension<00:05:26.730> is<00:05:26.820> there

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
you an idea of the dimension is there

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.300 
you an idea of the dimension is there
for<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.420> if<00:05:28.260> you<00:05:28.500> were<00:05:28.590> going<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:28.890> be<00:05:28.980> using

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
for that if you were going to be using

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.060 
for that if you were going to be using
it<00:05:29.400> backwards<00:05:29.790> as<00:05:30.090> a<00:05:30.120> container<00:05:30.540> but<00:05:31.470> that

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
it backwards as a container but that

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.790 
it backwards as a container but that
should<00:05:32.310> give<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:32.610> your<00:05:32.850> completed<00:05:33.800> project

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
should give you your completed project

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.470 
should give you your completed project
