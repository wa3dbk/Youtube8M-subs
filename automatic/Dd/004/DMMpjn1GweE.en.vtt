richness flour tiny bit more water I've
got<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> wok<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.670> here<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.289> ground<00:01:01.289> nut<00:01:01.499> oil

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
got a wok going here with ground nut oil

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.749 
got a wok going here with ground nut oil
it<00:01:01.889> doesn't<00:01:02.159> burn<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:03.949> bit<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> deep<00:01:05.250> fried<00:01:05.549> to

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
it doesn't burn a bit of a deep fried to

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.569 
it doesn't burn a bit of a deep fried to
give<00:01:05.939> us<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.670> then<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:09.840> take<00:01:10.140> your

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
give us that and then you take your

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.160 
give us that and then you take your
salmon<00:01:11.579> bits<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.270> flour<00:01:12.600> them<00:01:12.869> first

salmon bits and you flour them first
that<00:01:13.380> helps<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> batter<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.399> sticks<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that helps the batter to sticks to the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.940 
that helps the batter to sticks to the
salmon<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.039> then<00:01:18.079> better<00:01:19.079> than<00:01:19.380> let<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
salmon you then better than let the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
makes this is a completely new to me

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.080 
makes this is a completely new to me
I've<00:04:09.900> never<00:04:10.110> made<00:04:10.470> tempura<00:04:11.280> with<00:04:11.549> egg<00:04:11.760> yolks

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
I've never made tempura with egg yolks

separate egg white and corn flour which

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.409 
separate egg white and corn flour which
I<00:04:17.669> suppose<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.060> probably<00:04:18.540> much<00:04:18.720> in<00:04:18.930> writer

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
I suppose is probably much in writer

straight away that you'll then be doing
up<00:04:40.700> too<00:04:41.700> hot<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.090> eat<00:04:43.789> okay

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.159 

okay<00:04:53.240> now<00:04:53.449> I'll<00:04:53.570> take<00:04:53.720> them<00:04:53.840> over<00:04:53.960> what

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
okay now I'll take them over what

they've had about three minutes in there

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.999 
they've had about three minutes in there
which<00:04:55.790> is<00:04:55.910> probably<00:04:56.210> enough<00:04:56.770> fish<00:04:57.770> doesn't

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
which is probably enough fish doesn't

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
frozen these are fabulous I didn't think

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.590 
frozen these are fabulous I didn't think
they'd<00:05:04.250> turn<00:05:04.520> out<00:05:04.669> as<00:05:04.789> well<00:05:04.970> as<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.150> form<00:05:05.419> that
