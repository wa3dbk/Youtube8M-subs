00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 You see how many coins I have 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.870
 as we seem to which suddenly 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.029
 I'm already 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.160
 and how many do as I have and me 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.120
 you see all my workers when 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.170
 now always on the worker 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.120
 you can even see that on the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.000
 Extremely high quality has a lot 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.150
 speed and extreme endurance like 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.769
 you do that like your motto vodka 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:32.460
 factory wears on your ios device or 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:36.950
 chatting without jailbreak right now so 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.320
 like me i have two workers here 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.350
 and I have degrees plus 1000 coins and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.850
 seems 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:51.809
 and if we look like here now 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.800
 a lot of fans i have like that almost non-stop 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.930
 what you need 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.840
 you need to program what you for 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.250
 needs used mac then you have to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.229
 just connect your device 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.470
 he already needed a program like the skate 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.420
 or export iphone box with me quasi 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.390
 look at the files on your device 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.180
 I can give a link in there 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.939
 the description and property list the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:24.090
 gate there I also send you a link in 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:26.970
 the description here because this time 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.380
 out then goes our memory space 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.880
 partly called that also apps 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:39.000
 Directly and gdl was an app looking for him 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.079
 look at motor world at that time double- click 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.820
 her many files 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.520
 it's probably pictures this time 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.659
 I know what sorted best 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.430
 art you would have somewhere so most will 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.659
 they actually see the unknown 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.640
 files that stop scores at the back 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.439
 and the files 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.579
 she has his where to put the whole game 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.270
 what I'm in there 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.130
 and if we now our money first 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.179
 want to bring front wall 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:13.599
 then 3-player safe data file burns 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.120
 you usually copy on your desk 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.650
 you can just take off 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.340
 sometimes you have to say yes to the mac 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.220
 copy 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.280
 Here I can just take off and then 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:31.900
 I open the file in the property list 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:33.550
 editor such as would so something here 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.280
 For example, you see general cash value 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.370
 its euro shines channel cornwall 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.250
 next to your now channel donath value 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.239
 how many have donuts you can now 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.640
 it simply times cash value to ten 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:56.850
 make millions 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:56.850
 a value of 100 billion 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.819
 If you want to adjust donuts note 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.890
 that it will restart a few more times 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.720
 open initially condition is completely full 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.310
 I do not know why that happens 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.720
 okay now finally the whole and often 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.970
 Barely puts on just pull back 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.200
 this skate is not then 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.489
 you just have to say to grab 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.980
 copy because the file said and there 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.950
 jutta already exists 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.600
 you copied out just said 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.420
 replace 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.000
 now this must have worked 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.609
 but now we will continue right away and 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.780
 increase our profession a bit 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.870
 our number of fans 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.709
 he consumes the file reputation data 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.569
 Points 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.060
 that also moves back to the 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.720
 desk and opens the in the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.480
 property list editor for example 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.450
 general reputation he could now too 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.709
 Something write down that but stop 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.840
 watch that the number is not too big 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.030
 namely everywhere else you can to 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.079
 failing to come 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.100
 you 're just so on now 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.050
 quite high 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.350
 and then we save that again and 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:17.170
 finally files then copy like that 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:18.820
 Replace ours 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.950
 that concludes with proper work 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.520
 we need to get the file work 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:28.200
 edited alone as little stored 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.880
 you have that way through more complicated 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.000
 it would have something 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.900
 pay first 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.820
 and that is always how it stands here 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:47.080
 there are many elements in it , eg 1 in it 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:49.870
 and that there is a worker separating there 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.430
 give you a price what is a paper 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.970
 for example, but down there I have too 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.630
 something in it 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:03.040
 a worker that means, for example 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:06.540
 Knecht so what we just do now 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:13.900
 can you come here now? 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:20.590
 look at ecomodel data here quality 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:25.360
 maximum I already 50 billion now 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:28.600
 Just make five million and 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.630
 minimal the stolen yet 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.290
 I always had the quality or 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.780
 Speeds or endurance that 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.300
 look at the minimum value from the 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.880
 minimum value then trained but in the 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.630
 few donuts are in which items then 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.720
 it's kinda in between when we do that 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:51.730
 also increase a bit 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:54.490
 buchholz surface is not exactly big 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:59.889
 such as maximum speed we our also a time 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:06.770
 a bit higher so maximum too 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:08.780
 just like that, he's just like her 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.800
 can now be here quite what I what 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:15.289
 always try to do that too 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.750
 change name and description text though 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.110
 you do not need that easy now 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.130
 also 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.880
 here our work now if we are so 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.139
 often implicate workers to squeeze out 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.580
 so now do two but we have 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:33.020
 but the healthy one if one now 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:36.860
 we do 20 times once 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:41.810
 Workers increased saving and 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:46.690
 end and the file then on again 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:48.530
 Copy and replace sybase 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.090
 then we have it all 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.009
 made 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:56.870
 that can sometimes look what 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:58.759
 happened so start a game 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:06.949
 the same to me as we coins already 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:08.719
 have and how many bills and the 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:14.240
 quality is pretty high and the 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:15.680
 speed also how fast the 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.039
 Stamina is also possible 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.259
 set as actually done 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:24.740
 we could do even if you 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:26.960
 tutorial to draw motor world cafÃ© 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.099
 I hope you liked it if so 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.940
 then let the thumb up 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:32.780
 happy or commented video 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.319
 we'll meet again next time 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.319
 Video
