00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
luck so I brought the vectorized art in

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.070 
luck so I brought the vectorized art in
to<00:02:08.409> cinema<00:02:08.830> 4d<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:09.599> extruded<00:02:10.599> it<00:02:10.750> give<00:02:11.050> it

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
to cinema 4d and extruded it give it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.960 
to cinema 4d and extruded it give it
some<00:02:11.200> colors<00:02:11.680> made<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.580> look<00:02:12.610> kind<00:02:12.849> of

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
some colors made it look kind of

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.899 
some colors made it look kind of
metallic<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.599> shiny<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.200> epic<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.220> then<00:02:15.879> I

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
metallic and shiny and epic and then I

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.320 
metallic and shiny and epic and then I
shattered<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.659> right<00:02:17.409> in<00:02:17.560> orgrimmar<00:02:18.069> as

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
shattered it right in orgrimmar as

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.910 
shattered it right in orgrimmar as
chinglish<00:02:19.330> drums<00:02:19.629> through<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.709> thought

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
chinglish drums through it so I thought

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.619 
chinglish drums through it so I thought
that<00:02:21.040> was<00:02:21.129> pretty<00:02:21.280> badass<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:21.940> when<00:02:22.060> he<00:02:22.150> lands

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
that was pretty badass but when he lands

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.869 
that was pretty badass but when he lands
that<00:02:22.989> was<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.319> part<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:24.340> wanted<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.730> focus

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
that was the part that I wanted to focus

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.680 
that was the part that I wanted to focus
on<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:26.319> fire<00:02:26.739> emanates<00:02:27.400> outward<00:02:27.879> from

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
on and just fire emanates outward from

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.600 
on and just fire emanates outward from
where<00:02:28.930> he<00:02:29.019> landed<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.650> that's<00:02:30.400> basically

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
where he landed and that's basically

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.350 
where he landed and that's basically
what<00:02:30.909> the<00:02:31.000> concentrate<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.599> all<00:02:31.749> about

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
what the concentrate is all about

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.030 
what the concentrate is all about
now<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.050> don't<00:02:33.170> know<00:02:33.320> if<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.470> guys<00:02:33.560> noticed<00:02:33.800> but

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
if you look really closely you can see

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.070 
if you look really closely you can see
the<00:02:36.020> tattoo<00:02:36.380> of<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.560> X<00:02:36.800> right<00:02:37.460> under<00:02:37.640> his<00:02:37.760> eye
