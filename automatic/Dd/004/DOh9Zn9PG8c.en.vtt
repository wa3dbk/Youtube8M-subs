to speed up your Galaxy s6 or s6 edge so
if<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.199> can<00:00:16.350> see<00:00:16.500> right<00:00:16.529> now<00:00:16.770> I've<00:00:17.039> got<00:00:17.190> an<00:00:17.279> s6

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
if you can see right now I've got an s6

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.779 
if you can see right now I've got an s6
and<00:00:17.820> s6<00:00:17.910> edge<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.990> my<00:00:19.619> 6h<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.520> just

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
and s6 edge here and my 6h that just

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.310 
and s6 edge here and my 6h that just
appears<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> little<00:00:21.930> bit<00:00:22.109> more

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
appears to be a little bit more

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.380 
appears to be a little bit more
responsive<00:00:22.949> both<00:00:23.130> back<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.550> same<00:00:23.760> internals

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
responsive both back the same internals

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.470 
responsive both back the same internals
underneath<00:00:25.400> it's<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.789> little<00:00:26.939> tweak<00:00:27.150> that

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
underneath it's just a little tweak that

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.450 
underneath it's just a little tweak that
I<00:00:27.539> did<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.410> very<00:00:28.650> simple<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.310> doesn't

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
I did it's very simple to do it doesn't

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.040 
I did it's very simple to do it doesn't

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
animation scale turn it to 0.5 again the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.889 
animation scale turn it to 0.5 again the
transition<00:00:59.850> animation<00:01:00.390> scale<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
transition animation scale and the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.310 
transition animation scale and the
animator<00:01:01.199> duration<00:01:01.530> scale<00:01:01.800> all<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.430> 0.5<00:01:03.320> so

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
animator duration scale all to 0.5 so

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.050 
animator duration scale all to 0.5 so
now<00:01:04.439> your<00:01:04.619> phone<00:01:04.830> will<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.580> end<00:01:05.760> the

now your phone will the end the
animations<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.780> been<00:01:06.960> cut<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.680> mean<00:01:08.130> have

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

been<00:01:08.430> sped<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.890> would<00:01:11.159> feel<00:01:12.020> faster<00:01:14.360> so

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
been sped up so it would feel faster so

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.399 
been sped up so it would feel faster so
that's<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.280> guys<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.670> pretty<00:01:17.939> simple<00:01:18.409> tip

I<00:01:19.590> generally<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.369> savanah<00:01:20.790> getting<00:01:21.180> new

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
I generally do this savanah getting new

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.910 
I generally do this savanah getting new
Samsung<00:01:21.810> device<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.650> thought<00:01:22.770> I'll

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
Samsung device so I just thought I'll

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.219 
Samsung device so I just thought I'll
let<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.400> guys<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:24.840> some<00:01:25.080> of

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
let you guys know and then if some of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.550 
let you guys know and then if some of
you<00:01:25.380> want<00:01:26.210> functionality<00:01:27.210> over<00:01:27.390> looks<00:01:27.750> then

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
you want functionality over looks then

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.530 
you want functionality over looks then
you<00:01:28.680> could<00:01:28.799> actually<00:01:28.950> go<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.850> ahead<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.240> turn

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
you could actually go go ahead and turn

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.340 
you could actually go go ahead and turn
off<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.259> animation<00:01:32.009> scale<00:01:32.220> totally<00:01:33.350> which

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
off the animation scale totally which

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.200 
off the animation scale totally which
means<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.950> will<00:01:35.100> not<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.549> any<00:01:35.729> transitions

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
means you will not have any transitions

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.510 
means you will not have any transitions
when<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.450> open<00:01:36.750> apps<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.140> stuff<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.710> when<00:01:38.460> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
when you open apps and stuff so when you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.139 
when you open apps and stuff so when you
do<00:01:38.640> something<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.720> opens<00:01:40.049> up

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.130 

so<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.180> guess<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:45.600> pretty<00:01:45.750> much<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> guys

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
so I guess that's pretty much it guys

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.950 
so I guess that's pretty much it guys
