00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 every year at the end of July 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.130
 Aragonese cows cross the ridge 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.469
 border in the ossau valley at 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.070
 level of the pass of the bernatory for 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.870
 to graze in French territory 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.779
 this tradition firmly rooted in 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.990
 pyrenees and the living heritage agree 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.750
 ancestral experiences of the thirteenth century 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.970
 shepherds of the proto valley and the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.030
 trade union commission of the valley of 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:36.960
 barges soon silence is troubled 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.129
 by distant mooing this is the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.129
 transhumance is in progress 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.320
 emerging from fog some 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.050
 silhouettes the heavy of goes up in the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.050
 heavy stride in this desert landscape 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:10.440
 in front of this uninterrupted parade 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.440
 we start counting 46 47 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.270
 the first beasts cross the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.700
 breach the descent is carried out calmly 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.400
 cows to follow the same route 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:52.030
 to reach the edge of the lake and there 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:54.100
 to quench 220 221 2 was the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.170
 last chimney to get out of 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.899
 this area forces the flock to 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.250
 respect a few stops the children 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.250
 who does not know yet 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.540
 1 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.340
 finally the culminating point and athens 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.160
 let's take note of the descent opens 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.380
 in the footsteps of ruminants calm and 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.550
 caution is needed to avoid 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.550
 unwanted slips 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.640
 I do not know where I over 1200 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.060
 Spanish cows from a transit where all 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.160
 years for maybe grace before 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.160
 to leave by this scabrous route 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.110
 mid-September 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.800
 more than seven hundred years ago that this 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:22.520
 custom endure so go in 2007 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.330
 blood to check the persistence of 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.330
 this tradition
