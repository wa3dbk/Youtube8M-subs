I<00:04:28.750> guess<00:04:29.080> because<00:04:29.410> YouTube<00:04:30.220> is<00:04:30.430> saying<00:04:30.729> that

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
I guess because YouTube is saying that

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.040 
I guess because YouTube is saying that
these<00:04:31.000> are<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.240> most<00:04:31.390> engages<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:31.960> have
