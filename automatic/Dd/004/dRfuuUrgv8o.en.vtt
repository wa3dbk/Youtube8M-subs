eight eighty alginate mold I shaved my
head<00:00:10.530> for<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.889> summer<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.460> thought<00:00:11.790> this

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
head for the summer so I thought this

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.720 
head for the summer so I thought this
was<00:00:12.179> as<00:00:12.420> good<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.809> time<00:00:12.900> as<00:00:13.139> any<00:00:13.440> for<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.830> new<00:00:14.400> up

was as good a time as any for a new up

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.960 
was as good a time as any for a new up
to<00:00:15.000> date<00:00:15.179> life<00:00:15.509> cast<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.369> just<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.580> make

to date life cast and just to make

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.150 
to date life cast and just to make
things<00:00:18.330> more<00:00:18.720> interesting<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:19.529> myself<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
things more interesting for myself and

those helping with the cast Shannon and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.189 
those helping with the cast Shannon and
James<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.890> decided<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.970> do<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> screaming<00:00:24.840> head

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.580 
pose now the way we did this is I waited
until<00:00:29.160> Shannon<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.210> James<00:00:30.630> had<00:00:30.840> applied<00:00:31.140> a

alginate was just about to set and the
way<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> gauged<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> kept<00:00:53.460> some

way I gauged this was I kept some

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.970 
way I gauged this was I kept some
alginate<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.600> hand<00:00:54.989> from<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> original

batch<00:00:56.190> there<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.090> when<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> felt<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> start<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
batch there and when I felt it start to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.130 
batch there and when I felt it start to
get<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> little<00:00:58.469> gummy<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.820> 880<00:01:00.510> formula

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.680 
get a little gummy as the 880 formula
does<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.649> before<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.129> sets<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.420> kind

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.600 
does right before it sets at that kind
of<00:01:03.780> gummy<00:01:04.049> stage<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.129> opened<00:01:05.580> my

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
of gummy stage that's when I opened my

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.179 
of gummy stage that's when I opened my
mouth<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.939> assume<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.990> screaming<00:01:07.710> head<00:01:07.890> pose

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
now a cue cast 880 is normally about a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.270 
now a cue cast 880 is normally about a
seven<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> eight<00:01:12.060> minute<00:01:12.360> working<00:01:12.720> time<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.590> we

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
seven to eight minute working time so we

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.740 
seven to eight minute working time so we
wanted<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.670> wait<00:01:14.820> till<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> end<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
wanted to wait till the end of that

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.410 
wanted to wait till the end of that
working<00:01:16.020> time<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.740> me<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> pose<00:01:17.520> so

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
working time for me to do the pose so

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.060 
working time for me to do the pose so
that<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.600> didn't<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> keep<00:01:19.229> my<00:01:19.439> head<00:01:19.740> and

more information on the complete life

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
casting process I would recommend our

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.310 
casting process I would recommend our
life<00:01:37.530> casting<00:01:38.009> 101<00:01:38.640> DVD<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.299> covers<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
life casting 101 DVD that covers the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.590 
life casting 101 DVD that covers the
head<00:01:40.560> cast<00:01:40.860> process<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.759> much<00:01:42.030> greater<00:01:42.060> detail

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
head cast process in much greater detail

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.960 
head cast process in much greater detail
but<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.740> will<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:43.920> give<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.280> an<00:01:44.460> idea<00:01:44.579> how

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
but this will just give you an idea how

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.050 
but this will just give you an idea how
we<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> screaming<00:01:46.649> head<00:01:47.040> pose<00:01:47.340> by

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
we can do a screaming head pose by

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.719 
we can do a screaming head pose by
timing<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.780> alginate<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> pose

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
timing the alginate so we we do the pose

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.240 
timing the alginate so we we do the pose
or<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> dynamic<00:01:51.810> expression<00:01:52.170> right<00:01:52.740> before<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
or a dynamic expression right before the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.880 
or a dynamic expression right before the
alginate<00:01:53.579> sets<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> good<00:01:54.990> tip<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.530> for

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
alginate sets so a good tip there is for

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.889 
alginate sets so a good tip there is for
your<00:01:56.070> subject<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.329> handful<00:01:57.869> of

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
your subject to have a handful of

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.260 
your subject to have a handful of
alginate<00:01:58.350> where<00:01:58.979> they<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.280> feel<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.820> begin<00:02:00.240> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
alginate where they can feel it begin to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.999 
alginate where they can feel it begin to
set<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.869> their<00:02:01.020> hands<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.500> that's<00:02:01.649> when<00:02:01.890> they

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
set in their hands and that's when they

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.330 
set in their hands and that's when they
know<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.549> time<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> assume<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.540> expression

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
know it's time to assume the expression
