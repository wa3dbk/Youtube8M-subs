because<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.519> think<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.869> know<00:00:30.990> this

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
because this I think this you know this

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.410 
because this I think this you know this
especially<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.189> camo<00:00:32.579> being<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:32.969> popular

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
especially with camo being so popular

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.700 
especially with camo being so popular
again<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.780> could<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.050> throw<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.230> some<00:00:34.380> Camel

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
again you could just throw on some Camel

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.200 
again you could just throw on some Camel
shorts<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.160> camo<00:00:35.340> pants<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:35.790> these<00:00:35.969> and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
shorts or camo pants with these and

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.930 
shorts or camo pants with these and
