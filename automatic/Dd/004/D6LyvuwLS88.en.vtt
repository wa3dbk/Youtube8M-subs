battle event where the I guess you sort

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.420 
battle event where the I guess you sort
of<00:00:15.599> only<00:00:15.780> see<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> best<00:00:16.440> tanks<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:16.980> both<00:00:17.160> sides

another gripe I have against the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.700 
another gripe I have against the
simulator<00:00:29.730> battle<00:00:30.000> event<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:31.439> really

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
simulator battle event is the you really

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.910 
simulator battle event is the you really
only<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.340> two<00:00:32.460> tanks<00:00:33.000> you'll<00:00:33.960> see<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
only see like two tanks you'll see the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.200 
only see like two tanks you'll see the
strongest<00:00:35.309> tank<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:35.790> side<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
strongest tank on one side of the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.610 
strongest tank on one side of the
strongest<00:00:36.510> think<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> other<00:00:37.050> side<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
strongest think on the other side and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.979 
strongest think on the other side and
all<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> other<00:00:38.760> tanks<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.360> kind<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.540> us

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
all the other tanks are just kind of us

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.860 
all the other tanks are just kind of us
almost<00:00:41.300> but<00:00:42.300> that's<00:00:42.450> not<00:00:42.540> really<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> point

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
almost but that's not really the point

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.470 
almost but that's not really the point

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
itself a lot of people I remember people

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.729 
itself a lot of people I remember people
were<00:00:51.239> asking<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> revisit<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.500> tank

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.040 
were asking for a revisit of this tank
and<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.670> played<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.030> game<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.539> enjoyed<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
and I played this game and I enjoyed it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.319 
and I played this game and I enjoyed it
and<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.260> felt<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.770> maybe<00:00:56.399> during<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.210> game

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and I felt like maybe during this game

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.950 
and I felt like maybe during this game
it's<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.780> good<00:00:57.960> time<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.170> talk<00:00:58.410> about<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
it's a good time to talk about it so the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.290 
it's a good time to talk about it so the
tiger<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> reviewed<00:01:01.980> however<00:01:02.850> long<00:01:03.000> ago

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
tiger that I reviewed however long ago

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.469 
tiger that I reviewed however long ago
was<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:04.290> before<00:01:04.769> American<00:01:05.309> tanks<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:06.330> was

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
was was before American tanks it was

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.300 
was was before American tanks it was
actually<00:01:06.630> before<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.650> had<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.130> little

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
actually before it had the little

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.160 
actually before it had the little
headlights<00:01:08.820> removed<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> front<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
headlights removed on the front of the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.980 
headlights removed on the front of the
tank<00:01:10.939> since<00:01:11.939> then<00:01:12.180> obviously<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.659> headlights

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
tank since then obviously the headlights

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.840 
tank since then obviously the headlights
removed<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> American<00:01:14.070> tanks<00:01:14.310> been<00:01:14.460> reduced

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
removed and American tanks been reduced

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.840 
removed and American tanks been reduced
and<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> Tigers<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.960> guess<00:01:16.860> lifestyle<00:01:17.610> has

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and the Tigers I guess lifestyle has

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.080 
and the Tigers I guess lifestyle has
changed<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.890> headlights<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.759> mean<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.030> never

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
changed the headlights I mean I never

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.789 
changed the headlights I mean I never
really<00:01:21.540> noticed<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.200> apparently<00:01:22.320> they

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
really noticed it but apparently they

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.310 
really noticed it but apparently they
lost<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.939> lost<00:01:24.119> gun<00:01:24.420> depression<00:01:24.689> over<00:01:25.170> them

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
lost you lost gun depression over them

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.130 
lost you lost gun depression over them
which<00:01:26.060> now<00:01:27.060> something<00:01:27.570> they<00:01:27.689> fixed<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
which now something they fixed it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.230 
which now something they fixed it
whatever<00:01:28.470> doesn't<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.369> didn't<00:01:29.909> think<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.119> was<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
whatever doesn't I didn't think it was a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.960 
whatever doesn't I didn't think it was a
big<00:01:30.360> deal<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:32.009> battle<00:01:32.340> rating<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.640> Tigers

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
big deal the battle rating the Tigers

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.020 
big deal the battle rating the Tigers
still<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> same<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:35.490> tanks<00:01:35.880> at

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
still the same it's just the tanks at

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.710 
still the same it's just the tanks at
its<00:01:36.180> tier<00:01:36.479> now<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:38.070> strong<00:01:38.630> 5.7<00:01:39.630> is

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
its tier now are really strong 5.7 is

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.170 
its tier now are really strong 5.7 is
not<00:01:39.900> an<00:01:40.020> easy

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
not an easy

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.640 
not an easy
mainly<00:01:42.180> because<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.630> Sherman's<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.410> the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
mainly because of the Sherman's and the

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.000 
mainly because of the Sherman's and the
Jumbo<00:01:44.010> variants<00:01:44.570> both<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:47.930> e2<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.320> 75

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
Jumbo variants both the e2 with the 75

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.040 
Jumbo variants both the e2 with the 75
millimeter<00:01:50.430> gun<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.600> very<00:01:51.930> effective

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
millimeter gun is a very effective

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.520 
millimeter gun is a very effective
machine<00:01:52.980> as<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:54.210> short<00:01:54.450> belt<00:01:54.630> 75<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.260> it<00:01:55.350> can't

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
machine as the short belt 75 so it can't

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.230 
machine as the short belt 75 so it can't
really<00:01:55.620> deal<00:01:55.980> with<00:01:56.130> tigers<00:01:56.490> arranged<00:01:56.850> but

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
really deal with tigers arranged but

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.030 
really deal with tigers arranged but
from<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> sides<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.080> certainly<00:01:58.410> can<00:01:58.680> from<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
from the sides it certainly can from the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.390 
from the sides it certainly can from the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
Jumbo's especially against tiger each

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.070 
Jumbo's especially against tiger each
one's<00:05:26.160> which<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:27.000> mean<00:05:27.450> our<00:05:27.570> logical

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
one's which I mean our logical

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.870 
one's which I mean our logical
competition<00:05:28.650> because<00:05:28.890> they<00:05:29.010> sit<00:05:29.220> same<00:05:29.580> battle

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
competition because they sit same battle

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.350 
competition because they sit same battle
rating<00:05:30.770> yeah<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:32.370> Jumbo<00:05:32.730> one's<00:05:32.940> just<00:05:33.240> about

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
rating yeah the Jumbo one's just about

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.700 
rating yeah the Jumbo one's just about
every<00:05:33.600> time<00:05:34.430> so<00:05:35.430> I<00:05:35.460> guess<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:36.230> the<00:05:37.230> Tigers<00:05:37.590> in

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
every time so I guess the the Tigers in

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.050 
every time so I guess the the Tigers in
a<00:05:37.800> very<00:05:37.950> interesting<00:05:38.400> role<00:05:38.610> because<00:05:38.880> it<00:05:38.940> has

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
a very interesting role because it has

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.390 
a very interesting role because it has
this<00:05:39.300> mystique<00:05:39.990> about<00:05:40.200> being<00:05:40.620> this<00:05:40.830> you<00:05:41.310> know

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.370 
with the Jumbo in the game at the 5.7
battle<00:06:26.560> rating<00:06:27.449> that's<00:06:28.449> your<00:06:28.780> opponent<00:06:29.229> and

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
battle rating that's your opponent and

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.950

it's<00:06:29.800> a<00:06:29.889> very<00:06:30.099> tough<00:06:30.280> target<00:06:31.180> to<00:06:31.270> deal<00:06:31.419> with<00:06:31.660> so

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
it's a very tough target to deal with so

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.010 
it's a very tough target to deal with so
i<00:06:32.550> guess<00:06:33.550> to<00:06:33.849> revisit<00:06:34.330> this<00:06:34.419> tank<00:06:34.720> is<00:06:34.870> almost

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
i guess to revisit this tank is almost

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.760 
i guess to revisit this tank is almost
to<00:06:35.319> say<00:06:35.470> that<00:06:35.650> nothing's<00:06:36.130> changed<00:06:36.729> it's<00:06:37.150> just

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
to say that nothing's changed it's just

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.200 
to say that nothing's changed it's just
you<00:06:38.770> have<00:06:38.800> to<00:06:38.949> deal<00:06:39.190> with<00:06:39.280> Jumbo's<00:06:39.639> now<00:06:39.789> and

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
you have to deal with Jumbo's now and

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.600 
you have to deal with Jumbo's now and
that's<00:06:40.810> a<00:06:41.139> significant<00:06:41.770> change<00:06:42.009> in<00:06:42.250> terms<00:06:42.490> of

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
that's a significant change in terms of

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.150 
that's a significant change in terms of
gameplay<00:06:42.900> however<00:06:43.900> at<00:06:44.139> this<00:06:44.410> tier<00:06:44.800> I<00:06:44.830> don't

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
gameplay however at this tier I don't

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.650 
gameplay however at this tier I don't
think<00:06:45.370> there's<00:06:45.550> any<00:06:45.729> other<00:06:45.789> way<00:06:46.000> you<00:06:46.180> can<00:06:46.419> play

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
think there's any other way you can play

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.379 
think there's any other way you can play
this<00:06:46.810> tank<00:06:47.110> and<00:06:48.009> the<00:06:48.340> I<00:06:48.520> mean<00:06:48.759> the<00:06:48.880> Panther<00:06:49.240> has

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
this tank and the I mean the Panther has

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.409 
this tank and the I mean the Panther has
better<00:06:49.599> armor<00:06:50.050> but<00:06:50.610> this<00:06:51.610> 88<00:06:51.940> millimeter<00:06:52.120> gun

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
better armor but this 88 millimeter gun

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.120 
better armor but this 88 millimeter gun
is<00:06:52.570> pretty<00:06:52.810> good<00:06:53.050> against<00:06:53.470> everything<00:06:53.710> except

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
is pretty good against everything except

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.010 
is pretty good against everything except
John<00:06:54.310> Moses<00:06:54.699> but<00:06:55.330> very<00:06:55.539> effective<00:06:57.720> so<00:06:58.720> I<00:06:58.750> guess

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
John Moses but very effective so I guess

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.670 
John Moses but very effective so I guess
net<00:06:59.580> not<00:07:00.580> a<00:07:00.610> lots<00:07:00.880> changed<00:07:01.060> I<00:07:01.750> know<00:07:02.349> people

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.529 
net not a lots changed I know people
were<00:07:02.740> very<00:07:02.949> anxious<00:07:03.130> for<00:07:03.460> me<00:07:03.490> to<00:07:03.580> come<00:07:04.120> back<00:07:04.330> to

were very anxious for me to come back to

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:07.469 
were very anxious for me to come back to

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 
the tiger review baby I just can't think

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:09.839 
the tiger review baby I just can't think
of<00:07:07.659> that<00:07:07.900> many<00:07:08.110> things<00:07:08.440> that<00:07:08.740> really<00:07:09.340> swapped

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:09.849 
of that many things that really swapped

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:12.360 
of that many things that really swapped
out<00:07:10.060> the<00:07:10.330> tank<00:07:10.630> is<00:07:10.810> basically<00:07:11.440> the<00:07:11.560> same<00:07:11.740> sure

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
out the tank is basically the same sure

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.909 
out the tank is basically the same sure
that<00:07:12.639> had<00:07:12.940> like<00:07:13.090> two<00:07:13.240> removed<00:07:13.569> well<00:07:14.139> that's

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 
that had like two removed well that's

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.100 
that had like two removed well that's
almost<00:07:15.159> like<00:07:15.250> whatever<00:07:15.639> do<00:07:15.819> it<00:07:16.270> that<00:07:16.720> doesn't

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
almost like whatever do it that doesn't

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.219 
almost like whatever do it that doesn't
make<00:07:17.889> a<00:07:17.949> difference<00:07:18.430> to<00:07:18.699> me<00:07:19.110> but<00:07:20.110> the

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:20.229 
make a difference to me but the

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:21.480 
make a difference to me but the
introduction<00:07:20.740> of<00:07:20.770> American<00:07:21.159> tanks<00:07:21.400> have

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.490 
introduction of American tanks have

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.439 
introduction of American tanks have
really<00:07:21.669> changed<00:07:21.909> its<00:07:22.300> role<00:07:22.659> in<00:07:22.780> life<00:07:22.900> it<00:07:23.430> I'm

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:24.449 
really changed its role in life it I'm

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.700 
really changed its role in life it I'm
glad<00:07:25.449> that<00:07:25.479> they<00:07:25.750> made<00:07:25.960> the<00:07:25.990> realistic

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710 
glad that they made the realistic

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.339 
glad that they made the realistic
battles<00:07:26.830> sort<00:07:27.759> of<00:07:27.849> mixed<00:07:28.270> where<00:07:28.449> Germans<00:07:29.259> can

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:29.349 
battles sort of mixed where Germans can

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:31.620 
battles sort of mixed where Germans can
play<00:07:29.530> with<00:07:29.650> Americans<00:07:30.070> or<00:07:30.219> Russians<00:07:30.630> because

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:31.630 
play with Americans or Russians because

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.439 
play with Americans or Russians because
it<00:07:31.810> helps<00:07:32.620> to<00:07:32.740> balance<00:07:32.889> things<00:07:33.310> out<00:07:33.580> just

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:34.449 
it helps to balance things out just

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:36.240 
it helps to balance things out just
Germans<00:07:34.900> verse<00:07:35.139> just<00:07:35.469> Americans<00:07:35.949> Americans

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.250 
Germans verse just Americans Americans

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.439 
Germans verse just Americans Americans
should<00:07:36.759> win<00:07:36.969> most<00:07:37.300> of<00:07:37.509> the<00:07:37.630> time<00:07:37.949> so<00:07:39.240> anyway<00:07:40.240> I

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:40.449 
should win most of the time so anyway I

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:42.240 
should win most of the time so anyway I
know<00:07:40.750> it's<00:07:41.050> a<00:07:41.139> short<00:07:41.530> little<00:07:41.680> revisit<00:07:42.159> but
