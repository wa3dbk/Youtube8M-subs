 defense 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.380
 from rpk pumping system well, and from action 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.660
 the gameplay itself

 screen and a pair of buttons whose functionality 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
 I think you should not explain your city

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.510

 manually participate in protecting your city and 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.829
 it is here that you need to remember the mechanics

 the walls of your city swordsmen will 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.619

 your character has health for 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.159
 which must be followed 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.590
 restore health can be 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.900
 city ​​limits but regeneration occurs 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.540
 a very long time besides the defense of your city 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.799
 you can attack locations 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.810
 enemy army and get paid for it 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.030

 and craft new weapons or armor by 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.079
 the level of graphics the game of course looks 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.240
 little polygons are visible everywhere because 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.210
 making the faces of heroes look like egyptian 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.909
 hi pyramids 2001 and nothing else 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.250
 one famous person would say and 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.280
 mazafaka polygons little texture sucks 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.350
 the game is rubbish but thank god I'm not him and mine 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.299
 the verdict will be next despite 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.310
 grafon game turned out decent 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.240
 interesting and in my opinion very ri 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.250
 playable 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.259
 for your hero can be pumped by 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.540
 three different branches the second game 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.730
 called from roll behind shadow enjoy in 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.950
 this is quite a nice adventure lpg 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.360
 with an unusual graphic design in 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.610
 which way there is a note 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.440
 steampunk we have to travel 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.480
 on the fictional world to get acquainted with 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.110
 interesting characters and perform 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.630
 quests 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.110
 battle system in the game step by step in the spirit of j &amp; r 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.610
 pg 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.830
 but here you have to replace yours 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.050
 abilities and use available 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.750
 you cards but basically what's with the cards 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.910
 no matter what, I didn't feel 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.950
 Of the minuses of the game is worth noting the price and 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.810
 lack of Russian localization 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.150
 Well, in general, I think everyone will like the game 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.130
 lovers of this genre and passage 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.290
 the game will take you at least six hours 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.780
 There was a continuation of the popular and one 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.230
 of the most beautiful platformer figaro 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.780
 pho 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.790
 called an offer a freelance in this 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.530
 times our hero will be afraid to 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.930
 aliens we have to help 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.420
 overcome this fear the game is divided 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.459
 at forty-two levels whose goal is to collect 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.470
 key and get to the exit if you 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.480
 You want to get 3 stars you need to 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.609
 put together a special bean and keep within 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.200
 specified time in almost every 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.269
 missions will appear some 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.730
 new element what does the gameplay 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.350
 interesting and addictive individual 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.420
 line is to highlight and availability 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.160
 small cartoon inserts 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.320
 thanks to which the game grows 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.660
 what any plot continuation 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.640
 managed to keep their style atmosphere and 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.320
 so everyone who played in the previous parts 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.150
 I think not pass by 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.340
 then I want to tell you about the new 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.890
 football puzzle pieces and talking about 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.209
 play fine let's superbumen staples in this 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.819
 time the action is carried out on 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.980
 World Cup Women 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.989
 the mechanics of the game remained unchanged our 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.880
 the task is to bring the players with the ball to 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.980
 selected point and not 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.859
 cross with a team representative 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.810
 opponent game includes 24 new 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.970
 missions that break a lot 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.410
 your head personally me some missions 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.450
 just baffled 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.639
 I will say this continued good 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.859
 but unfortunately nothing new except 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.470
 long hair in characters and new 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.510
 missions introduced to the game was not 5 game 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.790
 is also associated with football only this 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.040
 time this football arcade is called 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.199
 play tag attack soccer game you can 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.850
 divide in two the first part is 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.650
 something like simplified 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.780
 on fats where you can train your 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.330
 team to hire staff to buy 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.340
 players and so on the second part is already 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.780
 directly the football match itself 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.030
 control in the game is carried out with 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.980
 using tapov and the second swap 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.110
 the specified point your hero move 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.570
 Tapaya on another player 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.700
 command you give him the slot with the help of 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.950
 swipe you can hit inside 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.320
 including on goal or do tackle 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.080
 despite such simplicity and arcade 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.970
 the game is of interest and delays think 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.920
 describe the graphics in this game is not worth it 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.140
 as you yourself see everything with your own 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.210
 eyes the next game is a new one 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.260
 touch arcade from bombs called 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.630
 running cycling 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.880
 the idea of ​​the game is not original once upon a time 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.980
 i saw playing something similar but to 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.720
 Sorry forgot the name you play for 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.030
 character that moves by 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.160
 circle by tapping the screen 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.140
 you can choose where he is either 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.820
 inside or outside to 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.680
 move from one circle to 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.230
 the other one needs to change position in 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.180
 the point of their intersection the goal of the game as in 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.730
 all modern timekiller ah pass 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.560
 as far as possible for the collected crystal 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.590
 you can unlock other skins 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.450
 of which there are a lot of 7 in the game 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.070
 called waltz my l she 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.260
 is a puzzle in 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.350
 which your task is to connect 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.610
 pipes and thus ensure the work 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.590
 oil platform puzzle 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.600
 done in 3d so you have to 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.030
 rotate and twist the cube to collect 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.280
 the combination you need at first everything will be 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.770
 very simple then the size of the cube will be 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.640
 increase and this is significant 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.590
 complicates the passage 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.780
 and the last game for today is arcade 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.120
 by disentangling nods xtx 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.580
 the game is endless and based on speed 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.650
 your reactions need to think fast and 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.170
 click on the screen area located 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.630
 under the intersection of two threads or wires 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.210
 I do not know exactly what it is if you do 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.520
 all right then you will pass on but remember 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.440
 one wrong action will all have 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.480
 start from the very beginning like you probably 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.310
 already understood the game is very hardcore and 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.650
 able to serve with quite good 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.480
 timekiller here unfortunately and all on 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.910
 My view today release was very 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.830
 many interesting and decent games which 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.780
 as I think it will soon be on 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.820
 your mobile devices therefore 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.380
 run faster swing liked 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.830
 toys but don't forget before that 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.020
