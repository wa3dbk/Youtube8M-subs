00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.190
 You carry dreams in your eyes I walk my eyes on your dress 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.430
 The wind mixes your hair In front of the sky which encompasses us 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.590
 Another ride on your planet Another night on your way 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.780
 Time flies, life often stops earlier than our instinct 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.040
 A little respite for the planet A little love on his sorrow 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.140
 May this life be a party And let it begin again tomorrow 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.620
 Life is full of encounters Some will remain silent 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.640
 And sometimes we realize 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.330
 That they weigh in us as an absence 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.530
 Fill my glass on the pillow Fill my dreams with sparks 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.330
 Spread your wet hair Let yourself be flooded by the sky 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.630
 Blend of lightning and comets Blend of cum and gametes 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.790
 All the mystery of the origins In these flashes that we print 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.020
 My origin and my destiny are confused at least on one point 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.210
 The one who saw me appear And yours where I would like to disappear 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.410
 My origin and my destiny are confused at least on one point 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.460
 The one from which life took me out And yours that attracts me today 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.200
 Another ride on your planet Another night on your way 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.380
 Time flies, life often stops earlier than our instinct 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.530
 A little respite for the planet A little love on his sorrow 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.760
 May this life be a party And let it begin again tomorrow 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.030
 Blend of lightning and comets Blend of cum and gametes 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.220
 All the mystery of the origins In these flashes that we print 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.410
 My origin and my destiny are confused at least on one point 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.630
 The one who saw me appear And yours where I would like to disappear 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.770
 My origin and my destiny are confused at least on one point 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.090
 The one from which life took me out And yours that attracts me today 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.230
 My origin and my destiny are confused at least on one point 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.450
 The one who saw me appear And yours where I would like to disappear 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.590
 My origin and my destiny are confused at least on one point 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.160
 The one from which life took me out And yours that attracts me today
