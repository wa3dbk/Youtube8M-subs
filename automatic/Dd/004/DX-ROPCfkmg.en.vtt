00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
patient system goes through verification

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.270 
patient system goes through verification
if<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.360> doesn't<00:00:39.840> pass<00:00:40.050> verification<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.040> all

if it doesn't pass verification if all

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250 
if it doesn't pass verification if all
the<00:00:41.580> parts<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.090> system<00:00:42.300> are<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:42.780> working

the parts of the system are not working
properly<00:00:43.700> nothing<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:44.820> happen<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
properly nothing will happen so it is

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.490 
properly nothing will happen so it is
safe<00:00:46.850> number<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.330> at<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:48.900> beginning<00:00:49.140> of

every procedure we go through a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.700 
every procedure we go through a
verification<00:00:51.260> then<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.350> go<00:00:52.470> through

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
verification then we go through

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.350 
verification then we go through
calibration<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:53.940> beyond<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.630> if<00:00:55.290> there's<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
calibration but beyond that if there's a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.630 
calibration but beyond that if there's a
safety<00:00:57.360> bill<00:00:57.720> within<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.920> system<00:00:59.400> and<00:00:59.550> this

safety bill within the system and this

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.430 
safety bill within the system and this
is<00:00:59.790> called<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> tool<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.810> it<00:01:00.840> performs

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
is called the tool because it performs

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.420 
is called the tool because it performs
the<00:01:01.590> procedure<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:02.870> accidentally<00:01:04.430> someone

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the procedure if accidentally someone

falls in bumps on the tool during the
dissection<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.039> would<00:01:08.189> mean<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.520> if<00:01:08.700> someone

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
dissection that would mean as if someone

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.760

button<00:02:15.230> press<00:02:15.590> little<00:02:16.070> button<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.810> there

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
button press little button and there

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.990 
button press little button and there
goes<00:02:18.110> we<00:02:18.560> are<00:02:18.650> ready<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.950> continue<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:19.880> the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
goes we are ready to continue so the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.250 
goes we are ready to continue so the
procedure<00:02:20.390> continues<00:02:21.080> very<00:02:21.350> easily<00:02:23.260> because

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
procedure continues very easily because

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.650 
procedure continues very easily because
of<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.620> noise<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:25.130> will<00:02:25.460> just<00:02:25.730> kind<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.030> turn<00:02:26.510> it

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
of the noise I will just kind of turn it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.720 
of the noise I will just kind of turn it
for<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.200> purpose<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:27.620> video<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:28.550> what<00:02:28.700> I

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
for the purpose of this video but what I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.870 
for the purpose of this video but what I
want<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.180> stress<00:02:30.140> it's<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.560> very<00:02:30.800> safe<00:02:31.130> system

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
want to stress it's a very safe system

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.690 
want to stress it's a very safe system
safe<00:02:32.270> system<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:33.320> safety<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:33.890> build<00:02:34.430> within

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
safe system the safety is build within

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.330 
safe system the safety is build within
the<00:02:34.940> system<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:36.050> safety<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.710> given<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.130> a

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
the system the safety is given to a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.430 
the system the safety is given to a
physician<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.210> anyone<00:02:38.870> around<00:02:39.110> there's<00:02:39.350> a

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
physician and anyone around there's a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.740 
physician and anyone around there's a
four<00:02:39.770> buttons<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.460> usually<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:41.030> users<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:41.660> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
four buttons and usually to users of the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.140 
four buttons and usually to users of the
system<00:02:41.960> so<00:02:42.740> it<00:02:43.070> is<00:02:43.220> really<00:02:43.810> built<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:45.080> be<00:02:45.200> safe

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
system so it is really built to be safe

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.850 
system so it is really built to be safe
beyond<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.270> is<00:02:47.480> very<00:02:47.720> sophisticated<00:02:48.080> and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
beyond that is very sophisticated and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.250 
beyond that is very sophisticated and
precise<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:50.390> was<00:02:50.570> about<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.870> safety<00:02:51.080> of

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
precise so this was about the safety of

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.250 
precise so this was about the safety of
the<00:02:51.440> artist<00:02:51.830> system
