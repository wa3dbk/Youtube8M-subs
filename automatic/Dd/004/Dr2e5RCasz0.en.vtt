waiting for for a really long time it is

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.090 
waiting for for a really long time it is
called<00:04:32.120> X<00:04:32.510> versus<00:04:33.080> Y<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:33.620> this<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:33.830> like<00:04:33.950> the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
called X versus Y and this is like the

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.920 
called X versus Y and this is like the
roughest<00:04:34.580> that's<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:34.940> most<00:04:35.120> beautiful<00:04:35.720> paper

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
roughest that's the most beautiful paper

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.170 
roughest that's the most beautiful paper
I<00:04:36.290> mean<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.650> design<00:04:36.950> of<00:04:37.160> this<00:04:37.280> entire<00:04:37.700> book<00:04:37.970> is

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
I mean the design of this entire book is

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.840 
I mean the design of this entire book is
pretty<00:04:38.720> cool<00:04:39.080> it<00:04:39.380> is<00:04:39.530> basically<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:39.919> comparison

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
pretty cool it is basically a comparison

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.210 
pretty cool it is basically a comparison
of<00:04:41.000> two<00:04:41.450> different<00:04:42.139> generations<00:04:42.800> their<00:04:43.070> two

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
of two different generations their two

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.430 
of two different generations their two
sisters<00:04:43.610> I<00:04:43.970> think<00:04:44.450> I'm<00:04:44.630> probably<00:04:44.900> gonna<00:04:45.200> be

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
sisters I think I'm probably gonna be

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.470 
sisters I think I'm probably gonna be
somewhere<00:04:46.010> in<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.280> middle<00:04:46.580> of<00:04:46.940> both<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:47.389> them

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
somewhere in the middle of both of them

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.940 
somewhere in the middle of both of them
I<00:04:47.630> might<00:04:47.780> have<00:04:47.900> been<00:04:47.960> too<00:04:48.169> young<00:04:48.410> for<00:04:48.440> some<00:04:48.830> of

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
I might have been too young for some of

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.230 
I might have been too young for some of
it<00:04:49.070> because<00:04:49.280> it<00:04:49.370> was<00:04:49.460> already<00:04:49.610> like<00:04:49.850> happening

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
it because it was already like happening

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.820 
it because it was already like happening
in<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.450> u.s.<00:04:50.660> in<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:50.840> UK<00:04:50.990> but<00:04:51.290> not<00:04:51.500> in<00:04:51.710> the
