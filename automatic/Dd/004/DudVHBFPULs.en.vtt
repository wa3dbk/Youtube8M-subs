looking<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:17.940> me<00:01:18.090> concept<00:01:18.630> model<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.560> most

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
looking at me concept model for most

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.410 
looking at me concept model for most
okay<00:01:22.340> imagining<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.460> found<00:01:23.940> that<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.090> really

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
okay imagining we found that we really

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.779 
okay imagining we found that we really
like<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> use<00:01:24.929> physical<00:01:25.350> models<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.009> map<00:01:26.580> out

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
like to use physical models to map out

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.180 
like to use physical models to map out
our<00:01:27.030> our<00:01:27.899> buildings<00:01:28.289> especially<00:01:28.410> there<00:01:29.100> is

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
our our buildings especially there is

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.550 
our our buildings especially there is
computers<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.970> everything<00:01:30.300> today<00:01:30.720> nothing

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
computers and everything today nothing

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.350 
computers and everything today nothing
really<00:01:31.710> works<00:01:32.009> as<00:01:32.250> good<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.580> as<00:01:33.000> doing<00:01:33.300> a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
really works as good as as doing a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.700 
really works as good as as doing a
physical<00:01:33.630> model<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.020> carving<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.440> all<00:01:34.530> out

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
physical model and carving it all out

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.529 
physical model and carving it all out
there<00:01:35.039> are<00:01:35.250> two<00:01:35.429> work<00:01:35.550> with<00:01:35.670> what<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.000> want<00:01:36.209> so

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
there are two work with what we want so

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.050 
there are two work with what we want so
as<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.410> go<00:01:37.530> from<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.800> smaller<00:01:38.069> model<00:01:38.429> to<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
as you go from the smaller model to the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.330 
as you go from the smaller model to the
larger<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.810> medium<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.319> large<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:41.190> get<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
larger one the medium to large you get a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.910 
larger one the medium to large you get a
little<00:01:41.459> bit<00:01:41.580> more<00:01:41.729> detail<00:01:42.179> haha

then is that the ride with the car that
we<00:01:56.560> loo<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:56.979> rent<00:01:57.189> radium<00:01:57.670> springs<00:01:57.820> racers

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
we loo and rent radium springs racers

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.050 
we loo and rent radium springs racers
back<00:01:59.200> there<00:01:59.470> right<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.220> actually<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:00.820> is<00:02:00.970> a

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
radiators races and that's what this

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.240 
radiators races and that's what this
whole<00:02:20.940> convo<00:02:21.940> area<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:22.900> right<00:02:23.140> there<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:24.100> got

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
whole convo area is right there you got

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.860 
whole convo area is right there you got
12<00:02:24.519> acres<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.180> actually<00:02:25.360> increase<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
12 acres that you actually increase the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.710 
12 acres that you actually increase the
part<00:02:26.819> about<00:02:27.819> half<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.360> Wow<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:31.450> then<00:02:31.569> is

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
part about half of it Wow and then is

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.170 
part about half of it Wow and then is
that<00:02:31.750> Luigi's<00:02:32.470> one<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.100> little<00:02:33.220> wine<00:02:33.760> area

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
this is the bigger model of what he just

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.369 
this is the bigger model of what he just
explained<00:03:00.030> ugly<00:03:01.939> so<00:03:03.530> did<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.560> get<00:03:04.889> in<00:03:05.010> here
