portion of my life but I've never really

portion of my life but I've never really
been<00:00:15.179> able<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.570> shred<00:00:15.809> do<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> ton<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.710> hours

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
been able to shred do a ton of hours

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.230 
been able to shred do a ton of hours
spent<00:00:17.220> trying<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.670> figure<00:00:17.850> out<00:00:18.000> what<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
spent trying to figure out what the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.450 
spent trying to figure out what the
problem<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.020> realized<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.830> my<00:00:20.010> wrist<00:00:20.250> is

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
problem was I realized that my wrist is

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.980 
problem was I realized that my wrist is
just<00:00:20.490> way<00:00:20.880> too<00:00:20.939> slow<00:00:21.359> enter<00:00:22.250> distracting

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.650 

basically<00:00:28.860> the<00:00:29.010> idea<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.370> to<00:00:29.550> attach<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.120> pic<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
basically the idea is to attach a pic to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.540 
basically the idea is to attach a pic to
an<00:00:30.750> electric<00:00:31.110> motor<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.680> get<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.220> spinning

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
an electric motor and get it spinning

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.940 
an electric motor and get it spinning
around<00:00:32.790> super<00:00:33.360> fast<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.470> that<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.650> can<00:00:34.860> hit

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
around super fast so that you can hit

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.320 
around super fast so that you can hit
the<00:00:35.130> strings<00:00:35.400> really<00:00:35.580> fast<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.060> then<00:00:36.180> like

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
the strings really fast and then like

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:58.740 
the strings really fast and then like
shred<00:00:37.140> that's<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> idea<00:00:37.860> anyway

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.410 

I'm<00:00:59.290> pretty<00:00:59.560> worried<00:00:59.800> about<00:00:59.860> this<00:01:00.190> one<00:01:00.430> first

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
I'm pretty worried about this one first

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.630 
I'm pretty worried about this one first
off<00:01:01.690> we've<00:01:02.290> got<00:01:02.350> a<00:01:02.739> motor<00:01:03.070> that<00:01:03.280> we<00:01:03.370> don't<00:01:03.520> know

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
off we've got a motor that we don't know

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.219 
off we've got a motor that we don't know
anything<00:01:03.880> about<00:01:04.000> anything<00:01:04.629> could<00:01:04.900> be<00:01:05.050> like

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
anything about anything could be like

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.900 
anything about anything could be like
enough<00:01:05.470> torque<00:01:05.800> enough<00:01:06.100> speed<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:06.460> know<00:01:06.790> all

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
enough torque enough speed you know all

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.730 
enough torque enough speed you know all
that<00:01:07.060> jazz<00:01:07.300> my<00:01:07.630> fault<00:01:07.900> got<00:01:08.380> all<00:01:08.560> these

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
that jazz my fault got all these

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.230 
that jazz my fault got all these
components<00:01:09.310> we're<00:01:09.430> following<00:01:09.580> make

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
components we're following make

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.130 
components we're following make
magazines<00:01:11.340> plan<00:01:12.340> so<00:01:12.910> like<00:01:13.510> those<00:01:13.750> guys<00:01:13.990> know

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
magazines plan so like those guys know

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.910 
magazines plan so like those guys know
their<00:01:14.290> stuff<00:01:14.470> should<00:01:15.040> work<00:01:15.250> but<00:01:16.890> trying<00:01:17.890> to

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
their stuff should work but trying to

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:41.690 
their stuff should work but trying to
solder<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.460> all<00:01:18.640> together

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:52.630 

check<00:01:42.700> this<00:01:42.850> out<00:01:43.170> good

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:04.160 

yes<00:01:55.510> okay<00:01:56.510> that's<00:01:56.690> faster

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.120 

they're<00:02:04.740> still<00:02:05.250> pretty<00:02:05.700> bad<00:02:06.680> it's<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.890> pretty

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
they're still pretty bad it's all pretty

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:17.290 
they're still pretty bad it's all pretty
fast<00:02:08.600> but<00:02:09.600> does<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.020> matter<00:02:10.170> because<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:11.220> did

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:28.010 

the<00:02:18.300> motor<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.900> uses<00:02:19.830> like<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> normal<00:02:20.310> pic<00:02:27.020> if

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
the motor and uses like a normal pic if

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:46.680 
the motor and uses like a normal pic if
you<00:02:28.290> want<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.590> play<00:02:28.709> fast

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.080 

I<00:02:46.860> guess<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:48.069> answers<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.550> question<00:02:48.910> as<00:02:49.060> to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
I guess that answers the question as to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.330 
I guess that answers the question as to
why<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:49.750> hasn't<00:02:50.140> been<00:02:50.410> built<00:02:50.590> before

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.450 

this<00:02:55.340> is<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.700> motorized<00:02:56.540> guitar<00:02:57.020> pick<00:02:57.460> take

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
this is the motorized guitar pick take

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.700 
this is the motorized guitar pick take
two
