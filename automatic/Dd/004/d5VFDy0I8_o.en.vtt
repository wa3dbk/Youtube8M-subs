00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.649 
it in a banned substance free
environment<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.340> recommend<00:01:14.940> to<00:01:15.180> all<00:01:15.330> my

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
environment then I recommend to all my

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:26.090 
environment then I recommend to all my
athletes<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.030> BCAA<00:01:18.030> peak<00:01:24.950> there<00:01:25.950> are

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
athletes and to you BCAA peak there are

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.370 
athletes and to you BCAA peak there are
three<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.549> them<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.360> leucine<00:01:27.869> isoleucine

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
three of them that is leucine isoleucine

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.670 
three of them that is leucine isoleucine
and<00:01:29.159> valine<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.540> fourth<00:01:30.869> ingredient<00:01:31.140> is

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and valine the fourth ingredient is

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.160 
and valine the fourth ingredient is
l-glutamine<00:01:32.369> which<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.700> also<00:01:32.939> an<00:01:33.270> amino<00:01:33.630> acid

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
l-glutamine which is also an amino acid

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.020 
l-glutamine which is also an amino acid
now<00:01:34.979> research<00:01:35.310> has<00:01:35.490> proven<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
now research has proven that the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.370 
now research has proven that the
combination<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.780> these<00:01:36.900> four<00:01:37.200> ingredients

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
combination of these four ingredients

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.350 
combination of these four ingredients
will<00:01:37.950> help<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.189> both<00:01:38.340> build<00:01:38.729> muscle<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
will help you both build muscle and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.200 
will help you both build muscle and
spare<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> muscle<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.619> already<00:01:41.210> now

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
spare the muscle that you already now

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.789 
spare the muscle that you already now
for<00:01:42.450> many<00:01:42.540> years<00:01:42.930> people<00:01:43.409> thought<00:01:43.560> that

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
for many years people thought that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.620 
for many years people thought that
glutamine<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.970> makes<00:01:45.150> up<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.450> high

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
glutamine because that makes up a high

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.420 
glutamine because that makes up a high
percentage<00:01:45.900> of<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.350> muscle<00:01:46.680> tissue<00:01:46.920> that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
percentage of your muscle tissue that

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.950 
percentage of your muscle tissue that
that<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:47.880> actually<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.299> most<00:01:48.420> important

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
that was actually the most important

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.640 
that was actually the most important
amino<00:01:49.110> ass

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
amino ass

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.830 
amino ass

actually leucine leucine has been found

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600 
actually leucine leucine has been found
not<00:01:57.270> only<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.930> help<00:01:58.080> trigger<00:01:58.770> protein

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
research in the BCA a peak is something

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.100 
research in the BCA a peak is something
that<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.700> recommend<00:02:42.030> for<00:02:42.360> anyone<00:02:42.720> that's
