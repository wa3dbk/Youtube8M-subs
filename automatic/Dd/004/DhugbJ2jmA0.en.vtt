 now the flashback should pay off 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.710

 the hansa park has been over three years 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.129
 his visitors fans guests questioned how 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.049
 because the next big attraction was what 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.810
 is supposed to be how it should look like 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.689
 what should it be yes and the result 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.509

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.820

 on 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.220

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.490
 novelty already planned since 2010 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.280
 Opening is 2015 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.560
 where then as already on the ground 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.259
 first without thematization or without 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.130
 full theme and one year 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:15.590
 later completely thematized the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:19.549
 complete name of the roller coaster is the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:25.790
 oath of the core then beware 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:28.420
 his spell on the whole has the park 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.959
 also a separate homepage 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.910
 kerner.de link in the video description 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.829
 There is also the block from the park 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:42.440
 itself there from the park disc home 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.090
 net pulled a speculation the days 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.780
 posts are the most interesting 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.450
 catch and quite a bit of information, the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.730
 new track is the largest so far 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.440
 future investment of the park the layout 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.810
 will be tailored to the needs of the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.459
 hansa parks tailored and adapted 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.230
 for the complete calculations and 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.000
 construction of the railway is nobody 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.209
 other responsibility than the engineering office 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.410
 Werner Stem in Munich so that 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.450
 already promises a good train to 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.000
 tending the whole thing 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.489
 the company gerstlauer from münsterhausen 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.859
 the tüv süd in munich is in the 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.019
 redevelopment with integrated railway 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.510
 speaks like clap special 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.669
 names and also a special story name 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.739
 and then the story the story should be 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.359
 to match hansa park and the name of 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.290
 Parks underpin and this one 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.190
 whole trade in europe theme even more 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.349
 advance 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.220
 The park itself says it will be a family 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.220
 light 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.460
 curious if that is good if that then 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.830
 real just such a bad one for far 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.660
 is a good family orbit 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.430
 unsuccessful a macho I do not know like that 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.170
 Do you have the feeling that the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.790
 small kids already on the 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.450
 Hard stuff going off the hard 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.500
 things that I can with such a 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.780
 must come extra children's stuff necessarily 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.090
 My opinion feels today 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.430
 but good I'm not in the 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.110
 not in the marketing department 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.620
 Market research or something else 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.850
 That should be better for the job I am so 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.680
 whole should then for the family one 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.160
 challenge adventure at the same time 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.160
 his 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.850
 The whole then finds in 16 seated 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.890
 trains with shows instead of what I iron 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.840
 very welcome i hate shoulder bögl 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.120
 could still be as good and comfortable as 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.070
 they want everything up here 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.280
 freezers that increases the rollercoaster 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.820
 driving feeling so much like horny 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.680
 yes be curious how the biggest 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.180
 project of hansa parks developed 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.310
 now in the near future, so the first 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.890
 video on the topic what I did now 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.050
 There will definitely be more 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.790
 mainly go if there is news 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:07.490
