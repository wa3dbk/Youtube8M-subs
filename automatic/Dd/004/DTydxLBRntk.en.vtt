00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hey all beaver dear friends today i 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.910
 I'll tell you about the five nights endoskeleton 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.010
 at freddys 2 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.900
 I wondered a long time ago and what 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.490
 It generally for a piece of iron goes on 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.289
 restaurants maybe this is my opinion yes 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.539
 nightmare such a theory often 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.119
 meets let 's discuss it and define 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.289
 who is most likely to have this andy 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.449
 skeleton ichiriu 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.730
 become this theory i was inspired by lads 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.529
 foreigners so here I was originally thinking 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.820
 what is this endoskeleton when the skeleton 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.309
 golden freddy 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.190
 pull him out 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.920
 experiences lure children so on and on 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.469
 further but if you look at the very 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.379
 Golden Freddy makes it clear that 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.079
 he still has it and let the skeleton 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.899
 broken but there is then this option 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.270
 I 'm sorry I'm a golden bear ult 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.520
 I hold after the appearance of the teaser is very 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.100
 many chili dumas that this skeleton is equal 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.559
 nightmare main driving force like 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.460
 realizing that he had a similar 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.710
 ears and used a nightmare can be seen a little bit 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.890
 drive summer on hand and it has a rounded 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.680
 the shape is like a skeleton in fnaf 2 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.110
 doom already quite unlikely wait a minute 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.630
 take the time to eat 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.530
 before the hand looks like but there are a couple of facts 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.140
 which is easy 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.799
 destroy this theory means fact 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.990
 namba van 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.159
 endoskeleton four fingers while 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.259
 at nightmare from 5 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.540
 this is the most obvious simplest fact 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.759
 nightmare has long been the dream spring Freddy 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.439
 because you can climb a man into it 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.780
 if you are so attentive now 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.900
 look at the endoskeleton you'll see what 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.000
 man can't get into it 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.460
 well first look at the hands in the middle 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.470
 hands goes healthy steel hole 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.990
 it is obvious that the person is not there 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.140
 stretch, I'm not talking about the face 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.630
 it is obvious that spring Freddie endoskeletons and 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.759
 spring bonnie were completely different 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.560
 head more rounded to them 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.140
 could put a man's head 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.149
 hands are more spacious so that they can 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.729
 it was shove your hand well in general you understood 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.130
 but that's not all, again, we'll see 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.770
 on the same nightmare hand his hand 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.300
 wider compared to the body while 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.300
 and this is the skeleton of it. 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.730
 little well and in conclusion most 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.400
 fatalities have a skeleton and balls are visible 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.540
 that connect the hand and the bodies of nightmares 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.150
 this part is naked 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.860
 and there are no balls to remove these balls 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.260
 just could not because otherwise 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.870
 the hand would fall off these facts clearly 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.230
 prove that I years, no nightmare Yandex 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.959
 the same thing well here so i am about the same 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.540
 yes yes yes but then whose is this andy skeleton 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.670
 it seems that the answer was found back to 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.050
 the initial version of golden freddy from him 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.580
 very clearly shows that the hand is 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.650
 in one piece 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.959
 to one arm tightly attached 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.390
 count the other hand has no moveable 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.300
 fingers that is, the hand is made one 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.879
 a piece with the case of the owings skeleton is clearly visible 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.640
 that fingers move and then gave 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.610
 think a little bit what if it's 5 and 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.590
 stand animatronics because traditionally 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.819
 animatronics have 5 individuals Freddie Bonnie 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.860
 foxy check and golden freddy such a scheme 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.800
 was the third generation of animatronics 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.959
 from fnaf 1 the same scheme was at the first 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.720
 generations of animatronics old animatronics 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.390
 but why suddenly there is no golden Freddie 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.370
 the second generation of that animatronics because 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.010
 golden robots were with this restaurant 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.049
 the very beginning of the story where there were spring 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.750
 bonnie esprit freddie even they were 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.480
 golden leaves that they should have 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.610
 make and made golden that freddie but 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.099
 didn't have time to put a suit on him 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.140
 now the baby golden bear walks by 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.090
 restaurant but without a suit 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.220
 that's just wondering why they decided 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.500
 not up to collect the costume or just not 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.250
 had time maybe it has something to do with 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.709
 killings 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.239
 because the killer was killing children it is in 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.459
 golden freddy costume 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.920
 maybe that's why they decided that we were not 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.989
 need a golden next freddy decision 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.330
 this already arrived after they 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.590
 made will give years it was decided just 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.810
 leave this endoskeleton 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.730
 in some secret room from where 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.980
 he then goes out and hunt us in 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.900
 fnaf 2 and remember that usually the year 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.080
 Freddy is a complete copy of the usual Freddy for 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.030
 color exclusion 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.230
 it is then that golden freddy is a complete copy 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.290
 the usual that Freddy 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.630
 street corner logic and now look at 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.310
 the finger of that Freddie they are made small 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.549
 the komi segment that allows this 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.430
 animatronics move them just as 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.860
 this skeleton also has worse ears 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.540
 bear truth they are a little bit different 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.800
 angle most likely as is the case with 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.530
 Boney, these ears can be slightly 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.420
 move his similar muzzle and he also 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.550
 not designed on the couch and man 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.220
 this animatronic from all this 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.010
 it turns out that that golden freddy was in 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.500
 the restaurant and it did not have time to collect 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.410
 the end of this comes out that second 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.350
 the generation also had 5 animatronics 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.580
 who is logical because golden freddie is always 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.860
 the fate of the restaurant 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.200
 Well, that's all my dear friends hope 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.200
 did you like bye bye good luck
