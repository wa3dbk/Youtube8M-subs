it's kind of like elvish mystic it's

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.800 
it's kind of like elvish mystic it's
just<00:03:00.910> like<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> turn<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.810> mana<00:03:02.470> dork<00:03:02.770> I<00:03:03.810> don't

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
just like a turn to mana dork I don't

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.090 
just like a turn to mana dork I don't
know<00:03:04.870> probably<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.320> root<00:03:05.500> wall<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.950> thing

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
know probably a root wall is the thing

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.199 
know probably a root wall is the thing
that<00:03:06.130> stands<00:03:06.430> out<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:06.700> me<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:08.340> think<00:03:09.340> for<00:03:09.490> be<00:03:09.610> I'm

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
that stands out to me I think for be I'm

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.320 
that stands out to me I think for be I'm
looking<00:03:10.720> at<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.870> mana<00:03:11.020> web<00:03:11.200> sliver<00:03:11.910> if<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.120> at

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
looking at the mana web sliver if I at

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.570 
looking at the mana web sliver if I at
this<00:03:13.600> point<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.140> know<00:03:14.170> four<00:03:14.530> cards<00:03:14.890> in<00:03:15.070> had

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
this point you know four cards in had

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.370 
this point you know four cards in had
picked<00:03:15.910> up<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.120> sliver<00:03:16.360> you<00:03:16.870> know<00:03:16.959> maybe<00:03:17.140> like<00:03:17.350> a

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
picked up a sliver you know maybe like a

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.560 
picked up a sliver you know maybe like a
rare<00:03:17.620> one<00:03:17.769> or<00:03:17.920> something<00:03:18.150> maof<00:03:19.150> silver<00:03:19.360> be<00:03:19.540> a

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
rare one or something maof silver be a

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.120 
rare one or something maof silver be a
first<00:03:19.840> grab<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.350> lil<00:03:20.590> bit<00:03:20.680> awkward<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.070> we

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
first grab a lil bit awkward that we

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.699 
first grab a lil bit awkward that we
have<00:03:21.250> two<00:03:21.550> ramps<00:03:21.820> in<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.150> same<00:03:22.360> yeah<00:03:22.750> but<00:03:23.440> I

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
have two ramps in the same yeah but I

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.470 
have two ramps in the same yeah but I
think<00:03:24.070> at<00:03:24.130> this<00:03:24.220> point<00:03:24.310> if<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:25.030> didn't<00:03:25.390> have

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
think at this point if you didn't have

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.750 
think at this point if you didn't have
any<00:03:25.780> slippers<00:03:26.200> yet<00:03:26.440> um<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:27.400> know<00:03:27.459> if<00:03:27.550> you<00:03:27.610> take

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
any slippers yet um you know if you take

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.310 
any slippers yet um you know if you take
that<00:03:27.910> one<00:03:28.090> you're<00:03:28.269> passing<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.630> blur<00:03:28.870> silver

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
that one you're passing the blur silver

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.380 
that one you're passing the blur silver
but<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:29.950> think<00:03:30.190> that's<00:03:30.370> okay<00:03:30.640> Sally<00:03:30.970> these<00:03:31.209> work

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
but I think that's okay Sally these work

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.520 
but I think that's okay Sally these work
really<00:03:31.420> well<00:03:31.660> in<00:03:31.870> conjunction<00:03:32.290> with<00:03:32.410> each

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
really well in conjunction with each

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.370 
really well in conjunction with each
other<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.940> might<00:03:34.120> weel<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.750> which<00:03:34.959> it's<00:03:35.200> not

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
other that might weel to which it's not

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.590 
other that might weel to which it's not
necessarily<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.160> biggest<00:03:36.519> thing<00:03:36.730> if<00:03:37.420> there's

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
necessarily the biggest thing if there's

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.449 
necessarily the biggest thing if there's
a<00:03:37.660> good<00:03:37.780> possibility<00:03:37.930> right<00:03:38.500> wheel<00:03:38.830> so<00:03:39.190> if<00:03:39.400> you

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
a good possibility right wheel so if you

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.680 
a good possibility right wheel so if you
pass<00:03:39.640> both<00:03:39.850> of<00:03:40.060> these<00:03:40.150> your<00:03:40.300> second<00:03:40.570> message

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
pass both of these your second message

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
flip over root wallow you mentioned the

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.350 
flip over root wallow you mentioned the
sliver<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:28.110> can<00:04:28.230> flip<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.560> one<00:04:28.770> over<00:04:29.360> I

cards that stays around very all long so

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.840 
cards that stays around very all long so
we'll<00:04:36.570> take<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.810> look<00:04:36.960> at<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.230> from<00:04:37.380> here<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:38.130> we

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
we'll take a look at it from here so we

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.820 
we'll take a look at it from here so we

at<00:05:24.570> least<00:05:24.690> from<00:05:24.840> this<00:05:25.050> pack<00:05:25.320> we<00:05:25.620> wouldn't<00:05:25.920> have

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
at least from this pack we wouldn't have

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.920 
at least from this pack we wouldn't have
too<00:05:26.250> much<00:05:26.490> in<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.970> deck<00:05:27.150> to<00:05:27.300> work<00:05:27.480> with<00:05:27.660> planar

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
too much in the deck to work with planar

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.200 
too much in the deck to work with planar
cleansing<00:05:28.170> in<00:05:28.380> terms<00:05:28.560> of<00:05:28.710> a<00:05:28.860> good<00:05:29.130> control<00:05:29.850> arc

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
cleansing in terms of a good control arc

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.210 
cleansing in terms of a good control arc
type<00:05:30.480> so<00:05:31.200> I<00:05:31.230> might<00:05:31.500> take<00:05:31.710> it<00:05:31.890> switch<00:05:32.100> because

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
type so I might take it switch because

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.680 
type so I might take it switch because
there's<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.460> lot<00:05:32.520> of<00:05:32.640> creatures<00:05:33.090> almost<00:05:33.570> as<00:05:33.660> a

there's a lot of creatures almost as a

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.290 
there's a lot of creatures almost as a
defensive<00:05:34.200> mechanism<00:05:34.410> to<00:05:35.010> have<00:05:35.760> it<00:05:35.880> not<00:05:36.090> be

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
defensive mechanism to have it not be

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.120 
defensive mechanism to have it not be
played<00:05:36.540> against<00:05:36.960> me<00:05:37.080> with<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.830> creatures
