hey<00:00:08.130> it's<00:00:08.550> praxis<00:00:09.210> guy<00:00:09.450> 86<00:00:10.080> here<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:11.420> this<00:00:12.420> is

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
hey it's praxis guy 86 here and this is

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.410 
hey it's praxis guy 86 here and this is
a<00:00:12.600> video<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.219> reeling<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.340> differentials<00:00:15.150> and

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
a video on reeling the differentials and

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.810 
a video on reeling the differentials and
the<00:00:15.809> slash<00:00:16.110> 4x4<00:00:17.480> okay<00:00:19.070> basically<00:00:20.070> from<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
the slash 4x4 okay basically from the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.609 
the slash 4x4 okay basically from the
first<00:00:21.029> thing<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.240> did<00:00:22.070> for<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> front<00:00:24.259> was<00:00:25.259> take

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
first thing I did for the front was take

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.919 
first thing I did for the front was take
off<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.279> two<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.029> three<00:00:27.300> screws<00:00:27.949> right<00:00:28.949> here

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
off the two the three screws right here

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.670 
off the two the three screws right here
that's<00:00:30.929> what<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.140> did<00:00:31.380> first<00:00:33.170> second<00:00:36.260> way<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
that's what I did first second way is

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.990 
that's what I did first second way is
this<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.040> yeah

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
this so yeah

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.910 
this so yeah
well<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> did<00:00:40.289> I<00:00:40.530> took<00:00:40.739> off<00:00:40.890> three<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.520> here

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
well I did I took off three right here

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.849 
well I did I took off three right here
ready<00:00:43.920> right<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:46.609> then<00:00:47.609> I<00:00:48.320> took<00:00:49.320> off

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
ready right there and then I took off

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.819 
ready right there and then I took off
the<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:51.030> screws<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> caster<00:00:52.379> box<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the the screws on the caster box so

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.119 
the the screws on the caster box so
these<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.190> free<00:00:54.320> like<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.910> on<00:00:56.910> both<00:00:57.120> sides

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
these are free like that on both sides

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.740 
these are free like that on both sides
so<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.760> take<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.800> differentials<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
so I can take the differentials out and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.150 
so I can take the differentials out and
I<00:01:04.220> took<00:01:05.220> off<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:06.570> did<00:01:06.690> I<00:01:06.780> tell<00:01:06.840> stood<00:01:07.350> out

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
I took off what did I tell stood out

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.810 
I took off what did I tell stood out
I<00:01:08.190> took<00:01:09.120> off<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:10.160> screw<00:01:11.160> right<00:01:11.340> there<00:01:11.610> we're

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
I took off the screw right there we're

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.420 
I took off the screw right there we're
moving<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.300> differential<00:01:12.900> case<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.470> mean<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
moving the differential case I mean the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.180 
moving the differential case I mean the
whole<00:01:14.550> yeah<00:01:15.680> right<00:01:16.680> there

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
whole yeah right there

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:27.710 
whole yeah right there
took<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.700> out<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:24.350> oh<00:01:25.730> they're<00:01:26.730> three<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.420> took

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
took it out and oh they're three I took

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.930 
took it out and oh they're three I took
the<00:01:27.870> bumper<00:01:28.170> off<00:01:28.350> they're<00:01:28.590> three<00:01:29.280> screws<00:01:29.640> for

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
the bumper off they're three screws for

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.350 
the bumper off they're three screws for
the<00:01:30.030> bumper<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.870> pretty<00:01:31.140> easy<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.310> see

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the bumper not pretty easy to see

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.490 
the bumper not pretty easy to see
even<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.870> didn't<00:01:34.080> have<00:01:34.170> any<00:01:34.320> instructions

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
even if you didn't have any instructions

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.050 
even if you didn't have any instructions
you<00:01:35.010> could<00:01:35.250> probably<00:01:35.430> get<00:01:35.700> them<00:01:35.850> off<00:01:36.650> okay

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
you could probably get them off okay

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.610 
you could probably get them off okay
this<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.240> what<00:01:40.940> first<00:01:41.940> you<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.960> when<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
this is what first you have to when the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.520 
this is what first you have to when the
differential<00:01:44.190> comes<00:01:44.400> out<00:01:45.200> there<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.320> four

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
differential comes out there are four

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.600 
differential comes out there are four
screws<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.010> this<00:01:47.190> thing

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
screws on this thing

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.810 
screws on this thing
one<00:01:47.910> two<00:01:48.950> three<00:01:49.950> four<00:01:50.910> okay<00:01:51.590> when<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.820> when

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
one two three four okay when that when

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.480 
one two three four okay when that when
one<00:01:54.060> through<00:01:54.300> those<00:01:54.710> there<00:01:55.710> are<00:01:55.890> four<00:01:56.370> little

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
one through those there are four little

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.690 
one through those there are four little
screws<00:01:56.850> when<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.690> come<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.700> these

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
screws when you come up with this these

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.480 
screws when you come up with this these
two<00:01:59.910> things<00:02:00.210> now<00:02:01.080> there<00:02:01.410> are<00:02:01.500> some<00:02:01.650> there<00:02:02.160> used

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
two things now there are some there used

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.820 
two things now there are some there used
to<00:02:02.580> be<00:02:02.640> some<00:02:02.940> spider<00:02:03.330> gears<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.810> there<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.260> took

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
to be some spider gears in there I took

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.499 
to be some spider gears in there I took
them<00:02:05.160> out<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.550> I'm<00:02:05.759> gonna<00:02:05.910> put<00:02:06.119> them<00:02:06.210> back<00:02:06.330> in

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
them out and I'm gonna put them back in

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.980 
them out and I'm gonna put them back in
when<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.750> refill<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> oil<00:02:08.179> but<00:02:09.179> right<00:02:09.840> now

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
when I refill the oil but right now

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.040 
when I refill the oil but right now
they're<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.360> dump<00:02:12.660> all<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
they're out and you just dump all the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.780 
they're out and you just dump all the
oil<00:02:13.230> out<00:02:13.500> try<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> get<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.190> out<00:02:14.280> with<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.489> towel

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
oil out try to get it out with a towel

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.850 
oil out try to get it out with a towel
do<00:02:15.300> whatever<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.170> get<00:02:16.290> all<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.709> out

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
do whatever you can to get all of it out

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.949 
do whatever you can to get all of it out
and<00:02:19.100> then<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.900> simply<00:02:23.420> place<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.600> spider

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
and then you simply place the spider

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.120 
and then you simply place the spider
gears<00:02:25.260> back<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.770> right<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:27.150> there

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
gears back in right in there

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.280 
gears back in right in there
right<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.340> there<00:02:30.560> then<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:33.209> fill<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.600> will

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
right in there then you fill it will

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.500 
right in there then you fill it will
fill<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.680> with<00:02:34.800> differential<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:36.000> five<00:02:36.239> K

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
fill it with differential of just five K

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.120 
fill it with differential of just five K
that's<00:02:36.720> that's<00:02:37.320> what<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.590> guy<00:02:37.739> said<00:02:37.769> at<00:02:38.070> the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
that's that's what the guy said at the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.810 
that's that's what the guy said at the
hobby<00:02:38.340> shop<00:02:42.440> fill<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.590> up<00:02:43.680> into<00:02:43.890> half<00:02:44.519> with

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
hobby shop fill it up into half with

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.949 
hobby shop fill it up into half with
submerging<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.739> spider<00:02:46.739> gears<00:02:47.070> Oh<00:02:47.959> honest

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
submerging the spider gears Oh honest

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.170 
submerging the spider gears Oh honest
this<00:02:49.350> case<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.310> pull<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.640> off<00:02:50.790> when

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
this case you can pull it off when

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.030 
this case you can pull it off when
you've<00:02:51.420> unscrewed<00:02:51.930> everything<00:02:54.860> with<00:02:55.860> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
you've unscrewed everything with the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.410 
you've unscrewed everything with the
back<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:58.519> basically<00:02:59.519> did<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.820> same<00:03:00.150> thing

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
back I basically did the same thing

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.710
