apply<00:00:47.190> copy<00:00:47.520> o<00:00:47.670> matic<00:00:49.460> will<00:00:50.460> use<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.910> center

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
apply copy o matic will use the center

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.500 
apply copy o matic will use the center
of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.510> object<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.350> mirroring<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:53.010> X

of the object to do the mirroring in X

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.060 
of the object to do the mirroring in X
so<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> left<00:00:54.930> side<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
so the left side is going to be on the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.250 
so the left side is going to be on the
right<00:00:56.250> side<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.390> right<00:00:57.539> side<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:58.020> going

right side and the right side is going

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.220 
right side and the right side is going
to<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> left<00:00:58.859> side<00:00:59.570> we<00:01:00.570> will<00:01:00.719> then<00:01:00.930> set

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
to be on the left side we will then set

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.780 
to be on the left side we will then set
the<00:01:01.379> threshold<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:02.960> 0.01<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.470> save<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> mirror

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790

matic<00:01:16.560> has<00:01:16.860> found<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> mirror<00:01:17.460> pair<00:01:17.790> for

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
matic has found the mirror pair for

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.749 
matic has found the mirror pair for
fourteen<00:01:18.600> hundred<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.080> seven<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.619> them<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
fourteen hundred and seven of them the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
fourteen hundred and seven of them the
reason<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:22.020> model<00:01:22.470> is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
reason for this is that this model is

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.030 
reason for this is that this model is
slightly<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.189> symmetrical<00:01:23.970> by<00:01:24.930> 39<00:01:25.350> points<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
slightly a symmetrical by 39 points to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.690 
slightly a symmetrical by 39 points to
be<00:01:26.159> exact<00:01:27.710> now<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.920> we've<00:01:29.070> created<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
be exact now that we've created the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.149 
be exact now that we've created the
reference<00:01:30.119> point<00:01:30.420> what<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.770> select

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
reference point what we can do is select

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.580 
reference point what we can do is select
this<00:01:32.400> target<00:01:32.909> here<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.079> target

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590

need to redo it for the other eye we can

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.550 
need to redo it for the other eye we can
just<00:02:02.520> collapse<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.149> stack<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.320> just

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
just collapse the stack and we have just

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
just collapse the stack and we have just
created<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:05.100> new<00:02:05.280> morph<00:02:05.549> target<00:02:07.250> let's<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.429> the

created a new morph target let's do the
same<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:08.940> our<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.209> symmetric<00:02:09.780> emotion<00:02:10.550> we<00:02:11.550> are

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
same with our a symmetric emotion we are

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.250 
same with our a symmetric emotion we are
going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.030> create<00:02:12.239> another<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.690> symmetric

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
going to create another a symmetric

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.830 
going to create another a symmetric
emotion

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
emotion

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.839 
emotion
actually<00:02:14.800> we're<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.190> going<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.489> flip<00:02:15.700> it

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
actually we're just going to flip it

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.110 
actually we're just going to flip it
entirely<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.950> we'll<00:02:18.069> select<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.640> vertices<00:02:18.819> of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
entirely so we'll select the vertices of

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.869 
entirely so we'll select the vertices of
the<00:02:19.360> face<00:02:19.830> basically<00:02:20.830> only<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.580> vertices

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
the face basically only the vertices

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.869 
the face basically only the vertices
that<00:02:22.060> are<00:02:22.239> part<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:22.810> facial<00:02:23.050> expression

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
that are part of this facial expression

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.540 
that are part of this facial expression
apply<00:02:24.879> copy<00:02:25.209> o<00:02:25.360> matic<00:02:25.660> again<00:02:26.080> copy<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.069> points

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
the exact mirror of our original target

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.440 
the exact mirror of our original target
moving<00:02:35.200> on<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.650> our<00:02:35.680> half<00:02:36.010> smile<00:02:36.459> target<00:02:36.970> I'll

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
moving on to our half smile target I'll

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.539 
moving on to our half smile target I'll
just<00:02:37.900> select<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.410> side<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.950> face<00:02:39.129> that<00:02:39.370> is

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
just select the side of the face that is

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.630 
just select the side of the face that is
actually<00:02:39.970> smiling<00:02:40.920> apply<00:02:41.920> copy<00:02:42.220> o<00:02:42.370> matic

click mirror and that's it we've created

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.750 
click mirror and that's it we've created
the<00:02:48.519> full<00:02:48.730> smile<00:02:49.150> with<00:02:49.630> just<00:02:49.870> one<00:02:50.110> half

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the full smile with just one half

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.430 
the full smile with just one half
instead<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.880> manually<00:02:52.360> moving<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.989> points<00:02:53.319> to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
instead of manually moving the points to

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.589 
instead of manually moving the points to
create<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.950> smile<00:02:54.250> we<00:02:54.670> created<00:02:55.060> half<00:02:55.299> of<00:02:55.480> it

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
create the smile we created half of it

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.319 
create the smile we created half of it
and<00:02:55.840> with<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.590> help<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.890> copy<00:02:57.190> o<00:02:57.310> matic<00:02:57.579> we

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
and with the help of copy o matic we

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.699 
and with the help of copy o matic we
finished<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.900> target<00:02:59.290> in<00:02:59.410> seconds<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:02.110> if<00:03:02.620> we

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
finished the target in seconds so if we

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.069 
finished the target in seconds so if we
go<00:03:02.920> back<00:03:03.099> to<00:03:03.160> our<00:03:03.340> head<00:03:03.579> model<00:03:03.819> here<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.329> we<00:03:04.930> go

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
go back to our head model here and we go

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.410 
go back to our head model here and we go
back<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.290> more<00:03:05.680> fur<00:03:05.920> we<00:03:06.700> can<00:03:06.879> see<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.239> the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
back to more fur we can see that the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.080 
back to more fur we can see that the
smile<00:03:07.810> was<00:03:07.840> fully<00:03:08.379> updated<00:03:08.950> thanks<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.970> the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
smile was fully updated thanks to the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.220 
smile was fully updated thanks to the
automatically<00:03:10.840> reload<00:03:11.230> targets<00:03:11.769> option<00:03:13.230> the

automatically reload targets option the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.500 
automatically reload targets option the
blink<00:03:14.500> now<00:03:14.620> affects<00:03:14.950> both<00:03:15.190> eyes<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.879> if<00:03:16.329> we

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
blink now affects both eyes and if we

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.500 
blink now affects both eyes and if we
want<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.739> can<00:03:17.769> add<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.069> new<00:03:18.280> target<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:19.329> have

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
want to we can add a new target to have

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.660 
want to we can add a new target to have
the<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.720> symmetric<00:03:20.319> emotion<00:03:20.769> on<00:03:20.920> one<00:03:21.130> side<00:03:21.430> with

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
the a symmetric emotion on one side with

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.140 
the a symmetric emotion on one side with
one<00:03:21.700> target<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.769> on<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.920> other<00:03:24.069> with<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.000> new

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
one target and on the other with the new

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.949 
one target and on the other with the new
one<00:03:26.639> so<00:03:27.639> as<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.970> can<00:03:28.120> see<00:03:28.359> with<00:03:28.480> these<00:03:28.630> morph

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
one so as you can see with these morph

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.229 
one so as you can see with these morph
targets<00:03:29.380> I<00:03:29.670> didn't<00:03:30.670> have<00:03:30.849> to<00:03:31.060> actually

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
the position of vertices from one model

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.120 
the position of vertices from one model
and<00:03:39.670> paste<00:03:40.599> a<00:03:40.780> mirrored<00:03:41.200> version<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.769> them<00:03:41.920> to
