much a part two of the ice so cab video
that<00:00:19.310> I<00:00:19.430> did<00:00:19.640> before<00:00:19.820> I<00:00:20.300> didn't<00:00:20.930> get<00:00:21.289> a<00:00:21.320> lot<00:00:21.500> of

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
that I did before I didn't get a lot of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.800 
that I did before I didn't get a lot of
questions<00:00:22.009> about<00:00:22.189> how<00:00:22.579> does<00:00:22.789> a<00:00:22.820> sound<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:23.689> it

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
questions about how does a sound and it

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.800 
questions about how does a sound and it
looks<00:00:24.050> great<00:00:24.349> but<00:00:24.619> does<00:00:25.070> it<00:00:25.220> actually<00:00:25.810> make

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
looks great but does it actually make

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.870 
looks great but does it actually make
any<00:00:27.019> difference<00:00:27.590> from<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.400> Randall

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
any difference from the Randall

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.210 
any difference from the Randall
isolation<00:00:29.480> bar<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.529> what<00:00:30.650> I'm<00:00:30.740> going<00:00:30.949> to<00:00:31.009> do

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
isolation bar so what I'm going to do

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.060 
isolation bar so what I'm going to do
today<00:00:31.460> is<00:00:32.449> I'm<00:00:32.660> going<00:00:32.839> to<00:00:32.900> show<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:33.170> pretty

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
today is I'm going to show you pretty

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.920 
today is I'm going to show you pretty
much<00:00:34.250> what<00:00:34.519> happens<00:00:34.970> to<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.330> sound<00:00:35.600> when<00:00:35.809> you

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
much what happens to the sound when you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.650 
much what happens to the sound when you
isolate<00:00:36.170> it<00:00:36.769> and<00:00:36.949> I'm<00:00:37.910> probably<00:00:38.150> going<00:00:38.600> to

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
isolate it and I'm probably going to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.439 
isolate it and I'm probably going to
give<00:00:38.839> you<00:00:38.960> an<00:00:39.140> idea<00:00:39.290> of<00:00:39.589> how<00:00:40.040> does<00:00:40.339> it<00:00:40.519> how<00:00:41.390> does

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
give you an idea of how does it how does

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.420 
give you an idea of how does it how does
it<00:00:41.600> affect<00:00:42.019> the<00:00:42.140> sail<00:00:42.470> to<00:00:42.710> have<00:00:42.860> two<00:00:43.129> mics

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
it affect the sail to have two mics

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.780 
it affect the sail to have two mics
instead<00:00:43.940> of<00:00:44.059> one<00:00:45.220> one<00:00:46.220> problem<00:00:46.580> that<00:00:46.729> you

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
instead of one one problem that you

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.270 
instead of one one problem that you
might<00:00:46.970> run<00:00:47.180> into<00:00:47.239> using<00:00:48.080> an<00:00:48.229> ISO<00:00:48.470> cabinet<00:00:49.100> is

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
might run into using an ISO cabinet is

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.100 
might run into using an ISO cabinet is
that<00:00:49.489> you<00:00:49.640> get<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:49.850> little<00:00:50.180> bit<00:00:50.269> of<00:00:50.420> boom<00:00:50.690> eNOS

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
that you get a little bit of boom eNOS

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.609 
that you get a little bit of boom eNOS
sir<00:00:51.470> like<00:00:51.680> a<00:00:51.710> boxy<00:00:52.369> sound<00:00:52.809> but<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.260> might<00:00:54.470> be

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:54.619 
sir like a boxy sound but you might be

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.189 
sir like a boxy sound but you might be
in<00:00:54.739> a<00:00:54.830> situation<00:00:55.040> where<00:00:55.510> what<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:56.629> found<00:00:56.900> in

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
in a situation where what you found in

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.320 
in a situation where what you found in
sound<00:00:57.500> do<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:57.710> want<00:00:58.040> but<00:00:58.369> you<00:00:58.430> want<00:00:58.699> to<00:00:58.820> use<00:00:58.939> an

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
sound do you want but you want to use an

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.450 
sound do you want but you want to use an
iso<00:00:59.479> cab<00:00:59.869> so<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:00.170> might<00:01:00.439> have<00:01:00.650> to<00:01:00.890> live<00:01:01.159> with<00:01:01.430> a

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
iso cab so you might have to live with a

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.179 
iso cab so you might have to live with a
boom<00:01:01.909> in<00:01:02.119> s<00:01:02.269> or<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.540> Box<00:01:02.869> in<00:01:03.080> it<00:01:03.199> but<00:01:04.159> I

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
boom in s or the Box in it but I

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.359 
boom in s or the Box in it but I
actually<00:01:04.339> did<00:01:04.729> a<00:01:04.909> couple<00:01:05.510> of<00:01:05.600> tryouts<00:01:06.049> at<00:01:06.950> one

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
actually did a couple of tryouts at one

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.300 
actually did a couple of tryouts at one
time<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.299> what<00:01:08.479> I<00:01:08.509> did<00:01:08.750> was<00:01:08.930> I<00:01:09.110> recorded<00:01:09.770> with

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
time and what I did was I recorded with

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.670 
time and what I did was I recorded with
the<00:01:10.520> lid<00:01:10.700> open<00:01:10.939> like<00:01:11.299> this<00:01:11.479> or<00:01:12.080> I<00:01:12.140> had<00:01:12.530> it

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
the lid open like this or I had it

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.130 
the lid open like this or I had it
closed<00:01:13.009> all<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.520> way<00:01:13.640> now<00:01:13.820> or<00:01:14.330> I<00:01:14.540> would<00:01:14.930> use

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
closed all the way now or I would use

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.930 
closed all the way now or I would use
sort<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.530> like<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.710> little<00:01:16.430> little<00:01:16.610> bit<00:01:16.910> of

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
sort of like a little little bit of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.480 
sort of like a little little bit of
openness<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:18.020> that<00:01:18.050> actually<00:01:18.860> freed<00:01:19.220> out<00:01:19.460> a

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
openness and that actually freed out a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.440 
openness and that actually freed out a
sound<00:01:19.940> quite<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.570> lot<00:01:20.870> so<00:01:21.790> you<00:01:22.790> have<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.120> try<00:01:23.360> it

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
sound quite a lot so you have to try it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.220 
sound quite a lot so you have to try it
out<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:23.930> see<00:01:24.170> what<00:01:24.410> will<00:01:25.010> you<00:01:25.159> like<00:01:26.080> for<00:01:27.080> this

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
out and see what will you like for this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.860 
out and see what will you like for this
demonstration<00:01:27.470> I'm<00:01:28.280> just<00:01:28.640> running<00:01:29.000> my<00:01:29.180> sir<00:01:29.540> s

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
demonstration I'm just running my sir s

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.910 
demonstration I'm just running my sir s
tree<00:01:30.230> straight<00:01:30.770> into<00:01:31.250> my<00:01:31.460> Laney<00:01:32.680> dc50<00:01:33.710> and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
tree straight into my Laney dc50 and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.300 
tree straight into my Laney dc50 and
that<00:01:34.159> goes<00:01:34.400> into<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.180> ISO<00:01:35.840> cab<00:01:36.290> that<00:01:37.010> goes

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
that goes into the ISO cab that goes

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.969 
that goes into the ISO cab that goes
from<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.150> ISO<00:01:38.300> cab<00:01:38.720> into<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.470> recording

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
from the ISO cab into the recording

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.969 
from the ISO cab into the recording
program<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.080> first<00:01:42.290> thing<00:01:42.650> I'm<00:01:42.740> going<00:01:42.920> to

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
program so the first thing I'm going to

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.580 
program so the first thing I'm going to
show<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:43.190> is<00:01:43.520> how<00:01:43.790> much<00:01:44.300> does<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.840> isolation

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
show you is how much does the isolation

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.550 
show you is how much does the isolation
box<00:01:45.740> actually<00:01:46.010> isolate<00:01:47.050> I've<00:01:48.050> set<00:01:48.350> my

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
box actually isolate I've set my

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.580 
box actually isolate I've set my
amplifier<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:50.030> little<00:01:50.360> bit<00:01:50.450> over<00:01:50.900> bedroom

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
amplifier to a little bit over bedroom

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.010 
amplifier to a little bit over bedroom
standard<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.549> you're<00:01:53.150> gonna<00:01:53.299> see<00:01:53.600> how<00:01:53.840> much

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
standard and you're gonna see how much

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:04.240 
standard and you're gonna see how much
it<00:01:54.320> actually<00:01:54.350> does<00:01:54.890> when<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.670> close<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.060> lid

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:37.170 

and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.610 

so<00:02:38.180> now<00:02:38.329> I've<00:02:38.510> engaged<00:02:38.690> my<00:02:39.110> recording<00:02:39.590> program

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
so now I've engaged my recording program

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.789 
so now I've engaged my recording program
and<00:02:40.250> we're<00:02:40.519> going<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.700> have<00:02:40.879> a<00:02:40.909> little<00:02:41.120> bit<00:02:41.420> of

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
and we're going to have a little bit of

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.580 
and we're going to have a little bit of
overlook<00:02:42.799> on<00:02:43.069> how<00:02:43.459> does<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.209> actual<00:02:44.840> boo

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
overlook on how does the actual boo
