00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.040 
wind I think we've got an option of a
wreck<00:02:10.850> all<00:02:11.060> right<00:02:11.180> well<00:02:11.390> yeah<00:02:11.630> you've<00:02:11.810> got<00:02:11.959> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.620 
wreck all right well yeah you've got the
full<00:02:12.410> wrap<00:02:12.740> obviously<00:02:13.640> at<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.820> top<00:02:14.090> then

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
full wrap obviously at the top then

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.970 
full wrap obviously at the top then
somebody<00:02:14.990> could<00:02:15.140> use<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.590> as<00:02:15.770> an<00:02:15.860> all

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
somebody could use this as an all

somebody could use this as an all
year-round<00:02:16.250> Billy<00:02:16.700> system<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:18.080> will<00:02:18.170> give

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
year-round Billy system it will give

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.800 
year-round Billy system it will give
them<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:19.010> twin<00:02:19.490> skin<00:02:19.850> eliminating
