 every morning when we wake up I 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:21.790
 think I will save genre 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.790
 and I would be half 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.099
 and it's only a matter of time 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.460
 before meeting one that is too much 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.460
 powerful 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.640
 so that I can defeat him 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.660

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.320
 traffic problem it would not be 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.220

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.220

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.340

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.770
 why this is the question of the day we 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.090
 would say 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.100

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.730

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.360

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.310
