00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
little bit of root so that the clips

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.319 
little bit of root so that the clips
have<00:01:43.680> something<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.159> adhere<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.210> want

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
have a little bit of root there her perm

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.210 
have a little bit of root there her perm
was<00:01:51.899> about<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> week<00:01:52.470> old<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.040> kind<00:01:53.189> of

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
was about a week old so it kind of

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.850 
was about a week old so it kind of
worked<00:01:53.430> out<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.820> us<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> when<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> had<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.680> clip

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
worked out for us so when I had to clip

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.649 
worked out for us so when I had to clip
there<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.579> second<00:01:56.939> reference<00:01:57.240> point<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.540> I

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
there the second reference point that I

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.630 
there the second reference point that I
use<00:01:57.899> was<00:01:58.170> old<00:01:58.439> probably<00:01:58.979> half<00:01:59.250> an<00:01:59.399> inch<00:01:59.520> above

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
use was old probably half an inch above

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
use was old probably half an inch above
her<00:01:59.909> ear<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.899> parked<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> hair<00:02:01.439> there<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
I took the very longest track and I used

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.289 
I took the very longest track and I used
that<00:02:04.799> particular<00:02:05.610> track<00:02:05.850> there<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.240> the

that particular track there and the
first<00:02:06.450> thing<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.869> noticed<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.350> put<00:02:07.530> in

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.020 
these clips in her hair that it matched
her<00:02:09.599> hair<00:02:10.129> perfectly

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
her hair perfectly

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.400 
her hair perfectly

these clipping so thumbs up to diva wigs
for<00:02:26.250> being<00:02:26.700> able<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:27.000> match<00:02:27.710> relaxed<00:02:28.710> hair

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
for being able to match relaxed hair

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.350 
for being able to match relaxed hair
very<00:02:29.160> very<00:02:29.370> well<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.610> think<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.970> will<00:02:30.120> match

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
very very well I think it will match

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.140 
very very well I think it will match
natural<00:02:30.990> hair<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:31.620> kind<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.920> depend<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.490> how

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
natural hair just kind of depend on how

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.120 
natural hair just kind of depend on how
you<00:02:33.210> press<00:02:33.570> your<00:02:33.780> hair<00:02:34.050> okay<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.710> this<00:02:34.920> clip

you press your hair okay so this clip
right<00:02:35.160> here<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:35.910> like<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.570> first<00:02:36.750> one

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
right here is just like the first one

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.990 
right here is just like the first one
that<00:02:37.080> we<00:02:37.230> put<00:02:37.740> down<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.280> key<00:02:38.490> point<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.820> I

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
that we put down the key point that I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.640 
that we put down the key point that I
use<00:02:39.210> here<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.690> reference<00:02:39.840> point<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.380> use

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
use here the reference point that I use

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.130 
use here the reference point that I use
was<00:02:41.160> probably<00:02:41.520> half<00:02:41.820> an<00:02:41.970> inch<00:02:42.090> above<00:02:42.210> the<00:02:42.960> last

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
was probably half an inch above the last

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.260 
was probably half an inch above the last
track<00:02:43.440> would<00:02:43.590> be<00:02:43.680> laid<00:02:43.890> close<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.000> crown

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
track would be laid close to the crown

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.240 
track would be laid close to the crown
right<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.990> center<00:02:46.290> back<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.740> head<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
right in the center back of the head and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.340 
right in the center back of the head and
then<00:02:47.760> I'm<00:02:47.880> done<00:02:48.120> with<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.720> back<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:49.020> her<00:02:49.110> head

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
then I'm done with the back of her head

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.890 
then I'm done with the back of her head
I'm<00:02:49.860> going<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.250> move<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.880> sides<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.630> I

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
I'm going to move to the sides and I

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.810 
I'm going to move to the sides and I
used<00:02:52.170> her<00:02:52.410> temple<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.400> side<00:02:53.610> as<00:02:53.790> a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
used her temple on the side as a

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.350 
used her temple on the side as a
reference<00:02:54.240> point<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.260> took<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:56.090> 1:1<00:02:57.090> track

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
reference point and I took the 1:1 track

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.380 
reference point and I took the 1:1 track
of<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.690> two<00:02:57.930> clips<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:59.640> put<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.120> one<00:03:00.300> on

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
of the two clips and I put that one on

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.270 
of the two clips and I put that one on
the<00:03:00.510> temple<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.110> then<00:03:01.560> I've<00:03:01.680> been<00:03:01.770> about<00:03:02.010> half

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
the temple and then I've been about half

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.060 
the temple and then I've been about half
an<00:03:02.430> inch<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.730> up<00:03:02.820> from<00:03:03.060> there<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.320> used<00:03:04.350> a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
an inch and up from there and I used a

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
an inch and up from there and I used a
single<00:03:05.940> track<00:03:06.630> one<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.700> put<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.880> one<00:03:09.060> there

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
single track one and put that one there

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.790 
single track one and put that one there
and<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.360> did<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.600> same<00:03:09.840> thing<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.110> both<00:03:10.470> sides

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
and I did the same thing for both sides

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.430 
and I did the same thing for both sides
so<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.460> love<00:03:12.360> these<00:03:12.510> clips<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.900> wish<00:03:13.170> they<00:03:13.320> would

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
so I love these clips I wish they would

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.260 
so I love these clips I wish they would
match<00:03:13.620> my<00:03:13.830> hair<00:03:14.100> but<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.640> would<00:03:14.850> really<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.180> to

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
match my hair but I would really have to

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.000 
match my hair but I would really have to
go<00:03:15.450> through<00:03:15.660> some<00:03:15.810> serious<00:03:15.990> work<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.650> get<00:03:16.830> them

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
go through some serious work to get them

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.220 
go through some serious work to get them
to<00:03:17.190> match<00:03:17.430> however<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.360> feel<00:03:18.750> like<00:03:19.020> these

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
to match however I feel like these

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.460 
to match however I feel like these
