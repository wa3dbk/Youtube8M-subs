 the mega mega star star force control 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.810
 He knew how to count on portable consoles 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.210

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.909
 Attempts to role - play actions in 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.369
 game boy advance started the mega man saga 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.890
 battle network which still with its 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.140
 detractors had moderate success and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.630
 became cartoon of figures of 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.909
 action unfortunately the attempt to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.770
 innovate of the saga with star wars is 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.590
 repeat itself with some changes 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.750
 its most successful perspectives and a 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.090
 story that had neither feet nor head

 megaman is one of our idols but 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.060
 this time it did not help us 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.060
 defend it 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.550
 It is one of the best games of the genre 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.700
 of the modern age combining elements 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.190
 of classic roles with lots of action and up 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.950
 a little platforms 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.930
 The particularity of this purpose is that its 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.240
 universe is born from a final cross 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.700

 with devils to cape and sword this 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.690
 it sounds like a recipe for failure is 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.800
 a franchise that continues to grow and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.310

 nothing of everything we can say 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.540

 any other action rpg leaving us 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.820
 no arguments to discuss his 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.040
 arrival to consoles may have been a 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.350
 little bumpy but still even 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.390
 Multiplayer fun to invite 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.940

 swords everywhere in an adventure of 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.640
 epic proportions if they are going to sell it 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:55.230
 a devil definitely has to be 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.280

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.760
