00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.460
 and this of course the people's body is 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.400
 any as any implant as 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.380
 the process of the vessels the process has become this 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.280
 same time on the apparatus which is made 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.670
 valuable ill rare for body tissues 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.589
 and materials from titanium 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.329
 but nevertheless happen in case i 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:25.369
 I think that it is indeed 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.699
 rejection though it flows in the background 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.039
 infectious process 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.960
 and the same is worth thinking about 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.620
 either primary or 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.700
 on the rejection of the body or is it 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.470
 infectious process that causes 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.810
 rejection that is everything and often it happens 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.700
 hard to figure it out 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.420
 a percentage of many such cases happen but we have them 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.650
 meanwhile we rank as infectious 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.580
 complications holy not very often often this 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.800
 comes from recent 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.700
 patientâ€™s features because 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.670
 interest with his family side 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.680
 we will do everything so that it does not exist 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.200
 it is usual traditionally conditions 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.100
 degrees 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.310
 and practically 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.450
 because it happens very rarely but all 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.260
 still not inclined to think what it is 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.920
 happened due to 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.650
 either some kind of hidden infection in the body 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.140
 his patient is his extremely weak 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.009
 and either reception what then 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.200
 drugs that she is capable of 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.369
 bring up the immune system ie its 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.049
 the body is not able to fight understanding 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.060
 those price and 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.710
 on any m intrusion of the people's body 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.659
 reacts sluggish 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.050
 inflammation 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.990
 and then we actually see these 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.110
 here 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.150
 early 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.640
 she his participation which among them both 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.000
 of course devices 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.720
 interest cure ituran but how to 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.240
 conventional surgical kana 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.500
 m 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.920
 it's over it's all gone 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.130
 that is, alexei kim fitso plantings 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.939
 ends his recovery and 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.030
 Poltava device in another place another 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.940
 country 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.560
 since we still have some reserves 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.250
 now and now we do it from the other side and whose 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.090
 after some time 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.510
 when he managed to cope with 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.540
 inflammatory tons
