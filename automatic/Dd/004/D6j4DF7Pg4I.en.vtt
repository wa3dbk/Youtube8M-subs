 Very cheerful person very friendly I love it

 be good with people and especially 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.090
 how to meet new people perfect 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.280
 good to do is a little bit more 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.140
 dynamic here I have a glass with several 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.700
 questions that we are going to be removing from 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.770
 one by one so that you go answering and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.540
 We're going to get to know you better and we're going to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.120
 go also knowing your work in 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.280
 our beauty querétaro if you could 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.909
 have some superpower which one would choose and 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.740
 why 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.450
 I think one that I wanted to get as 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.689
 always since I'm super little is 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.759
 like being invisible because it's like super 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.200
 fun like banadesa look like and 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.270
 appears in another place without anyone 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.850
 realize and you could do as many 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.079
 strange things I do not know would be great 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.840
 Now I think it's invisible 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.209
 Of course I would also choose to be invisible 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.670
 or fly what do you think about beauty 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:47.289
 interior I think that the inner life is 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.090
 much more important than the outside 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.390
 because if you do not feel good yourself 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.239
 with yourself this you can not 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.520
 feel beautiful on the outside 

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:59.590
 very good response the greater use you have 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.599
 done or done within the competition 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.479
 of our beauty querétaro today I already know 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.549
 which one I stumble over and I fall where 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.979
 five stairs and he knows that I could not 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.959
 walk like in three days and they were missing 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.780
 ten for the final has been horrible 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.200
 horrible thing was a cannon bear but this 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.299
 He was very funny because that about me 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.400
 I fell all the girls were watching me and 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.930
 it was like, and you're fine and I just 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.540
 I was laughing then it was very 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.099
 fun but it hurt a lot but 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.190
 this is better and of course I'm super 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.190
 all right 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.130
 what preparation you take the carry 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.320
 aspirants before going for the crown 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.350
 well, we have a routine 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.080
 daily is like a month before it is the 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.640
 contest every morning at 6 o'clock 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.140
 in the morning we go to the gym after 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.300
 let's kind of gateway after 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.060
 walkway class we go to our class 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.240
 in nutrition and then by as well as classes 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.250
 and you're class important appointments but 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.330
 little girls and then we also have classes 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.590
 as a festive toilet to make us 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.810
 feel better and so that we can 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.330
 develop in the camera and all that kind 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.790
 of things advantages and disadvantages from 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.940
 our view of querétaro good I think 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.300
 that an advantage I think is that they give you 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.040
 as work easier I could make from 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.560
 this or know in this medium that is the 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.210
 television and the catwalks because 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.710
 you have like a title and people already 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.140
 recognizes then it 's a lot easier 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.050
 get a job so you do not have anything 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.480
 and one of the disadvantages 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.750
 it would be that I have to make up almost 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.450
 Diary that your parents say your parents 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.580
 about being our beauty 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.709
 because at the beginning it was very difficult because 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.120
 my dad did not want I did not want I did not want and 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.220
 I was super against me being 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.880
 our beauty like he did not like 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.490
 everything that had to do with 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.230
 appearance let's say then they are very 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.300
 difficult for me because for like no no 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.650
 no no no and my mom was like herself and already 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.570
 like my dad did not think I was capable 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.970
 we do not have to believe that he is capable but as 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.620
 that I did not see it as a dream like that 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.320
 as I do not I do not want my daughter to 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.350
 disappointed and so and so when he saw me 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.510
 winning was like wow not believing I was 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.640
 super happy in my habitat are super 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.630
 Both happy and they love to support me 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.660
 in whatever then I would like 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.489
 know tell us how that day was that 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.700
 day you won that they had the crown 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.680
 as was 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.630
 its very funny because it marked 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.410
 perfectly that a week before we 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.120
 they have in a hotel and you have like your 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.800
 room and then I had my boom and gabriela 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.990
 pérez le cornada that in fact is one of 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.780
 the television reporters 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.700
 he was telling me how not to 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.610
 true one of the doubts win I swear 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.260
 I am like I do not know if I'm going to win 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.510
 I'm ready to show us type of cases 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.780
 what it says is usual with you 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.610
 conscience and this one tells you then 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.900
 it was very difficult like we're 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.850
 excited for the same time 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.130
 we were scared and so super funny 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.750
 and suddenly we were already in the 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.340
 scenario of nowhere we are in the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.100
 scenario and out of nowhere I brought the run 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.500
 head was like he did not understand 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.060
 There was not very good one of the 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.550
 best days of my life I believe not the 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.529
 best of my life from here to now 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.389

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.859

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.319
