00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.899
 hello everyone with you baby who are a little 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.460
 I disappointed in others and in general and 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.590
 humanity I actually found here 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.870
 I hope my God as I hope that 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.870
 it's just my illness and how would 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.940
 she is not serious about anything 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.119
 something hallucinogenic then there is not even 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.240
 temperatures and high not that but hell 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.490
 take it people made it possible 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.830
 I don't even know how to call fast food 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.539
 this is probably a hamburger but perhaps 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.610
 hamburger hamburger who himself with 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.340
 ether barely alive 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.399
 what are you smoking to do that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.000
 this one is generally legal 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.000
 no if you did it my goodness so 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.219

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.559

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.719

 lying on the floor of this institution 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.990
 notice a piece of glass and find such 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.540
 that's right base fastfood that's right 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.250
 as this question was invented here 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.720
 like the way you programmed 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.850
 everything is clear for some reason, like this 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.979
 question how did you even come to this 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.049
 as I understand you either under 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.400

 herself, that is, she will go a long way 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.869
 she will collect poop on the floor 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.579
 broken glass all that and in general 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.740
 this burger will make a hamburger 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.630

 difficult but trust me believe me it 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.540
 complex as if these things are not attached 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.030

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.269
 competition and this is also not very 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.819
 understandably 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:10.500
