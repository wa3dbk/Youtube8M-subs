00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
think they look kind of real well no but

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.520 
think they look kind of real well no but
yeah<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:26.230> do<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.740> just<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.280> see<00:02:27.580> what<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:29.320> would

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
yeah I do it just to see what it would

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.780 
yeah I do it just to see what it would
look<00:02:29.680> like<00:02:29.740> if<00:02:30.010> actually<00:02:30.460> caught<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
look like if actually caught the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.160 
look like if actually caught the
piercing<00:02:31.270> which<00:02:32.050> i<00:02:32.470> think<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.580> really<00:02:34.420> good<00:02:34.630> to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
piercing which i think is really good to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.380 
piercing which i think is really good to
do<00:02:35.380> because<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.880> wouldn't<00:02:37.090> want<00:02:37.210> to<00:02:37.240> get<00:02:37.330> a

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
do because you wouldn't want to get a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.000 
do because you wouldn't want to get a
piercing<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.200> then<00:02:38.320> think<00:02:38.560> also<00:02:38.740> it's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
piercing and then think also it's

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.660 
piercing and then think also it's
terrible<00:02:39.520> so<00:02:40.270> by<00:02:40.690> doing<00:02:40.750> this<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:42.400> kind<00:02:42.550> of

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
terrible so by doing this you kind of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.470 
terrible so by doing this you kind of
get<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.850> little<00:02:43.000> bit<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:44.220> good<00:02:45.220> preview<00:02:45.580> as<00:02:46.240> to
