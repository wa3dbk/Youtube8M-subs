00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.459
 hello my dear viewer 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.650
 plumbing and graduation 8 welcomes you 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.840
 the herd of dreams the thing is that I haven't 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.270
 there were a lot of clips in which some 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.130
 long action a few short 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.199
 gathered I decided not to combine them 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.369
 put together several 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.680
 pieces short little but immediately 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.629
 So we have a map of the monastery and this replay 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.820
 probably more suitable for transmission 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.129
 just live, but here is such a space 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.190
 the moment that I decided to cut it and 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.430
 do so here separately and so we 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.129
 50 four rents back falls into the water but 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.199
 not drowning with what he will do 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.800
 further out of 3 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.469
 goes down but something like this 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.750
 got scared backwards 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.140
 dangerous fourth vice versa decided but 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.239
 he is an easy frag now I'll strangle him 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.470
 gets from 50 fours four to four 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.860
 starts to sink and everything seems to be he 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.720
 a gift suitcase arrives from 92 to 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.640
 I end up in the hangar 4 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.619
 with a single shot at the stern 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.320
 correctly a certain card substitutes its 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.600
 ass comes here chinese trying 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.630
 punch 54 in the tower he has nothing 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.869
 it turns out to do and take a liter 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.570
 coined from 3 who decides a corpse i 4 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.850
 to flood 50 four in the meantime 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.000
 monasteries occupy the allies are killed 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.610
 rushes al 54 slowly sinking and out 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.820
 the third is trying to help with this but the matter 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.399
 that 50 is so easy to understand and 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.490
 finish off this isa third in general 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.460
 situation one I don't know one of a thousand 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.009
 it happens very rarely to 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.799
 reds are so blunted in 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.990
 one such episode and so all 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.520
 ends very simply 50 foursome 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.710
 retained hp until the end of the battle and spin 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.259
 last remaining shot e 75 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.440
 sends it to the hangar and it's beautiful 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.690
 good win well and this I have all 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.920
 don't forget to watch the ninth and tenth 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.780
 release 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.780
 but for now
