00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.150 

I'm<00:00:03.810> doing<00:00:04.110> it<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.259> point<00:00:04.470> this<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:04.770> what<00:00:05.040> the

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
I'm doing it a point this is what the

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.259 
I'm doing it a point this is what the
watercraft<00:00:05.670> dream<00:00:06.000> looks<00:00:06.299> like<00:00:10.340> in<00:00:11.340> some<00:00:12.240> ways

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
watercraft dream looks like in some ways

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.749 
watercraft dream looks like in some ways
the<00:00:12.780> analogy<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.320> we<00:00:13.590> made<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.490> it's

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
the analogy that we made this that it's

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.120 
the analogy that we made this that it's
a<00:00:14.880> little<00:00:14.910> bit<00:00:15.150> like<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.719> ipod<00:00:16.199> was<00:00:16.500> created

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
a little bit like the ipod was created

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.519 
a little bit like the ipod was created
in<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> current<00:00:17.789> watercraft<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:19.230> wanted

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
in the current watercraft and we wanted

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.220 
in the current watercraft and we wanted
to<00:00:19.560> create<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.039> ipod<00:00:20.550> nano<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.660> needed<00:00:21.930> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
to create the ipod nano so it needed to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.759 
to create the ipod nano so it needed to
have<00:00:22.470> some<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> bigger<00:00:24.060> brother<00:00:24.769> heritage

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
have some of the bigger brother heritage

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.029 
have some of the bigger brother heritage
however<00:00:26.640> by<00:00:27.599> architecture<00:00:28.529> would<00:00:28.920> be

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
however by architecture would be

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.359 
however by architecture would be
different<00:00:29.490> by<00:00:30.330> definition<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.590> needed<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.219> be

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
different by definition it needed to be

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.880 
different by definition it needed to be
different<00:00:32.940> because<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.809> needed<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.380> challenge

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
different because we needed to challenge

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.000 
different because we needed to challenge
every<00:00:35.520> single<00:00:35.910> component<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.660> by<00:00:37.469> doing<00:00:37.530> this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
every single component and by doing this

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
every single component and by doing this
we<00:00:38.579> knew<00:00:38.850> would<00:00:39.180> land<00:00:39.480> with<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.690> different

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
we knew would land with a different

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.020 
we knew would land with a different
architecture<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.770> would<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.100> quite<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.850> bit

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
architecture that would be quite a bit

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
architecture that would be quite a bit
different<00:00:42.600> from<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.870> current<00:00:43.440> watercraft

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
different from the current watercraft

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.069 
different from the current watercraft
yet<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.610> was<00:00:44.850> important<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.690> would<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
yet it was important that it would be a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.799 
yet it was important that it would be a
seadoo<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.280> keep<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.879> area<00:00:48.180> tidge<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
seadoo and keep this area tidge of the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.400 
seadoo and keep this area tidge of the
cdna<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.219> first<00:00:50.489> thing<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:51.510> wanted<00:00:52.110> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
cdna the first thing is we wanted that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.529 
cdna the first thing is we wanted that
product<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.989> really<00:00:54.989> open<00:00:55.379> light<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:57.149> feel

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
product to be really open light you feel

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.990 
product to be really open light you feel
some<00:00:57.870> freedom<00:00:58.590> around<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.609> want<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> to

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
some freedom around it we want it to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.319 
some freedom around it we want it to
move<00:01:00.719> away<00:01:00.989> from<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.340> traditional<00:01:02.579> way<00:01:03.059> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
move away from the traditional way of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.710 
move away from the traditional way of
doing<00:01:03.539> things<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.650> create<00:01:04.949> something<00:01:05.070> that

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
doing things to create something that

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.100 
doing things to create something that
appeals<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.140> makes<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.369> what<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.330> from<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
appeals and makes you what it from the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.890 
appeals and makes you what it from the
get-go<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:11.159> two<00:01:11.460> arms<00:01:11.970> make<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.720> an

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
look closely it looks small but the side

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.140 
look closely it looks small but the side
are<00:01:30.930> high<00:01:31.259> there's<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.070> lot<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.310> buoyancy<00:01:32.850> at

are high there's a lot of buoyancy at
the<00:01:33.329> front<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.990> rear<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:35.579> buoyancy

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
the front and rear so buoyancy

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.160 
the front and rear so buoyancy
proportion<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.820> together<00:01:39.170> makes

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
proportion with all this together makes

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.580 
proportion with all this together makes
part<00:01:40.729> surprisingly<00:01:41.729> stable<00:01:42.590> affordable

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590

doesn't<00:01:44.310> mean<00:01:44.549> cheap<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.450> want<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.950> process

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
doesn't mean cheap we want it to process

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.460 
doesn't mean cheap we want it to process
the<00:01:47.399> material<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.939> different<00:01:48.450> way<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.170> would

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the material a different way that would

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.389 
the material a different way that would
be<00:01:49.649> easier<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> mold<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.860> recyclable<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.159> this

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
be easier to mold and recyclable so this

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.940 
be easier to mold and recyclable so this
is<00:01:53.430> why<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.210> came<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:54.899> politic<00:01:55.500> it's

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
is why we came up with politic it's

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.730 
is why we came up with politic it's
stiffer<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.610> also<00:01:57.450> associated<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
stiffer and also associated with the

stiffer and also associated with the
product<00:01:59.159> architecture<00:01:59.689> what<00:02:00.689> makes<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
product architecture what makes the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.410 
product architecture what makes the
scene<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.380> spark<00:02:01.740> osito<00:02:02.310> everything<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.270> it

scene you spark osito everything that it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.060 
scene you spark osito everything that it
