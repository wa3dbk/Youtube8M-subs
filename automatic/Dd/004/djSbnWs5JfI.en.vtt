 Yukari 3 minutes cooking Hi 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.579
 Yuzuki Yukari 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.230
 Today's fish is the makogarei 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:51.610
 The season has already passed by without p 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:55.660
 You can eat delicious from November to February 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:00.400
 As it is white fish which does not prevent other seasons 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:03.550
 You can taste delicious except for 1 month after laying eggs 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.650
 Using this makogalei today 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.250
 Knob 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.360
 I want to make sashimi 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:18.830
 First of all, prepare Makogalei at the station 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:22.460
 Can you see that there is a pin on the head and the tail fin 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.850
 Put a kitchen knife here and close it 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:32.070
 By doing so, freshness will last longer 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:38.650
 In other words, you can maintain the freshness of the next day 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:42.200
 Next , remove the scissors and put the knife along the center of the body 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.210
 Then open a try along the spine river 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.090
 It became two sheets by this 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:54.829
 Then the other side opens in the same way 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:59.500
 You can see that holding the egg on the ventral side when the opening is over 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:02.800
 The eggs will be cooked later so please save them separately 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.330
 Treat the other side in the same way 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:11.890
 This will open five pieces of makogalei 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:18.210
 The skin is removed after this and it is completed as sashimi 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:24.120
 It is all the responsibility of the Woopee to not look deliciously sorry I'm sorry 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:26.800
 By the way, it was more delicious than the bar sushi store when I liked it when I made an excuse 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.920
 The next remaining egg is 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:36.580
 I want to cook this from now on 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:38.260
 Because of bone and eggs boiled so I put in the Speaking of curry I have to sashimi only 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.400
 I'm too bland 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:50.540
 So pick this into soy sauce today 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:55.850
 It is completed if you cut the egg and put soy sauce so that the soy sauce often stains and let it sleep overnight 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:03:00.980
 It is delicious to eat on hot rice as eating method 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:04.220
 Come you also to please try to eat to make once 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.580
 This will finish cooking for 3 minutes 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.580
