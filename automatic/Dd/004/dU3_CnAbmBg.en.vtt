00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.490
 Y 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.349
 hello how about friends in today's video 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.240
 then we come here with a gameplay of 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.099
 this new game is that of rafael nitro 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.550
 here we are seeing the garage the 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.140
 automobile that I have we go here again 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.800
 as you can see here we can put 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.660
 some enhancers some improvements 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.910
 and it will also change the painting by 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.820
 example 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.350
 that's why they did not charge me so here 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.960
 we have often we have three modes of 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.720
 fast running game multiplayer 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.090
 that I'm not sure if it 's 100% real is 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.150
 say with people 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.340
 with real people 100% but I think not 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.380
 well there we have that option too 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.860
 we have the story mode where we go to 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.330
 meet with six seasons 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.890
 of this hashtag for example here 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.220
 let's play next the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.730
 first race to talk a little more 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.730
 of the game 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.050
 as we can see, he is already loading the 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.050
 game there are 32 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.190
 here we started as I said the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.490
 hash for the new liter game we go for 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.300
 here we go on this side is the how 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.400
 we see him is the younger brother of up 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.940
 the 8 because then as you see is 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.530
 practically the same game with the 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.110
 difference that it has to a certain extent 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.659
 and smaller graphs that we're not going to 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.130
 deny because you can see that they are 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.799
 smaller graphics but you have to remember 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.280
 that this game already installed only weighs in 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.830
 70 mb and compared to salt 8 that 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.980
 it has a size of 1 and a half giga if not 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.850
 I'm wrong 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.980
 it comes and a half then we can not demand 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.390
 too much with our 70 mb that the 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.090
 I like really looks good the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.890
 game I remind you I play it an annex 7 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.480
 2013 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.840
 as you can see here at the top 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.080
 we have different cameras and for 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.319
 example we have this action camera 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.719
 if I'm not mistaken by his name 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.450
 have to move according to us also 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:30.180
 let's move our car I'm going to change 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.230
 the controls for example I prefer 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.230
 play with these controls 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.420
 there they are with our controls are the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.459
 I like to play, I like to be 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.680
 moving the device too much but 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.380
 Well that like everyone 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.230
 vienna and that very small crimes and how 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.569
 come then the game 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.430
 It is very, very good, as I said to 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.190
 six seasons we will have a good 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.799
 good fire time with this gas for the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.840
 micro in multiplayer mode which 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.840
 he told them that surely with some 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.750
 type of shadow that they have loaded 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.239
 we will compete in that in that way and as 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.470
 come and we completed in the first race 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.070
 we give you here in following 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.070
 how much 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.630
 good and unblock other two 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.500
 two races 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.700
 As you can see there are four stars we are leaving 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.840
 to this second 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.620
 I still can not improve 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.860
 let's see some improvement 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.270
 150 and if it reaches me for more acceleration 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.270
 is also the simple 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.660
 there 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.610
 there we are already observing him and how 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.380
 always or as usual because the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.560
 details of this game is that it requires 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.170
 a version of Android 2.3 at least and 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.030
 you can play without internet that's very 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.010
 well to be able 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.180
 to see playing anywhere that 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.430
 we want without need 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.709
 without needing to be depending on 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.709
 3g connection or wifi 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.109
 and I remind you that this is a gameplay 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.549
 by gameplay you will not find any 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.459
 type of link in the description to not 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.060
 have no problem with game love anymore 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.060
 that lately 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.300
 it was not there 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.729
 as I was telling you not to have any 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.800
 problem but I remind you what the 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.659
 description is the link of the page 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.050
 main of the blog that you give him 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:38.250
 there then and send them directly in the 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.870
 right part on top 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.849
 right there is a search bar 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.919
 you there only place fallible hashes 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.199
 All the azkals that will be appearing 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.259
 are available in my blog spot I know 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.300
 they can download very, very easy, not 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.139
 there is no complication or anything for the 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.870
 style 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.900
 it's just for wii to avoid the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.050
 problems in terms of hardware because I 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.050
 the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.520
 I would recommend maybe with 512 mb of 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.340
 ram and I 'm sure this will work 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.470
 game 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.350
 he forgot to mention that in the video 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.660
