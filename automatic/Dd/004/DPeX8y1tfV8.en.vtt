because<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.790> dry<00:01:17.060> air<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:17.270> lot<00:01:17.540> of<00:01:17.720> this<00:01:17.840> is

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
because of that dry air a lot of this is

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.660 
because of that dry air a lot of this is
evaporating<00:01:18.619> before<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.220> reaches<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.550> ground

but<00:01:20.240> we<00:01:20.300> do<00:01:20.420> have<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.690> potential<00:01:20.960> for<00:01:21.140> some

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
but we do have the potential for some

is in the 20s here we have cold air in

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.370 
is in the 20s here we have cold air in
place<00:01:58.580> up<00:01:59.060> into<00:01:59.450> eastern<00:01:59.750> Tennessee<00:02:00.110> around

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
place up into eastern Tennessee around

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.020 
place up into eastern Tennessee around
the<00:02:00.470> Knoxville<00:02:00.920> area<00:02:01.040> but<00:02:01.700> again<00:02:01.909> remember

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
the Knoxville area but again remember

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.750 
the Knoxville area but again remember
it's<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:02.869> dry<00:02:03.229> it's<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:03.710> dry<00:02:03.979> out<00:02:04.159> here<00:02:04.190> so<00:02:04.610> that

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
it's so dry it's so dry out here so that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.120 
it's so dry it's so dry out here so that
when<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.060> rain<00:02:05.270> does<00:02:05.659> move<00:02:05.990> in<00:02:06.260> it<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.890> going

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
when the rain does move in it is going

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.430 
when the rain does move in it is going
to<00:02:07.340> evaporate<00:02:07.670> at<00:02:08.030> first<00:02:08.269> and<00:02:08.510> that<00:02:08.869> cools

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
to evaporate at first and that cools

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.380 
to evaporate at first and that cools

key here is that temperatures are so

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.340 
key here is that temperatures are so
cold<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:48.910> they're<00:03:49.390> not<00:03:49.570> going<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:49.930> warm<00:03:50.170> up

temperature here in the teens and

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.320 
temperature here in the teens and
dropping<00:03:53.590> into<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.950> lower<00:03:54.160> teens<00:03:54.520> as<00:03:54.850> we<00:03:55.209> head

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
dropping into the lower teens as we head

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.880 
dropping into the lower teens as we head
through<00:03:55.480> today<00:03:55.690> this<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.110> it<00:03:56.290> this<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.530> as<00:03:56.739> warm

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
through today this is it this is as warm

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.500 
through today this is it this is as warm
as<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.160> gets<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:57.790> with<00:03:57.910> temperatures<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.390> this

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
as it gets and with temperatures of this

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.050 
as it gets and with temperatures of this
cold<00:03:58.840> it's<00:03:59.080> hard<00:03:59.380> for<00:03:59.680> salt<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.670> work<00:04:00.880> on

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
cold it's hard for salt and to work on

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.880 
cold it's hard for salt and to work on
the<00:04:01.150> roadways<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.230> certainly<00:04:02.590> this<00:04:02.709> is

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890
