00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 very good players i am wise and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.720
 welcome the second video of this 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.719
 channel I bring the top of the five 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.519
 best server no cousin for 1.7 point 2 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.109
 up to 1.8 any version of land 2.8 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.390
 that I consider the best as well 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.460
 guys, I do not tire them anymore and start 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.710
 the video we're going 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.470
 good players we are in what 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.019
 it would be fifth place on the top 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.519
 of premium and servers not good because 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.410
 I put in that I will explain why 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.019
 I understand understand and what is the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.269
 server that service I think it's one of 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.640
 the best known that I'll be 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.800
 naming today is the district server 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.390
 minecraft your lobby is very good and I'm going to 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.430
 explain why they can fifth place 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.839
 I can in fifth place for the 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.729
 problem that are the people who use 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.750
 hack so far I have found many 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.019
 people who use hack 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.239
 but the server goes with zero lag and has 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.030
 many minigames for example capture 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.949
 the flag destroys the nexus escapes from 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.920
 the beast that is in arrangement because 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.240
 tried to enter problem could sky war 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.430
 and 'hunger games ' are one the games 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.140
 the main minigames that like to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.509
 the people and good here you will be able to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.409
 find as well as the classics that are 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.689
 survival survival pvp among other guys 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.119
 so I do not tire them anymore with this 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.189
 server and see you in the room then and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.640
 good players we are in the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.500
 fourth position of the server and this server 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.240
 I think it is not so well known 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.580
 I have not seen that many youtubers was 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.970
 this server but I love ivo and 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.740
 let's see what it is to see we're going 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.900
 they put their lobbies very nice by 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.020
 true is well decorated and is the server 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.580
 of omega craft this is the see I believe I 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.470
 I think it's not that known because 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.920
 there are not many people talk about this 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.290
 server and good and why I put a room 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.990
 put that server because I have not had 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.780
 a long time trying what I 've 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.640
 tested for two or three weeks and it's very 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.170
 little time to put between the three or 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.720
 first four a brain then 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.360
 yours for a fourth place and good 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.459
 guys why I put it and also because 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.680
 I love it is a game model like the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.500
 that is football that consists of having 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.530
 I take out the f1 so they can watch soccer 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.740
 have a stick thrust 2 and hit 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.570
 a 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.830
 is line to put in the sky pp arch in 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.950
 these processes 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.070
 I still will not know 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.780
 I will try to train skywork 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.020
 hunger games this server does not go with 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.660
 no one my computer is not one of the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.270
 best of an average computer 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.550
 desk that has almost all in its 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.770
 home and it's not as good in how you see 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.110
 in when guys the truth then 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.210
 irpf 0 the water is not seeing in 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.090
 screen or it will also be in the 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.400
 description and then we go to the 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.340
 first three servei so see you 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.980
 player in the third second and first 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.020
 put it do see let's go there and 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.200
 good guys we are in what would be 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.320
 being the third player and this 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.300
 server as you do me, it is not so 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.640
 known but his lobby is beautiful me 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.670
 I really like I have not seen this lobby in 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.820
 other side but it is the server of plus and 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.430
 that this server I like its mode of 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.000
 skywork and the mini-games that you have to 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.730
 let's say now 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.730
 is to teach that you are watching me to see 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:36.730
 we go because I do not fall and I fall 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.840
 we are here we go back and from here we go 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.720
 to see what games he has, so you have good 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.400
 what skywork is mp I do not think that 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.910
 what proof prison 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.740
 arcade faction these today are like this one 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.900
 still where it knows it's going to be and 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.280
 come on and arcade is also not available 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.830
 to see it well what I have 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.250
 played here is prison and what is 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.990
 skywork so I see there are flaws in the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.120
 lobby but the server goes well in what 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.610
 are the minimum I bring the servers that 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.260
 be good minigames the lobby does not 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.720
 it matters a lot what I care about is playing 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.150
 in series then well I'm going to throw here 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.820
 to see they are seeing everything there is 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.090
 the server very nice by the way and good 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.080
 guys we're not in the last two 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.950
 posts 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.510
 and I repeat something is observe if you think that 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.210
 they are not the best 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.950
 I believe because in my opinion if you 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.660
 do you have any opinion other than some 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.520
 brain that want to put a next 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.120
 video leaving in the comments and what 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.170
 I'll put it in and try it to see what also 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.510
 go then guys with me go to the 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.940
 second and to the first place then we 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.880
 we see and good guys we meet in 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.190
 the second place the music that you hear 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.990
 it is not the design of the track but it is that 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.840
 is to see that even though it is only very 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.820
 nice that receives with a very music 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.610
 cozy, well, we are talking 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.070
 as you see on the screen the server of your 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.710
 craft this server I consider it one of 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.560
 the best because why 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.470
 skywork their mini games are very good and 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.390
 are implementing new things like 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.030
 we can see on the screen there are sites that 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.610
 we can see there as well the signal 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.620
 this I know him well I know and 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.639
 good guys 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.770
 This is the 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.400
 this would be being the second 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.870
 show kraft server post and how 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.610
 we can see I'm going to show here what 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:41.900
 has has creative action guy word 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.779
 survival than the sky block among others 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.849
 Well, guys, well, we're leaving 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:49.340
 player we go to the second then 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:53.539
 until the first and last place and we 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.939
 we see so we go to the first place and 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.610
 well guys we are already in the 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:01.729
 put number one and for sure you already 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.979
 you will know this server is the best known 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.020
 and the one that was the most filled with 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.520
 that taught in these I do not put it in 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.800
 first place because it fills up a lot and 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:15.050
 be well known but because it is not like 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.509
 to play all the mike maps of 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.719
 petra finals first here you can 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:22.639
 play in skywork and that would help us 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:25.189
 little what are youtuber because if you 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.669
 you watch a video that is not in a 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:30.800
 google craft map finds has 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.259
 fewer visits and despite if you're new 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.539
 I bring this server to you 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:37.940
 absolutely all the maps of cúber 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.560
 crash I also put in first place 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.419
 this is the new one because so far in 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.129
 the moment I was not with a single 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.680
 hack and it's been a long time that 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:48.470
 He has played as good guys left him with 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.389
 sighting of the lobby and I'll leave 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.400
 with an extra server of dust and it's 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.590
 overcoming just now this is not what 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.659
 they can no position because because 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.340
 it just starts in the first place and I want 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:01.009
 go and have asked me to support it as well as 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.930
 already start on youtube I want to see what 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.449
 can see to see if we support it to 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:09.670
 that grow a little more then good guys 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:12.849
 see you on the extra server 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:15.099
 we go to the service then 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:16.990
 and good players we would already meet in 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:19.389
 the last part of the video on the server 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:23.080
 extra the kraft coercion if I do not 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:25.599
 wrong and good and they will ask 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.189
 what to promote server for a simple 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:29.589
 because as I start in 

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:31.869
 youtube that to help is to say see no 

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:32.800
 I'm looking for youtuber range, that's why I'm not looking for 

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:34.389
 nothing 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.009
 what I want is to help this server to 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:38.979
 see if he calls it reset and good to them 

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:41.229

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:50.830
 they are implementing the fight with key and 

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:53.679
