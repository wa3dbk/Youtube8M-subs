it's<00:02:14.099> good<00:02:14.250> about<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.410> semi-automatics<00:02:16.410> is

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
it's good about the semi-automatics is

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.300 
it's good about the semi-automatics is
you<00:02:17.640> get<00:02:17.790> more<00:02:18.750> more<00:02:19.560> rounds<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:19.920> them<00:02:20.069> but<00:02:20.190> was

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
you get more more rounds in them but was

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.630 
you get more more rounds in them but was
good<00:02:20.459> about<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.940> what's<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.870> called<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.640> ball

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
good about the what's it called the ball

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.759 
good about the what's it called the ball

bears is that they don't Jam their Jam
proof<00:02:25.980> pretty<00:02:26.280> much<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:28.879> just<00:02:29.879> food<00:02:30.060> for

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
proof pretty much so just food for

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.539 
proof pretty much so just food for
thought<00:02:30.269> now<00:02:31.049> there's<00:02:31.260> also<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.830> lot<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.370> hogs

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
thought now there's also a lot of hogs

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.920 
thought now there's also a lot of hogs
wild<00:02:33.060> hogs<00:02:33.269> in<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.480> area<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.810> they're

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
wild hogs in this area and they're

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.539 
wild hogs in this area and they're
notoriously<00:02:36.049> dangerous<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.129> be<00:02:38.220> very

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
notoriously dangerous and it can be very

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.759 
notoriously dangerous and it can be very
very<00:02:38.700> aggressive<00:02:39.260> just<00:02:40.260> where<00:02:40.349> I<00:02:40.410> was<00:02:40.650> right

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
very aggressive just where I was right

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:50.500 
very aggressive just where I was right
down<00:02:40.920> there<00:02:41.250> let<00:02:42.060> me<00:02:42.230> show<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.379> on<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:49.280> right

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
down there let me show you on this right

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.750 
down there let me show you on this right
there<00:02:51.980> there's<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.069> lot<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.340> routing<00:02:53.610> right

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
there there's a lot of routing right

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.059 
there there's a lot of routing right
there<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.299> these<00:02:54.720> farmers<00:02:54.989> they<00:02:55.709> want<00:02:55.950> them

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
there and these farmers they want them

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.770 
there and these farmers they want them
gone<00:02:57.349> real<00:02:58.349> bad<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.769> they<00:02:58.829> come<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.160> here<00:02:59.400> and

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
gone real bad and they come in here and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.059 
gone real bad and they come in here and
to<00:03:00.780> get<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.959> drink<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.410> as<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> Creek<00:03:01.799> that

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
to get a drink and as a Creek that

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.949 
to get a drink and as a Creek that
actually<00:03:02.489> flows<00:03:02.760> up<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.329> through<00:03:03.510> here<00:03:04.819> so

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
actually flows up and through here so

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.059 
actually flows up and through here so
pretty<00:03:06.959> much<00:03:07.019> all<00:03:07.200> animals<00:03:07.590> need<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.799> water

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
pretty much all animals need a water

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.030 
pretty much all animals need a water
source<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:09.290> anyway<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.470> water<00:03:10.650> source<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.010> a

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
source so anyway the water source is a

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.210 
source so anyway the water source is a
good<00:03:11.160> place<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.870> kind<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:12.989> look<00:03:13.950> out<00:03:14.099> for

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
good place to kind of look out for

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.220 
good place to kind of look out for
animal<00:03:14.549> tracks<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.970> stuff<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.049> case

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
animal tracks and stuff so in this case

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.960 
animal tracks and stuff so in this case
is<00:03:16.410> hogs<00:03:16.739> actually<00:03:17.069> put<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> game<00:03:17.400> trail<00:03:17.609> came

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
is hogs actually put a game trail came

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.800 
is hogs actually put a game trail came
out<00:03:18.150> here<00:03:18.389> and<00:03:18.709> there's<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.829> wild<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.630> nut
