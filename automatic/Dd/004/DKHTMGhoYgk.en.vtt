this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.930> very<00:00:46.230> nice<00:00:46.410> thinking<00:00:46.680> boat<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
this is very nice thinking boat and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.459 
this is very nice thinking boat and
comes<00:00:47.430> almost<00:00:47.730> ready<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.239> run<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:49.020> requiring

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
comes almost ready to run just requiring

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.130 
comes almost ready to run just requiring
you<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.829> add<00:00:50.100> your<00:00:50.370> own<00:00:50.719> speed<00:00:51.719> controller

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
you to add your own speed controller

nautical<00:00:52.680> speaking<00:00:53.039> try<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> separate

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
nautical speaking try to do a separate

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.610 
nautical speaking try to do a separate
review<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.289> later<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.670> also<00:00:57.620> it

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
review of that one later on and also it

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.610 
review of that one later on and also it
requires<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.820> your<00:01:00.149> own<00:01:00.180> radio<00:01:00.780> system<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.410> well

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
requires a your own radio system as well

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.119 
requires a your own radio system as well
so<00:01:01.680> perhaps<00:01:02.190> I'm<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> fs<00:01:03.300> gt2<00:01:04.129> hobby

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
so perhaps I'm going the fs gt2 hobby

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.000 
so perhaps I'm going the fs gt2 hobby
can<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.869> big<00:01:06.869> range<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.350> supernumerary

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
can do a big range of supernumerary

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.620 
can do a big range of supernumerary
coast<00:01:08.220> hands-free<00:01:08.610> controls<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.390> once

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
coast hands-free controls for this once

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.830 
coast hands-free controls for this once
there's<00:01:09.900> no<00:01:10.020> worry<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:11.119> not<00:01:12.119> finding<00:01:12.479> that's

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
there's no worry of not finding that's

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.750 
there's no worry of not finding that's
apply<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.280> beautiful

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
apply to one of them this is a beautiful

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.140 
apply to one of them this is a beautiful
looking<00:01:14.939> boat<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:16.310> shown<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.670> remember

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
looking boat and shown to you remember

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.380 
looking boat and shown to you remember
the<00:01:18.270> first<00:01:18.420> thing<00:01:18.570> coming<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
the first thing coming out is the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.670 
the first thing coming out is the
instruction<00:01:21.390> manual<00:01:21.780> okay<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
instruction manual okay this is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.350 
instruction manual okay this is
instruction<00:01:23.159> manual<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.670> shooting<00:01:24.150> guide

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
instruction manual and shooting guide

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.050 
instruction manual and shooting guide
obviously<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.170> isn't<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.590> nitro<00:01:25.950> cope<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.490> by

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
obviously this isn't a nitro cope so by

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.200 
obviously this isn't a nitro cope so by
tuning<00:01:27.360> they<00:01:27.750> mean<00:01:28.340> tuning<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.729> assuming

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
tuning they mean tuning as in assuming

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.679 
tuning they mean tuning as in assuming
it<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.720> its<00:01:31.430> best<00:01:32.430> capabilities<00:01:33.210> setting

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
it up to its best capabilities setting

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.219 
it up to its best capabilities setting
up<00:01:33.810> etc<00:01:34.520> next<00:01:35.520> thing<00:01:35.790> coming<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.720> servo

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
up etc next thing coming up is the servo

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.649 
up etc next thing coming up is the servo
okay<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:38.939> actually<00:01:39.180> comes

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
okay and this one actually comes

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.440 
okay and this one actually comes
separate<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> very<00:01:41.850> nice<00:01:42.030> kick<00:01:42.329> if

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
separate so this is a very nice kick if

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.580 
separate so this is a very nice kick if
you're<00:01:42.570> looking<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.229> some<00:01:43.439> more

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
you're looking to get some more

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.340 
you're looking to get some more
experience<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.700> RC<00:01:45.360> boats<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
experience on RC boats because the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.499 
experience on RC boats because the
actual<00:01:46.710> boat<00:01:46.920> itself<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.670> already<00:01:47.970> built<00:01:48.240> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
actual boat itself is already built so

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.539 
actual boat itself is already built so
it's<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.780> hugely<00:01:49.079> complicated<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:50.399> there's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it's not hugely complicated but there's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.160 
it's not hugely complicated but there's
just<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.790> few<00:01:50.939> simple<00:01:51.270> things<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.750> needs<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.020> do

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
just a few simple things it needs to do

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.780 
just a few simple things it needs to do
for<00:01:52.380> example<00:01:52.439> winding<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.369> speed

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
for example winding of the speed

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.300 
for example winding of the speed
controller<00:01:54.290> installing<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:55.409> your<00:01:55.560> servo<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
controller installing up your servo and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.160 
controller installing up your servo and
programming<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.240> speed<00:01:57.479> controller<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
programming the speed controller and the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.020 
programming the speed controller and the
radio<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:58.950> nice<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> get<00:02:00.000> a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
radio so it's nice if you want to get a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.580 
radio so it's nice if you want to get a
little<00:02:00.299> bit<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.479> experience<00:02:00.960> and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
little bit of experience and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.740 
little bit of experience and
same<00:02:01.859> time<00:02:02.570> less<00:02:03.570> coming<00:02:03.840> out<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.229> these<00:02:04.590> nice

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
same time less coming out is these nice

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.100 
same time less coming out is these nice
