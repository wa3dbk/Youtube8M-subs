 products received in for 2014 offense 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.029
 I tried the sound of seven not 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.529
 come back to the nature composites is what we 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.060
 will have all registered ski but that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.939
 you tell me in which range name 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.400
 complete north comes with kinski 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:30.989
 perfect then this is our new series 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.369
 Freeride ski that replaces a little 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.140
 Below keep squat services 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.980
 that we had for several years in 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.140
 this new series 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.320
 do they know yes what's called 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.059
 new camber 4 go which convinces 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.640
 produced in this family there then the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.050
 squad seven which is a 120 mm below 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.250
 in the morning for the big elbow powder 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 while in the gestures he says 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.420
 that he was not going to stop in the east of the country 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.850
 it's going to be a little less than a maniac 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.350
 who will want to buy that especially the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.829
 Greek people maybe see a trip 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.629
 the super 7 that I have in my hands 1,616 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.730
 minima and whole of the same skate 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.420
 just money building that's going 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.100
 come change 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.260
 I think it's going to be tired for 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.780
 Eastern Canada 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.780
 I said that I did that provides 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.390
 super light probably be a drama 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.490
 a ski like 12 pairs of skis for 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.040
 a few already registered carving ski de 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.410
 track but by cons without flavor does not 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.910
 can really become at 106 1000 meters 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.800
 below the skate can really 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.570
 become an everyday ski for 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.890
 many a lot of young people these 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.660
 unpopular decisions I feel 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.650
 really fun you can really 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.600
 pushes on year consoles 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.190
 that is impressive but 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.420
 when they took as to be able to 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.250
 really fit or not to the background 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.810
 running mornant I thought that said 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.030
 of clients who have not yet learned 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.860
 to stick of calais madam about done 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.510
 a good campaign but there is a lot 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.170
 people who have learned to ski do not care 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.790
 of a whole people 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.790

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.460
 what is really you you are and what 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.550
 is a little earlier for really due 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.180
 convince them that they do when they all 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.920
 the days to make unique say 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.520
 what they replace what the series 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.280
 attraction one epu and that's it now and 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.450
 butt with a friend was running me the laminate 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.430
