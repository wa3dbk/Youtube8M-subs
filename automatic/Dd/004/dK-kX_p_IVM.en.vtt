menu and so the advantage of that is
that<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.759> works<00:00:33.030> well<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.510> small<00:00:33.870> display<00:00:34.440> like

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680

that it works well on small display like
slates<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.250> also<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.850> large<00:00:36.149> displays<00:00:36.660> so

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
slates and also on large displays so

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
slates and also on large displays so
basically<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.770> large<00:00:38.010> displays<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.820> just

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
basically on large displays you can just

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.090 
basically on large displays you can just
make<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.570> when<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> appear<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.920> don't

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
small pinch and just expand that and I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.020 
small pinch and just expand that and I
get<00:01:42.360> more<00:01:42.630> menus<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.520> change<00:01:44.790> the

get more menus and now I can change the
default<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.630> by<00:01:45.900> just<00:01:46.170> raising<00:01:46.380> my<00:01:46.770> index

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
default one by just raising my index

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.210 
default one by just raising my index
while<00:01:47.640> leaving<00:01:47.970> my<00:01:48.240> thumb<00:01:48.780> down<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:49.830> put

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
while leaving my thumb down and then put

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.609 
while leaving my thumb down and then put
my<00:01:50.250> index<00:01:50.759> down<00:01:51.240> again<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.590> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
my index down again and now I get to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.669 
my index down again and now I get to
another<00:01:53.009> default<00:01:53.550> menu<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.810> now<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.259> one<00:01:55.530> is

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
another default menu so now this one is

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.760 
another default menu so now this one is
the<00:01:55.800> default<00:01:56.160> menu

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.280 

so<00:01:59.520> here<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.150> second<00:02:00.450> menu<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.780> actually<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
so here the second menu is actually a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.319 
so here the second menu is actually a
tool-less<00:02:01.619> menu<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> click

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
tool-less menu so it's like a click

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.539 
tool-less menu so it's like a click
through<00:02:03.509> tool<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.590> basically<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.399> I

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
through tool so I can basically if I

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.160 
through tool so I can basically if I
want<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.850> draw<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> line<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.840> go<00:02:06.990> with

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
want to draw a line I can just go with

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.710 
want to draw a line I can just go with
my<00:02:07.320> pen<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:07.890> start<00:02:08.310> my<00:02:08.459> line<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.209> know<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
my pen here start my line here I know I

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.140 
my pen here start my line here I know I
can<00:02:09.989> position<00:02:10.349> my<00:02:10.830> line<00:02:11.039> with<00:02:11.459> two<00:02:11.670> hands<00:02:12.000> on

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
can position my line with two hands on

can position my line with two hands on
the<00:02:12.660> finger<00:02:12.989> side<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.800> an<00:02:13.920> offset<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.819> my

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the finger side I have an offset so my

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.670 
the finger side I have an offset so my
finger<00:02:15.420> doesn't<00:02:15.630> hide<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.080> beginning<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
finger doesn't hide the beginning of the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.890 
finger doesn't hide the beginning of the
line<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.700> other<00:02:17.730> side<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.690> pen

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
line and the other side is just a pen

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.960 
line and the other side is just a pen
that<00:02:19.110> shows<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.860> positioning<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.819> line

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
that shows the positioning of the line

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.509 
that shows the positioning of the line
and<00:02:21.660> then<00:02:21.989> when<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.230> release<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:23.069> menu<00:02:23.340> will

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
and then when I release the menu will

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.720 
and then when I release the menu will
come<00:02:23.550> back<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:25.349> now<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.590> can<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.220> same

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
come back and now I can do the same

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.490 
come back and now I can do the same
same<00:02:27.120> thing<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:27.390> thought<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.050> want<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.349> do<00:02:28.470> a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
same thing for thought if I want to do a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.680 
same thing for thought if I want to do a
square<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.700> start<00:02:29.970> by<00:02:30.120> clicking<00:02:30.300> through

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
square I can start by clicking through

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.229 
square I can start by clicking through
the<00:02:30.870> square<00:02:31.170> icon<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.519> now<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.790> can<00:02:33.000> position

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
the square icon and now I can position

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.250 
the square icon and now I can position
and<00:02:33.750> size<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.290> square<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.830> same<00:02:35.100> time

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
and size the square at the same time

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.699 
and size the square at the same time
same<00:02:37.260> idea<00:02:37.560> for<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.890> circle<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:39.260> can<00:02:40.260> position

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
same idea for a circle I can position

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.670 
same idea for a circle I can position
and<00:02:41.250> size<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.730> circle<00:02:42.120> with<00:02:42.510> two<00:02:42.540> hands<00:02:43.110> which

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and size the circle with two hands which

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.470 
and size the circle with two hands which
allows<00:02:43.950> me<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.310> position<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.910> very<00:02:45.209> precisely

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.610 

basically<00:02:52.480> what<00:02:52.750> we<00:02:52.900> have<00:02:52.989> is<00:02:53.019> if<00:02:53.319> you<00:02:53.440> do<00:02:53.590> a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
basically what we have is if you do a

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.850 
basically what we have is if you do a
large<00:02:53.860> pinch<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.610> will<00:02:54.849> zoom<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.560> if<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.709> do<00:02:56.830> a

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
large pinch it will zoom and if you do a

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.210 
large pinch it will zoom and if you do a
small<00:02:57.160> pinch<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.700> will<00:02:57.879> open<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.330> menu<00:02:59.220> yeah

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
small pinch it will open the menu yeah

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.890 
small pinch it will open the menu yeah
we<00:03:00.370> are<00:03:00.489> also<00:03:00.640> interested<00:03:01.300> about<00:03:01.540> different

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
we are also interested about different

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.960 
we are also interested about different
form<00:03:02.170> factor<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.739> exploring<00:03:03.160> different<00:03:03.610> kind

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
form factor and exploring different kind

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.460 
form factor and exploring different kind
of<00:03:04.150> in<00:03:04.420> place<00:03:04.660> command<00:03:05.019> menu

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.920 

another<00:03:11.400> interesting<00:03:11.790> expression<00:03:12.630> we<00:03:12.810> have

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
another interesting expression we have

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.080 
another interesting expression we have
done<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.830> use<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.160> shadow<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.730> finger

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
done is to use the shadow of the finger

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.600 
done is to use the shadow of the finger
as<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.300> clipboard<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:16.530> for<00:03:16.890> instance<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.220> can<00:03:17.340> put

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
as a clipboard so for instance I can put

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.310 
as a clipboard so for instance I can put
my<00:03:17.790> finger<00:03:18.150> down<00:03:18.360> here<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.050> shadow

I can place object inside the shadow and

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.980 
I can place object inside the shadow and
now<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.100> can<00:03:26.520> remove<00:03:26.940> my<00:03:27.000> finger<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.780> shadow
