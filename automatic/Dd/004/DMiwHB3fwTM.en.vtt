spike that is wanting to grow along too
with<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:04.580> new<00:01:05.580> route<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.170> don't<00:01:07.170> know<00:01:07.229> it's

a<00:01:13.939> blooming<00:01:14.939> spike<00:01:15.530> anyway<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:20.210> he

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
a blooming spike anyway this one is he

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.420 
a blooming spike anyway this one is he
been<00:01:21.720> drugging<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.650> drugged<00:01:22.979> him

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
been drugging and drugged him

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.330 
been drugging and drugged him
Karen<00:01:23.909> think

it's growing a Kiki I thought it was
going<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> blooming<00:01:46.110> spike<00:01:47.390> but<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.539> a

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
going to be a blooming spike but it's a

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.899 
going to be a blooming spike but it's a
new<00:01:48.840> plant

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
new plant

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.160 
new plant
Phalaenopsis<00:01:51.860> plants<00:01:52.860> grow<00:01:53.220> Kiki's<00:01:54.020> next<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
Phalaenopsis plants grow Kiki's next to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.830 
Phalaenopsis plants grow Kiki's next to
the<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.960> base<00:01:57.960> when<00:01:58.799> they<00:01:58.979> are<00:01:59.130> stressed

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
the the base when they are stressed

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.469 
the the base when they are stressed
under<00:02:00.840> stress<00:02:01.709> because<00:02:02.190> well<00:02:02.880> since<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> had

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
under stress because well since it had

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.169 
under stress because well since it had
no<00:02:03.840> root<00:02:05.929> this<00:02:06.929> is<00:02:06.990> what<00:02:07.259> they<00:02:07.380> do<00:02:07.439> they<00:02:08.179> grow

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
no root this is what they do they grow

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.039 
no root this is what they do they grow
new<00:02:09.840> plants<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.500> base<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.750> doing

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
new plants on the base so it's doing

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.570 
new plants on the base so it's doing
very<00:02:13.080> good<00:02:14.299> as<00:02:15.299> soon<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.810> gets<00:02:15.989> bigger

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
very good as soon as it gets bigger

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.780 
very good as soon as it gets bigger
roots<00:02:17.580> I'm<00:02:17.790> going<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.180> transplant<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.340> or<00:02:20.340> put
