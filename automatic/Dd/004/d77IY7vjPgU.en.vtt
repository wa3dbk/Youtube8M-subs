00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.120 
Suzuki GS 750 and as you can see it's
not<00:01:21.360> much<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.720> original<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.290> here<00:01:22.320> anymore

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
not much of the original is here anymore

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:38.300 
not much of the original is here anymore
but<00:01:23.909> I've<00:01:24.390> got<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> 14<00:01:35.360> 2005<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:37.409> exhaust<00:01:38.040> is

but I've got a 14 2005 the exhaust is

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.520 
but I've got a 14 2005 the exhaust is
run<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.960> inch<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> half<00:01:40.820> EMT<00:01:42.530> conduit

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.749 
run out of inch and a half EMT conduit
and<00:01:43.740> I'm<00:01:43.799> eventually<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> come<00:01:44.460> back

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and I'm eventually going to come back

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.490 
and I'm eventually going to come back
and<00:01:45.030> wrap<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.899> exhaust<00:01:46.229> header

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and wrap that with the exhaust header

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.670 
and wrap that with the exhaust header
wrap<00:01:49.310> one<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.720> only<00:01:51.720> downsides<00:01:52.170> I'd<00:01:52.380> see

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
wrap one of the only downsides I'd see

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.999 
wrap one of the only downsides I'd see
to<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.220> far<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.930> see<00:01:55.110> my<00:01:55.229> CVT<00:01:55.799> is

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
to this so far is you can see my CVT is

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.010 
to this so far is you can see my CVT is
spaced<00:01:56.369> out<00:01:56.579> kind<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.180> little<00:01:57.390> far<00:01:57.689> from<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
spaced out kind of a little far from the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.139 
spaced out kind of a little far from the
motor<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.829> up<00:01:59.040> flush<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.729> wanted<00:02:00.000> it

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
motor it's not up flush like I wanted it

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.969 
motor it's not up flush like I wanted it
to<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:01.079> that's<00:02:01.259> mostly<00:02:01.619> because<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
to be but that's mostly because I

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.190 
to be but that's mostly because I
couldn't<00:02:02.340> fit<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.700> all<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> frame<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
couldn't fit it all in the frame for the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.039 
couldn't fit it all in the frame for the
driven<00:02:04.950> pulley<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:06.000> would<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.659> clearance

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
driven pulley it would have clearance

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.660 
driven pulley it would have clearance
issues<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> had<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.890> bring<00:02:08.069> everything<00:02:08.399> out

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
issues so I had to bring everything out

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.059 
issues so I had to bring everything out
as<00:02:08.849> far<00:02:09.090> as<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.300> could<00:02:09.539> while<00:02:10.379> still<00:02:10.709> trying<00:02:11.009> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
as far as I could while still trying to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.280 
as far as I could while still trying to
keep<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> motor<00:02:12.000> towards<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> center<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
keep the motor towards the center of the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.900 
keep the motor towards the center of the
frame

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
frame

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.130 
frame
but<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.860> my<00:02:17.040> first<00:02:17.970> update<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:18.900> bike

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
but this is my first update on this bike

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.050 
but this is my first update on this bike
and<00:02:19.170> hopefully<00:02:19.739> I'll<00:02:20.099> be<00:02:20.280> giving<00:02:20.849> more<00:02:21.000> of

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
and hopefully I'll be giving more of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.769 
and hopefully I'll be giving more of
them<00:02:21.269> soon<00:02:21.650> thank<00:02:22.650> you
