00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.069 
there are just so much detail in this
set<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.430> really<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.510> fact<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.840> it's

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
set I really like the fact that it's

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.490 
set I really like the fact that it's
just<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.329> does<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.230> Thai

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
just it it really does have that Thai

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.709 
just it it really does have that Thai
fire<00:00:55.800> kind<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.219> look<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.610> feel<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.239> think

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
fire kind of look and feel to it I think

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.299 
fire kind of look and feel to it I think
it's<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.109> best<00:00:58.320> UCS<00:00:58.829> models<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it's one of the best UCS models like a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.920 
it's one of the best UCS models like a
set<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.609> Star<00:00:59.850> Wars<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.300> come<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.750> one

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
set of Star Wars that come out with one

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.369 
set of Star Wars that come out with one
oh<00:01:00.960> wow

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.690 
the stand as you can see there is no
bottom<00:01:09.960> part<00:01:10.380> connected<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:11.100> right<00:01:11.310> now<00:01:11.490> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
bottom part connected here right now I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.190 
bottom part connected here right now I
took<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.180> off<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> stand<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.720> show<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> that

took it off the stand to show you that

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560 
took it off the stand to show you that
it<00:01:13.320> does<00:01:13.470> stand<00:01:13.770> pretty<00:01:14.220> well<00:01:14.430> by<00:01:14.670> itself<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it does stand pretty well by itself and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.719 
it does stand pretty well by itself and
I'll<00:01:16.140> show<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.350> some<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> more<00:01:17.189> finer

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
I'll show you some of the more finer

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.280 
I'll show you some of the more finer
details<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.570> printed<00:01:18.990> piece<00:01:19.140> right

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
details like this printed piece right

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.749 
details like this printed piece right
here<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.590> how<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.770> details<00:01:20.250> around<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
here and how the details around the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.429 
here and how the details around the
wings<00:01:20.970> are<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.509> think<00:01:21.900> they<00:01:22.170> did<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> really

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
wings are I think they did a really

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.100 
wings are I think they did a really
really<00:01:23.159> awesome<00:01:23.189> job<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.180> set<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:25.020> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
really awesome job with this set like I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.660 
really awesome job with this set like I
said<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.290> can't<00:01:25.560> emphasize<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.250> enough

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
said I can't emphasize that enough

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.929 
said I can't emphasize that enough
it<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.110> figure<00:01:28.770> size<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.579> doesn't

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
it really is figure size but it doesn't

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.240 
it really is figure size but it doesn't
really<00:01:30.060> fit<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.390> figure<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.290> per<00:01:31.560> se<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:32.159> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
really fit the figure like per se in a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
really fit the figure like per se in a
stationary<00:01:32.909> position<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> think<00:01:34.170> that's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
stationary position so I think that's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.240 
stationary position so I think that's
kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.860> bummer

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
kind of a bummer

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
kind of a bummer
I<00:01:35.400> wish<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.820> set<00:01:36.000> would<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.299> actually<00:01:36.659> made

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
I wish the set would have actually made

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.219 
I wish the set would have actually made
it<00:01:37.380> more<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.189> guess<00:01:39.090> figure<00:01:39.479> friendly<00:01:39.960> for

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it more I guess figure friendly for

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.230 
it more I guess figure friendly for
minifigures<00:01:40.490> but<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> mean<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:41.790> overall<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
minifigures but I mean like overall I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
minifigures but I mean like overall I
can't<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:42.810> complain<00:01:43.049> cuz<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.439> could<00:01:43.680> put

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
can't really complain cuz you could put

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.740 
can't really complain cuz you could put

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
but mostly what's unique about this

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.890 
but mostly what's unique about this
entire<00:02:46.250> ship<00:02:46.489> is<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.819> fact<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.120> whenever

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
entire ship is the fact that whenever

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.140 
entire ship is the fact that whenever
you<00:02:48.110> zoom<00:02:48.349> in<00:02:48.500> out<00:02:48.620> like<00:02:48.829> this<00:02:49.130> I'll<00:02:49.760> show<00:02:50.090> you

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
you zoom in out like this I'll show you

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.680 
you zoom in out like this I'll show you
it<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.930> very<00:02:51.319> very<00:02:51.650> strong<00:02:51.829> model<00:02:52.760> if<00:02:53.540> you

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
it is a very very strong model if you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.009 
it is a very very strong model if you
can<00:02:53.900> kind<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.170> see<00:02:54.380> how<00:02:55.180> he'll<00:02:56.180> detail<00:02:56.660> them

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
can kind of see how he'll detail them

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.660 
can kind of see how he'll detail them
strongly<00:02:57.440> this<00:02:57.709> thing<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:58.040> like<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.310> said<00:02:58.459> I<00:02:58.519> can

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
strongly this thing is like I said I can

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.190 
strongly this thing is like I said I can
move<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:58.940> all<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.329> way<00:02:59.450> up<00:02:59.599> on<00:02:59.750> its<00:02:59.930> side<00:03:00.170> and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
move that all the way up on its side and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800 
move that all the way up on its side and
there<00:03:00.890> is<00:03:01.010> no<00:03:01.250> breaking<00:03:01.849> apart<00:03:01.940> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
there is no breaking apart the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.660 
there is no breaking apart the
connections<00:03:03.349> between<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.829> wings<00:03:04.040> are<00:03:04.280> very

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670
