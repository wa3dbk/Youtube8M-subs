system so it really does work and it is

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.170 
system so it really does work and it is
future<00:03:37.319> proof<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.949> it's<00:03:38.099> also<00:03:38.220> flash<00:03:38.639> enables

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
future proof and it's also flash enables

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.969 
future proof and it's also flash enables
you<00:03:39.540> often<00:03:39.780> hear<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.169> iPad<00:03:40.470> hasn't<00:03:40.859> got

flash enough factors now this is the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.849 
flash enough factors now this is the
latest<00:03:45.049> camcorder<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.349> we've<00:03:46.500> seen<00:03:46.709> out<00:03:46.829> a

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
about the projector be 50 this is about

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.720 
about the projector be 50 this is about
the<00:04:31.150> smallest<00:04:31.890> projector<00:04:32.890> smallest<00:04:33.550> and

the smallest projector smallest and

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.790 
the smallest projector smallest and
brightest<00:04:34.210> projector<00:04:34.750> for<00:04:34.930> its<00:04:35.050> size<00:04:35.290> in<00:04:35.590> the
