00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.559
 Hi, how are you? I'm the horse. I like it. 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.610
 of various types of art such as the grasshopper 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.830
 What do I do with palm leaf and 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.400
 Likes also sculpture and fruit taste 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.119
 of other types of art as you imagine 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.310
 and I 'm going to teach you is to do one or 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.289
 another athlete who looks is a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:40.559
 Palm tree 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:42.020
 There you cut and strip the stem. 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.440
 the son 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:55.260
 There you divide it in the middle. 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:01:06.750
 exactly in the middle and more in the middle of the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:14.610
 the other half is divided into 4 missing 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:17.360
 one piece ending at 4 part there you 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.360
 will do the following 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:31.950
 on the wrong side of one side you part 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:35.549
 up study second cross fold and in 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.009
 top of the other two always popular 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.970
 the first left side and passing through 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:46.770
 the other and the same thing 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:51.210
 already the second side also the time passes by 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:58.350
 down and to the right side in order to 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:01.100
 to fit with each other, then getting 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.100
 like this 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.690
 so look what exactly there is going to be 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.740
 that making this transition is to be able to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.720
 to fit in 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:25.670
 He comes out from under here and goes over 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:25.670
 another cross will do is talk braid 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:38.300
 pull a dog that I met here you 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.300
 She's going to braid but she's known. 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:48.030
 put the 4 starts with the first 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:57.140

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.140

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.830
 in the bedroom 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:32.879
 there it will stay that way around these 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:36.549
 two passes inside 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.879
 these two inside here these two 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:43.329

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:45.219
 and these two being up to four 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.310
 back four forward 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:52.480
 in this position there is and will have to 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:04:04.510
 pull two by 25 x 14 can not go 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:18.430
 pulling 22 until the braided 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:25.650
 Perfect at one end you give a tight knot 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:28.960

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.659

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:37.080
 It does not get too big and it's already giving 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:44.280
 format looks there will only be one detail missing 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.280
 little detail you're cutting 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.750
 forming 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.930
 on the other side 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:19.820
 It was cool, you can not see. 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.820
