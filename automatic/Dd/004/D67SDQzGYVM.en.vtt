00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hello everyone, this UHC is a Cutclean Rush FFA hosted by Lenasticots 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.560
 That is to say that the walls begin to move after 30 minutes 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.800
 and the meat and minerals are directly cooked 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.600
 I hope you will like it: D 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.720
 I found a villa but there were no bookstores or carrots. 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.460
 Anyway, carrots are useless because the nether is disabled 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.060
 And then, you can not do invisibility 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.680
 I found a cave, and I started to collect enough iron 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.180
 Stellios (a French friend) came to the ts, that's why they are going to listen 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.960
 Baguette croissant baguette? Pain au chocolat Badlion 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.180
 Seriously it does not matter what we say right now xD 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.980
 He's talking about another game but we do not care! D: 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.600
 Fuck, I'm down a skew spawner and they fall on my face 

00:00:58.196 --> 00:01:00.856
 I destroyed the spawner of skeletons but there was nothing interesting in the trunk 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.500
 I always listened to many skeletons below the spawner 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.840
 And then I'm going to kill them to have many arrows! 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.300
 But there were more mobs than I thought! 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.120
 I only have 3 hearts left and a half, GG Shadoune 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.480
 I keep exploring the cave trying to find gold 

00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:33.806
 But I can not find ... What do I see ?! 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.400
 Diamonds! 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.720
 omg how many? 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.720
 One only obviously xD 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.280
 I keep mining, and 2 French friends: Wolf and Lenasticots go to the ts with me 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.040
 Hi or/ 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.520
 Wolf: "You are in a good position Shadoune hahaha" 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.140
 Yes hahaha 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.940
 I do not know if you have seen but before, I had 15 arrows in my body x) 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.320
 I kept mining and I found a lot of gold 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.940
 Gold, yes! 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.180
 The proxmos degundos show Shadoune doing a totally bestial 1vs5 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.480
 The viewer should be ready for a wendingo level epicity 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.340
 I went up to the surface because it was time to go to the meetup 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.860
 And the wall was very close 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.960
 Hello Mr. Borderrrr 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.445
 I'm coming 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.040
 LÃ©na: "Hahaha, if it's going to you" 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.440
 Olala that OP I am (the truth is that the wall does not kill, only you teleport) 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.220
 It's fast on the edge! 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.600
 I had a bow, 20 arrows, only 3 hearts but 2 apples of gold and enough gold for another 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.600
 omg 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.840
 There's a guy who stepped next to me with a horse 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.620
 And an enchanted sword! 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.580
 How is life? 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.760
 It's ... 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.880
 1 heart! 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.260
 Wolf: "It's pretty fast" 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.720
 It's going too fast !! 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.500
 I lost the horse but and reaching 0.0 I find other players 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.000
 Osifou is 8 hearts with enchantments and diamond breastplate 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.060
 omg! 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.680
 I was only 1 heart with less stuff, an arrow and I die 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.560
 I needed to find something to defend myself! 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.480
 I found this sheep! 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.680
 AND IT IS!! 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.420
 Omg! 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.600
 I killed him bestially! 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.486
 But I shit in the milk with 1 heart ... 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.600
 I made a head of gold but nothing else because there is not enough gold 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.040
 There is a Sharpness 3 diamond, and enchantments 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.820
 Lol, this guy died for Backstab! 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.400
 In his things, I found a diamond breastplate and I had 6 diamonds 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.140
 Wolf: "Only Paul and Shadoune remain" 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.660
 We are only 2 ?? Nice! 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.740
 Always without gold to regenerate ... But I can make myself a diamond helmet and love it 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.600
 But in truth, we are not 2 but 3! 

00:04:44.612 --> 00:04:46.612
 In effect, a player reconnects 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.020
 Wolf: "Ah ok there's Tchobax too" 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.220
 I was going to say "Fortunately he only has 1 heart" 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.860
 But he took a head of gold, and now he is at 5 hearts +2 hearts of absorption! 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.880
 And now, ready to fight! 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.800
 Is there 4 regeneration with gold heads? 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.860
 Wolf: "Sip" 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.320
 He did not know .-. (I thought it was regeneration 2 for 2 times longer than a golden apple) 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.460
 Oh is the other here 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.360
 I'm going to kill him! 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.080
 Fuck! 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.980
 Maybe it's me that will die ... 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.820
 I had gold! Maybe enough to regenerate 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.020
 But it's already late, the other is behind me! 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.580
 Rip Shadoune rip! 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.060
 My bow broke ... 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.340
 Wolf: "We agree that you broke your bow ..." 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.480
 The truth is that I caught this power 2 with very little durability on the floor 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.680
 DO NOT!! 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.040
 Wolf: "Half heart!" 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.940
 Beware, great rage of Shadoune in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.280
 JODERR !! 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.220
 So close to victory! 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.600
 Jumping and putting myself in danger, shooting this last arrow 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.200
 I thought to kill him but sadly, I was left with half a heart ... 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.100
 And I have not had the reflections for the waterdrop 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.400
