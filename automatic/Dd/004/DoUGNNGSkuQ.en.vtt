00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
fell how did that really play into the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
fell how did that really play into the
laning<00:00:46.920> phase<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> game<00:00:47.250> lame<00:00:47.520> uh<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.600> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
laning phase of the game lame uh so it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.029 
laning phase of the game lame uh so it
was<00:00:49.050> kind<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.200> weird<00:00:49.320> because<00:00:49.469> I'll<00:00:49.739> take<00:00:49.890> was

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
was kind of weird because I'll take was

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.010 
was kind of weird because I'll take was
basically<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.879> via<00:00:51.090> wanting<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.449> listen<00:00:51.809> for

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
basically one via wanting to listen for

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.779 
basically one via wanting to listen for
pretty<00:00:52.379> much<00:00:52.469> an<00:00:52.680> entire<00:00:52.920> game<00:00:53.160> yeah<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.670> it

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
pretty much an entire game yeah and it

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.930 
pretty much an entire game yeah and it
was<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> rise<00:00:54.420> thrash<00:00:54.930> versus<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
was like a rise thrash versus like a

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.119 
was like a rise thrash versus like a
like<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> eg<00:00:57.780> swallowing<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.039> this

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
like the eg swallowing so it's like this

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.189 
like the eg swallowing so it's like this
weird<00:00:59.190> mixture<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.850> events<00:01:00.180> where<00:01:00.359> all<00:01:00.930> takes

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
weird mixture of events where all takes

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.540 
weird mixture of events where all takes
pretty<00:01:01.410> much<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> top<00:01:01.949> laner<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.340> and

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
recklessly and rise just as basically

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.630 
recklessly and rise just as basically
going<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.260> free<00:02:46.440> double<00:02:46.709> kill<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.370> at<00:02:47.489> this

point this kind of seals the game

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.000 
point this kind of seals the game
because<00:02:50.580> rise<00:02:51.150> if<00:02:51.660> he's<00:02:52.230> able<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.530> ever<00:02:52.769> get

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
because rise if he's able to ever get

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.530 
because rise if he's able to ever get
farm<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.519> early<00:02:53.700> am<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:53.910> pick<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.239> kills<00:02:54.420> like

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
farm the early am I pick up kills like

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.780 
farm the early am I pick up kills like
that<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:55.260> it's<00:02:55.709> incredibly<00:02:56.280> hard<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.670> come

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
that it's it's incredibly hard to come

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.069 
that it's it's incredibly hard to come
back<00:02:56.910> especially<00:02:57.209> when<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.690> have<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.840> stroke

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
back especially when you have a stroke

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.920 
back especially when you have a stroke
on<00:02:58.230> your<00:02:58.440> team<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.430> Evelyn's

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
on your team and you have Evelyn's

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.330 
on your team and you have Evelyn's
invisible<00:03:00.930> pressure<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:02.040> just<00:03:02.069> allows

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
invisible pressure so it just allows

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.280 
invisible pressure so it just allows
rise<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.880> just<00:03:03.060> ramped<00:03:03.239> up<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.599> farm<00:03:03.840> really

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
rise to just ramped up and farm really

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.410 
rise to just ramped up and farm really
really<00:03:04.530> hard<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.730> can<00:03:05.849> see<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.000> he<00:03:06.269> had

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
really hard and you can see that he had

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.930

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
uh so Snoopy jumps in here and they

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.960 
uh so Snoopy jumps in here and they
looked<00:03:36.959> Achilles<00:03:37.260> Yuki<00:03:37.500> because<00:03:38.040> he's<00:03:38.790> the

they're just gonna be more and more
aggressive<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.550> they're<00:04:42.000> going<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.150> play

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
aggressive and they're going to play

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.390 
aggressive and they're going to play
much<00:04:42.690> much<00:04:42.960> better<00:04:43.140> I'm<00:04:43.770> going<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.130> be<00:04:44.190> more

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
much much better I'm going to be more

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.550 
much much better I'm going to be more
confident<00:04:44.760> in<00:04:44.880> their<00:04:44.970> place<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.390> it<00:04:46.230> just<00:04:46.410> it

confident in their place and it just it

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.720 
confident in their place and it just it
just<00:04:46.590> seems<00:04:46.860> like<00:04:46.950> just<00:04:47.220> watching<00:04:47.370> that<00:04:47.520> game

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
just seems like just watching that game

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.520 
just seems like just watching that game
like<00:04:48.030> Game<00:04:48.210> one<00:04:48.360> was<00:04:48.480> just<00:04:48.660> a<00:04:48.720> warm-up<00:04:48.960> game<00:04:49.320> to

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
like Game one was just a warm-up game to

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.560 
like Game one was just a warm-up game to
their<00:04:49.770> they're<00:04:50.460> getting<00:04:50.670> to<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.850> groove<00:04:51.060> and

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
their they're getting to the groove and

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.910 
their they're getting to the groove and
maybe<00:04:51.780> game<00:04:51.990> three<00:04:52.260> if<00:04:52.380> they<00:04:52.530> could<00:04:52.680> get<00:04:52.770> their

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
maybe game three if they could get their

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.740 
maybe game three if they could get their
pics<00:04:53.160> again<00:04:53.280> then<00:04:53.700> dug<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.210> they'll<00:04:54.450> be<00:04:54.540> really

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
pics again then dug it they'll be really

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.080 
pics again then dug it they'll be really
strong<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.200> I<00:04:55.230> know<00:04:55.950> EG<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:56.580> kind<00:04:56.790> of<00:04:56.880> a<00:04:56.940> team

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
strong and I know EG is kind of a team

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.550 
strong and I know EG is kind of a team
that<00:04:57.120> kind<00:04:57.450> of<00:04:57.480> likes<00:04:57.660> to<00:04:57.810> tilt<00:04:58.050> time<00:04:58.320> to<00:04:58.410> time

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
that kind of likes to tilt time to time

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.490 
that kind of likes to tilt time to time
so<00:04:59.100> it's<00:04:59.910> really<00:05:00.240> important<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:00.780> they<00:05:01.170> don't

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
so it's really important that they don't

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.890 
so it's really important that they don't
lose<00:05:01.740> remember<00:05:02.160> momentum<00:05:02.790> from<00:05:02.940> game<00:05:03.120> one<00:05:03.330> and

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
lose remember momentum from game one and

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.600 
lose remember momentum from game one and
they<00:05:04.020> just<00:05:04.050> kind<00:05:04.290> of<00:05:04.380> think<00:05:04.560> about<00:05:04.620> their<00:05:05.010> pics

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
they just kind of think about their pics

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.910 
they just kind of think about their pics
yeah<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:06.330> was<00:05:06.450> a<00:05:06.480> 36<00:05:07.080> minute<00:05:07.320> victory<00:05:07.530> for<00:05:07.680> eg

for<00:06:22.940> because<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:24.000> still<00:06:24.450> strongly<00:06:24.720> believe

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020

that<00:06:25.050> a<00:06:25.500> climbing<00:06:26.190> tempest<00:06:26.430> has<00:06:26.460> stronger

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
that a climbing tempest has stronger

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.810 
that a climbing tempest has stronger
individual<00:06:27.690> leaders<00:06:27.930> so<00:06:28.500> if<00:06:29.370> they<00:06:29.580> can<00:06:29.730> do

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
individual leaders so if they can do

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.240 
individual leaders so if they can do
that<00:06:29.850> then<00:06:30.510> I<00:06:30.900> think<00:06:30.960> doan<00:06:31.410> after<00:06:32.100> me<00:06:32.220> you
