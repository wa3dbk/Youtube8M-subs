00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.539 
that was my first occasions riding on
the<00:02:05.610> footplate<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.329> engine

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
the footplate of the engine

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.790 
the footplate of the engine
and<00:02:08.000> that's<00:02:08.360> one<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.899> reasons<00:02:09.259> why<00:02:09.500> I

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
and that's one of the reasons why I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.160 
and that's one of the reasons why I
decided<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.940> if<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.330> could<00:02:11.510> find<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.930> and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
decided that if I could find it and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.440 
decided that if I could find it and
recover<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:13.489> would<00:02:13.670> be<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.790> nice<00:02:14.000> thing<00:02:14.030> to

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
recover it it would be a nice thing to

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.059 
recover it it would be a nice thing to
have<00:02:14.599> because<00:02:15.080> now<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.440> factory's<00:02:15.860> gone

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
have because now the factory's gone

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.100 
have because now the factory's gone
we've<00:02:16.580> got<00:02:16.790> something<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.510> old<00:02:17.540> factory

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
we've got something of the old factory

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.510 
we've got something of the old factory
left<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.310> remember<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.150> all<00:02:20.300> by
