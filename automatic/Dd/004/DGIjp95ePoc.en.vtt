00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.580
 video on a channel 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.059
 Today is my ps theory again 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.800
 namely two russ it draws much eye 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.550
 speculate what's on it 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.500
 could 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.960
 and today I will give you three 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.789
 different opinions show the the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.830
 most people have and one of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.890
 I also represent we are just starting now 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.260
 sometimes boring and with that I would 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.029
 say and exciting 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.490
 many say simply the source 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.309
 eye is broken and they justify that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.530
 So that he will be watching his eye 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.600
 lost with the monkeys or what 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.559
 some also tell me one wanted him 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.120
 to teach SB. A lesson 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.430
 and that's why he took his eye 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.410
 because she was either too weak he was 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.719
 not enough has strained because it is one 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.730
 round is too small and then could 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.430
 it also be that it is not difficult 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.680
 from new york a little bit that that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.850
 the harm has issued that was it 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.320
 actually came with the first theory 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.070
 not much to say but it 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.410
 just broken 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.309
 and then we have now come to the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 second theory 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.719
 The second theory says that it is one 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.119
 Eye closed keeps his senses closed 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.549
 strengthen and maybe be 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.290
 premonition saki if an eye 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.939
 Closed , he can focus more 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.400
 concentrate and can do other things 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.340
 maybe better practice and eventually 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.950
 if he has reached the stadium yes 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.710
 something better and it could be yes 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.450
 that the falcon eye is a very very very 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.000
 advanced level of premonition 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.130
 starkey is a very big one for me 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.619
 explained in advance and only because of this 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.170
 owns celebrated eyes and maybe 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.610
 trying euro as easy just to be 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.299
 to train to take the eye 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.979
 holds closed 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.020
 and maybe his senses strengthens or 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.909
 also in which it also closed 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.920
 parents hawk-eye trained and that has 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.600
 Of course also shown by New York 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.280
 get going but that is only 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.170
 a theory that if I'm cool 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.850
 but that we just made such a copy 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.320
 - and that's why it would be nothing 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.600
 sensational in the conventional 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.130
 theory that I find the most conclusive 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.509
 about which one has also heard the most 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.430
 and that's really cool, too 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.380
 because there is such a demon on his eye 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.270
 so he has more often for his takasu 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.829
 used and that was just this 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.719
 new heavy that many men the am 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.729
 has begun in the day 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.530
 background to the demon and us 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.210
 just has such a demonic and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.460
 dark 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.160
 Aura surrounded and maybe with help 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.830
 from new york so announced how to do it 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.440
 they take that in the sword is so 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.930
 That's the name of a search in his eye 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.700
 he just has an eye sealed 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.240
 sealed and if that can do that 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.980
 to open 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.930
 why has that sealed of course now 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.250
 the question may have already been seen that he 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.260
 asura can use 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.910
 but I think it's hers 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.500
 has brought him and 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.220
 It very very very difficult to him 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.960
 check 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.970
 but has the controlled get the 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.620
 one stops in the moon but is dried up 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.300
 if now an eye opens and the force 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.980
 a search can use that only in 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.540
 emergency situations because then too 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.340
 much stronger but of course also very much 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.040
 a lot of strength costs the demons too 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.750
 control earlier than sour sweden 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.760
 lives and bought at the sports retailer 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.650
 he already said it is very 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.640
 his kitas will be very hard 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.830
 check 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.570
 still a few things this 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.460
 affirm that one eye does not break 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.950
 and that a demon behind the demolition 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.690
 is located and a thing stop 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.310
 affirms that the dogs are more likely 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.650
 superficial is that means she is 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.780
 not only small but also the ones 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.160
 scar is on the eyelid that is that 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.580
 car it should actually damaged 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.750
 to have 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.460
 because the wound does not look too much 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.140
 In addition, we know many from deep 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.150
 other characters like where he is 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.400
 the ode gives the picture in the eye 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.650
 but have that escape in the future 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.410
 still open and I think 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.180
 So that's the case, too 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.070
 if it has always been used search 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.260
 you have also seen that his left 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.960
 riot puts closed red 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.120
 has lit and that has one too 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.320
 The demon called that to a demon 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.030
 had to look too because of the moon 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.110
 to let 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:50.150
 and maybe he just has the names 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.490
 or yourself or myself 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.440
 make it easier for him 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.570
 his eyes are closing because 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.970
 otherwise the whole car is too close 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.830
 maybe not so cool and if 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.180
 but has received it turns out 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.400
 for some reason maybe easier 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.170
 why is it so important to be demon 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.430
 The question also wants to control 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.080
 sometimes asked and I try 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.680
 Now an example cavendish to you 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.750
 explain 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.980
 you all know cavendish and you know 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.130
 but all that would not come so far 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.480
 the second form has this hakuba 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.920
 and I assume that there is one 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.239
 demon is also a sword that is 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.940
 finally be this akkupack 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.780
 saying a demon be not play 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.120
 can control 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.020
 Breaking the demo has made you spar and 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.250
 stop and devastate everything and everything 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.750
 wants to hold not what happens 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.830
 request comes out then the disengage 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.569
 that's why the ladder learned to 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.940
 so that 's it 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.380
 already with theory if he ask to the 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.460
 theme gives my fears understood 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.530
 write it in the comments 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.330
 You may also like to have a theory 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.979
 Write left eye in the comments 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.900
 I would be happy to listen to a few good ones 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.900
 and see you next time
