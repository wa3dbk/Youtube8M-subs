those now iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.279 
those now iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus and
the<00:00:17.430> question<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.210> everyone<00:00:18.480> asked<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.020> do

the question that everyone asked is do

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.560 
the question that everyone asked is do
you<00:00:19.350> need<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> case<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.070> need<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> case<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you need a case you need a case on the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.679 
you need a case you need a case on the
iPhone<00:00:21.630> 6<00:00:22.230> or<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> iPhone<00:00:22.650> 6<00:00:23.070> plus<00:00:23.130> well<00:00:23.760> let's

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
iPhone 6 or the iPhone 6 plus well let's

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.930 
iPhone 6 or the iPhone 6 plus well let's
find<00:00:24.869> out

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.610 

now<00:00:32.940> obviously<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.450> main<00:00:33.630> reason<00:00:34.050> why<00:00:34.170> anyone

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
now obviously the main reason why anyone

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
now obviously the main reason why anyone
would<00:00:34.890> want<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> case<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.610> their<00:00:35.760> phone<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.270> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
would want a case on their phone is to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.600 
would want a case on their phone is to
protect<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.410> phone<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.890> protect<00:00:38.220> their<00:00:38.340> phone

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
protect a phone to protect their phone

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.640 
protect a phone to protect their phone
from<00:00:39.000> any<00:00:39.210> drops<00:00:39.570> from<00:00:39.780> any<00:00:39.990> impact<00:00:40.470> damage

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
from any drops from any impact damage

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.530 
from any drops from any impact damage
which<00:00:41.130> is<00:00:41.160> true<00:00:41.490> which<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.820> perfectly<00:00:42.210> fine

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
which is true which is perfectly fine

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.150 
which is true which is perfectly fine
that's<00:00:42.840> basically<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.470> main<00:00:43.680> reason<00:00:44.040> why

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that's basically the main reason why

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
that's basically the main reason why
someone<00:00:44.670> would<00:00:44.910> buy<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.150> case<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
someone would buy a case now with the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.180 
someone would buy a case now with the
iPhone<00:00:46.650> 6

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
iPhone 6

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.430 
iPhone 6
especially<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> iPhone<00:00:48.570> 6<00:00:48.840> plus<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.290> have

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
especially the iPhone 6 plus you have

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.920 
especially the iPhone 6 plus you have
you<00:00:50.040> have<00:00:50.130> actually<00:00:50.489> more<00:00:50.730> reasons<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.900> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
you have actually more reasons to get a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590 
you have actually more reasons to get a
cage<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.460> long<00:00:53.460> story<00:00:53.670> short<00:00:53.970> you<00:00:54.330> do

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
cage because long story short you do

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.330 
cage because long story short you do
need<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> case<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.380> this<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.770> phone<00:00:56.040> was

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
need a case on this this phone was

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.120 
need a case on this this phone was
actually<00:00:56.730> designed<00:00:57.230> was<00:00:58.230> designed<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.950> be

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
actually designed was designed to be

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.840 
actually designed was designed to be
used<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.330> case<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.140> why<00:01:02.040> is<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.250> now

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
used with a case on so why is that now

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.340 
used with a case on so why is that now
if<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.150> take<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.330> look<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.900> back<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
if you take a look at the back of the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.750 
if you take a look at the back of the
phone<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.370> have<00:01:05.519> two

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
phone you can see that we have two

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.550 
phone you can see that we have two
really<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.720> thick<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.080> really<00:01:07.320> ugly

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
really really thick and really ugly

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.100 
really really thick and really ugly
lines<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.520> those<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.150> ugly<00:01:09.270> lines<00:01:09.750> are

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
lines now those really ugly lines are

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.810 
lines now those really ugly lines are
there<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.620> a<00:01:10.650> reason<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:11.400> actually<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
there for a reason for actually the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.810 
there for a reason for actually the
antennas<00:01:12.300> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.900> phone<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.620> Wi-Fi<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.580> pass

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
antennas of the phone now Wi-Fi can pass

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.300 
antennas of the phone now Wi-Fi can pass
through<00:01:15.060> aluminum<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.500> 3G<00:01:17.040> Edge

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
through aluminum but you know 3G Edge

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.240 
through aluminum but you know 3G Edge
and<00:01:17.940> 4G<00:01:18.540> signal<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.230> even<00:01:19.440> cellular<00:01:19.800> signal

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and 4G signal and even cellular signal

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.149 
and 4G signal and even cellular signal
well<00:01:20.850> they<00:01:21.450> need<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.840> less<00:01:22.320> dense<00:01:22.560> material

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
well they need a less dense material

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.760 
well they need a less dense material
such<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.370> rubber<00:01:24.180> that's<00:01:24.900> what<00:01:25.140> those<00:01:25.320> thick

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
such as rubber that's what those thick

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.190 
such as rubber that's what those thick
rubber<00:01:26.190> antenna<00:01:26.730> lines<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.270> used<00:01:27.480> for<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.140> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
rubber antenna lines are used for but I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.020 
rubber antenna lines are used for but I
like<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> HTC<00:01:28.620> One<00:01:29.070> m8<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.550> example<00:01:29.909> which

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
like the HTC One m8 for example which

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.310 
like the HTC One m8 for example which
has<00:01:30.060> them<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.690> thin

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
thick and they look as if someone

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.800 
thick and they look as if someone

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
actually drew with I know permanent

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.170 
actually drew with I know permanent
marker<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.530> my<00:01:37.740> phone<00:01:38.010> they<00:01:38.370> look<00:01:38.610> they<00:01:39.150> look

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
awful so there we go that's that's one

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.500

now in case you don't know the iPhone is

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.190 
now in case you don't know the iPhone is
made<00:03:05.160> out<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.400> aluminum<00:03:06.060> which<00:03:06.750> makes<00:03:06.990> it

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
made out of aluminum which makes it

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.750 
made out of aluminum which makes it
really<00:03:07.410> really<00:03:07.860> high-quality<00:03:08.100> but<00:03:08.580> also

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
really really high-quality but also

really really high-quality but also
really<00:03:09.210> slippery<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.230> there's<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.920> really<00:03:11.280> high

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
really slippery so there's a really high

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.820 
really slippery so there's a really high
chance<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.570> dropping<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.320> phone<00:03:13.500> on<00:03:13.770> a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.710 
six-plus and that is you probably know
what<00:03:55.110> that<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.410> well<00:03:55.800> it's<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.880> band<00:03:57.090> gate<00:03:57.330> so

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
what that is well it's the band gate so

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.270 
what that is well it's the band gate so
I'm<00:03:57.840> guessing<00:03:58.170> all<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.530> have<00:03:58.710> seen<00:03:58.980> Lou's
