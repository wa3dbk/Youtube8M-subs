00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
large objects but the new pictures show

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.740 
large objects but the new pictures show
way<00:00:53.730> more<00:00:53.940> signs<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.239> impact<00:00:54.480> than<00:00:54.660> we

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
way more signs of impact than we

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.569 
way more signs of impact than we
expected<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.800> probably<00:00:56.219> means<00:00:56.430> that

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
expected so this probably means that

expected so this probably means that
there<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> lot<00:00:57.059> more<00:00:57.090> bouncing<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
there was a lot more bouncing and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.180 
there was a lot more bouncing and
