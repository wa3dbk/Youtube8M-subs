00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.870 
the worm so let's go ahead and go to the
next<00:02:03.270> level<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:04.430> all<00:02:05.430> right<00:02:05.550> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
next level here all right this is a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.670 
next level here all right this is a
little<00:02:06.150> bit<00:02:06.330> more<00:02:06.570> difficult<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.530> still

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
little bit more difficult but it's still

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.510 
little bit more difficult but it's still
pretty<00:02:07.830> easy

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
pretty easy

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.520 
pretty easy
you<00:02:08.970> got<00:02:09.060> three<00:02:09.330> swipes<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.290> pause<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you got three swipes you can pause the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.750 
you got three swipes you can pause the
game<00:02:10.860> here<00:02:12.200> play<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.620> this<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:14.610> just

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
game here play and this is just

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.640 
game here play and this is just
advertising<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.570> different<00:02:15.959> game<00:02:16.110> here<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
advertising a different game here and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.260 
advertising a different game here and
you<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:16.980> restart<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.459> level<00:02:17.820> as<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.090> guys

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
you can restart the level as you guys

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.940 
you can restart the level as you guys
have<00:02:18.480> already<00:02:18.690> seen<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.380> we're<00:02:19.530> gonna<00:02:19.650> flick

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
have already seen so we're gonna flick

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.550 
have already seen so we're gonna flick
again<00:02:23.060> at<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.240> time<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.510> flick<00:02:24.750> too<00:02:24.990> hard<00:02:25.230> and

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
again at that time I flick too hard and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.930 
again at that time I flick too hard and
some<00:02:25.860> have<00:02:26.070> them<00:02:26.360> work<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.660> bird<00:02:27.870> back<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.980> I

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
some have them work the bird back and I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.000 
some have them work the bird back and I
didn't<00:02:30.360> do<00:02:30.450> too<00:02:30.480> well<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.840> time<00:02:33.770> so<00:02:34.770> as<00:02:34.890> you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
didn't do too well that time so as you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.030 
didn't do too well that time so as you
can<00:02:35.070> see<00:02:35.130> I'm<00:02:35.880> probably<00:02:36.360> up<00:02:36.480> one<00:02:36.750> star<00:02:37.050> so<00:02:37.980> I

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
can see I'm probably up one star so I

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.250 
can see I'm probably up one star so I
didn't<00:02:38.340> do<00:02:38.400> too<00:02:38.610> good<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.840> we're<00:02:39.990> going<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.140> go

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
didn't do too good so we're going to go

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.620 
didn't do too good so we're going to go
to<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.470> level<00:02:40.620> selection<00:02:41.040> here<00:02:41.510> we're<00:02:42.510> gonna

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
to the level selection here we're gonna

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.470 
to the level selection here we're gonna
go<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.840> like<00:02:43.170> level<00:02:43.890> 22<00:02:44.700> as<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:45.270> see<00:02:45.360> only

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
go to like level 22 as you can see only

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.690 
go to like level 22 as you can see only
got<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:45.990> star<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.860> must<00:02:47.100> be<00:02:47.280> pretty

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
got one star on it so it must be pretty

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.050 
got one star on it so it must be pretty
difficult<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.920> as<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.220> can<00:02:50.310> see<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.850> is<00:02:51.030> a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
difficult so as you can see this is a

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.240 
difficult so as you can see this is a
later<00:02:51.330> level<00:02:51.780> where<00:02:51.930> things<00:02:52.590> get<00:02:52.860> kind<00:02:53.070> of

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
later level where things get kind of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:02.199 
later level where things get kind of
hectic<00:02:54.620> so

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.270 

see<00:03:03.209> as<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.599> see<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:04.019> it's<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.830> lot<00:03:05.010> more

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
see as you can see here it's a lot more

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.050 
see as you can see here it's a lot more
difficult<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:08.280> got<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.700> be<00:03:08.790> careful

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
difficult and you got to be careful

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.820 
difficult and you got to be careful
about<00:03:09.420> using<00:03:09.599> your<00:03:09.900> swipes<00:03:10.200> on<00:03:10.409> this<00:03:10.590> level

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
about using your swipes on this level

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.390 
about using your swipes on this level
especially<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.500> let's<00:03:13.680> see<00:03:13.799> if<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.099> get<00:03:14.250> it

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
especially so let's see if I can get it

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
especially so let's see if I can get it
I<00:03:14.489> might<00:03:14.640> be<00:03:14.790> able<00:03:14.879> to<00:03:14.970> know<00:03:15.480> didn't<00:03:16.049> make<00:03:16.200> it

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
I might be able to know didn't make it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.460 
I might be able to know didn't make it
so<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.780> see<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.049> get<00:03:19.170> more

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
so that you can see to get more

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.259 
so that you can see to get more
difficult<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.129> you<00:03:20.190> get<00:03:20.370> more<00:03:20.549> obstacles

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
difficult and you get more obstacles

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.619 
difficult and you get more obstacles
along<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.110> way<00:03:25.879> so<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:27.000> sound<00:03:27.209> effects<00:03:27.510> are

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
along the way so the sound effects are

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.150 
along the way so the sound effects are
pretty<00:03:27.780> good<00:03:28.049> as<00:03:28.260> far<00:03:28.379> as<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.530> graphics<00:03:29.010> go

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
pretty good as far as the graphics go

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.710 
pretty good as far as the graphics go
the<00:03:29.340> nice<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.730> simple<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.209> they<00:03:30.269> run<00:03:30.480> pretty

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
the nice and simple and they run pretty

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.360 
the nice and simple and they run pretty
well<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.140> frame<00:03:31.379> rate<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.829> pretty<00:03:32.069> good<00:03:32.310> I

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
well the frame rate is pretty good I

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.460 
well the frame rate is pretty good I
have<00:03:32.730> not<00:03:32.910> had<00:03:33.360> any<00:03:33.629> issues<00:03:33.989> with<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.230> frame

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
have not had any issues with the frame

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.900 
have not had any issues with the frame
rate<00:03:34.680> as<00:03:35.690> some<00:03:36.690> games<00:03:36.870> do<00:03:37.170> have<00:03:37.609> so<00:03:38.609> we're

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
rate as some games do have so we're

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.339 
rate as some games do have so we're
gonna<00:03:39.030> go<00:03:39.180> back<00:03:39.359> a<00:03:39.390> little<00:03:39.629> selection<00:03:40.019> let<00:03:40.290> me

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
gonna go back a little selection let me

gonna go back a little selection let me
go<00:03:40.470> ahead<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:41.609> over<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.090> next<00:03:42.769> world

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
go ahead and go over to the next world

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.160 
go ahead and go over to the next world

this<00:03:51.510> won't<00:03:51.629> go<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.959> level<00:03:52.260> one<00:03:52.519> as<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.700> see

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.460 
this won't go the level one as you see
the<00:03:54.060> level<00:03:54.359> is<00:03:54.450> kind<00:03:54.599> of<00:03:54.720> changed<00:03:55.109> up<00:03:55.290> like

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
the level is kind of changed up like

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.000 
the level is kind of changed up like
source<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.040> as<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.489> design<00:03:57.060> goes<00:03:57.359> as<00:03:58.290> you
