 no barbecue and stuffed tomatoes 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.090
 they are spiced with Moroccan 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.889
 couscous filled and really mega 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.719
 Tastes that tastes great 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.660
 just perfect for the barbecue season 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:25.080
 great prepare and at the same time 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:27.210
 Let's start this one for now 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.070
 recipe you need the following ingredients 2 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.710
 green onions two tablespoons 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.510
 olive oil a little water then 100 grams 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.219
 two couscous meat tomatoes two 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.800
 tablespoon sunflower seeds four 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.809
 tablespoon soy pan two tablespoons fine 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.420
 chopped fresh mint and then still 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.430
 some sweet paprika powder sea salt and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.969
 fresh procedure if you like 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.250
 I also give her 210 olives 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.949
 leave you here because so is mainz 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.989
 Do not isolate and if you have it today 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.329
 hear it is mega hot under the roof 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.460
 me in the office and that's why mine airs 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.109
 computer today so a little more so 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.590
 I apologize for the lies 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.359
 in the weather 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.760
 which is also his nice pages 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.990
 has so nice sun remaining then 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.850
 just so first the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.970
 naturally to cut onion 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.380
 as every time the beaks at the beginning and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.080
 then he just puts it in a pot 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.580
 with hot olive oil and that was ready 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.619
 So a little bit so really 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.450
 not burning on almost anything always good 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.680
 stir and with me this will be like this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.270
 a bit brownish that still in 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.920
 okay if that is not black 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.479
 and then I just want to do it with you 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.189
 the water kind of stress once so 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.710
 simmer a bit so it's at the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.780
 heat super fast and then you can 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.880
 let the kiss kiss trickle and small 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.220
 Stir well on top and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.659
 the whole ten to a maximum of 15 minutes 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.590
 to the side so that the whole 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.600
 can swell 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.520
 In the meantime, we can then 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.229
 but already take care of the tomatoes 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.070
 just with a sharp knife 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.240
 above so that cut off the cap or 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.590
 of course, watch out 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.119
 that we do not hurt the dish what 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.890
 should still be tight after that if ours 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.810
 filling comes in and then just with 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.250
 a spoon the whole hollow out that 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.899
 works with small spoons 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.600
 actually much better than for 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.219
 huge spoon and then we can ourselves 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.429
 again about the couscous mixture 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.069
 then just take care of the soya cream 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.850
 and cook all stir well then 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.800
 it still swells 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.930
 so a little bit and then we can 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.790
 because the sunflower seeds are equal to it 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.830
 salt the whole thing a bit 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.920
 bit of paprika powder a bit pepper 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.590
 Add it and then always 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.970
 again stir well in between the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.970
 I'm doing all my rest here now 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.030
 So really twice as the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.560
 Add paprika and but me 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.120
 think these colors are really nice 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.610
 this red with the green and so in the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.320
 whole does not stop stuffy 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.960
 from the color or but somehow has 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.430
 the already beautiful different shades 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.110
 I think of the filling and that 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.000
 tastes really delicious in the end so 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.480
 then tried the necessarily from easy 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.710
 pluck the coin if you have one 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.780
 bÃ¤umchen are at home he has so 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.760
 Introduce as I have if you have the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.640
 whole brimming with herbs and that 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.740
 although I just think it all off 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.660
 Well, then just pick it up and then 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.890
 the whole thing is already done in the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.470
 to stuff tomatoes 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.790
 and by the way, under my last or 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.170
 penultimate video so a bit the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.760
 discussion flared up if felix are 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.010
 actually vegan is no he is 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.320
 he is not level and it really is 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.820
 but such a confident meat knife unfortunately 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.870
 I live with it and I try too 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.120
 do not confess 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.290
 and he is not lying cheese either 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.780
 something and that's why he opens 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.610
 his tomato got it then 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.290
 on top of that a little parmesan 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.940
 I think it tastes so mega 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.140
 tasty try the absolutely times from 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.300
 and good appetite 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.460
 you have seen really mega easy 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.980
 great to prepare when you go 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.110
 The time is invited to have a barbecue 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.510
 or such or actual barbecue party 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.250

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.030

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.650

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.990
