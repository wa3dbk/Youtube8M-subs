00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.100 
design for us it's very rewarding to
work<00:05:02.970> with<00:05:03.240> loan<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.570> College<00:05:03.780> of<00:05:03.900> Fashion

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
work with loan and College of Fashion

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.909 
work with loan and College of Fashion
who<00:05:04.620> is<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.770> world-famous<00:05:05.160> institute<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.919> i

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
who is a world-famous institute and i

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.450 
who is a world-famous institute and i
think<00:05:08.580> is<00:05:09.360> really<00:05:09.840> interesting<00:05:10.199> to<00:05:11.070> work<00:05:11.220> with

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
think is really interesting to work with

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.950 
think is really interesting to work with
students<00:05:11.970> as<00:05:12.060> well<00:05:12.090> because<00:05:12.570> they<00:05:12.720> haven't

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
students as well because they haven't

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.710 
students as well because they haven't
really<00:05:13.349> set<00:05:13.650> their<00:05:13.979> their<00:05:14.550> design<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.419> style

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
really set their their design and style

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.050 
really set their their design and style
yet<00:05:16.050> so<00:05:16.410> they<00:05:16.560> have<00:05:16.770> refreshing<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:17.940> the

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
yet so they have refreshing and the

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.260 
yet so they have refreshing and the
interesting<00:05:18.690> IDs

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.910 

I<00:05:22.010> think<00:05:23.010> she<00:05:23.310> did<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.790> really<00:05:24.150> good

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
I think she did a really good

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.870 
I think she did a really good
combination<00:05:25.920> between<00:05:26.070> technology<00:05:26.580> and

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
combination between technology and

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.940 
combination between technology and
fashion<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.690> not<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.380> way<00:05:28.530> that<00:05:28.770> the

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
fashion and not the way that the

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.210 
fashion and not the way that the
technology<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.730> shown<00:05:30.090> in<00:05:30.690> such<00:05:31.140> more<00:05:31.560> more

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
technology and shown in such more more

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.140 
technology and shown in such more more
the<00:05:32.370> way<00:05:32.660> the<00:05:33.660> garment<00:05:34.460> interact<00:05:35.460> with<00:05:35.910> the

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
the way the garment interact with the

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.510 
the way the garment interact with the
person<00:05:36.690> so<00:05:36.990> I<00:05:37.020> think<00:05:37.350> that<00:05:37.560> I<00:05:37.800> I<00:05:38.040> think<00:05:38.370> it's

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
person so I think that I I think it's

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.800 
person so I think that I I think it's
almost<00:05:38.940> a<00:05:39.630> bit<00:05:39.810> poetic<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.620> have<00:05:40.860> that<00:05:41.810> garment

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
almost a bit poetic to have that garment

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.110 
almost a bit poetic to have that garment
kind<00:05:43.080> of<00:05:43.200> showing<00:05:43.740> or<00:05:44.250> calling<00:05:44.970> your

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
kind of showing or calling your

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.120 
kind of showing or calling your
attention<00:05:45.320> when<00:05:46.320> someone's<00:05:46.710> calling<00:05:47.670> you<00:05:47.880> or

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.800 

technology<00:05:53.130> become<00:05:53.520> more<00:05:53.760> interval<00:05:54.210> and<00:05:54.480> then

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
technology become more interval and then

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.370 
technology become more interval and then
with<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.620> fashion<00:05:56.160> and<00:05:56.460> I<00:05:57.030> think<00:05:57.450> when

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
with the fashion and I think when

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.680 
with the fashion and I think when
technique<00:05:59.130> become<00:05:59.490> more<00:05:59.730> and<00:05:59.850> more<00:05:59.940> advanced

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
technique become more and more advanced

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.390 
technique become more and more advanced
i<00:06:00.810> think<00:06:01.020> it's<00:06:01.170> it's<00:06:01.440> not<00:06:01.680> only<00:06:01.920> about<00:06:02.190> the

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
i think it's it's not only about the

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.280 
i think it's it's not only about the
technique<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:02.970> functions<00:06:03.630> it's<00:06:03.870> also<00:06:04.020> about

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
technique and functions it's also about

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.520 
technique and functions it's also about
style<00:06:04.920> and<00:06:05.130> fashion
