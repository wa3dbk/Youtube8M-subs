comeback<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:53.399> there<00:01:53.490> was<00:01:53.549> two<00:01:53.790> years<00:01:53.970> ago

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
comeback I think there was two years ago

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.209 
comeback I think there was two years ago
around<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.689> rumble<00:01:54.960> time<00:01:55.170> Dan<00:01:55.500> Nash<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
around the rumble time Dan Nash and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.370 
around the rumble time Dan Nash and
Booker<00:01:56.460> T<00:01:56.490> split<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.659> double<00:01:57.990> D<00:01:58.170> money

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
Booker T split for the double D money

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.740 
Booker T split for the double D money
and<00:01:58.759> that<00:01:59.759> sort<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.030> broke<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.329> up<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and that sort of broke that up and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.899 
and that sort of broke that up and
that's<00:02:01.229> good<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.430> they're<00:02:02.520> gonna<00:02:02.610> go<00:02:02.790> in

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that's good I think they're gonna go in

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.639 
that's good I think they're gonna go in
and<00:02:03.060> fight<00:02:03.240> fortune<00:02:03.780> or<00:02:04.020> maybe<00:02:04.439> they<00:02:04.590> were

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and fight fortune or maybe they were

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.719 
and fight fortune or maybe they were
immortal<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.280> that's<00:02:05.399> why<00:02:05.520> they<00:02:05.640> were

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
immortal but that's why they were

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.520 
immortal but that's why they were
putting<00:02:05.969> them<00:02:06.090> back<00:02:06.180> together<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.719> at<00:02:07.290> that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
putting them back together and at that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.380 
putting them back together and at that
point<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.920> was<00:02:08.039> sort<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.610> know<00:02:08.670> an

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
point it was sort of you know an

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.270 
point it was sort of you know an
afterthought<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.259> Scott<00:02:10.470> Steiner<00:02:10.770> was<00:02:10.950> even
