 in the pilot issue, let's see purchases 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.309
 our members as you see the purchase from 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.950

 bought btr cheat in order not to give 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.460
 to use your spell 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.160
 the strengths of both heroes 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.500
 however, spirit storm preferred damage 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.809
 survival and chose linkin scope paw 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.239
 on the contrary, the number was persistently chosen 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.030
 damage and attack speed let's see what of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.969
 this will come out so the first round of the bug 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.739
 runs out rushes the world flies storm 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.500
 spirit on the night foolish get 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.390
 sticks out attracts it gets 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.240
 huge amount of damage ban hq 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.670
 and dies easily at the hands of the sides of the spirit and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.770
 so the time of the second round of states before 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.479
 bursts on those pp i get 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.640
 sticking out they start beating each other when 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.759
 heavy storm spirit and the greatest 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.939
 the amount of damage and bedbug dies as well 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.439
 fast as the first time, well, that in 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.930
 first part win two rounds 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.299
 in a row the storm wins unconditional 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.430
 victory our members have changed the purchase 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.409
 Before the second part of the duel, let's see what 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.210
 it turned out now who was share 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.670
 made a choice in favor of survival 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.000
 this is exactly what was missing in the first part 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.520
 but as they say the speed of the attack is superfluous 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.649
 does not happen and that's what he decided 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.860
 add damage and control due to cupcakes 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.710
 and mom but also about protection from magic not for 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.960
 there was a first round of 2 parts that time before 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.530
 on ulta blasts downed Orchids 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.230
 and Dana begins the fight at the Pope passes 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.250
 many lightning in a moment that time before 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.590
 and he dies and so the second round is both 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.920
 player rushes start a fight 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.470
 molting shot down brighter given fear of a 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.630
 included maman gives sex in the ass valve 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.520
 what can he do runs away and in 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.010
 the last moment she still has time to give 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.170
 ulta and so this time already bug 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.300
 wins two rounds unconditionally 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.270
 successively this hero turns out to be 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.090
 stronger in deeper these probably 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.010
 become consider this duel a draw yes you 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.430
 mock us so we don't decide who 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.400
 cooler 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.580
 we will play one more part of best of 3 but 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.980

 take a look at the next purchase change 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.959
 the storm decided that risk is a noble cause yes 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.940
 and mobility is quite enough for him 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.670
 ultimates so he sold out until thin and 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.580
 instead of them acquired bkb blade mail let

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.519
 I think itâ€™s not good to sell 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.049
 hyperstone 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:08.840

 they fight both little hp and some 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.710
 successful lightning solve the game well, finally 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.660
 at least some intrigue in the last round 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.700
 the storm lacked literally one two 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.739
 strikes in order to win but still not 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.240
 succeeded he then still tried 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.520
 to dissuade something like 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.830
 I was drunk but in fact he drank all 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.050

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.100
