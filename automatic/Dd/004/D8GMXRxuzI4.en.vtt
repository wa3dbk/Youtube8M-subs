for<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.040> rest<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> round<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.420> can

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
for the rest of the round so as you can

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.390 
for the rest of the round so as you can
see<00:01:33.570> now<00:01:33.840> we're<00:01:34.049> gonna<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.619> up<00:01:34.799> so

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
see now we're gonna be going up so

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.460 
see now we're gonna be going up so
that's<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> top<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.930> first<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.259> all<00:01:37.350> we're

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
that's the top but first of all we're

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.020 
that's the top but first of all we're
gonna<00:01:37.560> stop<00:01:37.799> off<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.250> floor<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.909> then

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
gonna stop off at this floor and then

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.969 
gonna stop off at this floor and then
this<00:01:39.150> ball<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.869> once<00:01:40.020> we're<00:01:40.140> back<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.500> I'm

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
this ball so once we're back here I'm

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.410 
this ball so once we're back here I'm
gonna<00:01:41.100> show<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.460> where<00:01:41.670> sometimes<00:01:42.060> some<00:01:42.299> of

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
gonna show you where sometimes some of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.910 
gonna show you where sometimes some of
the<00:01:42.509> other<00:01:42.630> parts<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.110> spawn<00:01:43.350> sometimes

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the other parts can spawn sometimes

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.170 
the other parts can spawn sometimes
there'll<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.340> part<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.670> their<00:01:44.790> most<00:01:44.939> born

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
there'll be a part of their most born

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.260 
there'll be a part of their most born
there<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.570> also<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.590> other<00:01:47.220> than<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.700> that

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
there and also here other than that that

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.999 
there and also here other than that that
is<00:01:48.299> pretty<00:01:48.630> much<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> locations<00:01:49.860> where

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
is pretty much all the locations where

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.700 
is pretty much all the locations where
the<00:01:50.070> pilot<00:01:50.430> chute<00:01:50.729> or<00:01:50.939> will<00:01:51.270> spawn<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:52.409> already

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the pilot chute or will spawn or already

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.429 
the pilot chute or will spawn or already
have<00:01:53.189> spawn<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.149> once<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
have spawn so on once you like that you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.139 
have spawn so on once you like that you
want<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.590> keep<00:01:55.799> adding<00:01:56.070> them<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.640> crafting

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
want to keep adding them to the crafting

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.580 
want to keep adding them to the crafting
table<00:01:57.860> or<00:01:58.860> however<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> call<00:01:59.820> that

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
table or however you want to call that

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.230 
table or however you want to call that
so<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.009> see<00:02:02.219> we<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.520> two<00:02:02.729> parts<00:02:03.060> now

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
so as you can see we have two parts now

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.330 
so as you can see we have two parts now
this<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.020> compressor<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
this is the compressor and that's the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.800 
this is the compressor and that's the
everything<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.479> make<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
everything this is to make the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.440 
everything this is to make the
trampoline<00:02:07.500> which<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.220> relatively<00:02:08.759> good<00:02:09.000> tool

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
trampoline which is relatively good tool

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.630 
trampoline which is relatively good tool
for<00:02:09.479> say<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.440> all<00:02:10.739> for<00:02:11.099> if<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.459> them

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
for say if you all for if you have them

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.040 
for say if you all for if you have them
you<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:12.330> put<00:02:12.510> one<00:02:12.720> here

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
you can put one here

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.320 
you can put one here
and<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:14.010> watch<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.910> building

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and you can watch you to that building

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.380 
and you can watch you to that building
there<00:02:15.750> are<00:02:16.050> easy<00:02:16.530> way<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:17.180> travel<00:02:18.180> from

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
there are easy way to travel from

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.880 
there are easy way to travel from
building<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.780> building<00:02:18.930> than<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.620> from

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
building to building than going from

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.210 
building to building than going from
jumping<00:02:20.880> or<00:02:21.150> taking<00:02:21.690> elevators<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.350> top<00:02:22.590> then

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
jumping or taking elevators to top then

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.430 
jumping or taking elevators to top then
going<00:02:23.580> or<00:02:23.730> taking<00:02:24.240> other<00:02:24.450> things<00:02:24.780> like<00:02:25.020> slides

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
going or taking other things like slides

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.260 
going or taking other things like slides
or<00:02:25.800> one<00:02:26.010> jumps<00:02:26.460> but<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.850> want<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.120> call

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
or one jumps but if you want to call

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.170 
or one jumps but if you want to call
them<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:29.160> now<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.520> gonna<00:02:29.730> wait<00:02:29.910> for<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
them so now it's gonna wait for the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.490 
them so now it's gonna wait for the
elevators<00:02:30.600> which<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.990> be<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> time-consuming

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
elevators which can be a time-consuming

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.710 
elevators which can be a time-consuming
spa<00:02:32.160> but<00:02:32.370> when<00:02:32.460> there's<00:02:32.640> four<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.090> this

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
spa but when there's four of you this

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.920 
spa but when there's four of you this
building<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.440> really<00:02:34.640> really<00:02:35.640> easy<00:02:36.000> takes<00:02:36.720> up

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
building is really really easy takes up

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.700 
building is really really easy takes up
to<00:02:37.080> no<00:02:37.320> time<00:02:37.620> at<00:02:37.800> all<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.160> then<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:40.530> is

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
to no time at all and then that is

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.160 
to no time at all and then that is
pretty<00:02:41.010> much<00:02:41.190> what<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.850> can<00:02:42.390> do<00:02:42.540> there<00:02:43.080> is

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
pretty much what that can do there is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.810 
pretty much what that can do there is
some<00:02:43.320> other<00:02:43.470> places<00:02:43.710> you<00:02:44.070> can<00:02:44.250> put<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:44.610> sort

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
some other places you can put this sort

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.580 
some other places you can put this sort
of<00:02:44.910> family<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.480> be<00:02:45.600> good<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:45.990> when<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:46.380> down

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
of family to be good is when you go down

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.890 
of family to be good is when you go down
there<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.980> go<00:02:47.910> down<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.360> power<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.780> get

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
there I go down to the power and you get

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.420 
there I go down to the power and you get
through<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.470> Chinese<00:02:49.860> upside<00:02:50.220> down

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
through so like the Chinese upside down

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.150 
through so like the Chinese upside down
building<00:02:50.790> there<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.710> bowing<00:02:52.710> that<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.010> can

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
building there is a bowing that you can

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.890 
building there is a bowing that you can
monitor<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.670> jump<00:02:53.910> across<00:02:54.180> if<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.690> put

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
monitor and jump across if you can put

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.970 
monitor and jump across if you can put
it<00:02:54.990> on<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.170> very<00:02:55.350> end<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.950> can

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
it on the very end of that and you can

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.470 
it on the very end of that and you can
launch<00:02:56.340> yourself<00:02:56.790> instead<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.180> having<00:02:57.300> to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
launch yourself instead of having to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.220 
launch yourself instead of having to
jump<00:02:58.250> politically<00:02:59.250> good<00:02:59.430> thing<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.850> do

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
jump politically good thing to do

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.390 
jump politically good thing to do
another<00:03:01.230> spot<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.740> found<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.160> when<00:03:02.280> you

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
another spot that I found is when you

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.220 
another spot that I found is when you
spawn<00:03:02.760> it's<00:03:02.940> born<00:03:03.210> you<00:03:03.420> can<00:03:03.570> also<00:03:03.690> put<00:03:04.050> those

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
spawn it's born you can also put those

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.120 
spawn it's born you can also put those
up<00:03:04.410> like<00:03:04.590> them<00:03:05.510> Champlain<00:03:06.510> we<00:03:06.840> jump<00:03:07.170> from<00:03:07.380> to

elevator<00:03:13.260> which<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.160> decent<00:03:14.670> thing<00:03:14.790> when

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
elevator which is a decent thing when

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.390 
elevator which is a decent thing when
you<00:03:15.330> think<00:03:15.570> about<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:15.960> cuz<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.350> can<00:03:16.530> go<00:03:17.250> up

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
you think about it cuz you can go up

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.010 
you think about it cuz you can go up
there<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.790> also<00:03:17.940> be<00:03:18.240> camping<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.870> on

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
there and you also be camping it is on

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.140 
there and you also be camping it is on
visible<00:03:19.350> jumps<00:03:19.680> through<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.220> land<00:03:20.610> on<00:03:20.790> catch

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
visible jumps through and land on catch

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.420 
visible jumps through and land on catch
trampoline<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.110> instead<00:03:22.770> of<00:03:22.830> having<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.190> like

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
trampoline and instead of having to like

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.830 
trampoline and instead of having to like
pressurize<00:03:23.970> every<00:03:24.180> time<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.630> will<00:03:24.720> just

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
pressurize every time it will just

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.590 
pressurize every time it will just
launch<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.230> zombies<00:03:25.590> across<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:27.150> now<00:03:27.300> we're<00:03:27.480> up

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
launch a zombies across so now we're up

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.510 
launch a zombies across so now we're up
the<00:03:27.720> elevators<00:03:28.170> back<00:03:28.350> but<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.800> take<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> long

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
the elevators back but to take a long

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.910 
the elevators back but to take a long
time<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:30.300> get<00:03:30.450> all<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.900> parts<00:03:31.230> but<00:03:31.740> it's

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
time to get all the parts but it's

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.830 
time to get all the parts but it's
actually<00:03:32.340> really<00:03:32.370> worth<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:33.060> once<00:03:33.510> you've<00:03:33.720> got

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
actually really worth it once you've got

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.900 
actually really worth it once you've got
this<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:34.260> liquify<00:03:34.800> you're<00:03:35.130> pretty<00:03:35.400> much<00:03:35.580> set

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
this and liquify you're pretty much set

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.310 
this and liquify you're pretty much set
for<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.180> pretty<00:03:36.510> decent<00:03:36.900> amount<00:03:36.990> if<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.230> have

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
for a pretty decent amount if you have

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.670 
for a pretty decent amount if you have
to<00:03:37.500> run<00:03:37.680> away<00:03:37.890> from<00:03:37.950> them<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.490> rate<00:03:38.760> trains<00:03:39.030> etc

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
to run away from them in rate trains etc

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.220 
to run away from them in rate trains etc
this<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.980> second<00:03:41.310> last<00:03:41.490> part<00:03:41.790> for<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.230> I'm

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
this is the second last part for it I'm

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.540 
this is the second last part for it I'm
just<00:03:43.440> gonna<00:03:43.560> run<00:03:43.800> off<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.160> do<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.310> because

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
just gonna run off and do it because

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.340 
just gonna run off and do it because
it's<00:03:45.000> such<00:03:45.209> an<00:03:45.360> easy<00:03:45.510> way<00:03:45.720> what<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:45.990> do<00:03:46.140> is<00:03:46.230> be

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
it's such an easy way what you do is be

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.680 
it's such an easy way what you do is be
careful<00:03:46.800> because<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> hollow<00:03:48.209> part<00:03:48.540> your

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
careful because it is a hollow part your

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.210 
careful because it is a hollow part your
full<00:03:48.870> tree<00:03:49.050> but<00:03:49.230> also<00:03:49.380> sometimes<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:50.070> might

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
full tree but also sometimes you might

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.130 
full tree but also sometimes you might
fall<00:03:50.490> off<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.670> edge<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.970> then<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.810> will<00:03:51.959> not

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
fall off the edge and then it will not

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.420 
fall off the edge and then it will not
help<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.470> because<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.770> will<00:03:52.980> just<00:03:53.130> have<00:03:53.280> to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
help you because you will just have to

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.510 
help you because you will just have to
die<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:54.000> do<00:03:54.840> actually<00:03:55.200> added<00:03:55.470> yes<00:03:55.620> there's

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
die and do actually added yes there's

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.920 
die and do actually added yes there's
only<00:03:56.610> one<00:03:56.790> more<00:03:56.940> part<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.420> is<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.720> base<00:03:57.900> of

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
only one more part that is the base of

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.630 
only one more part that is the base of
the<00:03:58.140> trampoline<00:03:58.680> which<00:03:58.860> will<00:03:59.010> launch<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.430> now

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
the trampoline which will launch you now

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.910 
the trampoline which will launch you now
it<00:03:59.790> just<00:03:59.820> got<00:04:00.090> away<00:04:00.150> forget<00:04:00.870> elevator<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.740> come

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
it just got away forget elevator to come

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.430 
it just got away forget elevator to come
the<00:04:02.880> elevator<00:04:03.270> over<00:04:03.450> there<00:04:03.600> isn't<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.290> way<00:04:04.410> to

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
the elevator over there isn't a way to

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.290 
the elevator over there isn't a way to
get<00:04:04.680> up<00:04:04.800> it<00:04:05.100> doesn't<00:04:05.430> do<00:04:05.580> anything<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.209> I'm

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
get up it doesn't do anything and I'm

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.610 
get up it doesn't do anything and I'm
pretty<00:04:06.450> sure<00:04:06.510> half<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.050> time<00:04:07.290> I've<00:04:07.470> been

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
pretty sure half the time I've been

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.190 
pretty sure half the time I've been
squashed<00:04:07.920> while<00:04:08.670> having<00:04:09.030> or<00:04:09.239> what<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.870> do<00:04:10.020> get

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
squashed while having or what you do get

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.650 
squashed while having or what you do get
squished<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.650> be<00:04:10.709> on<00:04:10.860> I'm<00:04:11.010> pretty<00:04:11.190> sure<00:04:11.370> so<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
squished to be on I'm pretty sure so the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.150 
squished to be on I'm pretty sure so the
only<00:04:12.780> elevator<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.230> get<00:04:13.350> up<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:13.650> this<00:04:13.920> elevator

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
only elevator to get up is this elevator

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.979

onto<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.060> brilliant<00:04:24.330> idea<00:04:24.419> elevators<00:04:24.930> up

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
onto this brilliant idea elevators up

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.700 
onto this brilliant idea elevators up
turn<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.530> power

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
turn the power

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.170 
turn the power
what<00:04:25.889> about<00:04:26.009> jump<00:04:26.430> because<00:04:26.550> yeah<00:04:26.850> that's<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
what about jump because yeah that's the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.159 
what about jump because yeah that's the
only<00:04:27.330> other<00:04:27.360> way<00:04:27.509> you're<00:04:27.690> gonna<00:04:27.810> get<00:04:27.990> through

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
only other way you're gonna get through

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.350 
only other way you're gonna get through
but<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:29.039> still<00:04:29.400> have<00:04:29.699> to<00:04:29.850> wait<00:04:30.000> for<00:04:30.240> the

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
but you still have to wait for the

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.170 
but you still have to wait for the
elevator<00:04:30.449> so<00:04:31.229> either<00:04:31.680> way<00:04:32.069> it<00:04:32.699> pretty<00:04:33.000> much

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
elevator so either way it pretty much

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.659 
elevator so either way it pretty much
not<00:04:33.479> gonna<00:04:33.720> get<00:04:33.990> this<00:04:34.319> build<00:04:34.620> without<00:04:35.220> waiting

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
not gonna get this build without waiting

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.879 
not gonna get this build without waiting
for<00:04:35.849> an<00:04:36.090> elevator<00:04:36.210> or<00:04:36.630> two<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.770> is

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
for an elevator or two so it is

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.249 
for an elevator or two so it is
relatively<00:04:38.490> easy<00:04:39.060> when<00:04:39.539> you<00:04:39.599> think<00:04:39.840> about<00:04:39.930> it

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
relatively easy when you think about it

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.800 
relatively easy when you think about it
the<00:04:40.380> time<00:04:40.620> will<00:04:41.490> take<00:04:41.699> short<00:04:42.120> out<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.479> wait<00:04:42.630> for

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
the time will take short out to wait for

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.159 
the time will take short out to wait for
an<00:04:42.900> elevator<00:04:43.080> here<00:04:43.410> than<00:04:43.650> doing<00:04:43.919> a<00:04:44.009> long<00:04:44.250> and

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
an elevator here than doing a long and

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.920 
an elevator here than doing a long and
strenuous<00:04:46.169> run<00:04:46.680> around<00:04:46.889> the<00:04:47.160> map<00:04:47.930> which

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
strenuous run around the map which

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.230 
strenuous run around the map which
sometimes<00:04:49.440> these<00:04:49.650> things<00:04:49.710> can<00:04:50.340> take<00:04:50.370> forever

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
sometimes these things can take forever

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.330 
sometimes these things can take forever
but<00:04:51.720> there's<00:04:52.259> no<00:04:52.410> way<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.590> speed<00:04:52.979> about

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
but there's no way to speed about

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.950 
but there's no way to speed about
so<00:04:54.210> on<00:04:55.970> actually<00:04:56.970> I<00:04:57.150> don't<00:04:57.479> that<00:04:57.660> actually

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
so on actually I don't that actually

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.570 
so on actually I don't that actually
worked<00:04:59.330> on<00:05:00.330> a<00:05:00.599> brother<00:05:00.900> I<00:05:01.199> could<00:05:01.440> build<00:05:01.650> so

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
worked on a brother I could build so

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.900 
worked on a brother I could build so
yeah<00:05:02.729> this<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.740> just<00:05:04.740> go<00:05:04.949> away<00:05:05.039> and<00:05:05.190> wait<00:05:05.580> wait

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
yeah this is just go away and wait wait

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.360 
yeah this is just go away and wait wait
it's<00:05:06.330> best<00:05:06.570> to<00:05:06.660> keep<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:07.020> normal<00:05:07.560> zombie<00:05:07.830> like<00:05:08.340> a

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
it's best to keep a normal zombie like a

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.730 
it's best to keep a normal zombie like a
slow<00:05:08.789> one<00:05:08.970> instead<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.479> crew<00:05:09.810> crawling<00:05:10.590> on<00:05:10.710> a

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
slow one instead of a crew crawling on a

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.719 
slow one instead of a crew crawling on a
creeper<00:05:11.130> but<00:05:11.699> um<00:05:11.849> as<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.919> wont<00:05:13.919> die<00:05:14.130> out<00:05:14.370> on<00:05:14.580> you

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
creeper but um as it wont die out on you

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.029 
creeper but um as it wont die out on you
like<00:05:15.030> it'll<00:05:15.270> de<00:05:15.389> sponge<00:05:15.750> stuck<00:05:16.320> but<00:05:16.620> it's<00:05:16.860> not

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
like it'll de sponge stuck but it's not

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.980 
like it'll de sponge stuck but it's not
really<00:05:17.220> gonna<00:05:17.340> do<00:05:17.490> much<00:05:17.610> damage<00:05:17.849> and<00:05:18.479> also<00:05:18.810> a

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
really gonna do much damage and also a

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.330 
really gonna do much damage and also a
thing<00:05:19.349> is<00:05:19.470> when<00:05:19.680> you're<00:05:19.800> going<00:05:19.949> on<00:05:20.159> elevator

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
thing is when you're going on elevator

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.920 
thing is when you're going on elevator
zombies<00:05:20.970> get<00:05:21.120> on<00:05:21.240> this<00:05:21.419> they<00:05:21.630> would<00:05:21.780> just

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
zombies get on this they would just

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.779 
zombies get on this they would just
exploit<00:05:22.349> also<00:05:22.770> baby<00:05:22.979> I'm<00:05:23.070> into<00:05:23.310> it<00:05:23.430> they<00:05:23.639> will

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
exploit also baby I'm into it they will

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.749 
exploit also baby I'm into it they will
just<00:05:24.030> exploit<00:05:24.449> soon<00:05:24.860> either<00:05:25.860> way<00:05:26.190> you're

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
just exploit soon either way you're

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.589 
just exploit soon either way you're
pretty<00:05:26.940> much<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.120> safe<00:05:27.449> safe<00:05:28.259> safe<00:05:28.610> safe<00:05:29.610> no

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
pretty much a safe safe safe safe no

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.360 
pretty much a safe safe safe safe no
matter<00:05:30.720> what<00:05:30.810> so<00:05:31.680> I'm<00:05:31.770> pretty<00:05:31.919> sure<00:05:32.039> this<00:05:32.220> is

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
matter what so I'm pretty sure this is

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.710 
matter what so I'm pretty sure this is
the<00:05:32.400> last<00:05:32.610> part<00:05:32.849> unless<00:05:33.000> is<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.270> part<00:05:33.539> up<00:05:33.690> here

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
the last part unless is a part up here

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.180 
the last part unless is a part up here
that<00:05:33.930> I<00:05:33.990> haven't<00:05:34.199> grabbed<00:05:34.500> but<00:05:34.710> I'm<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:34.889> hundred

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
that I haven't grabbed but I'm a hundred

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.670 
that I haven't grabbed but I'm a hundred
pen<00:05:35.340> short<00:05:35.669> this<00:05:36.060> will<00:05:36.509> be<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.900> last<00:05:37.050> part<00:05:37.349> I

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
pen short this will be the last part I

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.649 
pen short this will be the last part I
believe<00:05:38.460> I've<00:05:38.610> already<00:05:38.699> got<00:05:39.000> four<00:05:39.210> parts<00:05:39.539> we

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
believe I've already got four parts we

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.060 
believe I've already got four parts we
just<00:05:39.780> got<00:05:39.870> a<00:05:39.900> slightly<00:05:40.199> easier<00:05:40.380> way<00:05:40.710> off<00:05:40.860> and

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
just got a slightly easier way off and

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.249 
just got a slightly easier way off and
then<00:05:41.370> we<00:05:41.520> drill<00:05:41.820> it<00:05:41.940> this<00:05:42.659> will<00:05:42.840> hopefully<00:05:42.990> be

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
then we drill it this will hopefully be

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.740 
then we drill it this will hopefully be
the<00:05:43.380> last<00:05:43.560> part<00:05:43.830> and<00:05:44.270> we<00:05:45.270> should<00:05:45.419> get<00:05:45.479> I<00:05:45.539> take

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
the last part and we should get I take

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.390 
the last part and we should get I take
it<00:05:45.900> alright<00:05:46.289> that's<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.680> last<00:05:46.770> pot<00:05:47.190> so<00:05:47.370> now

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
it alright that's the last pot so now

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.550 
it alright that's the last pot so now
we've<00:05:47.639> got<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:47.909> trampoline<00:05:48.090> so<00:05:49.020> IV<00:05:49.199> chalk<00:05:49.440> it

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
we've got the trampoline so IV chalk it

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.529 
we've got the trampoline so IV chalk it
here<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:50.039> you<00:05:50.219> wait<00:05:50.430> for<00:05:50.759> it<00:05:50.849> to<00:05:50.880> pressurize

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
here and you wait for it to pressurize

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.839 
here and you wait for it to pressurize
itself<00:05:51.960> through<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:52.349> compressor<00:05:53.070> or<00:05:53.340> their

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
itself through the compressor or their

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.939 
itself through the compressor or their
processor<00:05:54.270> Plus<00:05:54.479> that<00:05:54.750> your<00:05:55.440> wait<00:05:55.560> for<00:05:55.800> that

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
processor Plus that your wait for that

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.320 
processor Plus that your wait for that
now<00:05:56.400> we're<00:05:56.520> trying<00:05:56.669> to<00:05:56.789> do<00:05:56.880> is<00:05:57.000> just<00:05:57.030> want<00:05:57.270> to

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
now we're trying to do is just want to

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.120 
now we're trying to do is just want to
go<00:05:57.419> onto<00:05:57.599> it<00:05:57.840> and<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:58.349> should<00:05:58.469> launch<00:05:58.620> across

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
go onto it and it should launch across

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.469 
go onto it and it should launch across
you<00:05:59.370> can<00:05:59.400> put<00:05:59.639> these<00:05:59.729> on<00:05:59.789> multiple<00:06:00.360> different

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
you can put these on multiple different

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.510 
you can put these on multiple different
paces<00:06:01.020> after<00:06:01.349> how<00:06:01.500> creative<00:06:01.889> you<00:06:01.949> are<00:06:02.190> is<00:06:02.370> how

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
paces after how creative you are is how

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.550 
paces after how creative you are is how
created<00:06:02.909> the<00:06:03.000> spot<00:06:03.240> will<00:06:03.389> be<00:06:03.539> to<00:06:03.719> launch<00:06:03.870> it<00:06:04.050> um

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
created the spot will be to launch it um

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.159 
created the spot will be to launch it um
see<00:06:05.520> you<00:06:05.580> guys<00:06:05.789> thanks<00:06:06.210> for<00:06:06.270> watching<00:06:06.479> and
