are big punches who have big devastating
knockout<00:05:57.180> power<00:05:57.449> if<00:05:58.319> they<00:05:58.620> can<00:05:58.830> land<00:05:58.979> their

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
knockout power if they can land their

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.029 
knockout power if they can land their
power<00:05:59.370> but<00:06:00.270> they're<00:06:00.419> not<00:06:00.569> prolific<00:06:01.259> punches

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
power but they're not prolific punches

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.100 
power but they're not prolific punches
and<00:06:02.550> can't<00:06:02.909> make<00:06:03.060> the<00:06:03.120> power<00:06:03.419> tell<00:06:03.810> on<00:06:04.080> a

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
and can't make the power tell on a

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.499 
and can't make the power tell on a
consistent<00:06:04.469> basis<00:06:05.270> alright<00:06:06.270> so<00:06:06.449> you

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
consistent basis alright so you

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:07.969 
consistent basis alright so you
recognize<00:06:06.960> the<00:06:07.259> difference<00:06:07.649> and<00:06:07.770> when<00:06:07.889> you're

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
recognize the difference and when you're

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.219 
recognize the difference and when you're
dealing<00:06:08.279> with<00:06:08.310> heavyweight<00:06:08.729> boxing<00:06:09.270> most

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
dealing with heavyweight boxing most

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.579 
dealing with heavyweight boxing most
heavyweights<00:06:10.770> have<00:06:10.830> got<00:06:11.039> the<00:06:11.129> power<00:06:12.379> to<00:06:13.379> knock

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:13.589

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
most other heavyweights out and when

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.079 
most other heavyweights out and when
you're<00:06:16.529> talking<00:06:16.889> about<00:06:17.009> the<00:06:17.250> elite<00:06:17.580> punches

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.089 
you're talking about the elite punches

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:20.029 
you're talking about the elite punches
people<00:06:18.270> like<00:06:18.599> Tyson<00:06:18.899> and<00:06:19.439> stuff<00:06:19.649> like<00:06:19.830> that

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
people like Tyson and stuff like that

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.249 
people like Tyson and stuff like that
you<00:06:20.849> get<00:06:21.060> to<00:06:21.210> a<00:06:21.240> point<00:06:21.539> where<00:06:21.779> you<00:06:21.899> reach<00:06:22.110> a

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
you get to a point where you reach a

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.920 
you get to a point where you reach a
critical<00:06:22.409> mass<00:06:23.000> Mike<00:06:24.000> Tyson<00:06:24.449> wasn't<00:06:24.839> the

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
critical mass Mike Tyson wasn't the

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.839 
critical mass Mike Tyson wasn't the
hardest<00:06:25.199> puncher<00:06:25.560> of<00:06:25.680> all<00:06:25.800> time<00:06:26.039> but<00:06:26.639> he<00:06:26.729> had

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
hardest puncher of all time but he had

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.700 
hardest puncher of all time but he had
enough<00:06:27.210> power<00:06:27.449> to<00:06:27.750> not<00:06:27.899> just<00:06:28.139> about<00:06:28.349> anyone

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
enough power to not just about anyone

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.010 
enough power to not just about anyone
out<00:06:28.860> anyway<00:06:29.219> so<00:06:30.060> if<00:06:30.210> you've<00:06:30.360> got<00:06:30.479> more<00:06:30.539> power

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
out anyway so if you've got more power

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.420 
out anyway so if you've got more power
than<00:06:31.199> Tyson<00:06:31.620> well<00:06:31.800> good<00:06:32.039> for<00:06:32.069> you

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
than Tyson well good for you

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.769 
than Tyson well good for you
but<00:06:33.300> it's<00:06:33.419> not<00:06:33.599> really<00:06:33.870> that<00:06:33.899> necessary<00:06:35.779> right

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:36.779 
but it's not really that necessary right

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:41.150 
but it's not really that necessary right
you<00:06:36.930> can<00:06:37.139> kill<00:06:37.379> someone<00:06:37.680> with<00:06:38.389> a<00:06:39.389> 22<00:06:39.990> caliber

so<00:07:07.830> yes<00:07:08.820> Mike<00:07:09.090> Tyson<00:07:09.510> wasn't<00:07:09.870> the<00:07:10.380> hardest

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 
so yes Mike Tyson wasn't the hardest

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.110 
so yes Mike Tyson wasn't the hardest
puncher<00:07:10.980> of<00:07:11.040> all<00:07:11.220> time<00:07:11.430> but<00:07:11.640> I<00:07:11.670> didn't<00:07:12.000> really

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
puncher of all time but I didn't really

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.300 
puncher of all time but I didn't really
matter<00:07:12.390> anyway<00:07:12.690> cuz<00:07:13.350> he<00:07:13.440> had<00:07:13.560> such<00:07:13.770> skill<00:07:14.130> and

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
matter anyway cuz he had such skill and

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.540 
matter anyway cuz he had such skill and
dexterity<00:07:14.690> hand<00:07:15.690> speed<00:07:16.020> coordination

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
dexterity hand speed coordination

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.900 
dexterity hand speed coordination
reflexes<00:07:17.550> technique<00:07:18.330> and<00:07:18.570> all<00:07:18.660> that<00:07:19.580> he<00:07:20.580> he

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:20.910 
reflexes technique and all that he he

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.610 
reflexes technique and all that he he
had<00:07:21.000> enough<00:07:21.300> power<00:07:21.570> to<00:07:21.660> knock<00:07:21.810> most<00:07:22.170> guys<00:07:22.380> out

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.620 
had enough power to knock most guys out

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.650 
had enough power to knock most guys out
and<00:07:22.800> he<00:07:23.220> had<00:07:23.340> a<00:07:23.370> great<00:07:23.670> delivery<00:07:24.060> system<00:07:24.510> for

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 
and he had a great delivery system for

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.660 
and he had a great delivery system for
delivering<00:07:24.750> that<00:07:25.050> power<00:07:25.430> Lukas<00:07:26.430> Brown

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:26.670 
delivering that power Lukas Brown

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.100 
delivering that power Lukas Brown
although<00:07:27.000> he<00:07:27.240> may<00:07:27.360> hit<00:07:27.570> harder<00:07:27.810> than<00:07:27.840> Tyson

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.110 
although he may hit harder than Tyson

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.690 
although he may hit harder than Tyson
obviously<00:07:28.770> he<00:07:28.890> doesn't<00:07:29.220> have<00:07:29.340> the<00:07:29.490> delivery

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:29.700 
obviously he doesn't have the delivery

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.560 
obviously he doesn't have the delivery
system<00:07:30.330> that<00:07:30.510> Tyson<00:07:30.990> had<00:07:31.520> you<00:07:32.520> know<00:07:32.670> so<00:07:33.060> don't

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:33.570 
system that Tyson had you know so don't

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.140 
system that Tyson had you know so don't
