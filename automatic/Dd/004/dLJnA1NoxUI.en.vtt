00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.730
 and it's like we're going to go as menu type nothing 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.440
 more than just one dish and I'm going to start 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.520
 for putting my meat that I already have 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.520
 previously sailor 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.960
 now I have sea and nobody is ready 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.119
 and right now I'm wearing beef skirt that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.869
 I love them and lately I have her as 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.960
 chosen one 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.650
 I like it very much, it seems like a very meat 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.180
 very rich and I think we left it already 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.559
 we have to stop using only 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.410
 because the people of mario are for 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.910
 salpicÃ³n and good let's give them others 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.440
 uses today and is 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.820
 very easy to do I will put the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.739
 Marine 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.300
 and I use these plastic bags that I 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.030
 they look very good this is the skirt of 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.579
 birds for people who do not know her 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.260
 I always have in return absolutely 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.120
 everything that enters refrigerator in a 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.769
 plastic film I think it's a lot 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.170
 better because that's the only way to 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.660
 that food is not contaminated so much 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.409
 of smell as of taste this is a lack 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.649
 of Kings 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.060
 we can see this marbling marbled 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.030
 means these little bits of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.159
 fat that they have here and the thread of 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.920
 muscle runs down we can see it 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.690
 if I cut my flesh this way as much 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.210
 It's hard for me to stay hard but if I 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.950
 tail that short as the thread goes 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.570
 the meat the big one is going to be much more 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.759
 soft are the secrets know the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.130
 big butchers let's put a 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.960
 plastic bag 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.540
 and the lemon way is very easy 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.890
 coriander seeds 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.909
 how is pepper 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.999
 cinnamon 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.649
 and garlic I could do it in a 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:45.149
 container mix simple tones but not 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.219
 I want to do so in dirty and now 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.119
 you can do it easily we are going to 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.119
 put him of course salt 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.650

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.650
 work

 here I have peanut meat and I like 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.820

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.190
 begin to integrate flavors the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.630

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.750
 refrigerator do not put it immediately 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.480
 General 15 minutes at temperature 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.780
 environment environment this makes the meat 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.360
 relax a little and the pole also and 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.400

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.200
 marinated and give it that extra flavor that 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.270
 we need for today and also 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.920

 Meal rings do not finish me 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.180
 love they would prefer some delicious 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.290

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.650
 properly washed and disinfected or 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.650
 epazote 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.110
 and me when what I knew is no treatment 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.820
 put them in the center because I was 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.210
 burn very fast I try to put them in 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.730
 the banks and press 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.890

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.810
 we are going the cheese try to put it 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.580

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.170
 what do you know and with the options because I am 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.120
 very bad to be turning tortilla 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.129
