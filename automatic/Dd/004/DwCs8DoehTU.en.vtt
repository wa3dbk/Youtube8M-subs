get from cellphones and microwave ovens

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.080 
get from cellphones and microwave ovens
and<00:00:33.050> so<00:00:34.050> I'm<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> put<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
and so I'm going to put it on the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.729 
and so I'm going to put it on the
electric<00:00:36.090> setting<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.620> you're

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
electric setting and what you're

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.069 
electric setting and what you're
interested<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.460> top<00:00:38.760> scale<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.480> which

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
interested in is a top scale here which

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.900 
interested in is a top scale here which
shows<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.239> volt<00:00:42.829> meters<00:00:43.829> actually<00:00:44.520> we're

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
shows you the volt meters actually we're

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880 
shows you the volt meters actually we're
looking<00:00:45.270> anything<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.440> three<00:00:46.770> so

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
looking anything can be on three so

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.139 
looking anything can be on three so
actually<00:00:47.129> 30<00:00:47.340> because<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.640> multiply<00:00:47.760> by<00:00:48.120> 10

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
actually 30 because you multiply by 10

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.810 
actually 30 because you multiply by 10
but<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:49.170> watch<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.739> anything<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:50.670> out

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
but just watch here anything be out

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
but just watch here anything be out
beyond<00:00:51.300> three<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.980> considered<00:00:53.489> dangerous

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
beyond three is considered dangerous

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.770 
beyond three is considered dangerous
okay<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.350> I'm<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> switch<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.780> got

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
okay so I'm going to switch it on got

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.439 
okay so I'm going to switch it on got
zero<00:00:58.079> at<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> moment<00:00:58.350> switch<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.239> can

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
zero at the moment switch on and you can

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:09.080 
zero at the moment switch on and you can
see<00:01:00.980> that<00:01:03.080> we<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.739> reading<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:07.670> three<00:01:08.670> four

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
see that we have a reading of three four

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.660 
see that we have a reading of three four
five<00:01:09.540> about<00:01:10.049> five<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:12.140> okay<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.610> bring

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
five about five here okay and as I bring

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.830 
five about five here okay and as I bring
it<00:01:14.970> away<00:01:15.680> then<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.799> goes<00:01:16.979> down<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:18.600> ten

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
it away then it goes down for about ten

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.300 
it away then it goes down for about ten
centimeters<00:01:19.140> away<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.920> down<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.920> three<00:01:22.920> at
