00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.419 
create our registration page now the
registration<00:00:09.630> page<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.260> usually<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.130> first

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
registration page is usually the first

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.820 
registration page is usually the first
page<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> user<00:00:12.330> goes<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.809> whenever<00:00:13.650> they

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
page that the user goes to whenever they

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.980 
page that the user goes to whenever they
want<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.099> use<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.400> site<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.389> page<00:00:15.690> that

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
want to use the site it's the page that

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.480 
want to use the site it's the page that
allows<00:00:16.289> them<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.830> create<00:00:17.279> their<00:00:17.460> account

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
allows them to create their account

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.240 
allows them to create their account
choose<00:00:18.119> their<00:00:18.330> username<00:00:19.039> choose<00:00:20.039> their

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
choose their username choose their

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.370 
choose their username choose their
password<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.300> pretty<00:00:21.570> much<00:00:21.660> allows<00:00:22.080> them

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
password and it pretty much allows them

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.720 
password and it pretty much allows them
to<00:00:22.710> like<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.070> said<00:00:23.250> create<00:00:23.490> their<00:00:23.699> account

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
to like I said create their account

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.089 
to like I said create their account
because<00:00:24.390> they<00:00:24.900> need<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.560> create<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:25.949> account

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
because they need to create an account

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.460 
because they need to create an account
before<00:00:26.519> they<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.180> add<00:00:27.420> items<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.230> tread

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
before they can add items and tread

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.950 
before they can add items and tread
trade<00:00:29.070> items<00:00:29.490> make<00:00:29.699> offers<00:00:30.119> all<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.779> good

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
trade items make offers all that good

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.080 
trade items make offers all that good
stuff<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.439> let's<00:00:32.099> go<00:00:32.250> ahead<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.790> make<00:00:33.059> that

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
stuff so let's go ahead and make that

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.420 
stuff so let's go ahead and make that
first<00:00:33.540> well<00:00:34.290> technically<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.980> already<00:00:35.280> made

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
first well technically we already made

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.549 
first well technically we already made
index<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> would<00:00:36.630> consider<00:00:37.140> this

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
index but you know I would consider this

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.770 
index but you know I would consider this
a<00:00:37.620> page<00:00:38.040> yet<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.030> ahead<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.450> create<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.750> new

a page yet so go ahead and create a new
file<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.770> first<00:00:41.129> thing<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.760> want<00:00:42.000> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
guys about sessions and I'm gonna talk

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.149 
guys about sessions and I'm gonna talk
about<00:01:27.420> sessions<00:01:27.930> more<00:01:28.200> whenever<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.710> make<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
about sessions more whenever I make the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.999 
about sessions more whenever I make the
login<00:01:29.610> script<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> session<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.799> is

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
login script but what a session is is

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.050 
login script but what a session is is
it's<00:01:32.250> basically<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:33.119> temporary<00:01:34.490> well<00:01:35.490> session

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it's basically a temporary well session

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.660 
it's basically a temporary well session
basically<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.770> reason<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.310> want<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> make

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
basically and the reason we want to make

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.030 
basically and the reason we want to make
this<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.030> whenever<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> user<00:01:39.659> logs<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.530> we're

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
this is whenever the user logs in we're

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.160 
this is whenever the user logs in we're
gonna<00:01:41.130> give<00:01:41.490> them<00:01:41.700> an<00:01:41.939> identification<00:01:42.659> it's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
gonna give them an identification it's

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.319 
gonna give them an identification it's
pretty<00:01:43.380> much<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> variable<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.369> sticks<00:01:45.270> with

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
pretty much a variable that sticks with

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.870 
pretty much a variable that sticks with
that<00:01:45.570> user<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.610> pretty<00:01:47.759> much

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
that user now this is pretty much

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.510 
that user now this is pretty much
testing<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> user<00:01:49.140> logged<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.799> or<00:01:50.009> logged

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
testing is the user logged in or logged

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.090 
testing is the user logged in or logged
out<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:51.000> they<00:01:51.479> already<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.770> session

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
out if they already are on a session

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.569 
out if they already are on a session
that<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.689> means<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> users<00:01:55.979> logged<00:01:56.310> in

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
that that means that the users logged in

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.539 
that that means that the users logged in
so<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.509> user<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.930> logged<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:59.340> there's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
so if a user is logged in then there's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.300 
so if a user is logged in then there's
no<00:01:59.759> reason<00:02:00.240> they<00:02:00.390> would<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.920> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.189> this

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
no reason they would be going to this

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.069 
no reason they would be going to this
register<00:02:02.549> page<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.479> don't<00:02:03.689> need<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.930> register

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
if you're already logged into your

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.449 
if you're already logged into your
account<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.509> later<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.869> when<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.439> test<00:02:07.740> if<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
account so later on when we test if the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.130 
account so later on when we test if the
user<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.789> logged<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:09.360> not<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.840> then<00:02:09.989> we

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
user is logged in or not and then we

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
user is logged in or not and then we
already<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.739> session<00:02:11.129> started<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.730> we

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
already have that session started and we

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.140 
already have that session started and we
can<00:02:12.120> say<00:02:12.270> something<00:02:12.660> like<00:02:12.810> if

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
can say something like if

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.940 
can say something like if
the<00:02:13.239> users<00:02:13.540> logged<00:02:13.720> in<00:02:13.959> already<00:02:14.470> then<00:02:14.709> just

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
the users logged in already then just

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.350 
the users logged in already then just
take<00:02:15.129> them<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.310> their<00:02:15.519> account<00:02:15.849> page<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:16.329> for

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
take them to their account page but for

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.759 
take them to their account page but for
now<00:02:16.599> I'm<00:02:16.810> just<00:02:16.840> going<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.140> include<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:17.739> I

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
now I'm just going to include that so I

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.440 
now I'm just going to include that so I
don't<00:02:17.980> forget<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.250> later<00:02:18.459> on<00:02:18.549> and<00:02:18.849> if<00:02:19.239> all<00:02:19.420> that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
don't forget it later on and if all that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.149 
don't forget it later on and if all that
confuse<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:20.079> guys<00:02:20.260> then<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.799> pretend<00:02:21.129> I

what we wanted to do is we want to
include<00:02:27.549> that<00:02:27.879> connection<00:02:28.269> file<00:02:28.629> to<00:02:28.989> connect

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
include that connection file to connect

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.440 
include that connection file to connect
the<00:02:29.530> database<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.640> reason<00:02:30.939> for<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.120> is

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
the database and the reason for that is

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.929 
the database and the reason for that is
whenever<00:02:32.019> they<00:02:32.470> choose<00:02:32.500> their<00:02:33.159> username<00:02:33.700> and

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
whenever they choose their username and

password their username and email what
we<00:02:37.420> want<00:02:37.599> to<00:02:37.720> do<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:38.049> we<00:02:38.290> want<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.879> query<00:02:39.879> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
we want to do is we want to query the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.759 
we want to do is we want to query the
database<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.569> make<00:02:40.900> sure<00:02:41.019> no<00:02:41.260> one<00:02:41.379> else<00:02:41.500> has

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
database and make sure no one else has

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.369 
database and make sure no one else has
that<00:02:41.799> username<00:02:42.459> or<00:02:42.700> email<00:02:43.269> yet<00:02:43.720> if<00:02:43.900> they<00:02:44.319> do

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
that username or email yet if they do

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.080 
that username or email yet if they do
then<00:02:44.799> they<00:02:44.950> can't<00:02:45.190> like<00:02:45.400> take<00:02:45.609> it<00:02:45.670> from<00:02:45.970> them

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
then they can't like take it from them

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.220 
then they can't like take it from them
you<00:02:46.180> can<00:02:46.209> have<00:02:46.450> two<00:02:46.599> people<00:02:46.720> with<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.019> same

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
you can have two people with the same

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.830 
you can have two people with the same
username<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:48.250> that's<00:02:48.549> why<00:02:48.700> we<00:02:49.000> are<00:02:49.030> including

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
username so that's why we are including

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.020 
username so that's why we are including
this<00:02:50.290> connection<00:02:50.709> file<00:02:50.889> at<00:02:51.010> all<00:02:51.099> so<00:02:51.670> in<00:02:51.879> order

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
this connection file at all so in order

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.390 
this connection file at all so in order
to<00:02:52.450> include<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.930> file<00:02:53.319> just<00:02:53.440> go<00:02:53.680> ahead<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.220> type

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
include which is a built-in function and

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.879

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.890 
go ahead and type the name of your file
now<00:02:59.889> remember<00:03:00.370> first<00:03:01.359> of<00:03:01.540> all<00:03:01.689> this

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
now remember first of all this

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.809 
now remember first of all this
connection<00:03:02.470> file<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.370> different

connection file is in a different

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.569 
connection file is in a different
directory<00:03:04.269> so<00:03:04.480> we<00:03:04.599> need<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.900> go<00:03:05.019> ahead<00:03:05.079> and<00:03:05.579> put
