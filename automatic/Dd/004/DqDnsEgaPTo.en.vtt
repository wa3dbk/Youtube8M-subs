00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
reviewed I've double-checked it to look

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.549 
reviewed I've double-checked it to look
at<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.270> did<00:00:42.450> make<00:00:42.629> some<00:00:42.660> mistakes<00:00:43.170> going

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
at it I did make some mistakes going

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.940 
at it I did make some mistakes going
through<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> build<00:00:44.210> but<00:00:45.590> got<00:00:46.590> everything

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
through the build but got everything

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.529 
through the build but got everything
corrected<00:00:47.489> according<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> instructions

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
corrected according to the instructions

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.319 
corrected according to the instructions
and<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.899> actually<00:00:49.050> has<00:00:49.730> extra<00:00:50.730> pieces<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.149> got

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and it actually has extra pieces you got

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.850 
and it actually has extra pieces you got
eight<00:00:51.870> extra<00:00:52.559> pieces<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.250> I've<00:00:53.430> never<00:00:53.760> had<00:00:54.860> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
eight extra pieces and I've never had a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.459 
eight extra pieces and I've never had a
set<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.879> extra<00:00:57.180> pieces<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.870> may<00:00:58.109> not

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
set with extra pieces but it may not

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.470 
set with extra pieces but it may not
necessarily<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:59.280> extra<00:01:00.000> though<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.329> doesn't

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
necessarily be extra though it doesn't

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.150 
necessarily be extra though it doesn't
so<00:01:00.719> show<00:01:00.960> them<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> instructions<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.010> may

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
so show them on the instructions it may

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.729 
so show them on the instructions it may
be<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.699> making<00:01:03.030> your<00:01:03.210> little<00:01:03.510> critters<00:01:04.470> fly

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
be for making your little critters fly

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.140 
be for making your little critters fly
your<00:01:05.070> Ultron's<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.150> his<00:01:07.310> other<00:01:08.310> versions<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
your Ultron's and his other versions of

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.660 
your Ultron's and his other versions of
him<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.270> repulsor<00:01:12.810> rays<00:01:13.670> basically

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
him so this the repulsor rays basically

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.749 
him so this the repulsor rays basically
for<00:01:14.880> Ultron<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.040> used<00:01:17.280> some<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> them<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.729> my

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
for Ultron so I used some of them on my

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.820 
for Ultron so I used some of them on my
sigfig<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> pretty<00:01:19.500> neat<00:01:19.710> little

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
sigfig there it's a pretty neat little

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:31.169 
sigfig there it's a pretty neat little
throne<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:22.700> little<00:01:23.700> crooked

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.669 

there<00:01:32.179> was<00:01:32.390> some<00:01:32.659> parts<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.079> this<00:01:33.229> that<00:01:33.289> were

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
there was some parts of this that were

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:41.099 
there was some parts of this that were
kind<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:34.009> hard<00:01:34.189> to<00:01:34.280> build<00:01:39.069> hold<00:01:40.069> on<00:01:40.189> a<00:01:40.219> minute

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
kind of hard to build hold on a minute

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.380 
kind of hard to build hold on a minute
the<00:01:42.109> piece<00:01:42.319> is<00:01:42.500> kind<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.829> just<00:01:42.979> floating<00:01:43.549> there

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.410 

there<00:01:47.890> all<00:01:48.890> right<00:01:49.009> so<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.759> just<00:01:49.789> hang<00:01:50.179> it<00:01:50.299> on

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
there all right so you just hang it on

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.599 
there all right so you just hang it on
right<00:01:50.929> there<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.810> basically<00:01:54.130> there's<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.459> get

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
right there so basically there's you get

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.849 
right there so basically there's you get
little<00:01:58.270> fires<00:01:59.270> right<00:01:59.689> there<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.380> is<00:02:00.439> kind<00:02:00.799> of

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
little fires right there this is kind of

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.099 
little fires right there this is kind of
an<00:02:00.979> angled<00:02:01.369> build<00:02:01.640> they<00:02:02.450> use<00:02:02.599> these<00:02:02.780> clear

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
an angled build they use these clear

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.619 
an angled build they use these clear
pieces<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.860> simulate<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.939> flying<00:02:05.299> that's

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:05.629 
pieces to simulate the flying that's

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:07.809 
pieces to simulate the flying that's
what<00:02:05.750> these<00:02:05.869> are<00:02:05.929> for<00:02:06.129> there's<00:02:07.129> another<00:02:07.399> 1<00:02:07.640> by

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
what these are for there's another 1 by

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.300 
what these are for there's another 1 by
1<00:02:08.030> round<00:02:08.209> piece<00:02:08.539> up<00:02:08.810> here<00:02:08.920> for<00:02:09.920> this<00:02:10.099> little

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
1 round piece up here for this little

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.119 
1 round piece up here for this little
ultron's<00:02:10.970> line<00:02:14.079> you<00:02:15.079> get<00:02:15.260> for<00:02:15.769> minifigures

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
ultron's line you get for minifigures

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.580 
ultron's line you get for minifigures
which<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.849> a<00:02:16.879> lot<00:02:17.269> for<00:02:17.569> a<00:02:17.629> San<00:02:17.930> Diego<00:02:18.049> common

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
which is a lot for a San Diego common

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.650 
which is a lot for a San Diego common
comic-con<00:02:19.280> set<00:02:19.760> but<00:02:20.060> they're<00:02:20.239> pretty<00:02:20.510> much

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
comic-con set but they're pretty much

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.110 
comic-con set but they're pretty much
you<00:02:21.019> know<00:02:21.140> not<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.920> really<00:02:22.190> exclusive<00:02:22.489> I<00:02:22.910> don't

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
you know not a really exclusive I don't

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.470 
you know not a really exclusive I don't
think<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:24.049> get<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.379> three<00:02:25.150> Ultron's<00:02:26.150> and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
think you get the three Ultron's and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.660 
think you get the three Ultron's and
then<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:27.079> put<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:27.650> lift<00:02:27.859> his<00:02:28.010> repulsor<00:02:28.489> rays

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
then the I put I lift his repulsor rays

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.089 
then the I put I lift his repulsor rays
they<00:02:28.819> actually<00:02:29.090> show<00:02:29.269> them<00:02:29.390> without<00:02:29.780> them

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
they actually show them without them

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.410 
they actually show them without them
