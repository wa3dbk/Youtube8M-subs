00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
I don't just get in and swim up and down

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.719 
I don't just get in and swim up and down
for<00:01:36.079> two<00:01:36.110> hours<00:01:36.530> we<00:01:36.770> don't<00:01:36.950> unfortunately<00:01:37.340> get

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
for two hours we don't unfortunately get

to<00:01:37.850> listen<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.210> music<00:01:38.299> but<00:01:39.079> I<00:01:39.109> do<00:01:39.259> listen<00:01:39.380> to

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
to listen to music but I do listen to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.830 
to listen to music but I do listen to
music<00:01:39.649> outside<00:01:40.180> outside<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.479> swimming<00:01:41.719> pool

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
music outside outside the swimming pool

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.359 
music outside outside the swimming pool
and<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.049> gym<00:01:42.289> we<00:01:42.530> do<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.710> lot<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:42.920> gym<00:01:43.130> as<00:01:43.219> well

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
and the gym we do a lot of gym as well

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.209 
and the gym we do a lot of gym as well
so<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:44.149> kind<00:01:44.359> of<00:01:44.420> gives<00:01:44.600> us<00:01:44.719> a<00:01:44.750> bit<00:01:44.960> more

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
so it kind of gives us a bit more

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.440 
so it kind of gives us a bit more
momentum<00:01:46.219> and<00:01:46.340> we<00:01:46.520> do<00:01:46.609> a<00:01:46.640> lot<00:01:46.789> of<00:01:46.820> traveling<00:01:47.270> so

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
momentum and we do a lot of traveling so

did<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:18.950> bear<00:03:19.550> gymnastics<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.330> I<00:03:20.390> did<00:03:20.540> follow

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
did to bear gymnastics and I did follow

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.380 
did to bear gymnastics and I did follow
her<00:03:20.989> but<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:21.830> hated<00:03:22.130> it<00:03:22.459> I'm<00:03:22.820> not<00:03:23.000> very<00:03:23.180> flexible

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
her but I hated it I'm not very flexible

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.449 
her but I hated it I'm not very flexible
so<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:23.930> didn't<00:03:24.380> like<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.650> lady<00:03:24.800> shouting<00:03:25.220> at<00:03:25.340> me

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
so I didn't like the lady shouting at me

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.210 
so I didn't like the lady shouting at me
every<00:03:25.880> day<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.840> try<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.050> stretch<00:03:27.800> my<00:03:27.980> legs<00:03:28.160> a

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
every day to try and stretch my legs a

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.290 
every day to try and stretch my legs a
bit<00:03:28.310> further<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:28.700> because<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:28.940> just<00:03:28.970> couldn't

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
bit further to because I just couldn't

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.940 
bit further to because I just couldn't
do<00:03:29.540> it

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
do it

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.530 
do it
and<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.550> did<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:30.700> bit<00:03:30.849> of<00:03:30.880> netball<00:03:31.209> which<00:03:31.420> I

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
and I did a bit of netball which I

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.089 
and I did a bit of netball which I
absolutely<00:03:31.720> loved<00:03:32.080> but<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.500> soon<00:03:32.709> realized

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
absolutely loved but I soon realized

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.030 
absolutely loved but I soon realized
that<00:03:33.310> my<00:03:33.970> forte<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:34.750> life<00:03:34.959> was<00:03:35.230> swimming<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.830> I

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
that my forte in life was swimming and I

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.470 
that my forte in life was swimming and I
literally<00:03:36.370> can't<00:03:36.640> do<00:03:36.730> anything<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:37.000> can't<00:03:37.270> run

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
literally can't do anything I can't run

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.900 
literally can't do anything I can't run
I<00:03:37.510> can't<00:03:37.840> throw<00:03:38.110> I<00:03:38.140> can't<00:03:38.440> catch<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.010> yeah

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
I can't throw I can't catch so yeah

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.030 
I can't throw I can't catch so yeah
swimming<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:40.330> pretty<00:03:40.569> much<00:03:40.750> what<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.560> wanted<00:03:41.890> to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
swimming is pretty much what I wanted to

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.550 
swimming is pretty much what I wanted to
do<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.400> sort<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.239> found<00:03:43.810> me<00:03:44.050> as<00:03:44.200> well<00:03:44.349> as<00:03:44.470> I

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
do and sort of found me as well as I

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.160 
do and sort of found me as well as I
found<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.640> this<00:03:48.910> is<00:03:49.120> for<00:03:49.150> race<00:03:49.870> based

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
found it and this is for race based

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.510 
found it and this is for race based
coaching<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:52.230> kind<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.440> have<00:03:53.590> considered<00:03:54.100> doing

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
coaching I kind of have considered doing

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.570 
coaching I kind of have considered doing
some<00:03:54.970> triathlons<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.860> swimming<00:03:57.130> part<00:03:57.280> of<00:03:57.459> it

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
some triathlons the swimming part of it

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.250 
some triathlons the swimming part of it
is<00:03:57.819> it's<00:03:58.150> obviously<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.660> bit<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:58.959> love

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
is it's obviously the bit that I love

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.530 
is it's obviously the bit that I love
but<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.860> literally<00:04:00.280> cannot<00:04:00.790> run<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.239> save<00:04:01.390> my

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
but I literally cannot run to save my

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.979 
but I literally cannot run to save my
life

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
life

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.020 
life
so<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.860> would<00:04:03.010> be<00:04:03.160> quite<00:04:03.489> embarrassing<00:04:03.640> I

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
so it would be quite embarrassing I

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.610 
so it would be quite embarrassing I
think<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:04.450> you<00:04:04.720> may<00:04:04.930> come<00:04:05.140> out<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.440> water

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
think so you may come out of the water

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.640 
think so you may come out of the water
and<00:04:05.860> then<00:04:05.980> have<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.430> run<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:07.420> myself<00:04:08.260> and

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
and then have to run and myself and

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.930 
and then have to run and myself and
bikes<00:04:08.860> don't<00:04:09.220> have<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.549> best<00:04:09.760> of

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
bikes don't have the best of

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.820 
bikes don't have the best of
relationship<00:04:10.480> as<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:10.930> broke<00:04:11.260> my<00:04:11.440> arm<00:04:11.470> when<00:04:11.799> I

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
relationship as I broke my arm when I

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.530 
relationship as I broke my arm when I
fell<00:04:12.160> off<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.340> bike<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.549> couple<00:04:12.910> years<00:04:13.090> ago<00:04:13.180> I

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
fell off the bike a couple years ago I

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.270 
fell off the bike a couple years ago I
think<00:04:13.840> when<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:14.170> retire<00:04:14.590> swimming<00:04:14.980> and

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
think when I retire swimming and

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.979 
think when I retire swimming and
obviously<00:04:15.880> there's<00:04:16.120> no<00:04:16.299> worry<00:04:16.540> if<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:16.780> break

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
obviously there's no worry if I break

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.860 
obviously there's no worry if I break
any<00:04:17.200> bones<00:04:17.380> for<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.859> but<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.479> probably<00:04:19.479> will

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
any bones for that but I probably will

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.120 
any bones for that but I probably will
go<00:04:20.049> into<00:04:20.200> maybe<00:04:20.470> doing<00:04:20.769> a<00:04:20.829> couple<00:04:21.070> of

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
go into maybe doing a couple of

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.950 
go into maybe doing a couple of
triathlons<00:04:21.639> but<00:04:21.910> like<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:22.150> said<00:04:22.389> running

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
triathlons but like I said running

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.650 
triathlons but like I said running
really<00:04:23.260> isn't<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.830> greatest<00:04:24.070> thing<00:04:24.340> and

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
really isn't the greatest thing and

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.730 
really isn't the greatest thing and
generally<00:04:25.660> when<00:04:25.840> you're

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
you know not even just a

high-performance athlete and athlete in
general<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.550> are<00:04:30.699> really<00:04:30.940> competitive<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.660> I

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
general you are really competitive and I

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.999 
general you are really competitive and I
know<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:32.110> if<00:04:32.229> I<00:04:32.349> wasn't<00:04:32.530> good<00:04:32.740> at<00:04:32.800> something

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
know that if I wasn't good at something

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.969 
know that if I wasn't good at something
it<00:04:33.280> would<00:04:33.400> frustrate<00:04:33.610> me<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:34.740> yeah<00:04:35.740> we'll<00:04:35.889> have

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
it would frustrate me so yeah we'll have

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.610 
it would frustrate me so yeah we'll have
to<00:04:36.099> see<00:04:36.250> how<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.460> goes
