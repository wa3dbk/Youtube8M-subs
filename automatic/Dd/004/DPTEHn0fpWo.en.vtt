00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.240
 hello yes 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.920
 water we are pleased at 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.860
 you have on 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.110
 you are the world you ask us 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.480
 we all try to get you faster on them 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.360
 answer and here are a few questions 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.529
 Itâ€™s about why the leaves turn yellow 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.869
 different cultures 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.860
 here I will give this case we have 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:33.510
 here's the eggplant leaves 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:38.500
 yellowish color on them here here 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.879
 such a yellow river tackle can be said 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.489
 yes on the leaves of cucumber leaves sometimes 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.650
 yellow here, too, look at the leaves 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.050
 sometimes yellows of course from fungal 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.460
 diseases 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.680
 but there may still be a shortage 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.450
 trace elements in particular iron and here 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.870
 very good drug which 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:05.770
 iron deficiency compensates for this ferro species 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.320
 I already use it many times and I see 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.670
 what a good result is obtained here 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.799
 here on eggplants I already rule such 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.170
 spraying were yellow leaves you 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.960
 you know and whether it is new and just anyway 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.270
 not with some yellow chic were walking here 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.330
 after i processed the ferrari there 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.970
 new leaves went here beautiful 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.229
 look green good gain and 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.420
 turned out how to use it 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:39.640
 there are instructions on the bag here 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:44.290
 such an ampoule here with you and a half 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.900
 in my or liter company places m here 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.659
 here it says company in stm see 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.680
 please not to buy a fake and 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:58.330
 per liter of water dissolves now i 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.780
 open on a liter of water dissolves this 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.479
 top dressing not root but on leaves 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.810
 she is given here I will put a pit here too 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.119
 here 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.950
 certainly better not to do well in 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.560
 a little water first 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.099
 shake well and then 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.140
 to bring to the liter but I just have to 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.640
 do not spend time in front of the camera 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.320
 here we are good right now 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.600
 shake it to dissolve 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:34.710
 look here it turns out such a liquid 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.030
 this chemistry no trace elements 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.400
 eat fruit here you see 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.890
 eggplant life here began 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.930
 frills, too, we have and it is not dangerous 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.740
 process better food back side 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.300
 leaf is better to do it either in the early morning 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.880
 either pm 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.390
 Well, from above, you can also just sprinkle 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.940
 the back of the sheet there is absorbent 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.860
 abilities gadfly wrong side she higher and 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.420
 also on cucumber please 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.240
 sprinkle but I won't do it now 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.050
 it's on all plants because we have with 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.780
 you day bright sun I'll wait for the evening 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:21.280
 all the preparations that you prepare better 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:24.220
 all the same day and use i 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.270
 in the evening that I will sprinkle and 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:31.690
 such procedures can be carried out two three 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.440
 times with an interval of about ten days and 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.930
 you your plants will get your portion 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.250
 the missing iron and there will be such 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.750
 here are the good ones 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.750
 green leaves
