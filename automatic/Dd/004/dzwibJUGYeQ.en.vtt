00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.280 
really important feature in my opinion
which<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.369> layer<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> micro<00:01:36.150> coils<00:01:36.540> micro

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
which is the layer of micro coils micro

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.050 
which is the layer of micro coils micro
coils<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> one<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.250> half<00:01:38.460> inch<00:01:38.729> coil

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
coils is a one and a half inch coil

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
coils is a one and a half inch coil
system<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.930> actually<00:01:40.470> built<00:01:40.710> into<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
system that is actually built into the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.920 
system that is actually built into the
comfort<00:01:41.729> padding<00:01:42.090> layers<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:42.450> essentially

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
comfort padding layers which essentially

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
comfort padding layers which essentially
doubles<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.380> coil<00:01:43.619> count<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.040> mattress

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
doubles the coil count of the mattress

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.580 
doubles the coil count of the mattress
and<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.119> allows<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.570> mattress<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.990> contour<00:01:46.500> to
