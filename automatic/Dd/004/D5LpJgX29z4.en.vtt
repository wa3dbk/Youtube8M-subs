if<00:00:15.610> you<00:00:15.880> hone<00:00:16.090> these<00:00:16.270> more<00:00:16.539> frequently<00:00:20.880> you

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
if you hone these more frequently you

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.609 
if you hone these more frequently you
won't<00:00:22.060> have<00:00:22.210> to<00:00:22.390> do<00:00:22.570> this<00:00:22.750> quite<00:00:23.050> so<00:00:23.259> much<00:00:23.380> and

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
won't have to do this quite so much and

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.850 
won't have to do this quite so much and
it<00:00:23.680> won't<00:00:23.860> be<00:00:24.210> as<00:00:25.210> much<00:00:25.599> work<00:00:25.869> to<00:00:26.650> sharpen<00:00:27.040> them

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
it won't be as much work to sharpen them

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:46.630 
it won't be as much work to sharpen them
let's<00:00:29.860> go<00:00:30.040> back

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.570 

let's<00:00:47.640> see<00:00:47.760> what<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.940> does<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.330> us<00:00:48.630> oh<00:00:49.580> that's

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
let's see what that does to us oh that's

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.880 
let's see what that does to us oh that's
much<00:00:50.760> better<00:00:54.260> they'll<00:00:55.260> shave<00:00:55.530> off<00:00:55.740> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
much better they'll shave off the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.060 
much better they'll shave off the
surface<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.370> my<00:00:56.490> fingernail<00:00:56.940> now<00:00:58.070> that's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
surface of my fingernail now that's

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.330 
surface of my fingernail now that's
starting<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.400> get<00:00:59.550> pretty<00:00:59.850> pretty<00:01:00.540> sharp<00:01:00.809> now

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
starting to get pretty pretty sharp now

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.240 
starting to get pretty pretty sharp now
flip<00:01:02.340> around<00:01:03.020> same<00:01:04.020> operation<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> other

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
flip around same operation on the other

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:24.010 
flip around same operation on the other
side<00:01:12.590> there<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:13.710> back<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> same<00:01:15.020> angle

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.820 

starting<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:27.470> we<00:01:28.470> turn<00:01:28.680> this

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
starting to get there we turn this

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.260 
starting to get there we turn this
around<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.250> little<00:01:29.280> bit<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.970> that's

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
want to do is test to see how close the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.360 
want to do is test to see how close the
jaws<00:02:16.580> come<00:02:17.860> if<00:02:18.860> we<00:02:19.370> have<00:02:19.640> any<00:02:19.849> gaps<00:02:20.860> let's<00:02:21.860> see

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
can see notice where those filings are I

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.469 
can see notice where those filings are I
should<00:04:32.130> have<00:04:32.460> come<00:04:32.639> pretty<00:04:32.820> close<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.300> doing

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
should have come pretty close to doing

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:44.960 
should have come pretty close to doing
what<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.750> wanted<00:04:40.699> okay<00:04:41.699> one<00:04:42.060> blow<00:04:42.600> that<00:04:42.780> off<00:04:43.970> now

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
what I wanted okay one blow that off now

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:54.560 
what I wanted okay one blow that off now
let's<00:04:45.240> take<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.449> look<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:45.840> see<00:04:53.419> it's<00:04:54.419> much

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
let's take a look and see it's much

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
let's take a look and see it's much
better<00:04:55.280> much<00:04:56.280> better<00:04:56.310> getting<00:04:57.300> there<00:05:00.590> all

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
better much better getting there all
