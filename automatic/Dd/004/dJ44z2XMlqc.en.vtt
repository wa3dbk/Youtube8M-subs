we're showing and possibly the engine
mountains<00:04:17.950> as<00:04:18.100> well<00:04:18.900> when<00:04:19.900> we<00:04:19.989> were<00:04:20.049> looking

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
mountains as well when we were looking

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
mountains as well when we were looking
on<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.410> ramp<00:04:20.590> we<00:04:20.739> were<00:04:20.830> looking<00:04:21.010> at<00:04:21.100> the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
on the ramp we were looking at the

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.420 
on the ramp we were looking at the
brakes<00:04:21.400> as<00:04:21.609> well<00:04:22.800> sort<00:04:23.800> of<00:04:23.860> feeling<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.340> they

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
brakes as well sort of feeling that they

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.800 
brakes as well sort of feeling that they
were<00:04:24.490> stiff<00:04:24.760> on<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:24.970> one<00:04:25.120> so<00:04:25.270> if<00:04:25.390> I<00:04:25.480> just<00:04:25.660> apply

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
were stiff on the one so if I just apply

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.570 
were stiff on the one so if I just apply
the<00:04:26.020> brakes<00:04:26.260> very<00:04:26.530> slowly<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:26.950> can<00:04:27.100> sort<00:04:27.520> of

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
the brakes very slowly you can sort of

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.300 
the brakes very slowly you can sort of
spill<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.970> car<00:04:28.180> sort<00:04:28.420> of<00:04:28.510> drift<00:04:28.720> on<00:04:28.870> one<00:04:28.990> side

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
spill the car sort of drift on one side

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
spill the car sort of drift on one side
indicating<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.550> brakes<00:04:30.790> are<00:04:31.000> sort<00:04:31.300> of

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
indicating that the brakes are sort of

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330 
indicating that the brakes are sort of
snatching<00:04:31.630> a<00:04:31.780> little<00:04:31.960> bit<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:32.650> that's<00:04:33.040> sort<00:04:33.280> of

Jenny<00:05:05.440> I'll<00:05:05.710> pick<00:05:05.950> them<00:05:06.070> up<00:05:06.190> when<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.370> was<00:05:06.460> on

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
Jenny I'll pick them up when I was on

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.880 
Jenny I'll pick them up when I was on
underneath<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.150> ramp<00:05:07.330> doing<00:05:07.570> an<00:05:07.630> inspection

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
underneath the ramp doing an inspection

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.530 
underneath the ramp doing an inspection
but<00:05:08.890> obviously<00:05:09.430> I<00:05:09.490> most<00:05:09.970> of<00:05:10.090> all<00:05:10.180> I<00:05:10.210> picked<00:05:10.480> up

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
but obviously I most of all I picked up

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.790 
but obviously I most of all I picked up
when<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.750> was<00:05:10.840> on<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:11.020> test<00:05:11.230> drive<00:05:11.380> you<00:05:11.650> again

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
when I was on the test drive you again

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.990 
when I was on the test drive you again
tend<00:05:12.070> to<00:05:12.130> get<00:05:12.220> a<00:05:12.280> lot<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.520> shudders<00:05:12.820> through

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
tend to get a lot of shudders through

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.220 
tend to get a lot of shudders through
the<00:05:13.060> front<00:05:13.300> when<00:05:13.600> you<00:05:13.720> go<00:05:13.810> over<00:05:13.960> some<00:05:14.110> small

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
the front when you go over some small

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.030 
the front when you go over some small
bumps<00:05:15.720> generally<00:05:16.720> you<00:05:16.870> would<00:05:16.990> change<00:05:17.230> the<00:05:17.590> ng

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
bumps generally you would change the ng

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.070 
bumps generally you would change the ng
mountains<00:05:18.460> at<00:05:18.669> at<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.060> same<00:05:19.240> time<00:05:19.510> so<00:05:19.990> it's

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
mountains at at the same time so it's

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.890 
mountains at at the same time so it's
like<00:05:20.230> a<00:05:20.260> set<00:05:20.530> of<00:05:20.680> six<00:05:21.090> is<00:05:22.090> that<00:05:22.450> a<00:05:22.480> big<00:05:22.660> job

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
like a set of six is that a big job

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.720 
like a set of six is that a big job
generally<00:05:23.560> around<00:05:23.740> three<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.190> four<00:05:24.220> hours<00:05:24.700> to

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
generally around three to four hours to

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.830 
generally around three to four hours to
change<00:05:24.970> something<00:05:25.180> like<00:05:25.270> that<00:05:25.450> but<00:05:25.600> it<00:05:25.660> does

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
change something like that but it does

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.840 
change something like that but it does
transform<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.830> front<00:05:27.100> nose<00:05:27.370> of<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.610> cars

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
transform the front nose of the cars

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.480 
transform the front nose of the cars
over<00:05:28.600> sort<00:05:28.780> of<00:05:28.840> 25<00:05:29.320> years<00:05:29.530> to<00:05:29.830> deteriorate<00:05:30.340> it

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
over sort of 25 years to deteriorate it

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.760 
over sort of 25 years to deteriorate it
very<00:05:30.669> slowly<00:05:30.970> so<00:05:31.660> once<00:05:31.990> we<00:05:32.169> get<00:05:32.290> those<00:05:32.440> change

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
very slowly so once we get those change

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.200 
very slowly so once we get those change
you<00:05:32.890> do<00:05:33.040> fine<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:33.430> just<00:05:33.520> make<00:05:33.730> quite<00:05:33.910> a<00:05:33.970> bit<00:05:34.120> of

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
you do fine and just make quite a bit of

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.730 
you do fine and just make quite a bit of
a<00:05:34.270> difference<00:05:34.630> so<00:05:34.690> probably<00:05:35.290> worth<00:05:35.470> getting

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
a difference so probably worth getting

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.250 
a difference so probably worth getting
those<00:05:35.919> done<00:05:36.160> really<00:05:36.570> you<00:05:37.570> did<00:05:37.750> point<00:05:37.990> out<00:05:38.140> that

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
those done really you did point out that

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.710 
those done really you did point out that
you<00:05:38.350> were<00:05:38.440> going<00:05:38.560> to<00:05:38.620> do<00:05:38.680> on<00:05:38.830> some<00:05:39.070> sort<00:05:39.310> of

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
you were going to do on some sort of

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.540 
you were going to do on some sort of
continental<00:05:41.160> driving<00:05:42.160> so<00:05:42.310> you're<00:05:42.400> going<00:05:42.520> to

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
continental driving so you're going to

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.159 
continental driving so you're going to
do<00:05:42.669> a<00:05:42.700> few<00:05:42.880> miles<00:05:43.120> in<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.419> car<00:05:43.600> probably<00:05:44.050> with

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
do a few miles in the car probably with

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.689 
do a few miles in the car probably with
some<00:05:44.320> hot<00:05:44.890> climates<00:05:45.370> as<00:05:45.490> well

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
some hot climates as well

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.850 
some hot climates as well
there's<00:05:47.210> a<00:05:47.270> few<00:05:47.509> linked<00:05:47.839> pipe<00:05:48.110> that<00:05:48.319> links<00:05:48.680> the

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
there's a few linked pipe that links the

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.489 
there's a few linked pipe that links the
filter<00:05:49.309> etc<00:05:49.849> at<00:05:49.909> the<00:05:49.999> back<00:05:50.180> is<00:05:50.689> quite<00:05:50.960> rusty

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:51.499 
filter etc at the back is quite rusty

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.129 
filter etc at the back is quite rusty
doesn't<00:05:51.919> need<00:05:52.159> sort<00:05:52.400> of<00:05:52.430> replace<00:05:53.029> it<00:05:53.240> by<00:05:53.839> vice

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
doesn't need sort of replace it by vice

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.929 
doesn't need sort of replace it by vice
to<00:05:54.349> get<00:05:54.499> that<00:05:54.619> replaced<00:05:54.860> if<00:05:55.490> it<00:05:55.610> was<00:05:55.789> to

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:55.939 
to get that replaced if it was to

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.659 
to get that replaced if it was to
fracture<00:05:56.389> it<00:05:57.159> probably<00:05:58.159> going<00:05:58.279> to<00:05:58.339> lose<00:05:58.430> quite

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
fracture it probably going to lose quite

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.279 
fracture it probably going to lose quite
a<00:05:58.699> bit<00:05:58.879> of<00:05:58.969> your<00:05:59.059> fuel<00:05:59.300> that's<00:05:59.839> quite<00:06:00.080> a<00:06:00.110> bit

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
a bit of your fuel that's quite a bit

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:01.689 
a bit of your fuel that's quite a bit
all<00:06:00.409> right<00:06:00.589> okay<00:06:00.889> I'll<00:06:01.069> be<00:06:01.189> a<00:06:01.219> bit<00:06:01.550> of<00:06:01.639> a

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 
all right okay I'll be a bit of a

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:02.049 
all right okay I'll be a bit of a
problem

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:02.059 
problem

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:04.629 
problem
yeah<00:06:02.330> so<00:06:02.659> that<00:06:03.229> needs<00:06:03.439> doing<00:06:03.619> another<00:06:04.430> one<00:06:04.580> as

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
yeah so that needs doing another one as

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.999 
yeah so that needs doing another one as
well<00:06:04.699> is<00:06:05.059> a<00:06:05.089> rear<00:06:05.599> prop<00:06:06.139> shaft<00:06:06.319> couple<00:06:06.800> it<00:06:06.860> on

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
well is a rear prop shaft couple it on

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.850 
well is a rear prop shaft couple it on
the<00:06:07.279> back<00:06:07.839> you<00:06:08.839> got<00:06:08.960> to<00:06:09.199> sort<00:06:09.379> of<00:06:09.469> couplings

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
the back you got to sort of couplings

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.510 
the back you got to sort of couplings
that<00:06:09.979> sit<00:06:10.159> on<00:06:10.189> the<00:06:10.399> back<00:06:10.550> of<00:06:11.360> the<00:06:11.449> prop<00:06:11.629> shaft

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
that sit on the back of the prop shaft

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.409 
that sit on the back of the prop shaft
it's<00:06:13.520> one<00:06:13.639> of<00:06:13.699> the<00:06:13.759> front<00:06:13.969> one<00:06:14.119> at<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:14.300> back

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
it's one of the front one at the back

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.749 
it's one of the front one at the back
and<00:06:14.719> the<00:06:15.169> back<00:06:15.319> once<00:06:15.499> all<00:06:15.649> cracked<00:06:15.949> it's<00:06:16.550> got

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
and the back once all cracked it's got

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.219 
and the back once all cracked it's got
some<00:06:16.939> paralleling<00:06:17.479> cracks<00:06:17.749> that<00:06:17.930> are<00:06:18.020> coming

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
some paralleling cracks that are coming

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:23.379 
some paralleling cracks that are coming
in<00:06:18.319> it<00:06:18.439> quite<00:06:18.529> badly<00:06:18.770> so<00:06:21.129> I'd<00:06:22.129> advise<00:06:22.759> and<00:06:23.210> sort

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
in it quite badly so I'd advise and sort

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:24.909 
in it quite badly so I'd advise and sort
of<00:06:23.449> get<00:06:23.599> in<00:06:23.689> that<00:06:23.719> replaced<00:06:24.110> as<00:06:24.289> well<00:06:24.319> again<00:06:24.770> is

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
of get in that replaced as well again is

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.409 
of get in that replaced as well again is
that<00:06:25.069> is<00:06:25.189> that<00:06:25.370> effect<00:06:26.029> the<00:06:26.149> sort<00:06:26.389> of

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
that is that effect the sort of

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.209 
that is that effect the sort of
potential<00:06:26.749> safety<00:06:27.080> or<00:06:27.409> integrity<00:06:27.649> of<00:06:27.979> the<00:06:28.039> car

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
potential safety or integrity of the car

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:29.709 
potential safety or integrity of the car
with<00:06:28.969> the<00:06:29.059> miles<00:06:29.300> that<00:06:29.389> you're<00:06:29.569> probably

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:29.719 
with the miles that you're probably

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:31.959 
with the miles that you're probably
intending<00:06:30.229> gonna<00:06:30.409> do<00:06:30.529> with<00:06:30.649> the<00:06:30.740> car<00:06:31.009> it's

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:31.969 
intending gonna do with the car it's

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:33.219 
intending gonna do with the car it's
going<00:06:32.120> to<00:06:32.180> break<00:06:32.389> up<00:06:32.569> at<00:06:32.689> some<00:06:32.839> point<00:06:33.080> it's

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
going to break up at some point it's

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.129 
going to break up at some point it's
only<00:06:33.289> going<00:06:33.499> to<00:06:33.559> get<00:06:33.680> worse<00:06:33.889> so<00:06:34.249> I'd<00:06:34.789> like<00:06:35.330> it's

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
only going to get worse so I'd like it's

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.570 
only going to get worse so I'd like it's
all<00:06:36.259> in<00:06:36.289> line<00:06:36.589> with<00:06:36.800> what<00:06:36.979> we've<00:06:37.129> spoke<00:06:37.370> about

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
all in line with what we've spoke about

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.730 
all in line with what we've spoke about
with<00:06:37.789> the<00:06:37.879> other<00:06:37.969> issues<00:06:38.240> as<00:06:38.360> well<00:06:38.479> really<00:06:38.870> one

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
with the other issues as well really one

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.549 
with the other issues as well really one
thing<00:06:39.889> you<00:06:39.979> pointed<00:06:40.159> out<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:41.419> brakes<00:06:41.629> you

00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:42.559 
thing you pointed out the brakes you

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:44.049 
thing you pointed out the brakes you
yeah<00:06:42.919> they<00:06:43.069> were<00:06:43.159> a<00:06:43.189> little<00:06:43.339> bit<00:06:43.490> sticky<00:06:43.699> yeah

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:44.059 
yeah they were a little bit sticky yeah

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:46.329 
yeah they were a little bit sticky yeah
you're<00:06:44.300> quite<00:06:44.419> right<00:06:44.599> with<00:06:44.779> those<00:06:44.930> I<00:06:45.339> noticed

00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:46.339 
you're quite right with those I noticed

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.489 
you're quite right with those I noticed
that<00:06:46.550> the<00:06:46.699> front<00:06:47.180> brake<00:06:47.839> caliper<00:06:48.289> on<00:06:48.409> the

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:48.499 
that the front brake caliper on the

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.329 
that the front brake caliper on the
passenger<00:06:48.919> side<00:06:49.839> was<00:06:50.839> quite<00:06:51.169> sticking<00:06:51.979> quite

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:52.339 
passenger side was quite sticking quite

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:54.399 
passenger side was quite sticking quite
you<00:06:52.550> can<00:06:52.729> get<00:06:52.849> all<00:06:52.969> of<00:06:53.089> the<00:06:53.149> wheel<00:06:53.300> in<00:06:53.479> its

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:54.409 
you can get all of the wheel in its

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:56.350 
you can get all of the wheel in its
binding<00:06:54.620> quite<00:06:55.009> badly<00:06:55.219> so<00:06:55.399> you<00:06:55.610> you<00:06:55.969> oh<00:06:56.180> is

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
binding quite badly so you you oh is

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.269 
binding quite badly so you you oh is
that<00:06:56.479> what<00:06:56.629> it<00:06:56.659> was<00:06:56.870> then<00:06:57.080> that<00:06:57.259> that's<00:06:58.039> I

00:06:58.269 --> 00:06:58.279 
that what it was then that that's I

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:00.219 
that what it was then that that's I
think<00:06:58.610> that's<00:06:58.729> the<00:06:58.879> area<00:06:59.120> of<00:06:59.509> view<00:06:59.959> of<00:07:00.199> your

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:00.229 
think that's the area of view of your

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.439 
think that's the area of view of your
brakes<00:07:00.499> the<00:07:00.770> rest<00:07:00.949> more<00:07:01.219> okay<00:07:01.610> you<00:07:02.149> know<00:07:02.240> your

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:02.449 
brakes the rest more okay you know your
