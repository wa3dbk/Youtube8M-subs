00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
to repeat better this week his tempo was

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.890 
to repeat better this week his tempo was
off<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:45.850> little<00:04:46.000> bit<00:04:46.240> as<00:04:46.389> well<00:04:46.510> with<00:04:46.750> the

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
right shot you're making on on each lane

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.570 
right shot you're making on on each lane
and<00:05:11.720> and<00:05:11.900> Patrick<00:05:12.680> Allen<00:05:12.980> is<00:05:13.040> very<00:05:13.250> good<00:05:13.460> at

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.540 

that's<00:05:42.140> gal<00:05:42.440> incentive<00:05:42.980> to<00:05:43.100> keep<00:05:43.250> for<00:05:43.490> him

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
that's gal incentive to keep for him

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.220 
that's gal incentive to keep for him
this<00:05:43.790> week<00:05:44.000> was<00:05:44.210> trying<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.600> attack<00:05:44.960> both

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
this week was trying to attack both

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.670 
this week was trying to attack both
lanes<00:05:45.620> with<00:05:46.550> similar<00:05:47.030> angles<00:05:47.540> and<00:05:48.290> you<00:05:48.560> know

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
lanes with similar angles and you know

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.920 
lanes with similar angles and you know
you<00:05:48.740> can<00:05:49.040> do<00:05:49.310> that<00:05:49.550> when<00:05:50.270> there's<00:05:50.480> not<00:05:50.660> a<00:05:50.720> lot

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
you can do that when there's not a lot

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.810 
you can do that when there's not a lot
of<00:05:50.960> traffic<00:05:51.590> and<00:05:51.740> you<00:05:52.040> can<00:05:52.250> see<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.490> direction

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
of traffic and you can see the direction

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.970 
of traffic and you can see the direction
that<00:05:53.120> he's<00:05:53.240> playing<00:05:53.600> on<00:05:53.960> both<00:05:54.500> lanes<00:05:54.770> it's

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
that he's playing on both lanes it's

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.680 
that he's playing on both lanes it's
it's<00:05:55.130> it's<00:05:55.550> kind<00:05:55.850> of<00:05:55.940> similar<00:05:56.150> even<00:05:56.480> though

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
it's it's kind of similar even though

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.750 
it's it's kind of similar even though
two<00:05:57.170> completely<00:05:57.830> different<00:05:58.190> areas<00:05:58.490> on<00:05:58.640> the

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
two completely different areas on the

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:11.299 
two completely different areas on the
lane

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:11.309 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:13.129 

the<00:06:11.849> other<00:06:11.969> thing<00:06:12.239> that<00:06:12.269> Patrick<00:06:12.749> Allen<00:06:12.989> has

one yeah generally speaking they get
locked<00:06:42.149> in<00:06:42.329> pretty<00:06:42.809> fairly<00:06:43.169> easily<00:06:43.439> on<00:06:43.709> one

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
locked in pretty fairly easily on one

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.399 
locked in pretty fairly easily on one
lane<00:06:44.129> and<00:06:44.399> in<00:06:44.610> it's<00:06:45.149> you<00:06:45.479> know<00:06:45.599> it's<00:06:46.079> just<00:06:46.229> the

other lane that gives them a little bit
of<00:06:47.879> trouble<00:06:48.299> and<00:06:49.049> today<00:06:49.469> it<00:06:49.709> could<00:06:49.860> possibly

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
of trouble and today it could possibly

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:59.550 
of trouble and today it could possibly
be<00:06:50.309> bus<00:06:50.639> lanes

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.659 

tactic<00:07:00.560> that<00:07:00.760> they<00:07:01.760> look<00:07:02.000> lovely

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:04.669 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:08.350 

somebody<00:07:05.240> came<00:07:05.449> in<00:07:05.629> to<00:07:05.749> finish<00:07:05.990> it<00:07:06.110> off

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.279 

what<00:07:08.629> in<00:07:08.930> the<00:07:09.080> world<00:07:09.349> just<00:07:09.590> hit<00:07:09.979> the<00:07:10.129> dead<00:07:10.370> fish

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:11.289 
what in the world just hit the dead fish

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:13.510 
what in the world just hit the dead fish
because<00:07:12.289> whatever<00:07:12.500> it<00:07:12.740> was<00:07:12.919> it<00:07:13.069> was<00:07:13.189> really

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
because whatever it was it was really

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.230 
because whatever it was it was really
fast

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
fast

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.149 
fast
now<00:07:14.599> again<00:07:14.840> Barnes<00:07:15.259> trying<00:07:15.409> to<00:07:15.560> use<00:07:15.650> that<00:07:15.800> same

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:16.159 
now again Barnes trying to use that same

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:18.610 
now again Barnes trying to use that same
theory<00:07:16.580> of<00:07:16.789> trying<00:07:17.000> to<00:07:17.090> use<00:07:17.210> similar<00:07:18.050> angles

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 
theory of trying to use similar angles

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.429 
theory of trying to use similar angles
and<00:07:19.090> look<00:07:20.090> how<00:07:20.300> fast<00:07:20.629> the<00:07:20.900> messenger<00:07:21.319> comes

00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:21.439 
and look how fast the messenger comes

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.950 
and look how fast the messenger comes
over<00:07:21.740> to<00:07:21.949> just<00:07:22.550> catch<00:07:23.180> it<00:07:23.389> the<00:07:23.509> 10<00:07:23.719> out<00:07:23.870> of

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
over to just catch it the 10 out of

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.300 
over to just catch it the 10 out of
there<00:07:24.080> I<00:07:24.259> don't<00:07:24.379> know<00:07:24.500> what<00:07:24.680> one<00:07:24.800> that<00:07:24.979> was<00:07:25.129> I

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310 
there I don't know what one that was I

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:31.390 
there I don't know what one that was I
wasn't<00:07:25.490> the<00:07:25.669> head<00:07:25.819> 10<00:07:29.680> who<00:07:30.680> knows<00:07:30.860> but<00:07:31.099> when<00:07:31.280> we

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
wasn't the head 10 who knows but when we

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.550 
wasn't the head 10 who knows but when we
return<00:07:31.699> the<00:07:31.849> conclusion<00:07:32.449> of<00:07:32.599> Barnes<00:07:33.080> Allen

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 
return the conclusion of Barnes Allen

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.170 
return the conclusion of Barnes Allen
the<00:07:33.680> winner<00:07:33.919> to<00:07:34.129> face<00:07:34.159> the<00:07:34.520> biggest<00:07:34.789> and

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.180 
the winner to face the biggest and

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.819 
the winner to face the biggest and
