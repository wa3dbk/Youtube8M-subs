Valley<00:00:19.500> particularly<00:00:20.369> there<00:00:20.820> was<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.410> blue

Valley particularly there was a blue

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.529 
Valley particularly there was a blue
mold<00:00:22.769> which<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.310> guess<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> tobacco<00:00:24.060> mold

mold which I guess is a tobacco mold
that<00:00:24.720> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.019> took<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.260> industry<00:00:25.800> down<00:00:27.289> just

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
that kind of took the industry down just

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.769 
that kind of took the industry down just
prior<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.010> first<00:00:29.039> world<00:00:29.429> war<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.060> since

prior to the first world war and since

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.150 
prior to the first world war and since
then<00:00:30.990> New<00:00:31.560> York<00:00:31.590> hasn't<00:00:31.980> been<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.700> big<00:00:33.090> producer

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
picked in the bags we actually wound up

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.570 
picked in the bags we actually wound up
with<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> full<00:01:39.270> bushel<00:01:39.780> which<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.490> three<00:01:41.490> of

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
with a full bushel which was three of

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.460 
with a full bushel which was three of
these<00:01:41.670> recycled<00:01:42.300> bags<00:01:42.450> full<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> next<00:01:43.290> step

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
these recycled bags full the next step

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
these recycled bags full the next step
is<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.800> dry<00:01:44.130> them<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.730> that<00:01:44.820> we're<00:01:45.030> going<00:01:45.150> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
is to dry them for that we're going to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.910 
is to dry them for that we're going to
lay<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.870> window<00:01:46.140> screens<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
lay them out on the window screens and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:02:07.410 
lay them out on the window screens and
let<00:01:49.920> them<00:01:50.100> dry

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.270 

we've<00:02:07.900> got<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.200> cones<00:02:08.440> all<00:02:08.679> spread<00:02:08.979> out<00:02:09.130> on

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
we've got the cones all spread out on

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.820 
we've got the cones all spread out on
the<00:02:09.399> screens<00:02:09.759> I<00:02:10.420> have<00:02:10.959> no<00:02:11.110> idea<00:02:11.380> how<00:02:11.530> long<00:02:11.680> it's

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
the screens I have no idea how long it's

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.170 
the screens I have no idea how long it's
going<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.010> take<00:02:12.160> them<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.370> dry<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.700> guess<00:02:13.000> we'll

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
going to take them to dry I guess we'll

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.900 
going to take them to dry I guess we'll
find<00:02:13.480> out<00:02:13.660> we<00:02:14.650> also<00:02:14.770> don't<00:02:15.040> have<00:02:15.160> any<00:02:15.340> idea<00:02:15.640> how

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
find out we also don't have any idea how

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.170 
find out we also don't have any idea how
much<00:02:16.030> they<00:02:16.300> weigh<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:16.870> once<00:02:17.110> they're<00:02:17.500> dry

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
much they weigh but once they're dry

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.030 
much they weigh but once they're dry
we'll<00:02:19.180> weigh<00:02:19.420> them<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:19.959> package<00:02:20.560> them<00:02:20.770> in<00:02:20.860> 1

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
we'll weigh them in package them in 1

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.620 
we'll weigh them in package them in 1
ounce<00:02:21.190> containers<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.209> they<00:02:22.270> should<00:02:22.480> be

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
ounce containers and they should be

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.990 
ounce containers and they should be
ready<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.930> use<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.470> also<00:02:24.040> want<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.400> mention<00:02:24.550> too

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
ready to use I also want to mention too

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.420 
ready to use I also want to mention too
that<00:02:25.330> we're<00:02:26.230> going<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.410> take<00:02:26.620> these<00:02:26.800> hops<00:02:27.130> and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
that we're going to take these hops and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.540 
that we're going to take these hops and
send<00:02:27.640> them<00:02:27.819> off<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.180> lab<00:02:28.560> I'll<00:02:29.560> put<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.040> web

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
send them off to a lab I'll put the web

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.479 
send them off to a lab I'll put the web
address<00:02:30.880> up<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.330> screen<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.830> will<00:02:33.160> test

address up on the screen that will test
for<00:02:33.790> alpha<00:02:34.510> acids<00:02:34.989> tell<00:02:35.319> us<00:02:35.410> how<00:02:35.560> much<00:02:35.680> better

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
for alpha acids tell us how much better

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.860 
for alpha acids tell us how much better
in<00:02:36.160> quality<00:02:36.310> they<00:02:36.730> have<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.450> will<00:02:37.569> tell<00:02:37.780> us

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
in quality they have and will tell us

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.330 
in quality they have and will tell us
the<00:02:37.900> type<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.230> hops<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.739> right<00:02:38.950> now<00:02:39.100> we're<00:02:39.310> not

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
the type of hops is right now we're not
