00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.029 
step further and we have a closed track
here<00:01:07.960> so<00:01:08.320> what<00:01:08.439> we<00:01:08.500> do<00:01:08.590> is<00:01:08.710> we'll<00:01:08.829> turn<00:01:08.920> the

here so what we do is we'll turn the

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.830 
here so what we do is we'll turn the
stability<00:01:09.399> control<00:01:09.700> off<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:10.119> little<00:01:10.600> bit<00:01:10.719> fun

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840
