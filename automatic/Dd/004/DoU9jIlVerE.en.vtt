the seeding box with it and you'll see
here<00:02:06.250> how<00:02:07.569> how<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:08.629> can<00:02:08.929> get<00:02:09.080> some<00:02:09.379> acreage

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
here how how you can get some acreage

don't know exactly how fast he's going

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.820 
don't know exactly how fast he's going
my<00:02:17.180> guess<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.629> around<00:02:17.780> five<00:02:18.200> miles<00:02:18.500> an<00:02:18.739> hour

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
my guess is around five miles an hour

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.910 
my guess is around five miles an hour
possibly<00:02:19.489> six
