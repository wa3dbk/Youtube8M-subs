00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.069 
this is probably the
least<00:02:13.469> biggest<00:02:13.950> concern<00:02:14.400> out<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.049> the

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
least biggest concern out of the the the

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.780 
least biggest concern out of the the the
categories<00:02:16.890> I'll<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.129> covering<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:17.639> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
categories I'll be covering but the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.599 
categories I'll be covering but the
mixability<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.389> a<00:02:18.420> 10<00:02:18.689> out<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.930> 10<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.950> did<00:02:20.370> two

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
mixability is a 10 out of 10 I did two

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.140 
mixability is a 10 out of 10 I did two
scoops<00:02:20.999> because<00:02:21.389> I<00:02:21.930> am<00:02:22.859> a<00:02:22.950> man<00:02:23.189> and<00:02:23.219> I<00:02:23.670> don't

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
scoops because I am a man and I don't

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.379 
scoops because I am a man and I don't
ever<00:02:24.359> do<00:02:24.569> one<00:02:24.780> scoop<00:02:25.129> so<00:02:26.129> I<00:02:26.489> think<00:02:26.609> for<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
ever do one scoop so I think for the

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.970 
ever do one scoop so I think for the
suggested<00:02:28.079> amount<00:02:28.499> of<00:02:28.739> water<00:02:29.689> is<00:02:30.889> six<00:02:31.889> to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
suggested amount of water is six to

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.649 
suggested amount of water is six to
eight<00:02:32.099> ounces<00:02:32.459> per<00:02:32.700> scoop<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.209> did<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.510> think

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
eight ounces per scoop so I did I think

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.020 
eight ounces per scoop so I did I think
it<00:02:33.900> did<00:02:34.019> twelve<00:02:34.319> twelve<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.430> fourteen<00:02:35.819> because

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
it did twelve twelve to fourteen because

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.270 
it did twelve twelve to fourteen because
I<00:02:36.209> don't<00:02:36.450> want<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:36.659> dilute<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.739> less<00:02:38.099> water

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
I don't want to dilute it the less water

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.940 
I don't want to dilute it the less water
you<00:02:38.489> use<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.760> more<00:02:38.939> strong<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:40.319> pre-workout

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
you use the more strong the pre-workout

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.280 
you use the more strong the pre-workout
is<00:02:41.129> so<00:02:41.400> no<00:02:41.939> blender<00:02:42.269> ball<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.689> Mex<00:02:42.870> ability

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
is so no blender ball the Mex ability

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.709 
is so no blender ball the Mex ability

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.250 
even an hour for this to really kick in
it<00:04:25.740> was

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
it was

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.490 
it was
very<00:04:26.410> subtle<00:04:26.860> in<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.880> best<00:04:28.060> way<00:04:28.240> possible

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
when it comes to c4 like I said it's

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.840 
when it comes to c4 like I said it's
like<00:04:32.110> one<00:04:32.350> minute<00:04:32.500> you're<00:04:32.680> just<00:04:32.800> like<00:04:33.220> chillin

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
increase in energy level that being said

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.730 
increase in energy level that being said
it<00:04:45.190> did<00:04:45.850> an<00:04:45.970> amazing<00:04:46.360> job<00:04:46.600> I<00:04:46.990> did<00:04:47.230> not<00:04:47.410> get<00:04:47.590> the

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.520 
it was really good
so<00:05:55.840> I<00:05:55.870> guess<00:05:56.170> my<00:05:56.410> only<00:05:56.770> beef<00:05:57.040> with<00:05:57.310> this<00:05:57.520> if<00:05:57.760> any

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
so I guess my only beef with this if any

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.250 
so I guess my only beef with this if any
is<00:05:59.530> that<00:05:59.950> it<00:06:00.160> took<00:06:00.400> longer<00:06:00.760> to<00:06:01.150> kick<00:06:01.600> in<00:06:01.810> then

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
is that it took longer to kick in then

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.740 
is that it took longer to kick in then
compared<00:06:02.860> to<00:06:02.890> c4<00:06:03.520> but<00:06:03.820> that<00:06:04.030> just<00:06:04.150> means<00:06:04.360> taken

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
compared to c4 but that just means taken

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.860 
compared to c4 but that just means taken
earlier<00:06:05.110> so<00:06:05.790> you<00:06:06.790> know<00:06:06.880> that<00:06:07.090> is<00:06:07.300> really<00:06:07.660> my

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
earlier so you know that is really my

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.470 
earlier so you know that is really my
only<00:06:08.260> issue<00:06:08.440> I'm<00:06:08.920> probably<00:06:09.670> gonna<00:06:10.000> stick<00:06:10.360> with

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
only issue I'm probably gonna stick with

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.220 
only issue I'm probably gonna stick with
this<00:06:11.730> just<00:06:12.730> because<00:06:13.120> I<00:06:13.150> love<00:06:13.630> Owen<00:06:13.780> for<00:06:14.140> other

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
this just because I love Owen for other

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.290 
this just because I love Owen for other
things<00:06:14.530> so<00:06:14.710> why<00:06:14.860> the<00:06:14.920> hell<00:06:15.100> not<00:06:15.250> just<00:06:15.580> just<00:06:16.030> go

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
things so why the hell not just just go

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.900 
things so why the hell not just just go
