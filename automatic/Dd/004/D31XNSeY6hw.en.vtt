 I am very grateful to you for the contact.

 just awesome each with his 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.469
 highlight 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.320
 all different are still interesting in 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.110
 General, thank you very much and up to the room 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.969
 i'm done already now i'm sitting by me and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.480
 very well turned out she was very 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.000
 happy but let's think we won't 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.149
 discuss there every little thing of my new 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.049
 I'll go to the case to the room 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.380
 my channel 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.530
 and this is the way I recently got sick here 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.900
 caught a cold after repair right there 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.479
 I already had my room ready 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.280
 it was already all ready to write 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.770
 but I caught a cold in my throat 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.100
 I was a brand of us was nasal 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.420
 In general, I decided all the same 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.040
 get well and then start 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.430
 record because if i will 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.799
 overstrain your throat tom it seems to me 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.350
 we get sick even worse i recovered 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.729
 Of course itâ€™s generally very easy to get sick 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.799
 and because the weather is so unstable 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.409
 it was warm and walking so 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.149
 T-shirts and then sharply cold to go to 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.210
 basically used to walk in a T-shirt 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.340
 come out again T-shirts and freeze 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.009
 just really Dubak or at least 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.350
 look here in the morning the weather is good in the afternoon 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.960
 good evening right here right away 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.040
 cooling and even occasionally there was 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.409
 in the morning I get up early sometime in the morning 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.679
 at 9 9 degrees on 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.899
 street plus 9 and dugout want a scarf 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.720
 wear I do not know that for years on a 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.209
 Now it seems good to God forbid that further 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.519
 it was also good I generally like that 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.330
 the weather is not hot and not cold that is 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:25.120
 such an average normal when super 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.400
 hot and stuffy not too unpleasant in general 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.640
 in short, I don't know where such a country is 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.239
 where is the climate to find where the weather is straight 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.489
 such 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.530
 which I want I always have something not 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.790
 arranges unfortunately okay let's 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.489
 move on to my channel already 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.519
 guys i renew my videos i 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.370
 come back at 74 i come back sims 3 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.290
 by the way, I'll tell you one more 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.010
 the problem that came into my mind 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.799
 I have my stationary repair time 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.200
 computer windows on which i play 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:03.569
 sims 4 there all my family 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.269
 that is, there I write it is buggy 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.299
 He passed out and did not want to cut one or all 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.480
 in which she had some problems there errors 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:17.109
 Generally some kind of full and 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.750
 yes of course I can not write there 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:24.090
 now of course but thank god I have 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:27.099
 guys there is a laptop too windows and 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.889
 he is a gaming laptop and thank god i have 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.260
 on this laptop there are sims 4 but there was 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.730
 one such problem 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.680
 a-7 and this is on this landline 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.340
 I had to have a family computer 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.079
 pull and load on a laptop and play 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.870
 here in these families because well, you understand 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.959
 I hope in general, I had to shorter 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.760
 pull the hard drive out of the computer 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.620
 then buy a special box for 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.930
 hard drive so this hard drive 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.290
 connect to a laptop from this hard 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.720
 drive still throw off the family and download these 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.299
 families ie add folder to sims 4 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.060
 already on the laptop and I will be this 74 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.359
 write to the laptop yes that is me 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.879
 the computer has changed temporarily I hope 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.829
 my stationary 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.940
 it is normalized there 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.310
 reinstall windows altogether 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.130
 update everything will be erased when feast 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.720
 I will install windows on nothing terrible 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.820

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.340

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.970
