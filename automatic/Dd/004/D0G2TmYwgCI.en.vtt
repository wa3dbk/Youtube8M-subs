 Dr. White we are here today for a new one 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.890
 fifa 14 video in particular a 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.870
 gameplay in my first impressions 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.000
 on the demo of recollections it was 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.900
 released to move standard for ps3 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.509
 and for pc 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.990
 today we start on the tah we will see 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.039
 meanwhile the menus of this one makes you 14 a lot 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.630
 in windows 8 style 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.210
 start to see the teams you can 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.220
 use this demo first of all 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.210
 we see the teams in this demo the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.970
 boca juniors 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.380
 the manchester city ​​the tottenham the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.579
 borussia dortmund the milan psg the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.489
 barcelona and many other rugby 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.980
 teams for this demo of fifa 14 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.690
 small addition you can try the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.200
 wire mode once beach users 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.980
 when you launch you were given one 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.320
 basic school 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.180
 I remind you of the values ​​of non players 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.160
 are the definitive ones are enough 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.500
 different which of the final game we can 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.180
 see also only in each also 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.550
 referred to as the central midfielder 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.530
 you can play a match against this one 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.299
 team now let's go see some 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.070
 goal I made users is not 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.470
 in my opinion, however, this can be judged 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.350
 mode this because why not 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.600
 can understand if the gameplay is like that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.880
 how we see it or is due to the fact 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.799
 that the opponent was of a level was 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 then the CPU is reset on one level 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.700
 really low we can see gods 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.740
 containing fa look at us here braidich 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.729
 as it goes away very quickly and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.080
 touches the goal 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.110
 so in my opinion it is not yet 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.909
 I would expect the exit of 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.009
 game was dressed to try it against 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.869
 opponents in hands that usually are 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.909
 Baby opponents difficult to deal with 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.040
 compared to the computer a thing I have 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.009
 noticed the blow the horn tests and am 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.580
 still very effective and my fear is 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.410
 that they are also the pitches like 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.360
 here the precision shots to be 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.160
 fearfully strong you see here in bra with 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.110
 a fairly slow throw commits 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.270
 seriously the next goalkeeper will do a 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.340
 gameplay in the classic mode with the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.110
 computer has difficulty legend and I have to 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.120
 say that it was a massacre 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.450
 I made Milan, Barcelona, ​​Barcelona 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.040
 he was playing the computer and there was none 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.420
 really history and barcelona legend 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.150
 graphic like true barcelona therefore 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.520
 close pass memories and really close 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.740
 a crazy team to deal with 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.120
 I really really struggled with this 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.090
 also for the new innovations they have 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.590
 brought this type 14 starting from 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.790
 ball control that is no longer accurate 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.770
 as in fifa 13 where the players 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.900
 they hooked any type of ball 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.370
 they calmly controlled it too 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.200
 in the midst of opponents and be a lot 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.480
 more difficult jumps opponents e 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.220
 dribble them especially in the strait 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.440
 the steps are much more difficult 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.720
 look here for passages too 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.880
 easy wrong under the pressing of 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.440
 computer so it will be difficult to do 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.700
 very risky steps concerning 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.930
 this of balotelli 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.700
 the fifa 3d would have gone 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.209
 quietly in port in this type 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.280
 14 wrong fast players are not 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.080
 more like determinants look at sharaawy 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.930
 in the progression the control of 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.370
 palermo is no longer perfect then 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.989
 beware that fast fathers then 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.580
 first game was really a 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.489
 massacre you will see at the end the 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.900
 statistics really really isn't there 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.850
 was no story 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.500
 well guys we concluded if 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.209
 live released online with comments 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.150
 written to the dog we will meet again tomorrow 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.150
 with the fig playlife 14 hi to all
