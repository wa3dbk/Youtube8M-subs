00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.060 
orange cones orange yeah all right let's
do<00:01:49.750> it

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.740 

so<00:01:53.070> got<00:01:53.220> two<00:01:53.400> laps<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.850> write<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> sentence

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.810 

sacred<00:01:57.750> dragon<00:01:58.170> Allah<00:01:58.320> okay<00:01:59.220> that<00:01:59.550> didn't

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
sacred dragon Allah okay that didn't

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.370 
sacred dragon Allah okay that didn't
take<00:01:59.940> too<00:02:00.150> long<00:02:00.300> to<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.630> hung<00:02:00.810> up<00:02:00.930> let's<00:02:01.140> try

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
take too long to get hung up let's try

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.980 
take too long to get hung up let's try
another<00:02:01.560> driver<00:02:02.390> first<00:02:03.390> trip<00:02:03.660> around<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
another driver first trip around the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.800 
another driver first trip around the
course<00:02:04.230> hands-free<00:02:04.980> not<00:02:05.400> too<00:02:05.610> bad<00:02:05.820> now<00:02:06.570> for

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
course hands-free not too bad now for

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.540 
course hands-free not too bad now for
the<00:02:06.870> second<00:02:07.200> lap<00:02:07.290> trying<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.950> text<00:02:08.369> at<00:02:08.490> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the second lap trying to text at the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.240 
the second lap trying to text at the
same<00:02:08.790> time<00:02:09.260> okay<00:02:10.260> ready

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
same time okay ready

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.490 
same time okay ready
so<00:02:11.460> while<00:02:11.670> we're<00:02:11.850> driving<00:02:12.030> mm-hmm<00:02:12.840> text<00:02:13.350> I

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
so while we're driving mm-hmm text I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.850 
so while we're driving mm-hmm text I
hate<00:02:13.710> orange<00:02:14.010> goes<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.520> hate<00:02:15.150> orange<00:02:15.480> cones

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.470 

second<00:02:19.860> time<00:02:19.980> around<00:02:20.220> not<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.940> good

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
second time around not so good

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
second time around not so good
didn't<00:02:22.080> take<00:02:22.230> 10<00:02:22.500> seconds<00:02:23.010> until<00:02:23.130> she<00:02:23.520> ran

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
didn't take 10 seconds until she ran

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.760 
didn't take 10 seconds until she ran
over<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.180> first<00:02:24.390> cone<00:02:24.720> yeah<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.380> spell

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
over the first cone yeah I spell

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.450 
over the first cone yeah I spell
everything<00:02:26.010> right<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.910> hate<00:02:27.540> orange<00:02:27.810> cones<00:02:28.460> but

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
everything right I hate orange cones but

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.700 
everything right I hate orange cones but
I<00:02:29.490> hit<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.820> lot<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.810> other<00:02:33.930> test<00:02:34.230> was<00:02:34.380> all<00:02:34.530> about

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
I hit a lot the other test was all about

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.160 
I hit a lot the other test was all about
physics<00:02:35.220> how<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> car<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.150> tires<00:02:36.480> break<00:02:36.930> loose

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
physics how a car is tires break loose

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.680 
physics how a car is tires break loose
and<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.500> spin<00:02:37.800> now<00:02:38.400> drivers<00:02:38.880> can<00:02:39.090> get<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:39.420> car

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
and a spin now drivers can get that car

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.850 
and a spin now drivers can get that car
back<00:02:39.720> under<00:02:40.260> control

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
back under control

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.580 
back under control

you<00:02:45.330> go<00:02:45.450> buddy<00:02:45.750> nice<00:02:46.230> job<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.709> saw<00:02:46.890> your<00:02:47.070> mate

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
you go buddy nice job I saw your mate

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.920 
you go buddy nice job I saw your mate
you're<00:02:47.459> making<00:02:47.730> attempts<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.450> grip<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.780> wheel

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
you're making attempts to grip the wheel

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.270 
you're making attempts to grip the wheel
with<00:02:49.140> both<00:02:49.170> hands<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.620> that's<00:02:49.770> perfect

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
with both hands and that's perfect

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.850 
with both hands and that's perfect
here<00:02:50.700> we<00:02:50.790> go<00:02:50.940> Nick<00:02:51.180> okay<00:02:51.630> there<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.050> go<00:02:52.410> okay

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
here we go Nick okay there you go okay

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.900

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
that after all is the goal to get new

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.920 
that after all is the goal to get new
drivers<00:02:58.020> right
