00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
another one and from the Q&amp;A here it

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.229 
another one and from the Q&amp;A here it
seems<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:44.010> actually<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.520> video<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:45.149> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
seems they actually have a video of it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.490 
seems they actually have a video of it
actually<00:00:45.450> working<00:00:46.020> if<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.200> wanna<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.469> that

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
actually working if you wanna see that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.850 
actually working if you wanna see that
links<00:00:46.860> below<00:00:47.450> it<00:00:48.450> seems<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.079> me<00:00:49.289> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
links below it seems to me that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.670 
links below it seems to me that
something<00:00:50.640> obviously<00:00:51.390> has<00:00:51.719> gone<00:00:51.989> wrong<00:00:52.379> with

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
something obviously has gone wrong with

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.889 
something obviously has gone wrong with
this<00:00:52.949> because<00:00:53.789> first<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.449> all<00:00:54.539> they<00:00:54.660> said<00:00:54.840> they

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
this because first of all they said they

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.350 
this because first of all they said they
were<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> release<00:00:55.440> early<00:00:56.219> June<00:00:56.489> rolling

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
were going to release early June rolling

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.479 
were going to release early June rolling
into<00:00:57.510> July<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.230> there's<00:00:58.530> nothing<00:00:59.219> actually

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
into July and there's nothing actually

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.209 
into July and there's nothing actually
going<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.600> don't<00:01:01.379> think<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.859> think<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
going on I don't think I think the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.650 
going on I don't think I think the
problem<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.789> not<00:01:02.940> supporting<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> newer

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
problem is it's not supporting the newer

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.960 
problem is it's not supporting the newer
firmwares<00:01:04.229> yet<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.710> think<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:05.729> low<00:01:05.939> on

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
firmwares yet I think they're low on

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.340 
firmwares yet I think they're low on
units<00:01:06.510> they've<00:01:06.720> already<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.020> think<00:01:07.229> they've

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
units they've already I think they've

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.320 
units they've already I think they've
already<00:01:07.500> produced<00:01:07.950> their<00:01:08.130> units<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.670> then

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
already produced their units and then

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.899 
already produced their units and then
all<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.510> units<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.200> produce<00:01:10.790> kind<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
all the units that they produce kind of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.240 
all the units that they produce kind of
got<00:01:12.119> updated<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.530> they<00:01:13.680> need<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> patch

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
got updated on and they need to patch

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.390

trying to keep my cartridges in a safe
place<00:02:42.860> another<00:02:43.860> thing<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.250> they<00:02:44.520> say

place another thing is that they say
save<00:02:45.000> data<00:02:45.270> isn't<00:02:45.480> fully<00:02:45.750> working<00:02:46.020> yet<00:02:46.350> and

save data isn't fully working yet and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.160 
save data isn't fully working yet and
that's<00:02:47.370> kind<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.000> discerning<00:02:48.540> considering

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
that's kind of discerning considering

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.230 
that's kind of discerning considering
most<00:02:49.560> people<00:02:49.920> like<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.070> save<00:02:50.400> their<00:02:50.670> games<00:02:50.970> and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
most people like to save their games and

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.870 
most people like to save their games and
there's<00:02:52.050> no<00:02:52.260> ability<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.160> run<00:02:53.340> games<00:02:53.640> from

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
there's no ability to run games from

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.650 
there's no ability to run games from
other<00:02:54.060> regions<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:55.490> it<00:02:56.490> seems<00:02:56.940> pretty<00:02:57.300> buggy

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
other regions so it seems pretty buggy

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.330 
other regions so it seems pretty buggy
at<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.110> point<00:02:58.410> maybe<00:02:58.740> that's<00:02:59.010> why<00:02:59.190> they're

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
at this point maybe that's why they're

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.030 
at this point maybe that's why they're
not<00:02:59.370> releasing<00:02:59.790> it<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.780> what<00:03:01.740> do<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.830> think

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
not releasing it but what do you think

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.350 
not releasing it but what do you think
about<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.310> technology<00:03:02.640> what<00:03:03.030> do<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.180> think

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
about the technology what do you think

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.880 
about the technology what do you think
about<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.630> gateway<00:03:03.900> flash<00:03:04.140> car<00:03:04.410> will<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.710> be

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
buying one when they come out they're

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.600 
buying one when they come out they're
