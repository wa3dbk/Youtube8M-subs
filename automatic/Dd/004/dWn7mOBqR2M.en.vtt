this<00:01:26.259> motor

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.760 

you're<00:01:55.090> three<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:55.990> we<00:01:56.080> can<00:01:56.200> get<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:56.350> few<00:01:56.620> out

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.340 

how's<00:02:07.180> this<00:02:07.390> for<00:02:07.600> straight<00:02:07.900> shot<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.289> the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
how's this for straight shot of the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:22.420 
how's this for straight shot of the
castle

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.520 

and<00:02:23.030> not<00:02:23.329> much<00:02:23.450> else<00:02:23.510> l<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.110> see<00:02:24.290> otherwise

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
and not much else l to see otherwise

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.839 
and not much else l to see otherwise
except<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.099> bunch<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.370> trees<00:02:27.579> anyway<00:02:28.579> let's<00:02:28.760> go

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
except a bunch of trees anyway let's go

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:40.809 
except a bunch of trees anyway let's go
back<00:02:29.000> down<00:02:35.200> shrines<00:02:36.200> are<00:02:36.379> off<00:02:38.409> Nick<00:02:39.819> Lantern

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
back down shrines are off Nick Lantern

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:48.589 
back down shrines are off Nick Lantern
doesn't<00:02:41.120> really<00:02:41.269> work

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.890 

Montgomery<00:02:49.500> County<00:02:49.709> out<00:02:50.010> there

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.699 

so<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:53.950> probably<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.519> Montgomery<00:02:54.909> motor

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
so that probably is a Montgomery motor

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.930 
so that probably is a Montgomery motor
anyway

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
anyway

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.130 
anyway
take<00:02:57.940> one<00:02:58.120> more<00:02:58.239> ride<00:02:58.480> we'll<00:02:58.690> listen<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:59.049> it

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
take one more ride we'll listen to it

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.729 
take one more ride we'll listen to it
again<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.209> meantime<00:03:04.260> it's<00:03:05.260> pretty<00:03:05.530> nice

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
again in the meantime it's pretty nice

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.130 
again in the meantime it's pretty nice
elevator<00:03:07.049> underneath<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.170> padding<00:03:08.590> here

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:20.339 
elevator underneath the padding here
yeah<00:03:11.170> that's<00:03:12.510> not<00:03:13.510> bad

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.510 

great<00:03:47.770> impact<00:03:48.250> can<00:03:49.830> set<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:50.950> camera<00:03:51.310> right

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
great impact can set the camera right

00:03:51.520 --> 00:04:21.000 
great impact can set the camera right
there<00:03:51.550> let's<00:03:52.390> listen

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:46.390 

great<00:04:23.470> door<00:04:24.470> closed<00:04:24.680> works<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:25.070> like<00:04:25.220> that

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:55.700

miss the button going out takes a while
to<00:04:55.740> level

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.479 

that's<00:05:11.330> it
