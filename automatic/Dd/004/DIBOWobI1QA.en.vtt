but<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.490> is<00:02:59.640> worth<00:02:59.820> checking<00:03:00.270> out<00:03:00.330> because<00:03:00.600> it

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
but it is worth checking out because it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.200 
but it is worth checking out because it
is<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> viable<00:03:01.440> option<00:03:02.310> for<00:03:02.340> multi<00:03:02.760> jessamy<00:03:03.030> and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
it does have one of the things that the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.100 
it does have one of the things that the
current<00:03:05.460> multitasking<00:03:06.210> switcher<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.690> missing
