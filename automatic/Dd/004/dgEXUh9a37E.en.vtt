00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.850 

being<00:01:12.720> somewhere<00:01:12.930> different<00:01:13.290> helps<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.650> I

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
being somewhere different helps you I

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.240 
being somewhere different helps you I
think

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
think

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.860 
think
consider<00:01:14.820> things<00:01:15.030> differently<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.450> breaks

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
consider things differently and breaks

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.660 
consider things differently and breaks
you<00:01:15.990> out<00:01:16.050> of<00:01:16.230> your<00:01:16.350> normal<00:01:16.500> habits<00:01:16.980> and<00:01:17.550> it's

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you out of your normal habits and it's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.770 
you out of your normal habits and it's
always<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.970> good<00:01:18.150> thing<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.300> do

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
always a good thing to do

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.330 
always a good thing to do
I<00:01:18.810> think<00:01:19.350> flex<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.680> working<00:01:20.010> is<00:01:20.100> great

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
I think flex for working is great

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.880 
I think flex for working is great
because<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:21.000> out<00:01:21.150> there<00:01:21.530> see<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:22.680> works

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
because you get out there see what works

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:42.969 
because you get out there see what works
for<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.370> and<00:01:23.640> ultimately<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.450> better

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.960 

hopefully<00:01:43.979> showing<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.520> really<00:01:44.820> easy

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
hopefully showing that it's really easy

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.930 
hopefully showing that it's really easy
to<00:01:45.240> work<00:01:46.110> flexibly<00:01:46.350> wherever<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.430> are<00:01:47.580> what

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
to work flexibly wherever you are what

00:01:47.940 --> 00:02:04.230 
to work flexibly wherever you are what
you're<00:01:48.060> doing<00:01:48.090> even<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:49.910> like<00:01:50.910> a<00:01:50.940> boss
