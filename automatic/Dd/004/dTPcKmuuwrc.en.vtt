00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.520
 and to the head a little bit the bonus 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.560
 the call of the mirror 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.340

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.160
 get closer myth accomplished 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.110
 you go on the train 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.950
 after the previous 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.970
 why not catch up with normandie you have to know that it works 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.820
 you aim

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.260
 video 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.440

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.440
 still proud 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.840
 it is a mistake 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.130
 Well here is the ground 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.130
 inside 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.650
 we are still waiting for a treat 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.169
 ah yes of course the front bumper 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.219
 schedule 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.549
 apart from paris 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.089

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.949
 khadir 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:35.949
 it's a sport a little bit anyway 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.689
 then you have one oscillating 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.749
 everything is going well and that the om 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:51.619
 he actually wants 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:52.899
 it is a fact 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:56.359
 that's what we miss next so suddenly left decline forced 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.119
 it's still like that 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.939
 ap in the stomach 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.759
 Wallander 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.779
 I am proud 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.219
 I did not work more 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.419
 rogge blew up 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:43.549

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.219
 online what breaks 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.510
 but hey it's not too well known the local elected exceeds it a little bit 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.509
 too bad 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.739
 they can lose 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.739
 still often like that 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:07.669
 ea com Clement left there 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.669
 it's weird it goes in all directions actually 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.690
 same as normally coming soon translated north favelas plan there is no 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.690
 masses but how 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.789
 beating just planned if I managed their coup 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.720
 went to anz bank so now I showed you beautiful from 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.720
 fight mirror try a little air with users 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.930
 why the market then nothing at all on the side of the mirror 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.120
 finally the bitumen mirror 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.759
 but these weapons 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.759
 so you're going to get under the seat you appropriate them 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.819
 we must break this mirror there we have tight 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.460
 ok that's what it looks 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.370
 funded at the haye ranking 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.099
 and here is China 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.099

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.689
 in the lead until next time 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.370
