00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.930
 well guys, I'll give it to you then 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.560
 on the use of refrigerators I see in 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.850
 many houses sometimes housewives 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.540
 make some mistakes for not having 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.730
 knowledge of these tips 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:30.630
 so the first one is not to put a 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.120
 Kiss me, I put several objects 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.500
 this may reduce the life of 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.790
 refrigerator or even burn a motor 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.900
 happens that these refrigerators these 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.310
 they are all electronic 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.200
 so often the housewife will use 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.560
 that same outlet for two three things 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.150
 in the refrigerator attack work when the 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.090
 refrigerator is working 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.360
 the engine will compress all this 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.810
 part here is working there already in 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.060
 load when he was in Bahia comes 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.270
 here strips and uses an electric iron 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.360
 use a blender immediately 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.159
 put it back if you turn off that 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.490
 refrigerator and put it back in the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.320
 plug is already plugged in and put into 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.350
 less than ten minutes in the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.670
 the gas will be all over and with that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.310
 there it will force the engine it in most 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.380
 times you can not trigger the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.990
 thermal relay and that tactic tic tactic 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.800
 tac tic tac may have a plate 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.260
 electronics 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.960
 this same thing happens when there is 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.960
 lack of energy sometimes the phase falls 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.690
 low voltage there if 220 is there 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.930
 180 without then at that moment that the 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.830
 refrigerator stands tic tac tic tac strip 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.010
 take and leave on average half an hour 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.159
 off 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.960
 Then you put that one back by 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.000
 ventura will use this outlet 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.670
 refrigerator to connect a blender 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.729
 or any other object 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.740
 Leave her half an hour off the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.170
 You put it back you can not take it out here. 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.360
 and put the motor back on ends 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.879
 superheating 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.909
 another tip is the following this refrigerator 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.720
 modern all of them come with compartment 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.240
 here behind 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.730
 sometimes you go to a house the refrigerator 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.640
 gets all clean 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.280
 but that stink that does not know 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.080
 Where is this housing from? 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.299
 he usually joins something here of the thaw and 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.970
 this water it will evaporate according to the 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.230
 engine heats up 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.200
 only that often the housewife 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:44.450
 put there that has a brine 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.299
 for example of meat put in the freezer 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.269
 and when that aura is frozen 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.920
 team the fund and that and enter into 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.370
 decomposes and ends up creating bad 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.750
 smell in the house and no one knows where it comes from 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.910
 Another detail is that part of it is quÃ© 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.670
 it has to have a heat exchange with the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.930
 environment so the refrigerator has a 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.260
 good refrigeration 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.629
 so never coachella too much on the wall 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.239
 have to leave a space here of about 15 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.640
 feeling from 10 to 15 centimeters 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.620
 there was this heat exchange and did not close 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.609
 the sides so as not to drown too much. 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.680
 this area 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.440
 the detail is that she has to be clean 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.530
 tashi from appearing on the spider syndikat that 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.220
 I also lost the efficiency of the exchange of 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.989
 heat do not put anything past cac that 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.380
 generally personal before putting some 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.569
 Drying is not good. 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.260
 another interesting detail that few 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.840
 people know is that what it generates is not a 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.669
 ice and yes for money 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.269
 I will give an example here many times I 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:52.819
 I get the refrigerator in here, ok? 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.030
 full of ice along the sides of the 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.380
 court is no longer closing staff 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.709
 is full of ice plus the food is 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.780
 losing what you do from there is not the 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.000
 amount of ice 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.489
 the refrigerator has to be ice-cold and 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.889
 more ice vapor as if it were serene 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.019
 in so italy fli generating well you 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.900
 those installed at the beginning of this 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:19.359
 year 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.359
 so also what is so 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:28.520
 this modern refrigerator it is made of 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.590
 polyurethane in the expanding foam and 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.139
 times when the refrigerator 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.289
 according to the ambient temperature changes 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:39.560
 until the refrigerator freezes thaw 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:43.400
 she used to make a strange noise is 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.759
 afternoon with were cheating me 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.680
 something is normal in this 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.139
 type of refrigerator that has foam 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.949
 expansive person thinks that some 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:57.139
 It's strange but it's normal. 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.509
 so the tip is to exit every time you take the 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.560
 refrigerator is taken from the refrigerator 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.860
 working 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.710
 not immediately place every time the 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.699
 refrigerator start the tic tac tic tac 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.889
 tektek strip outlet and let cool 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.669
 this refrigerator will cool you sometimes 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.500
 calls a technician if he calls the tag alone 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.389
 because even the refrigerator on / off 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.210
 line you call the technician 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.469
 a good part of those who are called will accuse 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.680
 I do not know what happened in return. 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:30.229
 that piece without any need 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.469
 You take the standby refrigerator. 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.800
 cool the engine and replaced it 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.710
 persist 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:43.639
 So you call the technician to see what it is. 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:46.479
 what is happening there then the tips 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:49.520
 were there like you 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.899
 share so others see if 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.939
 subscribe to the channel 

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:54.939
 Thank you very much and see you next time.
