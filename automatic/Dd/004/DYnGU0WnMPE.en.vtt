 you should reassure yourself if you are going to cross out 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.710
 to someone on the list that's how I 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.710

 their houses also destroyed half of them 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.890
 because we're leaving she does not think there's 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.890
 problems 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.579

 I have information about Mr. 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.560
 Did you know that he is a widower and father of 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.690
 a boy of ten years 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.310

 I will not help you to leave an orphan child 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.360
 I'll just give you a warning 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.160
 in doing something really good in this 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.090
 city something more than recover the money 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.090
 scammed people 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.540
 you're not the only one who knows how to restart my 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.540
 system 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:24.400
 it was a mistake to stand in my way 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.400
 join you even if it's temporary 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.350
 we'll go back later we should 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.390
 expect this is very serious and if in your 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.580
 next attack of conscience speaks with 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.750
 the police will not say anything I know I had to 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.700
 do the same calculation when you 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.430
 I find out what is mine 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.570
 and what would you have done if I had called 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.570
 the inspector threw 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.080
 through art with an arrow 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.440
 today seriously you would have done it 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.130
 I bet that it would not be long before I came to 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.200
 visit me to tell me that I put betray 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.880
 it was nothing 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.619
 in fact expected to change your 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.590
 opinion last night had high adrenaline 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.020
 for the exercise and I did not speak to you as 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.540
 I had to do it now I hope you give me the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.570
 opportunity to fix it and if you start 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.520
 by ken williams also enjoy your 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.040
 adrenaline did not return the stolen money 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.900
 and went to bed his son in bed 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.740
 As I said, it was just one 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.210
 warning 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.490
 the public that we are joining forces 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.260
 with the interpol since the elusive act 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.940
 mainly in europe and we have been 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.100
 advised that we inform the people of 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.990
 that is armed and I've heard about that 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.810
 type they call the elusive because it avoids 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.540
 getting dirty hands uses hostages 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.450
 so they can steal for him as he puts them 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.890
 bomb an explosive necklace last year 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.860
 A man from Madrid did not steal what he 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.660
 he said and blew his head off as is and 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.430
 now that psychopath is here pity 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.620
 that is not in your notebook not only I'm going to 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.600
 by the people on the list from time to time 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.390
 when I make exceptions 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.390
 a thief who takes hostages for example 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.840
 what do you think if you help us dig for 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.510
 catch it we must find out well where 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.790
 is or where you plan to be is this way 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.250
 you think about your actions eating 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.069
 hamburgers I feel the delay today I have 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.879
 some especially scandalous clients 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.480
 You want me to take care of it but I'm a 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.590
 professional 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.590

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.569
 Erick's brother and his brother died 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.829

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.019
 return to the fight against the first 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.180
 I was thinking that you should and is asking 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.189
 a serious date I'll do it a minute 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.590
 after you ask for it, antenna 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.980
 Inspector of the elusive case is that 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.980
 did you like 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.690
 I do not see you asking for a quotation 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.660
 Felicity that uncle is targeting a 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.120
 very specific type of jewelry and we find out 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.400
 why 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.110
 we would already know how to treat it I have a 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.049
 idea 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.530
 your sweetheart the one on the plate I talk about the 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.350

 yes yes he made a digital micro tula 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.500
 you distract with so I heard you put it on 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.490
 the phone would be a micro transmitter and 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.800
 we will hear everything you speak 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.419
 I do not usually get my training so 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.880
 usual method which I give with the 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.420
 person and I make him die of fear 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.770
 until he sings 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.770
 but test your system
