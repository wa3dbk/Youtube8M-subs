00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello and welcome to this new 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.200
 debrief so today we will talk 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.790
 of fifa 14 since electronic arts has 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.040
 presented the new fifa that's why 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.470
 that I am with vincent oms our 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.150
 vincent house specialist 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.850
 what do you remember from this 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.380
 first presentation of pippa 14 listening 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.330
 brice what I remember most is 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.980
 that for the moment we've seen a lot of 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.449
 changes like every year i 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.830
 want to say electronic arts us 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.630
 shows that the game still had 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.160
 a lot of defects and that he was 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.329
 time to fix some stuff the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.219
 community made him a lot of returns 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.110
 which they took advantage of to make a big 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.250
 spring cleaning in fact then 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.329
 I have a small child 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.070
 parenthesis in relation to what you come 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.960
 to say it's true that precisely for 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.760
 readers who do not know it when 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.160
 of his presentations every year since 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.450
 a few years now 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.730
 electronic art it's a habit of 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.059
 present the defects of the edition 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.469
 previous in saying by presenting a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.180
 little bit low all they were fishing 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.940
 in the previous edition so that's it 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.530
 pretty funny and it's pretty rare when 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.500
 even in the video game to see that but 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.000
 it's still pretty odd 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.290
 highlight its flaws while 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.290
 arnaud before he was only aimed at the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.030
 game was awesome good is what you can 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.930
 to talk to us about including apparently 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.299
 new dribble system so in fact 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.119
 he calls that the wine and bold revolt 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.950
 ocz which makes it the equivalent of the first of 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.420
 control in terms of evolution of the year 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.320
 last one ie that the control to 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.290
 a touch of the ball they had 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.790
 introduced in fifa 13 there actually it's 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.079
 really a system to stop 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.119
 to have cyborgs that make 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.920
 dribbles he easily loses who make 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.630
 bullet thrusts without any problem 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.250
 to go meet massacre attack 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.500
 of guardian there it is finished the cyborgs 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.790
 it's over now we really 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.590
 players who have attitudes 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.000
 realistic with the ball a control of 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.710
 much less perfect ball they 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.050
 can lose the ball actually following 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.940
 a bad contact or following 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.320
 a stream of stats we imagine a roll of die 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.190
 on the stats on that will not be positive 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.930
 so 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.220
 the defense can intervene a little more 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.260
 easily and that's still a 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.180
 big advance compared to cyborgs 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.010
 last year we're going to say yeah because 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.090
 is that really so then that 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.560
 that's what presented you but 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.850
 it is true that there what you present 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.200
 it's a little bit what we are thinking about 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.240
 and already last year telling me 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.800
 everything will not be we will not necessarily 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.340
 robots they may also have missed their 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.260
 control 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.120
 what did they show they 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.650
 would in any case suggest that 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.670
 this year we will really have people 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.500
 who are able to make mistakes 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.000
 on the ground on the ground actually what 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.100
 showed us it's easy to 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.420
 comparative videos you allowed me 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.800
 to realize that the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.820
 essential point we will say about the next 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.010
 fifa it's really not graphics 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.720
 first level brain as May 13 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.000
 really the new animations and the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.080
 novelties that we will talk about 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.240
 the thing is that comparative video 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.100
 is very clear we see the cyborg of cif 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.420
 at 13.6 pushes his balloon without doing 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.250
 to have all the time to the goal and 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.870
 then we see the human being chief at 14 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.950
 whoever he may be a good player who at 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.240
 after a while we miss a check and 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.680
 pushes the ball too much 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.700
 simply 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.110
 and what are you doing 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.850
 intelligence information 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.160
 artificial since it's a little bit 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.090
 managed the essential nucleus of fifa that is 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.980
 what can you tell us about this? 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.690
 yes then of course so in fact lilly has 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.890
 it's one of the big jobs 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.030
 teammates but heard there are some 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.530
 opposing teammates 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.770
 so we imagine but it's not 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.000
 it's not the priority teammates 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.860
 they do not care anything during pressing 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.110
 it's over it's good news 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.250
 the laundry that will be tightened so 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.630
 in fact when the team makes a move 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.430
 whether it's an attack or a defense 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.209
 and especially on a laundry all the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.430
 world is going to put it 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.709
 Well, that's good news 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.510
 appeals in attack will finally be over 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.590
 intelligent one complained during 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.730
 years not have calls in the games 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.750
 football have now that we have the one 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.830
 even more demanding now we want 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.840
 calls that's along the lines 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.160
 to avoid the offside and not do 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.720
 calls made it too easy to 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.250
 deciphering all this is going to be better 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.930
 taken up also there again we saw 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.770
 in video so a priori the system 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.450
 then works I have a great 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.090
 question is a question that a lot 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.310
 of fifa fans arose did you have 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.489
 had the opportunity to see a version on 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.750
 will say next-gen of fifa and well tuned 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.920
 no 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.630
 no i would have liked no 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.730
 unfortunately they concentrated the 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.920
 presentation on only the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.610
 current generations so ps3 xbox 360 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.840
 and pc 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.990
 it should be noted that there is not a 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.910
 presentation of the who the following at 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.770
 mini scandal of a cif to xiii who was 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.490
 in fact a cif to all disguised will do 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.190
 maybe some noise in the 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.580
 nintendo communities and I think that 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.690
 it is quite obvious why we 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.799
 happens to this is that in fact the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.480
 sales figures that were presented 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.070
 are staggering and that on the next gen 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.210
 we may not be the priority any of 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.280
 next and that is maybe a bit early 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.320
 for electronics 15 to present a 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.270
 new technology or a new 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.680
 motor porsche me I think we 're going 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.320
 rather wait until the 3rd or a little later 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.660
 to start seeing info on it 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.880
 very well well we'll leave each other on 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.980
 about this information and you are told to 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.980
 soon on jeuxvideo magazine.com
