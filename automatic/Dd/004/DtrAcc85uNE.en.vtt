you<00:02:01.929> see<00:02:02.170> this<00:02:02.289> on<00:02:02.440> higher-end<00:02:02.830> systems<00:02:03.220> they

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
you see this on higher-end systems they

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.190 
you see this on higher-end systems they
put<00:02:03.970> in<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.179> fan<00:02:04.360> control<00:02:04.720> there<00:02:04.869> as<00:02:05.020> well

also<00:02:05.679> on<00:02:06.160> higher<00:02:06.369> end<00:02:06.520> systems<00:02:06.940> they'll<00:02:07.119> put

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
also on higher end systems they'll put

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.979 
also on higher end systems they'll put
in<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.899> 2.5<00:02:08.739> hot-swappable<00:02:09.729> bay<00:02:10.539> there<00:02:10.840> so

holes you can see here if the twist ties

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.740 
holes you can see here if the twist ties
will<00:04:03.489> go<00:04:03.669> around<00:04:03.939> there<00:04:04.180> as<00:04:04.299> well

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
will go around there as well

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
that I mentioned a second ago is a blue

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.619 
that I mentioned a second ago is a blue
LED<00:04:08.560> one<00:04:09.009> I<00:04:09.220> took<00:04:09.579> out<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:09.970> front<00:04:10.180> panel<00:04:10.509> there

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
LED one I took out the front panel there

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.140 
LED one I took out the front panel there
it<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:10.840> at<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.109> front<00:04:11.379> of<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.650> case<00:04:11.859> and

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
it is at the front of the case and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.439 
it is at the front of the case and
that's<00:04:13.150> pretty<00:04:13.599> much<00:04:13.750> it<00:04:14.409> for<00:04:14.949> the<00:04:15.489> internals

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
that's pretty much it for the internals

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.589 
that's pretty much it for the internals
lots<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:17.759> expansion<00:04:18.759> possibilities<00:04:18.970> you're

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
lots of expansion possibilities you're

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.390 
lots of expansion possibilities you're
not<00:04:19.810> gonna<00:04:19.930> have<00:04:20.139> any<00:04:20.259> problems<00:04:20.709> there<00:04:20.889> with

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
not gonna have any problems there with

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.879 
not gonna have any problems there with
adding<00:04:21.849> a<00:04:21.880> large<00:04:22.389> graphics<00:04:23.020> card<00:04:23.289> I'll<00:04:23.650> take

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
adding a large graphics card I'll take

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.939 
adding a large graphics card I'll take
out<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.159> top<00:04:24.610> panel<00:04:25.539> there<00:04:25.930> at<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.650> top<00:04:26.830> of

out the top panel there at the top of

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.110 
out the top panel there at the top of
the<00:04:27.009> case<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.340> can<00:04:27.490> see<00:04:27.639> what<00:04:27.759> I'm<00:04:27.849> talking

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
the case you can see what I'm talking

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.600 
the case you can see what I'm talking
about<00:04:28.180> when<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:28.840> go<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.050> replace<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.130> add

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
about when you go to replace and add

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.370 
about when you go to replace and add
fans<00:04:30.909> you<00:04:31.150> want<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.419> dust<00:04:31.690> filter<00:04:31.870> there

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
fans you want a dust filter there

fans you want a dust filter there
there's<00:04:33.009> one<00:04:33.130> already<00:04:33.520> included<00:04:34.210> and

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
there's one already included and

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.320 
there's one already included and
obviously<00:04:35.919> if<00:04:36.039> you<00:04:36.159> put<00:04:36.340> in<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.639> liquid<00:04:37.090> cooler

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
obviously if you put in a liquid cooler

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.269 
obviously if you put in a liquid cooler
you<00:04:37.900> want<00:04:38.080> to<00:04:38.169> be<00:04:38.260> able<00:04:38.349> to<00:04:38.500> get<00:04:39.039> in<00:04:39.130> there

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:39.279 
you want to be able to get in there

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.540 
you want to be able to get in there
right

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
right

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.060 
right
so<00:04:39.670> that's<00:04:40.150> why<00:04:40.360> they<00:04:40.540> put<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:40.780> up<00:04:41.770> there<00:04:41.830> so

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
so that's why they put that up there so

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.310 
so that's why they put that up there so
you<00:04:42.250> can<00:04:42.430> get<00:04:42.640> easily<00:04:42.940> to<00:04:43.330> installing<00:04:44.020> things

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
you can get easily to installing things

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.950 
you can get easily to installing things
okay<00:04:44.920> and<00:04:45.010> you<00:04:45.070> can<00:04:45.190> see<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:45.430> can<00:04:45.580> add<00:04:45.700> two

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
okay and you can see you can add two

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.650 
okay and you can see you can add two
120-millimeter<00:04:46.960> of<00:04:47.410> fans<00:04:47.650> or<00:04:47.890> even<00:04:48.190> two<00:04:48.660> 140

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
120-millimeter of fans or even two 140

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.300 
120-millimeter of fans or even two 140
millimeter<00:04:50.050> fans<00:04:50.260> no<00:04:50.470> problem<00:04:50.890> at<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.100> top

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
millimeter fans no problem at the top

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.910 
millimeter fans no problem at the top
and<00:04:51.640> here<00:04:52.270> is<00:04:52.480> a<00:04:52.510> look<00:04:52.870> at<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.290> other<00:04:53.560> side<00:04:53.890> of

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
and here is a look at the other side of

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.260 
and here is a look at the other side of
the<00:04:54.070> case<00:04:54.250> where<00:04:54.490> all<00:04:54.520> your<00:04:54.730> cable<00:04:55.060> management

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
the case where all your cable management

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.150 
the case where all your cable management
all<00:04:55.750> that<00:04:55.930> mess<00:04:56.230> is<00:04:56.410> gonna<00:04:56.560> happen<00:04:56.920> and<00:04:57.040> of

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
all that mess is gonna happen and of

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.890 
all that mess is gonna happen and of
course<00:04:57.400> they've<00:04:57.610> done<00:04:57.730> a<00:04:57.760> good<00:04:57.940> job<00:04:58.000> in<00:04:58.330> giving

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
course they've done a good job in giving

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.080 
course they've done a good job in giving
you<00:04:58.960> lots<00:04:59.170> of<00:04:59.350> holes<00:04:59.650> in<00:04:59.890> areas<00:05:00.280> here<00:05:00.700> where

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
you lots of holes in areas here where

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.480 
you lots of holes in areas here where
you<00:05:01.210> can<00:05:01.390> route<00:05:01.630> all<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.680> stuff<00:05:03.010> through<00:05:03.220> and

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
you can route all the stuff through and

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.310 
you can route all the stuff through and
the<00:05:03.640> twist<00:05:03.880> ties<00:05:04.090> like<00:05:04.720> I<00:05:04.840> mentioned<00:05:05.260> earlier

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
the twist ties like I mentioned earlier

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.830 
the twist ties like I mentioned earlier
can<00:05:05.770> go<00:05:06.160> along<00:05:06.370> there<00:05:06.670> a<00:05:06.970> little<00:05:07.360> bit<00:05:07.570> of<00:05:07.660> room

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
can go along there a little bit of room

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.170 
can go along there a little bit of room
of<00:05:08.080> course<00:05:08.440> to<00:05:08.920> maneuver<00:05:09.250> between<00:05:09.640> the<00:05:09.790> panel

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
of course to maneuver between the panel

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.980 
of course to maneuver between the panel
and<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:12.100> board<00:05:12.370> so<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.570> know<00:05:13.690> you've<00:05:13.960> got

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
and the board so you know you've got

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.110 
and the board so you know you've got
enough<00:05:14.440> room<00:05:14.590> here<00:05:14.650> for<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:15.070> CPU<00:05:15.520> cooler<00:05:15.910> and
