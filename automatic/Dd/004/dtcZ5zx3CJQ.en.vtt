Bobby Labonte do what can Carl Edwards

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.699 
Bobby Labonte do what can Carl Edwards
do<00:02:28.150> because<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:28.600> all<00:02:28.750> know<00:02:28.930> Jimmie<00:02:29.260> Johnson's

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709

friend is Carl Edwards if Carl can hold
Jimmie<00:02:35.680> Johnson<00:02:36.100> up<00:02:36.250> if<00:02:36.430> Ryan<00:02:36.670> Newman<00:02:36.970> can

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120

Jimmie Johnson up if Ryan Newman can
hold<00:02:37.269> Jimmie<00:02:37.540> Johnson<00:02:37.959> up<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.320> Bobby<00:02:38.859> could

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100
