00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
that is why we do so much drafting in

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.880 
that is why we do so much drafting in
actually<00:01:39.759> even<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.060> feedlot<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.659> farm<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.619> to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
actually even a feedlot on farm is to

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.190 
actually even a feedlot on farm is to
trying<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.640> better<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.420> quality<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:44.110> the

so this is where the journey begins for

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.010 
so this is where the journey begins for
these<00:02:00.729> sheep<00:02:01.060> button<00:02:01.509> it'll<00:02:01.659> be<00:02:01.810> at<00:02:01.990> least
