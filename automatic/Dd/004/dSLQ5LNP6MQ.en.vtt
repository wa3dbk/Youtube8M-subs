know<00:01:51.950> once<00:01:52.160> you<00:01:52.340> start<00:01:52.850> stepping<00:01:53.149> away<00:01:53.240> for

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
know once you start stepping away for

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.880 
know once you start stepping away for
long<00:01:53.600> enough<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:53.960> start<00:01:54.020> losing<00:01:54.320> that<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:54.800> you

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.660 
but I think it's been fun you know I
think<00:02:57.409> we're<00:02:57.650> making<00:02:57.769> progress<00:02:57.920> really<00:02:58.400> well

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
think we're making progress really well

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.940 
think we're making progress really well
and<00:02:58.939> I<00:02:59.180> think<00:02:59.659> by<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.290> time<00:03:00.319> Anaheim<00:03:00.769> one

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
and I think by the time Anaheim one

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.110 
and I think by the time Anaheim one
comes<00:03:01.159> around<00:03:01.430> we're<00:03:01.549> going<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.730> be<00:03:01.819> ready<00:03:02.000> to

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
comes around we're going to be ready to

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.720 
comes around we're going to be ready to
go<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.450> ready<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.890> give<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.099> give<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.549> shot

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
go and ready to give it give it a shot

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.059 
go and ready to give it give it a shot

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
so that's the next time or as say the

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.099 
so that's the next time or as say the
first<00:03:07.250> time<00:03:07.459> we'll<00:03:07.609> see<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:07.760> racing<00:03:08.060> KTM<00:03:08.420> yes

the monster monster cup coming up and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.339 
the monster monster cup coming up and
all<00:03:13.040> its<00:03:13.219> it's<00:03:13.639> hard<00:03:13.879> to<00:03:14.000> say<00:03:14.180> because<00:03:14.420> it's<00:03:15.200> so

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
all its it's hard to say because it's so

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.479

a<00:03:37.760> rider<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.329> just<00:03:39.079> I<00:03:39.349> think<00:03:39.739> approach<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:40.760> like

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
a rider I just I think approach it like

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.909 
a rider I just I think approach it like
we<00:03:41.750> always<00:03:41.930> have<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.379> know<00:03:42.409> november

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
we always have you know november

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.979 
we always have you know november
december<00:03:43.010> start<00:03:43.579> getting<00:03:43.819> ready<00:03:43.939> just<00:03:44.780> be<00:03:44.900> as

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
december start getting ready just be as

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.020 
december start getting ready just be as
ready<00:03:45.169> as<00:03:45.260> i<00:03:45.379> possibly<00:03:45.739> can<00:03:45.799> for<00:03:46.370> Anaheim<00:03:46.849> one

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
ready as i possibly can for Anaheim one

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.509 
ready as i possibly can for Anaheim one
and<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.359> know<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.510> think<00:03:48.010> every<00:03:49.010> season<00:03:49.219> brings

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
and you know I think every season brings

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.190 
and you know I think every season brings
different<00:03:49.700> challenges<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:50.629> forth<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.139> I

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
different challenges and so forth so I

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.839 
different challenges and so forth so I
think<00:03:51.260> all<00:03:51.590> we<00:03:51.799> can<00:03:51.949> do<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.069> be<00:03:52.280> ready<00:03:52.430> for<00:03:52.669> that

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
think all we can do is be ready for that

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.759 
think all we can do is be ready for that
and<00:03:52.879> and<00:03:53.510> just<00:03:53.840> keep<00:03:54.019> keep<00:03:54.500> her<00:03:54.590> head<00:03:54.739> down

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
and and just keep keep her head down

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.920 
and and just keep keep her head down
keep<00:03:54.949> plugging<00:03:55.489> away<00:03:55.609> you<00:03:55.790> know<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:56.030> think<00:03:56.150> last

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
keep plugging away you know I think last

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.930 
keep plugging away you know I think last
year<00:03:57.079> was<00:03:57.560> last<00:03:57.799> year<00:03:58.040> we<00:03:58.190> had<00:03:58.220> quite<00:03:58.699> a<00:03:58.790> bit

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
year was last year we had quite a bit

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.640 
year was last year we had quite a bit
adversity<00:03:59.269> we<00:03:59.510> had<00:03:59.629> to<00:03:59.690> overcome<00:04:00.049> but<00:04:00.319> you

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
adversity we had to overcome but you

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.259 
adversity we had to overcome but you
know<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:00.919> was<00:04:01.040> it's<00:04:01.310> what<00:04:01.489> it<00:04:01.579> was<00:04:01.729> and<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.060> think

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
know it was it's what it was and I think

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.780 
know it was it's what it was and I think
as<00:04:02.419> a<00:04:02.780> rider<00:04:03.109> it<00:04:03.500> shapes<00:04:04.189> you<00:04:04.370> for<00:04:04.549> you<00:04:04.639> for

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
as a rider it shapes you for you for

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.330 
as a rider it shapes you for you for
your<00:04:05.000> future<00:04:05.269> so<00:04:05.599> I<00:04:05.629> think<00:04:05.900> just<00:04:06.889> apply<00:04:07.129> what<00:04:07.310> I

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
your future so I think just apply what I

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.250 
your future so I think just apply what I
learned<00:04:07.370> last<00:04:07.760> year<00:04:07.939> and<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.479> put<00:04:08.989> that<00:04:09.139> to

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
learned last year and and put that to

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.890 
learned last year and and put that to
the<00:04:09.290> test<00:04:09.379> and<00:04:09.859> get<00:04:10.400> ready<00:04:10.519> last<00:04:11.359> question<00:04:11.750> how
