00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.800
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.690
 from her pc 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.610
 my name is niklas and i'll show you 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.190
 Today, the Tourino Schein ebook 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.500
 again the collaboration of thalia 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.850
 world picture club bertelsmann and the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.529
 telekom was brought out 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.349
 yes let's start with the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.060
 unpack the good piece 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.070
 Here we see him directly 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.690
 is currently still in sleep mode 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.430
 we will change but the same 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.370
 Once we have the accessories 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.489
 have looked at this field while relatively 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.660
 spartan but well too much 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.910
 you do not need his e 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.379
 We would have to operate book reader 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.250
 once as we already see up here 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.699
 a quick guide then another 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.219
 warranty card and finally that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.079
 USB cable to the e book reader with the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.690
 pc to connect under loud the battery too 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.010
 load 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.690
 after looking at the accessories 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.409
 Let's take a look at the ebook 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.780
 again 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.869
 here we see him already he has a 6 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.880
 inch display namely via display 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.340
 which are with 1024 x 768 9 58 pixels 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.619
 It dissolves consists of plastic power 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.049
 but still a very well made 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.240
 impression up here we have the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.340
 Lock button and still the lighting 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.380
 button with which you can half the display 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.750
 in a dark room yet but illuminate 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.939
 the homebutton and on the bottom 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.400
 of the 190 gram lightweight ebook readers 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.850
 Then we have a reset button 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.740
 USB port and still the micro sd 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.310
 card slot with which the memory 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.310
 expand 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.759
 Let's try the function 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.979
 we will wake up tourino bill 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.390
 Let's see them here 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.369
 directly the start screen is up 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.920
 our library and we see directly 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.899
 the weltbild shop we go now once 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.890
 short in the library are three books 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.560
 already preinstalled 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.520
 Of course you can do it all 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.590
 sorry the whole can of course 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.149
 again after different 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.680
 sort categories and features or 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.430
 in different forms of presentation 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.890
 Show and see how you see 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.810
 So that displays really outstanding 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.390
 is very good for reading it 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.409
 now in the dark or in the light 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.209
 you still have to darken the 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.260
 possibility over the upper right button 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.379
 as I said before 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.069
 to turn on the backlight 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:31.560
 yes and a big one before but at the same time 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.889
 also disadvantage is that depending on where you are 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.139
 the tulio sparkle you just buy the 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:40.170
 respective shop of the supplier directly 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.909
 has linked and that is of course to 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.590
 one of the advantages that you directly over 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.569
 The tulio seem new ebook itself 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.470
 can relate 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.060
 On the other hand, it also has the disadvantage 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.590
 that one then always on the job 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.299
 instructed is always one has chosen 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.189
 of course it can be that at 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.489
 thalia a larger selection prevails in 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.659
 worldview or there the prices turn 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.989
 in some books then maybe 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.129
 cheaper than it is the case here 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.189
 yes in the shop itself you can stop too 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.590
 arrange again according to categories and yes 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.540
 as always with stars like Amazon 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.370
 Ratings others you can recognize 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.579
 how the books are rated by others 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.799
 The whole thing was here with the shop 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.530
 actually works relatively easily 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.349
 and straightforward 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.449
 but now we want to conclude 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.349
 a little bit on the attitude 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.269
 enter 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.760
 up here on the left is the button 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.250
 so we can for the settings 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.269
 Among other things again hold devices 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.290
 make adjustments like that 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.060
 brightness control 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.470
 you see that a degree 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.269
 the backlight starts the 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.470
 you could still open another here 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.509
 factory settings the device again 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.519
 reset and here we will see 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:52.079
 still the memory four gigabyte memory 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.669
 owns the device of it 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.919
 but only two communes gigabytes 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:59.159
 be used for e-books the rest is 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.989
 keep on the system and thanks to the 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.699
 We also have telekom cooperation 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.810
 telekom cloud there can be up to 25 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:08.639
 gigabytes of data will be outsourced and 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.620
 We also have access to 11,000 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.329
 hotspots of telekom in germany 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.620
 Which is cool, of course 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.489
 sometimes on the way again a new one 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.190
 ebook can download roses 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.019
 you as you also see with the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.759
 however, this is the death certificate 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.629
 as a nice gimmick to look at 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:29.550
 really useful feature for an e 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:33.030
 book readers just stop to e 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.430
 book reading thought and not for surfing 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.849
 on the internet that's more of a tablet 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.129
 but if it does, maybe 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.800
 on the way wlan network finds and briefly what 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.789
 of course, that's natural 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.780
 a nice addition and as you can see 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.979
 you will see it right when we 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.720
 call our page 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.110
 it will take a while 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.590
 pretty long and loads now 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.180
 accordingly slow compared to 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.340
 right tablet what the side already 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.900
 would have built up long otherwise 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.340
 In addition, Tourino shines to say that 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.319
 He all popular ebook format 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.520
 supports this include, among others 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:15.479
 the epub format and the pdf format that 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.770
 whole then without and with adobe drm 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.690
 So the digital rights management 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.930
 which then stops synonymous with third-party providers 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.849
 also e-books can be purchased and 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.009
 This then very simple via USB cable 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:33.509
 on the turiner seem over copied 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:35.159
 will be able to become so in ours 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.810
 short test has the turiner seem 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:38.520
 he left a really good impression 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.190
 is a worthy competition to Amazon 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.500
 kindle and moves with 100 euros 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.169
 purchase price exactly between the Amazon 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.979
 kindle costs around 80 euros and the 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.819
 amazon kindle paperworld it was 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.500
 again from me 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:54.690
