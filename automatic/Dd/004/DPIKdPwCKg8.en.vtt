00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
could do that you can call our own fun

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.670 
could do that you can call our own fun
that's<00:00:20.130> perfect<00:00:20.760> color<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.210> but<00:00:22.170> today<00:00:22.560> in

this tutorial I'm going to show you how

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.359 
this tutorial I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:24.180> conquer<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.810> blunts<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.099> pencil

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
to conquer the blunts and with a pencil

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.830 
to conquer the blunts and with a pencil
now<00:00:26.789> since<00:00:27.090> there's<00:00:27.269> nothing<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.810> really

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
now since there's nothing we can really

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.830 
now since there's nothing we can really
do<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.260> what<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.710> need<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.630> snap<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
do that what we need to do is snap the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.639 
do that what we need to do is snap the
pencil<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.890> will<00:00:32.070> create<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.820> nice<00:00:33.649> blunt

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
pencil and this will create a nice blunt

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.940 
pencil and this will create a nice blunt
edge<00:00:35.059> see<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:37.050> now<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.559> something<00:00:37.739> we

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
edge see and now this is something we

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.680 
edge see and now this is something we
can<00:00:38.129> work<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.270> still<00:00:39.450> can't

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
can work with because we still can't

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.569 
can work with because we still can't
draw<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.460> hey<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> see<00:00:42.989> no<00:00:43.309> that's<00:00:44.309> not

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
draw on it hey with it see no that's not

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.209 
draw on it hey with it see no that's not
used<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.969> book<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.350> need<00:00:46.620> one<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.010> two

used to book so you need one of two

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.910 
used to book so you need one of two
things<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.789> ever<00:00:47.940> need<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.480> these<00:00:48.920> sharp

enough<00:00:55.260> things<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.399> birds<00:00:56.760> use<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> yeah<00:00:58.890> for

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
enough things that birds use so yeah for

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.619 
enough things that birds use so yeah for
this<00:00:59.280> tutorial<00:00:59.520> I'm<00:01:00.000> not<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.420> use<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
this tutorial I'm not going to use the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.880 
this tutorial I'm not going to use the
pencil<00:01:00.870> sharp<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.590> use<00:01:01.649> this

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
pencil sharp and I'm going to use this

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.219 
pencil sharp and I'm going to use this
because<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.399> got<00:01:02.489> much<00:01:02.760> faster<00:01:03.270> much<00:01:03.510> more

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
because it's got much faster much more

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.260 
because it's got much faster much more
efficient<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.070> lasts<00:01:05.489> much<00:01:05.820> longer<00:01:05.850> than

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
efficient and it lasts much longer than

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.179 
efficient and it lasts much longer than
those<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.869> that's<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.409> blade<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.159> blade

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
those because that's a blade the blade

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.820 
those because that's a blade the blade
goes<00:01:08.700> blunt<00:01:09.119> after<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.600> while<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.770> is

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
goes blunt after a while but this is

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.850 
goes blunt after a while but this is
paper<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.030> much<00:01:12.510> better<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.619> got

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
paper and it's much better so we got

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.499 
paper and it's much better so we got
there<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.220> slowly<00:01:15.049> rub<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.170> along<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.650> this

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
there just slowly rub it along like this

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.920 
there just slowly rub it along like this
and<00:01:18.530> after<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.710> while<00:01:19.920> you'll<00:01:20.340> start<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.900> get<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and after a while you'll start to get a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.609 
and after a while you'll start to get a
nice<00:01:24.020> sharp<00:01:25.020> edge<00:01:26.869> we<00:01:27.869> go<00:01:28.020> starting<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.530> get

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
nice sharp edge we go starting to get

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.010 
nice sharp edge we go starting to get
nice<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.829> smooth<00:01:29.220> now

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.700 

I'm<00:01:34.710> just

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.630 

see<00:01:38.710> it's<00:01:38.859> getting<00:01:39.100> better<00:01:39.280> it's<00:01:39.579> getting

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
see it's getting better it's getting

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:57.179 
see it's getting better it's getting
better<00:01:41.549> speed<00:01:42.549> this<00:01:42.670> up<00:01:42.729> for<00:01:55.140> moi<00:01:56.140> la<00:01:56.380> there

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
better speed this up for moi la there

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.609 
better speed this up for moi la there
you<00:01:57.280> have<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.520> nice<00:01:57.969> close-up<00:01:58.600> if<00:01:59.319> you're<00:01:59.469> nice

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
you have it nice close-up if you're nice

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.279 
you have it nice close-up if you're nice
sharp<00:02:00.250> pencil<00:02:00.819> where<00:02:00.969> you<00:02:01.060> can<00:02:01.179> go<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.390> do

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
sharp pencil where you can go and do

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.699 
sharp pencil where you can go and do
your<00:02:02.740> art<00:02:03.039> degree<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:04.329> we<00:02:05.079> go<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.409> prove<00:02:05.679> that

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
your art degree so we go to prove that

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.249 
your art degree so we go to prove that
it<00:02:05.979> actually<00:02:06.130> works<00:02:06.549> you'll<00:02:07.420> see<00:02:07.959> it's<00:02:08.110> nice

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
it actually works you'll see it's nice

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.569 
it actually works you'll see it's nice
and<00:02:08.319> fine<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.920> now<00:02:09.399> say<00:02:10.239> it's<00:02:10.390> all<00:02:10.509> efficient

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
and fine and now say it's all efficient

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.539 
and fine and now say it's all efficient
are<00:02:12.579> you<00:02:12.730> can<00:02:12.880> draw<00:02:13.650> I'll<00:02:14.650> get<00:02:14.769> started<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.370> my

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
are you can draw I'll get started on my

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.480 
are you can draw I'll get started on my
degree<00:02:16.030> work
