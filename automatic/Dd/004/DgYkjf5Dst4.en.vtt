hands<00:00:47.789> home<00:00:47.940> all<00:00:48.480> right<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> handheld

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
hands home all right so it is a handheld

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.860 
hands home all right so it is a handheld
device<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.370> form<00:00:50.700> factor<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.239> obviously<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> big

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
device so form factor is obviously a big

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.380 
device so form factor is obviously a big
consideration<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> pictures<00:00:54.300> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
consideration and from the pictures that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.959 
consideration and from the pictures that
I've<00:00:54.539> seen<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.350> looks<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.039> little<00:00:56.250> clunky

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
I've seen of it it looks a little clunky

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.849 
I've seen of it it looks a little clunky
it<00:00:57.180> seems<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> buttons<00:00:58.350> there's<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.710> lot

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it seems like the buttons there's a lot

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.590 
it seems like the buttons there's a lot
of<00:00:58.890> space<00:00:59.190> between<00:00:59.520> them<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> edges<00:01:00.570> of

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
of space between them and the edges of

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.779 
of space between them and the edges of
the<00:01:00.809> device<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.890> does<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.190> actually<00:01:02.219> play

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the device so it does it actually play

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.460 
the device so it does it actually play
well<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.090> your<00:01:03.329> hand<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:03.719> first<00:01:03.989> glance<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.379> is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
well in your hand at first glance it is

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.810 
well in your hand at first glance it is
a<00:01:04.500> little<00:01:04.680> strange<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.129> once<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.400> pick<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.700> up

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
a little strange but once you pick it up

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.539 
a little strange but once you pick it up
it<00:01:05.970> feels<00:01:06.150> pretty<00:01:06.479> good<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> center

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
it feels pretty good the so the center

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.070 
it feels pretty good the so the center
of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> controller<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.210> bit<00:01:09.360> recessed<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
of the controller is a bit recessed and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.170 
of the controller is a bit recessed and
at<00:01:10.860> first<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.369> does<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.820> kind<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
at first that does you kind of have to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
at first that does you kind of have to
clean<00:01:12.390> your<00:01:12.479> hands<00:01:12.659> forward<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.080> bit

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
clean your hands forward a little bit

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.440 
clean your hands forward a little bit
but<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:13.740> actually<00:01:13.950> very<00:01:14.189> good<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
but it's really actually very good the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.719 
but it's really actually very good the
one<00:01:15.659> difference<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.530> notable<00:01:16.860> problem<00:01:17.520> is

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
one difference one notable problem is

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.070 
one difference one notable problem is
the<00:01:17.939> d-pad<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.479> they're<00:01:18.600> still<00:01:18.780> working<00:01:18.869> on

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the d-pad but they're still working on

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.120 
the d-pad but they're still working on
that<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.619> still<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.830> pre-production

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
that this is still a pre-production

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.580 
that this is still a pre-production
model<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:21.720> stiff<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.170> everything

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
model it's a little stiff but everything

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.660 
model it's a little stiff but everything
else<00:01:22.710> felt<00:01:22.890> really<00:01:23.009> good<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.340> sticks<00:01:23.580> were

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
else felt really good the sticks were

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.850 
else felt really good the sticks were
great<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:24.509> were<00:01:24.570> sort<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.110> orbs<00:01:25.619> with

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
great they were sort of on orbs with

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
great they were sort of on orbs with
little<00:01:26.100> foam<00:01:26.280> pads<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.880> would<00:01:27.000> rotate

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
little foam pads so you would rotate

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.969 
little foam pads so you would rotate
around<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> stick<00:01:28.380> necessarily

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
around so it's not a stick necessarily

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.280 
around so it's not a stick necessarily
but<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.340> same<00:01:29.460> function<00:01:29.909> okay<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.960> so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
but it's the same function okay and so

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.289 
but it's the same function okay and so
this<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.619> an<00:01:31.770> Android<00:01:32.250> device<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
this is an Android device is it the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
sure in that order how it would work the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.770 
sure in that order how it would work the
way<00:02:42.220> we<00:02:42.250> did<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.670> was<00:02:42.850> we<00:02:43.150> started<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.570> game<00:02:43.660> on

way we did it was we started the game on

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.810 
way we did it was we started the game on
a<00:02:43.810> handheld<00:02:44.110> as<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:45.010> was<00:02:45.130> playing<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.550> noticed

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
a handheld as I was playing it I noticed

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.979 
a handheld as I was playing it I noticed
he<00:02:45.880> glanced<00:02:46.330> over<00:02:46.390> his<00:02:46.600> shoulder<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
he glanced over his shoulder the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.030 
he glanced over his shoulder the
gentleman<00:02:47.320> doubling<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:47.860> he<00:02:47.950> was

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
gentleman doubling it and he was

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.680 
gentleman doubling it and he was
watching<00:02:48.220> me<00:02:48.489> play<00:02:48.610> on<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.820> screen<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.660> I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
watching me play on the screen so I

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.540 
watching me play on the screen so I
imagine<00:02:49.930> there<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.739> can<00:02:50.920> actually<00:02:51.250> jump<00:02:51.400> out

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
imagine there you can actually jump out

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.979 
imagine there you can actually jump out
of<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.700> game<00:02:51.820> on<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.000> Android<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.600> then<00:02:52.810> if

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
of the game on the Android and then if

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.350 
of the game on the Android and then if
you<00:02:53.080> wanted<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.500> jump<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.700> computer<00:02:55.300> and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
you wanted to jump on the computer and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.580 
you wanted to jump on the computer and
keep<00:02:55.510> playing<00:02:55.600> but<00:02:55.840> we<00:02:56.140> didn't<00:02:56.350> demo<00:02:56.560> that

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
keep playing but we didn't demo that

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.590 
keep playing but we didn't demo that
specifically<00:02:57.250> but<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.120> seems<00:02:58.300> within<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
specifically but it seems within the

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.390 
specifically but it seems within the
realm<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.840> possibility<00:02:59.380> so<00:02:59.769> if<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.040> steam

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
realm of possibility so if the steam

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.920

with<00:03:03.730> valve<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.970> little<00:03:04.209> bit<00:03:04.330> some<00:03:04.959> of<00:03:05.050> this

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
with valve a little bit some of this

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.080 
with valve a little bit some of this
went<00:03:05.320> back<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.680> their<00:03:05.950> assistance<00:03:06.340> making

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
went back to their assistance making

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.350 
went back to their assistance making
Linux<00:03:07.390> drivers<00:03:07.720> for<00:03:07.959> a<00:03:07.989> lot<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.260> Valve's<00:03:08.530> games

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
Linux drivers for a lot of Valve's games

this<00:03:10.360> isn't<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.810> steam<00:03:11.610> native<00:03:12.610> device<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:13.390> it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
this isn't a steam native device but it

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.180 
this isn't a steam native device but it
supports<00:03:13.660> steam<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.350> that's<00:03:14.800> with<00:03:14.980> some

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
supports steam and that's with some

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.620 
supports steam and that's with some
cooperation<00:03:15.610> with<00:03:15.880> valve<00:03:16.060> but<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.510> what

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
cooperation with valve but to what

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.540 
cooperation with valve but to what
extent<00:03:16.900> we're<00:03:17.200> not<00:03:17.320> really<00:03:17.500> sure<00:03:17.560> yet<00:03:17.860> okay<00:03:18.340> so

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
extent we're not really sure yet okay so

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.580 
extent we're not really sure yet okay so
overall<00:03:19.060> what<00:03:19.720> did<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:19.959> think<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.320> device

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
overall what did you think of the device

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.520 
overall what did you think of the device
does<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:20.920> seem<00:03:21.100> like<00:03:21.250> too<00:03:22.000> little<00:03:22.570> too<00:03:22.930> late<00:03:22.959> in

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
does it seem like too little too late in

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.100 
does it seem like too little too late in
terms<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.250> know<00:03:24.450> handheld<00:03:25.450> devices<00:03:25.750> and

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
terms of you know handheld devices and

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.600 
terms of you know handheld devices and
tablets<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.650> things<00:03:26.830> like<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.010> or<00:03:27.370> do<00:03:27.519> you

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
tablets and things like that or do you

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.860 
tablets and things like that or do you
think<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:27.940> this<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.090> actually<00:03:28.330> gonna<00:03:28.570> carve

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
think that this is actually gonna carve

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.360 
think that this is actually gonna carve
out<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.019> niche<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.560> think<00:03:29.950> it's<00:03:30.040> going<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.220> carve

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
out a niche I think it's going to carve

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.680 
out a niche I think it's going to carve
out<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.519> bit<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.820> niche<00:03:31.000> it's<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.510> first

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
out a bit of a niche it's the first

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.110 
out a bit of a niche it's the first
device<00:03:31.989> of<00:03:32.200> its<00:03:32.260> kind<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.860> Android<00:03:33.730> part<00:03:34.030> of

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
device of its kind the Android part of

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.090 
device of its kind the Android part of
it<00:03:34.239> is<00:03:34.360> pretty<00:03:35.230> typical<00:03:35.410> it's<00:03:35.799> just<00:03:36.010> like

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
it is pretty typical it's just like

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.350 
it is pretty typical it's just like
you've<00:03:36.250> got<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.430> smartphone<00:03:37.000> with<00:03:37.330> a

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
you've got a smartphone with a

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.840 
you've got a smartphone with a
controller<00:03:37.720> attached<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.380> yeah<00:03:38.620> but<00:03:39.250> the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
controller attached to it yeah but the

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.130 
controller attached to it yeah but the
really<00:03:40.000> exciting<00:03:40.269> part<00:03:40.600> is<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.810> streaming

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
really exciting part is the streaming

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.380 
really exciting part is the streaming
games<00:03:41.230> from<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.560> pc<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.640> latency<00:03:43.030> was<00:03:43.180> really

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
games from the pc the latency was really

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.210 
games from the pc the latency was really
low<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:44.019> video<00:03:44.260> compression<00:03:44.650> was<00:03:44.950> almost

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
low the video compression was almost

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.420 
low the video compression was almost
unnoticeable<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:47.160> for<00:03:48.160> all<00:03:48.220> intensive

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
unnoticeable and for all intensive

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.620 
unnoticeable and for all intensive
purposes<00:03:48.550> a<00:03:48.880> looked<00:03:49.090> great<00:03:49.270> in<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.420> played

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
purposes a looked great in a played

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.440 
purposes a looked great in a played
grade<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.050> I<00:03:50.110> was<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.440> was<00:03:50.620> impressed

grade and I was I was impressed

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.240 
grade and I was I was impressed
I<00:03:51.510> think<00:03:52.200> once<00:03:52.349> they<00:03:52.500> really<00:03:52.770> get<00:03:52.890> this<00:03:53.010> thing

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
I think once they really get this thing

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.240 
I think once they really get this thing
get<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.670> controls<00:03:54.000> figured<00:03:54.330> out<00:03:54.950> just<00:03:55.950> that

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
get the controls figured out just that

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.589 
get the controls figured out just that
last<00:03:56.489> little<00:03:56.610> bit<00:03:56.879> you<00:03:57.150> know<00:03:57.209> it's<00:03:57.450> going<00:03:57.540> to

last little bit you know it's going to

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:58.640 
last little bit you know it's going to
be<00:03:57.720> really<00:03:57.840> good<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.260> are<00:03:58.379> they<00:03:58.500> talking

price but he said it's going to be

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.250 
price but he said it's going to be
priced<00:04:05.519> as<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.819> mobile<00:04:06.510> device<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:07.140> could

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
priced as a mobile device so you could

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.229 
priced as a mobile device so you could
imagine<00:04:07.319> a<00:04:07.890> typical<00:04:08.489> portable<00:04:08.819> game<00:04:08.940> machine

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
imagine a typical portable game machine

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.809 
imagine a typical portable game machine
or<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.510> cell<00:04:09.720> phone<00:04:09.959> anywhere<00:04:10.319> from<00:04:10.610> 200<00:04:11.610> maybe

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
or a cell phone anywhere from 200 maybe

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.360 
or a cell phone anywhere from 200 maybe
the<00:04:12.000> hot<00:04:12.120> top<00:04:12.330> end<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.630> 500<00:04:13.200> hopefully<00:04:14.190> not

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
the hot top end of 500 hopefully not

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.589 
the hot top end of 500 hopefully not
beyond<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.880> because<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.090> think<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.360> would

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
beyond that because I think that would

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.060 
beyond that because I think that would
then<00:04:15.720> breach<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.290> sort<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.560> threshold<00:04:16.709> where

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
then breach the sort of threshold where

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.110 
then breach the sort of threshold where
people<00:04:17.340> might<00:04:17.430> actually<00:04:17.609> purchase<00:04:18.000> this

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
people might actually purchase this

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.479 
people might actually purchase this
thing<00:04:18.329> cool<00:04:18.959> sounds<00:04:19.410> good<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:20.250> that's<00:04:20.400> your
