00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.330
 for more than 40 years people everywhere 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.969
 of the world have explored the metal and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.430
 many of its subgenres during these 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.529
 years the metal has been tyrannized creating 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.320
 stories and theories around this 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.480
 after so many errors of appreciation I think 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.490
 that it is important that people 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.890
 understand what it really is like 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.430
 these are 10 myths about metal and 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.259
 truth that comes with them myth the 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.269
 genre is called heavy metal 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.430
 most people believe that the 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.410
 music characterized by hard screams and 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.870
 very distorted guitars is heavy 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.239
 metal in today's metal has 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.729
 hundreds of subgenres and heavy metal 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.039
 it's just one of them bands like led 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.629
 zeppelin black sabbath or horsehair showed 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.479
 the way for metal bands 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.399
 creating a unique sound but while 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.320
 that these bands can be called 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.690
 heavy metal a large majority of not 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.879
 metalheads especially elderly and 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.250
 young women refer to all the 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.120
 rock music like heavy metal simply 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.940
 for not knowing the gender 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.980
 myth the metal musicians are fanatics 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.909
 ignorant who are not able to 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.670
 compose witty lyrics 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.770
 another mistake most people see 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.409
 the letters and metal music as 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.329
 simple and stupid actually 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.880
 Most metal musicians are so 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.770
 smart or more than the common people 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.990
 very concrete that are capable of 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.750
 write lyrics and music deep and 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.149
 significant for example the band of 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.740
 black metal battery inspires much 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.590
 of his music in composers 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.900
 Classic most metal letters 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.480
 They are surprisingly elaborate 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.610
 myth the metal is against the 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.680
 religion 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.900
 most opinions of the no 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.330
 metalheads has the belief that this 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.310
 gender goes against religion but 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.310
 is not entirely true since in its 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.840
 Most metal is not anti-religious 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.580
 but very often it is against the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.370
 Christianity or the ways of 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.920
 christianity however many artists 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.560
 of the metal are religious as the band 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.530
 American metalcore ashley dying 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.300
 or deivid training of disturbed you could 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.130
 say that religion is not very 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.530
 appreciated in the metal but it's not 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.900
 I absolutely hate although there are exceptions 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.900
 to all the rules as everything 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.249
 myth the metal promotes Satanism 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.650
 the genre of music that has numerous 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:35.629
 satanic characteristics in their subjects and 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.909
 the use of referring images is called 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.579
 black metal that is derived from the album 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.290
 trash black metal of the group good although 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.780
 some groups of the tea trash metal 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.599
 as slayer cannibal corts or more biden 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.879
 yen assume very satanic characteristics 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.639
 few musicians of these subgenres have 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.290
 actually these beliefs and those that the 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.340
 practice they tend to try not to 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.010
 promote the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.150
 myth the metal promotes activities 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.489
 criminals like murder 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.590
 while a few people in the 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.390
 metal community have been involved 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.030
 in some crime only one case has 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.610
 relevant result and is that of barbie 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.439
 kearns the most metal groups that 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.689
 they have violent content in their lyrics 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.459
 or use disturbing images have 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.220
 declared that its content should not be 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.230
 be taken seriously in that regard the most 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.689
 remarkable would be cannibal corts that are 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.700
 famous for their lyrics which are usually 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.650
 be complex and with representations 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.540
 horrible death murder and 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.670
 sexual fetishism 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.670
 myth the metal is sexist 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.150
 although it seems that much of the metal 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.370
 especially at the end of the decade 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.469
 the eighties would have been written for 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.049
 trivialize sexual relations already 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:51.180
 women now its incidence is much 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.489
 less common and many bands 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.129
 especially in genres like black 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.790
 green and a metal avoid touching themes 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.400
 referring to sex completely 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:07.110
 myth the metal musicians have 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.420
 racist or neo-Nazi fascist tendencies 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.520
 while many musicians say that 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.160
 believe that certain races or ethnic groups 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.750
 are better or worse than others and 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.359
 while some have beliefs 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.790
 legitimate about this is more common than 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.010
 be just a pose on stage a 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.140
 good example of this is the former vocalist 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.240
 gorgoroth gal who is not only 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.550
 homosexual but he has declared his 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.800
 racist points of view but that is not 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.370
 he takes it seriously and avoids not expressing them 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:39.250
 openly 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.250
 myth the metal is bad for children 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.580
 much of the metal is geared to 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.680
 children and adolescents as a way 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.540
 less serious to face the stress that 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.120
 the other available means generate 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.160
 although people can say that the metal 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.110
 poisons the minds of our children there 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.420
 to keep in mind that these people 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.090
 they are usually very closed of mind towards 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.950
 gender and do not understand it today 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.930
 there are other genres that do contribute 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.360
 negatively with content letters 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.610
 inappropriate and that are very widespread 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.240
 among children even encouraged by 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.759
 your own parents 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.280
 myth the metal has no ability to 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.560
 execution 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.630
 any professional in music will 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.580
 I could say that metal and jazz are 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.190
 two of the most difficult genres of 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.410
 execute and although it seems that the musicians 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.480
 of the metal tend to writhe while 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.760
 shield behind the distortion the 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.520
 fast riffs and extreme execution in 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.040
 the percussions are almost always 100% 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.889
 without any actual material 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.200
 synthesized the subgenres that tend to 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.290
 modify your music digitally are the 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.060
 metalcore industrial and green almost everything 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:52.030
 the rest is legitimate 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.030
 myth the metal alone are voices screaming 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.870
 if you like metal maybe you've heard 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.870
 comment someone can not sing 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.880
 really that really bothers us 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.800
 to the metalheads since it is a fact that 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.980
 metal voices are extremely 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.020
 difficult and although it seems to be executed 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.080
 effortlessly the metal voice is very 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.960
 ranging from grunts to screams and 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.750
 everything else is very complicated before such 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.740
 appreciation the answer is simple 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.740
 it's just different
