00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
know what an OPD prison server it is

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.800 
know what an OPD prison server it is
I'll<00:00:15.360> explain<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:17.160> basically<00:00:17.550> there<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.420> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
I'll explain it so basically there is a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.109 
I'll explain it so basically there is a
variety<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.500> mines<00:00:19.859> or<00:00:20.250> containing<00:00:20.670> lots<00:00:20.939> of

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
variety of mines or containing lots of

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.570 
variety of mines or containing lots of
different<00:00:21.359> things<00:00:21.570> from<00:00:21.869> stone<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.619> oars<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
different things from stone to oars and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.509 
different things from stone to oars and
gold<00:00:24.119> blocks<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.720> whatnot<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.160> idea<00:00:26.279> is

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
gold blocks and whatnot and the idea is

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.790 
gold blocks and whatnot and the idea is
you<00:00:26.640> mind<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.840> sell<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.289> things<00:00:28.529> that

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
you mind and you sell the things that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.919 
you mind and you sell the things that
you<00:00:28.890> mind<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:30.029> money<00:00:30.210> rank<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
you mind to get money rank up and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.400 
you mind to get money rank up and
eventually<00:00:31.230> be<00:00:31.650> free<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> prison<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
eventually be free of the prison and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.720 
eventually be free of the prison and
able<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.640> go<00:00:35.640> into<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.210> plot<00:00:36.660> world<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.110> believe

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
able to go into the plot world I believe

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.330 
able to go into the plot world I believe
so<00:00:39.079> this<00:00:40.079> server<00:00:40.530> does<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> plot<00:00:41.190> well

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
so this server does have a plot well

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.790 
so this server does have a plot well
book<00:00:41.520> talk<00:00:41.700> show<00:00:42.149> later<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.870> at<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.680> moment

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
I'll concentrate on the prison so this

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.029 
I'll concentrate on the prison so this
is<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.020> spawn<00:00:46.260> room<00:00:46.440> looks<00:00:46.649> very<00:00:46.829> very<00:00:46.860> nice

to bear in mind that there is a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.300 
to bear in mind that there is a
three-second<00:01:43.320> teleport<00:01:43.680> period<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.189> you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
three-second teleport period so if you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.590 
three-second teleport period so if you
in<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.850> someone's<00:01:45.180> rushing<00:01:45.479> at<00:01:45.570> you
