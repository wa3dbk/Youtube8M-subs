00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
cut which I'm pretty sure is obvious

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.069

that<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.579> can<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:05.880> they<00:03:06.120> could<00:03:06.359> but<00:03:07.049> I

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
that you can so that they could but I

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.590 
that you can so that they could but I
had<00:03:07.260> them<00:03:07.440> cut<00:03:08.120> about<00:03:09.120> an<00:03:09.239> inch<00:03:09.389> and<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.569> half

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
had them cut about an inch and a half

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.479 
had them cut about an inch and a half
off<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.079> it<00:03:10.200> really<00:03:10.380> it's<00:03:10.560> like<00:03:10.650> 16<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.459> half

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
off so it really it's like 16 and a half

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.120 
off so it really it's like 16 and a half
in<00:03:11.940> probably<00:03:12.269> 17<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.290> it's<00:03:13.410> not<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.590> 42<00:03:13.980> inch

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
in probably 17 so it's not the 42 inch

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.370 
in probably 17 so it's not the 42 inch
