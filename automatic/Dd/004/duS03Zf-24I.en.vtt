00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.069 

okay<00:00:28.460> you<00:00:29.060> don't<00:00:29.210> want<00:00:29.329> anything<00:00:29.539> to<00:00:29.810> sort<00:00:29.989> of

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
okay you don't want anything to sort of

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.679 
okay you don't want anything to sort of
jump<00:00:30.410> out<00:00:30.649> at<00:00:30.890> you<00:00:31.039> probably<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.149> fairly

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
jump out at you probably a fairly

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.479 
jump out at you probably a fairly
delicate<00:00:33.170> tome<00:00:34.000> um<00:00:35.000> but<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.620> challenge<00:00:37.219> here

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
delicate tome um but the challenge here

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.350 
delicate tome um but the challenge here
I<00:00:37.519> think<00:00:37.879> for<00:00:38.300> me<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:39.500> keep<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.370> long<00:00:40.670> lines

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
I think for me is to keep the long lines

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.040 
I think for me is to keep the long lines
going<00:00:42.079> at<00:00:42.500> this<00:00:43.040> slow<00:00:43.370> tempo<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:44.839> way<00:00:45.019> I

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
going at this slow tempo so the way I

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.259 
going at this slow tempo so the way I
would<00:00:45.350> practice<00:00:45.680> this<00:00:46.040> what<00:00:46.579> I<00:00:46.610> find<00:00:46.940> is<00:00:47.120> most

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
would practice this what I find is most

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.110 
would practice this what I find is most
effective<00:00:47.780> is<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.500> start<00:00:49.010> by<00:00:49.670> simply

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
effective is to start by simply

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.030 
effective is to start by simply
subdividing<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:50.960> rhythm<00:00:51.440> in<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.620> bow<00:00:51.739> and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
subdividing the rhythm in the bow and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.329 
subdividing the rhythm in the bow and
what<00:00:52.820> I<00:00:52.850> mean<00:00:53.089> by<00:00:53.269> that<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:53.979> you're<00:00:54.979> going<00:00:55.190> to

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
what I mean by that is you're going to

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.630 
what I mean by that is you're going to
think<00:00:56.210> eighth<00:00:56.540> notes<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.290> your<00:00:57.979> bow<00:00:58.159> is<00:00:58.430> going

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
think eighth notes and your bow is going

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.179 
think eighth notes and your bow is going
to<00:00:58.850> play<00:00:59.059> all<00:00:59.360> eighth<00:00:59.659> notes<00:00:59.960> but<00:01:00.920> with<00:01:01.070> the

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:01.189 
to play all eighth notes but with the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:03.460 
to play all eighth notes but with the
correct<00:01:01.460> volume<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:02.119> there<00:01:02.780> are<00:01:03.019> four<00:01:03.290> eighth

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
correct volume so there are four eighth

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.530 
correct volume so there are four eighth
notes<00:01:03.680> in<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:03.949> first<00:01:04.159> note<00:01:04.670> or<00:01:04.909> four<00:01:05.360> eighth

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
notes in the first note or four eighth

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.999 
notes in the first note or four eighth
notes<00:01:05.780> could<00:01:05.960> fit<00:01:06.200> in<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.350> first<00:01:06.560> note<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:06.950> I'm

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
notes could fit in the first note so I'm

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.179 
notes could fit in the first note so I'm
going<00:01:07.189> to<00:01:07.220> go<00:01:07.369> yeah<00:01:08.740> all<00:01:09.740> right<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:09.979> same

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
going to go yeah all right the same

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.359 
going to go yeah all right the same
thing<00:01:10.369> for<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.549> next<00:01:10.790> note<00:01:15.159> and<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:16.280> I'm<00:01:16.340> just

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
thing for the next note and so I'm just

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.370 
thing for the next note and so I'm just
thinking<00:01:16.700> mathematically<00:01:17.450> here

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
thinking mathematically here

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.550 
thinking mathematically here
how<00:01:18.829> many<00:01:19.310> eighth<00:01:19.579> notes<00:01:19.880> could<00:01:20.450> I<00:01:20.479> fit<00:01:20.900> in<00:01:21.079> to

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
how many eighth notes could I fit in to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.399 
how many eighth notes could I fit in to
whatever<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.549> printed<00:01:22.970> rhythm<00:01:23.299> is<00:01:23.450> all

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
whatever the the printed rhythm is all

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.260 
whatever the the printed rhythm is all
right<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:25.130> start<00:01:25.399> with<00:01:25.579> I'm<00:01:25.790> going<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:26.119> I'm

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
right and to start with I'm going to I'm

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.340 
right and to start with I'm going to I'm
actually<00:01:26.509> not<00:01:26.810> going<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.049> go<00:01:27.170> for

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
actually not going to go for

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.899 
actually not going to go for
tremendously<00:01:27.770> exciting<00:01:28.220> I'm<00:01:28.549> going<00:01:28.729> to<00:01:28.790> make

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
tremendously exciting I'm going to make

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.180 
tremendously exciting I'm going to make
each<00:01:29.150> of<00:01:29.450> these<00:01:29.600> you're<00:01:30.170> kind<00:01:30.350> of<00:01:30.470> consistent

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
each of these you're kind of consistent

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:46.899 
each of these you're kind of consistent
length<00:01:31.640> consistent<00:01:32.390> amount<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.750> bow

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.990 

and<00:01:47.479> I'm<00:01:47.600> trying<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.960> get<00:01:48.079> sort<00:01:48.290> of<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.409> baseline

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
and I'm trying to get sort of a baseline

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.120 
and I'm trying to get sort of a baseline
understanding<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.600> how<00:01:50.960> much<00:01:51.229> bone<00:01:51.500> do<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:51.799> need

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
understanding of how much bone do I need

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.920 
understanding of how much bone do I need
to<00:01:52.399> play<00:01:52.579> each<00:01:52.789> of<00:01:52.939> these<00:01:53.090> notes<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.719> know<00:01:53.840> if

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
to play each of these notes you know if

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.690 
to play each of these notes you know if
I<00:01:54.020> go<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:54.350> way<00:01:54.409> for<00:01:54.890> four<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.340> I<00:01:55.369> go<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:55.640> way

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
I go this way for four and I go this way

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.700 
I go this way for four and I go this way
for<00:01:56.000> four<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.479> then<00:01:56.600> three<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:57.079> then<00:01:57.380> two

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
for four and then three and then two

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.770 
for four and then three and then two
like<00:01:58.159> where<00:01:58.369> do<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.520> end<00:01:58.759> up<00:01:58.909> in<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.149> bone<00:01:59.299> so

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
like where do I end up in the bone so

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.050 
like where do I end up in the bone so
I'm<00:02:00.320> getting<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.679> sense<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:01.100> that<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.820> start

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
I'm getting a sense of that to start

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.679 
I'm getting a sense of that to start
with<00:02:02.229> but<00:02:03.229> then<00:02:03.470> once<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.280> I've<00:02:04.640> got<00:02:05.119> that<00:02:05.390> down

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
with but then once I I've got that down

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.410 
with but then once I I've got that down
and<00:02:06.259> I<00:02:06.350> know<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:07.100> rhythm<00:02:07.429> I'm<00:02:07.759> consistent

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
and I know the rhythm I'm consistent

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.620 
and I know the rhythm I'm consistent
with<00:02:08.539> it<00:02:08.720> then<00:02:09.500> I'm<00:02:09.800> going<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.039> start<00:02:10.340> actually

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
with it then I'm going to start actually

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.759 
with it then I'm going to start actually
varying<00:02:11.630> how<00:02:12.170> big<00:02:12.680> each<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:13.250> these<00:02:13.430> chunks<00:02:14.030> is

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
varying how big each of these chunks is

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.729 
varying how big each of these chunks is
right<00:02:15.769> according<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.610> how<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.569> want<00:02:18.110> my<00:02:18.200> phrase

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
right according to how I want my phrase

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.309 
right according to how I want my phrase
to<00:02:19.280> be<00:02:19.519> shaped<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:20.150> what<00:02:20.330> what<00:02:20.930> notes<00:02:21.170> are

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
to be shaped and what what notes are

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.289 
to be shaped and what what notes are
leading<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.860> others<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.340> which<00:02:22.459> are<00:02:22.700> coming

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
leading to others and which are coming

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.259 
leading to others and which are coming
away<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:24.170> for<00:02:24.410> example<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.950> first<00:02:25.310> two<00:02:25.700> notes

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
away so for example the first two notes

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.030 
away so for example the first two notes
I<00:02:26.299> might<00:02:26.840> start<00:02:27.140> out<00:02:27.349> with<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.500> little<00:02:27.709> bit<00:02:27.920> of

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
I might start out with a little bit of

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.400 
I might start out with a little bit of
bone<00:02:34.000> or<00:02:35.000> something<00:02:35.209> like<00:02:35.569> that<00:02:35.630> maybe<00:02:36.200> I'll

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
bone or something like that maybe I'll

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.670 
bone or something like that maybe I'll
try<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.739> different<00:02:37.040> way<00:02:37.069> I'll<00:02:37.220> try<00:02:38.680> coming

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
try it a different way I'll try coming

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.399 
try it a different way I'll try coming
away

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.050 

right<00:02:44.409> and<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.920> what<00:02:45.129> this<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.489> showing<00:02:45.519> me<00:02:46.030> is

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
right and and what this is showing me is

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.229 
right and and what this is showing me is
to<00:02:46.629> make<00:02:46.989> these<00:02:47.290> different<00:02:47.950> shapes<00:02:48.250> how<00:02:48.909> much

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
to make these different shapes how much

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.280 
to make these different shapes how much
bo<00:02:49.510> do<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:49.930> need<00:02:51.180> really<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.360> do<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.900> and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
bo do I need really to do that and and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.289 
bo do I need really to do that and and
does<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.799> work<00:02:53.980> right<00:02:54.519> where<00:02:54.819> do<00:02:54.909> I<00:02:54.970> need<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.209> be

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
does it work right where do I need to be

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.360 
does it work right where do I need to be
in<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.510> boat<00:02:55.659> so<00:02:56.230> first<00:02:56.829> thing<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.040> do<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:57.340> just

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
in the boat so first thing I do is just

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.830 
in the boat so first thing I do is just
experiment<00:02:58.000> around<00:02:58.299> with<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.480> bunch<00:02:58.690> of

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
experiment around with a bunch of

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:07.890 
experiment around with a bunch of
different<00:02:58.959> versions<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.860> know<00:03:06.900> whatever

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
different versions you know whatever

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.380 
different versions you know whatever
there<00:03:08.319> there's<00:03:08.590> no<00:03:08.739> one<00:03:09.040> true<00:03:09.430> way<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.730> do<00:03:10.030> this

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
there there's no one true way to do this

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.319 
there there's no one true way to do this
um<00:03:10.450> but<00:03:11.170> generally<00:03:11.769> wherever<00:03:12.640> however<00:03:13.150> much

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
um but generally wherever however much

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.920 
um but generally wherever however much
bow<00:03:13.569> you<00:03:13.900> end<00:03:14.400> one<00:03:15.400> note<00:03:15.670> with<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.420> next<00:03:16.750> note

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
bow you end one note with the next note

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.930 
bow you end one note with the next note
should<00:03:17.200> start<00:03:17.590> with<00:03:18.010> about<00:03:18.129> that<00:03:18.519> same<00:03:18.760> amount

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
should start with about that same amount

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.420 
should start with about that same amount
of<00:03:19.060> oh<00:03:19.150> so<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.420> wouldn't<00:03:19.720> want<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.959> do<00:03:20.109> this

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
of oh so you wouldn't want to do this

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.879 
of oh so you wouldn't want to do this
little<00:03:21.430> bow<00:03:22.170> Oh<00:03:23.170> sir

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
little bow Oh sir

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:31.680 
little bow Oh sir
try<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.370> again<00:03:30.209> right<00:03:31.209> because<00:03:31.359> it<00:03:31.480> just

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
try it again right because it just

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.699 
try it again right because it just
starts<00:03:31.989> as<00:03:32.079> on<00:03:32.200> bong<00:03:32.530> uh<00:03:34.139> no<00:03:35.139> you<00:03:35.440> know<00:03:35.530> and

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
starts as on bong uh no you know and

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.979 
starts as on bong uh no you know and
things<00:03:35.920> stick<00:03:36.310> out<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.849> want<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.180> see<00:03:37.629> how

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
things stick out so you want to see how

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.990 
things stick out so you want to see how
you<00:03:38.049> can<00:03:38.530> connect<00:03:39.010> one<00:03:39.280> note<00:03:39.579> to<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.879> other

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
you can connect one note to the other

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.449 
you can connect one note to the other
and<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.389> is<00:03:40.540> done<00:03:40.840> by<00:03:41.379> using<00:03:41.409> the<00:03:42.069> same

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
and that is done by using the same

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.960 
and that is done by using the same
amount<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:43.480> bow<00:03:43.750> at<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:45.370> beginning<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.849> the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
amount of bow at the beginning of the

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.210 
amount of bow at the beginning of the
new<00:03:46.120> note<00:03:46.359> is<00:03:46.540> how<00:03:46.750> much<00:03:46.989> you<00:03:47.169> ended<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:48.040> last

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
new note is how much you ended the last

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.210 
new note is how much you ended the last
bow<00:03:48.609> with<00:03:48.879> all<00:03:49.449> right<00:03:49.769> experiment<00:03:50.769> room<00:03:50.949> did

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
bow with all right experiment room did

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.500 
bow with all right experiment room did
try<00:03:51.459> different<00:03:51.669> phrase<00:03:52.090> shapes

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
try different phrase shapes

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.710 
try different phrase shapes
um<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:53.319> then<00:03:53.949> the<00:03:54.639> idea<00:03:54.940> is<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.150> keep<00:03:55.419> that

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
um and then the idea is to keep that

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.280 
um and then the idea is to keep that
same<00:03:56.139> bow<00:03:56.440> distribution

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.270 

I

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.140 

and<00:04:05.280> that's<00:04:06.269> what's<00:04:06.540> gonna<00:04:06.659> get<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:08.150> phrase

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
and that's what's gonna get you a phrase

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.020 
and that's what's gonna get you a phrase
basically<00:04:10.099> alright<00:04:11.099> so<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.519> go<00:04:11.790> through<00:04:11.819> the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
basically alright so I go through the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.630 
basically alright so I go through the
whole<00:04:12.329> piece<00:04:12.780> doing<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.500> way<00:04:13.709> just<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.489> get<00:04:14.609> a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
whole piece doing that way just to get a

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.060 
whole piece doing that way just to get a
feel<00:04:14.909> for<00:04:14.939> my<00:04:15.540> bow<00:04:15.719> distribution<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.590> then

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
feel for my bow distribution and then

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.509 
feel for my bow distribution and then
the<00:04:17.220> only<00:04:17.639> other<00:04:17.759> really<00:04:18.239> thing<00:04:18.509> that<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:19.519> like

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
the only other really thing that I like

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.760 
the only other really thing that I like
to<00:04:20.789> do<00:04:20.940> in<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.209> piece<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.660> this<00:04:22.079> is<00:04:22.289> totally

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
to do in this piece and this is totally

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.150 
to do in this piece and this is totally
again<00:04:23.009> matter<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.400> personal<00:04:23.789> taste<00:04:24.139> um<00:04:25.160> since

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
again matter of personal taste um since

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.730 
again matter of personal taste um since
you<00:04:26.460> repeat<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.479> whole<00:04:27.630> thing<00:04:27.990> right<00:04:28.440> you

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
you repeat the whole thing right you

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.920 
you repeat the whole thing right you
basically<00:04:29.160> you<00:04:29.250> get<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.580> end<00:04:29.759> and<00:04:30.000> almost

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
basically you get to the end and almost

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.390 
basically you get to the end and almost
the<00:04:31.050> end<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.440> go<00:04:31.740> back<00:04:31.889> to<00:04:31.949> begin<00:04:32.190> do<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
the end and go back to begin do the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.279 
the end and go back to begin do the
whole<00:04:32.520> thing<00:04:32.699> again<00:04:32.759> the<00:04:33.360> risk<00:04:33.630> of<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:34.020> is

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
whole thing again the risk of that is

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.870 
whole thing again the risk of that is
that<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.650> could<00:04:34.800> get<00:04:34.889> very<00:04:35.160> boring<00:04:35.460> for<00:04:35.789> your

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
that it could get very boring for your

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.150 
that it could get very boring for your
audience<00:04:36.180> which<00:04:36.539> gives<00:04:36.720> us<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.870> slow<00:04:37.139> piece<00:04:37.380> so

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
audience which gives us a slow piece so

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.990 
audience which gives us a slow piece so
if<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.460> do<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:39.060> same<00:04:39.360> exact<00:04:40.110> thing<00:04:40.289> again<00:04:41.000> but

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
if you do the same exact thing again but

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.629 
if you do the same exact thing again but
not<00:04:42.539> so<00:04:42.750> interesting<00:04:43.259> so<00:04:43.889> I<00:04:43.919> like<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.340> think<00:04:44.550> of

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
not so interesting so I like to think of

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.700 
not so interesting so I like to think of
different<00:04:45.060> ways<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.599> make<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:46.080> second<00:04:46.500> time

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
different ways to make the second time

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.219 
different ways to make the second time
different<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.789> certainly<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:48.960> could<00:04:49.110> do

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
different and certainly you could do

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.870 
different and certainly you could do
different<00:04:49.560> phrasing<00:04:49.919> on<00:04:50.099> the<00:04:50.430> second<00:04:50.759> you

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
different phrasing on the second you

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.240 
different phrasing on the second you
could<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:51.389> know<00:04:51.509> have<00:04:51.900> your<00:04:52.199> phrase<00:04:52.919> shapes

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
could you know have your phrase shapes

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.580 
could you know have your phrase shapes
lead<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.479> different<00:04:54.810> notes<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.349> would<00:04:55.440> be

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
lead to different notes that would be

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.020 
lead to different notes that would be
one<00:04:55.770> approach<00:04:55.889> um

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
one approach um

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.390 
one approach um
dynamics<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:58.440> could<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.710> know<00:04:58.830> first<00:04:59.130> time

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
dynamics you could you know first time

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.450 
dynamics you could you know first time
you<00:04:59.880> could<00:05:00.060> go<00:05:00.180> through<00:05:03.889> second<00:05:04.889> time

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.980 

ah

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
ah

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.140 
ah
you<00:05:09.990> know<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.080> much<00:05:10.620> gentler<00:05:10.650> sound<00:05:11.640> quality

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
you know a much gentler sound quality

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.030 
you know a much gentler sound quality
that<00:05:12.600> would<00:05:12.780> be<00:05:12.900> a<00:05:12.930> way<00:05:13.140> to<00:05:13.200> have<00:05:13.440> your<00:05:13.620> second

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
that would be a way to have your second

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.860 
that would be a way to have your second
time<00:05:14.160> be<00:05:14.760> different<00:05:15.120> from<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.330> first<00:05:15.510> and<00:05:15.810> to

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
time be different from the first and to

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.290 
time be different from the first and to
give<00:05:16.020> it<00:05:16.140> some<00:05:16.320> interest<00:05:16.530> um<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:18.090> way<00:05:18.270> I

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
give it some interest um the way I

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.360 
give it some interest um the way I
really<00:05:18.810> like<00:05:18.840> them<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:21.140> you<00:05:22.140> know<00:05:22.290> this<00:05:22.560> don't

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
really like them and you know this don't

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.770 
really like them and you know this don't
feel<00:05:23.610> like<00:05:23.790> you<00:05:23.910> have<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.060> do<00:05:24.270> this<00:05:24.420> but<00:05:24.690> the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
feel like you have to do this but the

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.200 
feel like you have to do this but the
first<00:05:24.960> time<00:05:28.070> okay<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.280> second<00:05:29.610> time<00:05:29.820> I<00:05:30.000> play

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
first time okay and second time I play

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.510 
first time okay and second time I play
all<00:05:30.420> on<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.960> D<00:05:31.230> string<00:05:31.260> so<00:05:32.130> I'm<00:05:32.190> just<00:05:32.310> going<00:05:32.430> to

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
all on the D string so I'm just going to

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.490 
all on the D string so I'm just going to
show<00:05:32.670> you<00:05:32.730> what<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.210> fingering<00:05:33.840> would<00:05:34.080> be<00:05:34.260> if

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
show you what the fingering would be if

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.680 
show you what the fingering would be if
you<00:05:34.920> wanted<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.550> do<00:05:35.670> that<00:05:35.700> don't<00:05:36.270> feel<00:05:36.510> that

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
you wanted to do that don't feel that

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.570 
you wanted to do that don't feel that
you<00:05:36.780> have<00:05:36.840> to<00:05:36.960> so<00:05:37.920> it's<00:05:38.040> starting<00:05:38.310> fourth

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
you have to so it's starting fourth

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:49.900 
you have to so it's starting fourth
position<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:41.250> my<00:05:41.370> harmonic<00:05:43.160> position<00:05:48.680> now

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
position to my harmonic position now

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.420 
position to my harmonic position now
shift<00:05:50.910> a<00:05:51.090> fourth<00:05:51.450> finger<00:05:52.080> gonna<00:05:52.650> do<00:05:52.830> a<00:05:52.860> four

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
shift a fourth finger gonna do a four

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:02.709 
shift a fourth finger gonna do a four
replace<00:05:53.730> one<00:05:53.970> shift<00:05:58.520> back<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.700> fourth

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.590 

my<00:06:04.059> vision

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
my vision

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:15.329 
my vision
Oh

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:15.339 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:20.300 

would<00:06:16.339> you<00:06:16.430> shoot<00:06:16.580> again

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:38.870 

and<00:06:20.400> now<00:06:20.970> extend<00:06:21.510> from<00:06:21.900> here

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.670 

and<00:06:39.000> still<00:06:39.750> in<00:06:39.930> for

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.850 

ah

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.410 

you<00:06:53.860> could<00:06:54.010> really<00:06:54.160> put<00:06:54.400> any<00:06:54.640> finger<00:06:54.970> and<00:06:55.330> you

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
you could really put any finger and you

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:20.210 
you could really put any finger and you
wanted<00:06:56.250> then<00:06:57.250> up<00:06:57.370> to<00:06:57.490> your<00:06:57.580> harmonic

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.700 

put<00:07:21.220> your<00:07:21.460> arms<00:07:21.910> down<00:07:22.060> so<00:07:22.930> you<00:07:23.050> don't<00:07:23.080> break

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:23.710 
put your arms down so you don't break

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.470 
put your arms down so you don't break
them<00:07:25.980> and<00:07:26.980> that's<00:07:27.130> about<00:07:27.250> you're<00:07:27.490> done<00:07:27.640> okay

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:28.480 
them and that's about you're done okay

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.340 
them and that's about you're done okay
but<00:07:28.810> you<00:07:28.870> want<00:07:29.020> to<00:07:29.080> suspend<00:07:29.260> that<00:07:30.010> last<00:07:30.670> note

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.350 
but you want to suspend that last note

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.900 
but you want to suspend that last note
you<00:07:32.350> know<00:07:32.440> obviously<00:07:32.890> your<00:07:33.070> your<00:07:33.340> audience<00:07:33.760> is

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:33.910 
you know obviously your your audience is

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.850 
you know obviously your your audience is
sleeping<00:07:34.360> by<00:07:34.540> now<00:07:34.570> so<00:07:35.410> you<00:07:35.500> don't<00:07:35.650> want<00:07:35.770> to

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
sleeping by now so you don't want to

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.690 
sleeping by now so you don't want to
suddenly<00:07:36.400> jolt<00:07:37.000> them<00:07:37.240> from<00:07:37.510> their<00:07:37.660> slumber

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:38.700 
suddenly jolt them from their slumber

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.100 
suddenly jolt them from their slumber
all<00:07:39.700> right<00:07:39.820> so<00:07:40.090> some<00:07:40.480> things<00:07:40.540> to<00:07:40.720> think<00:07:40.930> about

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.110 
all right so some things to think about

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.980 
all right so some things to think about
that<00:07:41.800> practice<00:07:42.280> technique<00:07:42.670> of<00:07:42.990> subdividing

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:43.990 
that practice technique of subdividing

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.720 
that practice technique of subdividing
the<00:07:44.080> eighth<00:07:44.290> notes<00:07:44.590> always<00:07:44.890> good<00:07:45.370> when<00:07:45.580> you're

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:45.730 
the eighth notes always good when you're

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.140 
the eighth notes always good when you're
working<00:07:46.060> on<00:07:46.320> row<00:07:47.320> distribution<00:07:48.130> and<00:07:48.520> phrasing

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:49.150 
working on row distribution and phrasing

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.800 
working on row distribution and phrasing
um<00:07:49.740> then<00:07:50.740> you've<00:07:50.980> got<00:07:51.330> some<00:07:52.330> different<00:07:52.720> ways

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:52.810 
um then you've got some different ways

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.770 
um then you've got some different ways
to<00:07:52.990> think<00:07:53.230> about<00:07:53.500> how<00:07:54.220> you<00:07:54.280> can<00:07:54.580> do<00:07:54.760> the<00:07:55.270> second

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:55.780 
to think about how you can do the second

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.900 
to think about how you can do the second
time<00:07:56.020> the<00:07:56.410> repeat<00:07:56.770> different<00:07:57.460> from<00:07:57.580> the<00:07:57.700> first

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:57.910 
time the repeat different from the first

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:02.010 
time the repeat different from the first
time<00:07:58.180> and<00:07:58.450> then<00:07:59.050> your<00:07:59.200> very<00:07:59.380> last<00:07:59.620> note
