00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
one or you don't want to splurge and

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.790 
one or you don't want to splurge and
spend<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.600> money<00:02:57.630> on<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.770> a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
spend the money on it so that is a

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.350 
spend the money on it so that is a
really<00:02:58.980> good<00:02:59.160> alternative<00:02:59.340> I<00:03:00.060> won't<00:03:00.270> do<00:03:00.330> a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
really good alternative I won't do a

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.640 
really good alternative I won't do a
little<00:03:00.570> close-up<00:03:00.720> now<00:03:00.870> because<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.260> filmed

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
little close-up now because I filmed

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.960 
little close-up now because I filmed
myself<00:03:01.800> applying<00:03:02.220> them<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.520> my<00:03:02.700> waterline

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
myself applying them to my waterline

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.730 
myself applying them to my waterline
earlier<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:03.960> can<00:03:04.080> see<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> difference<00:03:04.590> I

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
earlier so you can see the difference I

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.960 
earlier so you can see the difference I
want<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.010> set<00:03:05.100> off<00:03:05.220> with<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.460> Mac<00:03:05.610> chroma

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
want to set off with the Mac chroma

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.309 

and<00:03:15.129> then<00:03:15.640> on<00:03:15.760> my<00:03:15.909> right<00:03:16.180> eye<00:03:16.209> I'm<00:03:16.750> using<00:03:17.019> the

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
and then on my right eye I'm using the

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:28.130 
and then on my right eye I'm using the
Rimmel<00:03:17.799> scandaleyes

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.450 

not<00:03:28.530> really<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.800> was<00:03:28.920> going<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.100> pick<00:03:29.190> up<00:03:29.310> on

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
not really I was going to pick up on

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.370 
not really I was going to pick up on
camera<00:03:29.790> but<00:03:29.940> as<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.150> can<00:03:30.330> maybe<00:03:30.480> tell<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:31.200> Mac

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
camera but as you can maybe tell the Mac

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.290 
camera but as you can maybe tell the Mac
one<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.770> slightly<00:03:32.370> lighter<00:03:32.610> whereas<00:03:33.180> the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
one is slightly lighter whereas the

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.820 
one is slightly lighter whereas the
rumor<00:03:33.480> was<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.660> bit<00:03:33.840> darker<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.410> also<00:03:34.530> has

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
rumor was a bit darker and it also has

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.160 
rumor was a bit darker and it also has
kind<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.430> more<00:03:35.670> natural<00:03:36.270> tone<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.720> but

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
kind of a more natural tone to it but

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.080 
kind of a more natural tone to it but
both<00:03:37.380> are<00:03:37.650> extremely<00:03:37.980> similar<00:03:38.520> they<00:03:38.910> look

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
both are extremely similar they look

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.240 
both are extremely similar they look
almost<00:03:39.360> identical<00:03:39.570> better<00:03:40.290> personal<00:03:40.890> history

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
almost identical better personal history

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.380 
almost identical better personal history
and<00:03:41.460> then<00:03:41.550> I'm<00:03:41.640> just<00:03:41.820> going<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:41.970> quickly<00:03:42.120> talk

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
and then I'm just going to quickly talk

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.300 
and then I'm just going to quickly talk

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
their cage are pencil not really a fan

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.300 
their cage are pencil not really a fan
of<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:54.180> one<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:54.600> find<00:03:55.080> that<00:03:55.410> it's<00:03:55.560> not<00:03:55.710> a<00:03:55.920> true

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
of this one I find that it's not a true

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.490 
of this one I find that it's not a true
nude<00:03:56.520> it's<00:03:56.760> more<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.300> a<00:03:57.450> kind<00:03:57.990> of<00:03:58.110> beige

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
nude it's more of a kind of beige

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.820 
nude it's more of a kind of beige
neutral<00:03:59.070> shade<00:03:59.550> and<00:03:59.900> especially<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:01.350> me<00:04:01.590> who's

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
neutral shade and especially on me who's

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.950 
neutral shade and especially on me who's
quite<00:04:02.070> pale<00:04:02.310> um<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:03.030> just<00:04:03.090> doesn't<00:04:03.570> work<00:04:03.630> on<00:04:03.840> my

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
quite pale um it just doesn't work on my

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.600 
quite pale um it just doesn't work on my
waterline<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.650> just<00:04:04.890> looks<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.220> little<00:04:05.340> bit<00:04:05.580> too

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
waterline it just looks a little bit too

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.120 
waterline it just looks a little bit too
beige<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.990> dull<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.590> doesn't<00:04:07.830> really<00:04:07.920> do

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
beige and dull and it doesn't really do

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.640 
beige and dull and it doesn't really do
anything<00:04:08.430> in<00:04:08.640> terms<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.970> brightening

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
anything in terms of brightening

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.960 
anything in terms of brightening
probably<00:04:10.650> darkens<00:04:11.010> my<00:04:11.070> eyes<00:04:11.340> more<00:04:11.670> than<00:04:11.850> it

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
probably darkens my eyes more than it

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.510 
probably darkens my eyes more than it
brightens<00:04:12.420> if<00:04:12.630> you've<00:04:13.140> got<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.680> lot<00:04:14.310> darker

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
brightens if you've got a lot darker

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.880 
brightens if you've got a lot darker
skin<00:04:14.940> than<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.180> have<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.660> you<00:04:15.900> find<00:04:16.170> the<00:04:16.440> remote

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
skin than I have and you find the remote

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.530 
skin than I have and you find the remote
or<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.130> Mac<00:04:17.280> is<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:17.730> too<00:04:18.000> light<00:04:18.180> for<00:04:18.209> you

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
or the Mac is just too light for you

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.789 
or the Mac is just too light for you
then<00:04:18.959> maybe<00:04:19.140> you<00:04:19.230> could<00:04:19.290> give<00:04:19.470> this<00:04:19.560> one<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.739> go

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
then maybe you could give this one a go

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.710 
then maybe you could give this one a go
it's<00:04:20.100> only<00:04:20.280> like<00:04:20.489> two<00:04:20.970> dollars<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.510> you're<00:04:21.660> not

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
it's only like two dollars so you're not

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.630 
it's only like two dollars so you're not
really<00:04:21.989> red<00:04:22.590> making<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.070> loss<00:04:23.190> if<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.400> don't

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
really red making a loss if you don't

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.730 
really red making a loss if you don't
like<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:24.090> but<00:04:24.330> um<00:04:24.390> I<00:04:24.810> wasn't<00:04:25.260> really<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.530> fan<00:04:25.560> of

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
like it but um I wasn't really a fan of

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.290 
like it but um I wasn't really a fan of
this<00:04:25.890> one<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:26.280> then<00:04:26.640> the<00:04:26.730> next<00:04:26.970> one<00:04:27.060> I'm<00:04:27.210> not

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
this one and then the next one I'm not

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.580 
this one and then the next one I'm not
going<00:04:27.420> to<00:04:27.510> talk<00:04:27.720> about<00:04:27.870> too<00:04:27.990> long<00:04:28.200> because<00:04:28.380> it

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
going to talk about too long because it

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.170 
going to talk about too long because it
was<00:04:28.710> limited<00:04:29.010> edition<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:29.850> probably

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
was limited edition and it's probably

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.510 
was limited edition and it's probably
sold<00:04:30.390> out<00:04:30.570> in<00:04:30.750> most<00:04:30.930> Target<00:04:31.440> stores<00:04:31.680> now<00:04:31.890> but

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
sold out in most Target stores now but

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.460 
sold out in most Target stores now but
this<00:04:32.730> was<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.150> limited<00:04:33.750> edition<00:04:33.780> dual<00:04:34.320> eye

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
this was a limited edition dual eye
