00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
because you I got lost when I try to do

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.429 
because you I got lost when I try to do
it<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.960> patrol<00:01:04.470> mode<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.780> mission<00:01:07.229> takes

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
it in patrol mode and this mission takes

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.289 
it in patrol mode and this mission takes
you<00:01:07.590> right<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> where<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.220> want<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.549> so

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
you right to where we want to go so

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.179 
you right to where we want to go so
let's<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.990> we're<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.290> from<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.830> start

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
let's do it we're going from the start

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.260 
let's do it we're going from the start
and<00:01:11.880> we're<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> get<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:13.549> chest<00:01:14.549> which

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and we're going to get one chest which

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.660 
and we're going to get one chest which
you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.630> get<00:01:15.810> anytime<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> figured<00:01:17.490> it's

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you can get anytime but I figured it's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
you can get anytime but I figured it's
on<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> way<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.540> other<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.200> why<00:01:19.380> not

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
on the way to this other one so why not

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.890 
on the way to this other one so why not
get<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.640> mission<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.210> mean<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.750> could

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
get it in this mission I mean you could

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.940 
get it in this mission I mean you could
have<00:01:21.960> got<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.170> straight<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> other

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.670 
have got it straight up to the other
chest<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:23.400> felt<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.180> patrol<00:01:24.960> mode<00:01:25.200> or

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
chest or felt like it in patrol mode or

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.590 
chest or felt like it in patrol mode or
