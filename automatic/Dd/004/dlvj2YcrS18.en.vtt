00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
doing this test and I had it sitting

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.619 
doing this test and I had it sitting
here<00:00:14.099> running<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.580> figured<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.299> might<00:00:15.419> as<00:00:15.480> well

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:15.629 
here running I figured I might as well

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.079 
see I got the whole xbox is in this this
base<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.540> and<00:00:30.930> it's<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:32.550> less<00:00:32.820> than<00:00:33.030> an

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:33.089 
base here and it's it's less than an

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:35.029 
base here and it's it's less than an
inch<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.359> half<00:00:33.390> 60<00:00:34.050> not<00:00:34.649> gonna<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:34.920> any

trouble making it less than two inches
thick<00:00:37.489> let's<00:00:38.489> see<00:00:38.640> what<00:00:39.570> I'm<00:00:39.690> testing<00:00:40.109> right

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
thick let's see what I'm testing right

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.919 
thick let's see what I'm testing right
now<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.499> my<00:00:40.710> cooling<00:00:41.070> system<00:00:41.460> which<00:00:42.269> as<00:00:42.809> you

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
now is my cooling system which as you

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:44.239 
now is my cooling system which as you
can<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> nice<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.710> visible<00:00:44.010> fan

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:44.249 
can see I got a nice and visible fan

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:48.259 
can see I got a nice and visible fan
right<00:00:44.429> there<00:00:44.989> okay<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.399> didn't<00:00:47.399> what<00:00:47.940> i'm<00:00:48.030> doing

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
right there okay I didn't what i'm doing

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.509 
right there okay I didn't what i'm doing
is<00:00:48.359> i'm<00:00:48.570> using<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.019> negative<00:00:49.980> air<00:00:50.070> pressure<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
is i'm using a negative air pressure to

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.809 
is i'm using a negative air pressure to
pull<00:00:51.199> air<00:00:52.199> through<00:00:52.589> this<00:00:53.159> hole<00:00:53.399> through<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:53.819 
pull air through this hole through the

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.790 
pull air through this hole through the
heatsink<00:00:54.269> and<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.989> blowers<00:00:55.409> and<00:00:55.440> it's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
heatsink and with blowers and it's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.149 
heatsink and with blowers and it's
coming<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.159> this<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.749> this<00:00:57.949> there's<00:00:58.949> two

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
coming out this and this there's two

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.489 
coming out this and this there's two
vents<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.640> there<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.940> blowers<00:01:00.269> and

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
vents right there with blowers and

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.899 
vents right there with blowers and
that's<00:01:01.499> constantly<00:01:02.069> pulling<00:01:02.670> air<00:01:02.879> through

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
that's constantly pulling air through

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.150 
that's constantly pulling air through
the<00:01:03.210> case<00:01:03.539> that's<00:01:04.260> what<00:01:04.440> this<00:01:04.559> black<00:01:04.890> tapes

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
the case that's what this black tapes

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.340 
the case that's what this black tapes
for<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:05.760> when<00:01:06.330> i<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.720> final<00:01:06.960> assembly

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
for because when i do the final assembly

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.630 
for because when i do the final assembly
it'll<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.710> really<00:01:07.890> tight<00:01:08.190> and<00:01:08.220> i<00:01:08.370> won't<00:01:08.550> have

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
it'll be really tight and i won't have

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.580 
it'll be really tight and i won't have
to<00:01:08.730> worry<00:01:08.880> about<00:01:08.940> you<00:01:09.630> know<00:01:09.660> it<00:01:10.050> not<00:01:10.260> getting

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
to worry about you know it not getting

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.860 
to worry about you know it not getting
area<00:01:11.100> getting<00:01:11.310> air<00:01:11.550> in<00:01:11.700> other<00:01:11.820> places<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.780> i

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
area getting air in other places but i

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.030 
area getting air in other places but i
had<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> put<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> tape<00:01:13.440> on<00:01:13.620> this<00:01:13.770> because<00:01:13.920> i

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
had to put the tape on this because i

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.230 
had to put the tape on this because i
don't<00:01:14.190> even<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.520> holes<00:01:14.820> drilled<00:01:15.150> from

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
don't even have the holes drilled from

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.730 
don't even have the holes drilled from
both<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.690> on<00:01:16.280> but<00:01:18.170> it's<00:01:19.170> pulling<00:01:19.560> air

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
both this on but it's pulling air

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.410 
both this on but it's pulling air
through<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.280> heatsink<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.120> heat<00:01:21.240> sink

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
through the heatsink and the heat sink

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.140 
through the heatsink and the heat sink
is<00:01:21.570> staying<00:01:21.810> really<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.800> cool<00:01:23.070> I've<00:01:24.000> been

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
is staying really really cool I've been

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.930 
is staying really really cool I've been
playing<00:01:24.450> I've<00:01:25.410> been<00:01:25.530> playing<00:01:25.920> video<00:01:26.700> games

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
playing I've been playing video games

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.300 
playing I've been playing video games
for<00:01:27.150> about<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.840> four<00:01:28.470> hours<00:01:28.800> on<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.040> thing

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
for about so four hours on this thing

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.340 
for about so four hours on this thing
and<00:01:29.550> anybody<00:01:30.330> who's<00:01:30.600> worked<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.260> these

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and anybody who's worked on one of these

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.090 
and anybody who's worked on one of these
knows<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.980> top<00:01:32.190> of<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:32.430> heatsink<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:34.100> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
knows that the top of the heatsink if it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.880 
knows that the top of the heatsink if it
with<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.370> stock<00:01:35.700> fan<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.630> heatsink<00:01:37.110> gets<00:01:37.650> about

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
with a stock fan the heatsink gets about

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.820 
with a stock fan the heatsink gets about
150<00:01:38.820> degrees<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.870> let's<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.710> this

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
150 degrees and let's just see what this

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.670 
150 degrees and let's just see what this
is<00:01:41.010> up<00:01:41.160> to<00:01:41.340> after<00:01:41.550> about<00:01:41.670> an<00:01:41.790> hour<00:01:42.380> all<00:01:43.380> right

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
is up to after about an hour all right

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.090 
is up to after about an hour all right
check<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:47.240> 99<00:01:48.680> it's<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:49.830> call<00:01:49.980> it<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
check that out 99 it's just call it a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.880 
check that out 99 it's just call it a
hundred<00:01:50.250> degrees<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.140> that's<00:01:52.140> pretty<00:01:52.770> much

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
hundred degrees and that's pretty much
