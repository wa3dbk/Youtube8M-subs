00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
of lane 36 a long time ago but up that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.870 
of lane 36 a long time ago but up that
was<00:02:45.650> real<00:02:45.830> neat<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.160> know<00:02:46.190> it's<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.700> little

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
was real neat you know it's a little

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.460 
was real neat you know it's a little
different<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.420> what<00:02:47.600> I'm<00:02:47.690> used<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:48.020> because<00:02:48.350> I

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
different to what I'm used to because I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.280 
different to what I'm used to because I
build<00:02:48.680> my<00:02:48.800> own<00:02:48.830> cookers<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.810> do<00:02:50.870> board<00:02:51.230> the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
build my own cookers and I do board the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.780 
build my own cookers and I do board the
convector<00:02:51.740> kinda<00:02:52.010> heat<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:52.370> it's<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.550> little

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
convector kinda heat so it's a little

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
convector kinda heat so it's a little
interesting<00:02:53.180> working<00:02:53.360> with<00:02:53.540> more<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.750> a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
interesting working with more of a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.900 
interesting working with more of a
radiant<00:02:54.280> all<00:02:55.280> at<00:02:55.460> all<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.610> thought<00:02:55.850> the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
radiant all at all I thought the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.310 
radiant all at all I thought the
reversal<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.480> was<00:02:56.570> nice<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:56.960> there's<00:02:57.080> no<00:02:57.200> way

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
reversal it was nice and there's no way

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.840 
reversal it was nice and there's no way
we<00:02:57.500> could<00:02:57.650> have<00:02:57.710> possibly<00:02:58.040> cooked<00:02:58.580> that<00:02:58.700> much

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
we could have possibly cooked that much

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.310 
we could have possibly cooked that much
food<00:02:59.030> in<00:02:59.180> such<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.420> small<00:02:59.510> package

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:17.560 

vomit<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.740> brisket<00:03:07.480> that's<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:16.180> delicious<00:03:17.180> eka

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
vomit the brisket that's a delicious eka

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.200 
vomit the brisket that's a delicious eka
we<00:03:18.380> noticed<00:03:18.740> that<00:03:18.860> they're<00:03:19.010> using<00:03:19.190> links<00:03:20.090> to

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
we noticed that they're using links to

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.930 
we noticed that they're using links to
local<00:03:20.330> cookers<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:22.070> do<00:03:22.550> you<00:03:22.610> think<00:03:22.790> that

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
local cookers and do you think that

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.230 
local cookers and do you think that
really<00:03:23.710> is<00:03:24.710> it<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:24.980> better<00:03:25.730> brisket<00:03:26.210> that

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
really is it a better brisket that

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.350 
really is it a better brisket that
you've<00:03:26.480> had<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.230> what<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:28.850> did<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.120> see<00:03:29.330> the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
you've had is it what so did you see the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.740 
you've had is it what so did you see the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.880

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
because there doesn't seem to be a line

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.020 
because there doesn't seem to be a line
up<00:03:37.130> outside<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:37.790> anybody<00:03:38.210> else's<00:03:38.570> stand<00:03:40.030> well
