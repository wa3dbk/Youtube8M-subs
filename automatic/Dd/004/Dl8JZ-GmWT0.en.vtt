00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.510
 and the state university in Peru is 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.730
 finds in total abandonment according to 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.870
 refer their teachers and students this 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.389
 Once a group of them took the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.349
 university la cantuta as a claim against 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.349
 the constant irregularities 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.530
 tired of the rector not leave your 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.320
 charge despite having a sentence 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.360
 court for embezzlement of funds 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.369
 students and teachers of the cantuta 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.279
 they decided to take the university in 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.830
 defense of the rule of law the first 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.720
 point is the rector's exit the second 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.059
 point is that we solve the 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.120
 computer labs 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.830
 multimedia and audiovisual equipment 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.120
 that is a paramount need perhaps 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.670
 for all the students because 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.050
 we live in a time or an era of 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.630
 technology however we do not live it 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.680
 we here as students 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.350
 before us in the dining room 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.230
 We had 2,500 servings today 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.059
 we have 1,500 servings while the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.610
 rector is in no condition 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.680
 had their deans tried to retake the 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.019
 control of the only state university 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.060
 Pedagogical of Peru 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.219
 maybe what accompany me to local 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.899
 humanities so they see all the 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:14.969
 districts that have done for the partner 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.969
 the ability for all children 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:23.240
 let's just show they're screaming 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:24.740
 the authority was forced to retire and 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.539
 the students showed us the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.939
 conditions in which they study when 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.399
 exposes you also do not listen too and 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.009
 to study to form ourselves academically 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.289
 it is not adequate it is practically 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.149
 outrageous what the days that 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.009
 we are having if it is for that mind 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.840
 the 80s 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.450
 look at mines that in the quality of pipe the 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.000
 TV everything is piggy not then 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.969
 what could we say this is study to 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.560
 this we could call university to this 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.890
 we could say this is the work of 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.590
 Our authorities in Peru 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.290
 the situation of the cantuta is not alien to 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.820
 the other state universities are missing 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.710
 of budget and low level of 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.720
 teachers join a law 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.500
 university that takes more than two 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.940
 decades waiting for its reform
