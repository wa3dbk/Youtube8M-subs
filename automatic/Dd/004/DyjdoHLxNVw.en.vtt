second<00:01:27.299> date<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.340> product<00:01:29.759> has

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
second date I think that the product has

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.300 
second date I think that the product has
to<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.930> work<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> hair<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
to have time to work on the hair that is

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.910 
to have time to work on the hair that is
not<00:01:32.610> something<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.210> use<00:01:33.650> one<00:01:34.650> time

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
not something that you can use one time

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.069 
not something that you can use one time
and<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:35.549> automatically<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.540> make<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and then automatically you can make the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.749 
and then automatically you can make the
determination<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.310> not<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> good

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
determination that this is not a good

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.270 
determination that this is not a good
product<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.869> will<00:01:40.320> say<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.770> when<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> product

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
