and a 55-gallon drum however my power

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.680 
and a 55-gallon drum however my power
needs<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.880> be<00:00:36.000> more<00:00:36.210> than<00:00:36.390> what<00:00:36.540> this

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
needs got to be more than what this

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.369 
needs got to be more than what this
thing<00:00:36.899> could<00:00:37.050> supply<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:38.340> thing<00:00:38.550> will<00:00:38.700> do

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
thing could supply this thing will do

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.930 
thing could supply this thing will do
you<00:00:40.379> know<00:00:40.469> probably<00:00:40.770> around<00:00:40.980> 8<00:00:41.250> kilowatts<00:00:41.760> or

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
you know probably around 8 kilowatts or

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.660 
you know probably around 8 kilowatts or
so<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.360> beyond<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.520> just

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
so and beyond that the the it's just

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.160 
so and beyond that the the it's just
more<00:00:44.820> than<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> engine<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.600> put<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.899> so

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
more than what the engine can put out so

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.639 
more than what the engine can put out so
I<00:00:47.160> needed<00:00:47.969> more<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.300> 15<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.379> does<00:00:49.500> have

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
I needed more like 15 it does have

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.170 
I needed more like 15 it does have
provisions<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.190> electric<00:00:50.550> start<00:00:50.820> it's

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
provisions for electric start it's

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.900 
provisions for electric start it's
actually<00:00:51.480> got<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:52.250> flywheel<00:00:53.250> size<00:00:53.670> ring

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
actually got this flywheel size ring

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.869 
actually got this flywheel size ring
gear<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.390> side<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.620> got<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
gear on this side and then it's got a

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.360 
gear on this side and then it's got a
Chevy<00:00:56.879> flex<00:00:57.270> plate<00:00:57.600> type<00:00:58.440> ring<00:00:58.739> gear<00:00:58.980> here

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
Chevy flex plate type ring gear here

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.369 
Chevy flex plate type ring gear here
along<00:00:59.640> with<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> mount<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> starter<00:01:00.690> I've

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
along with the mount for a starter I've

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.959 
along with the mount for a starter I've
actually<00:01:01.590> never<00:01:01.890> used<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> electric<00:01:02.699> start

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
actually never used the electric start

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.530 
actually never used the electric start
on<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.329> when<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.939> it<00:01:05.939> had<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.330> there

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
on this when I got it it had it on there

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.510 
on this when I got it it had it on there
and<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.080> found<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.770> kind<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.159> unreliable

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and I found it to be kind of unreliable

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.550 
and I found it to be kind of unreliable
so<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.840> went<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> hand<00:01:10.380> crank

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
so I just went with the hand crank

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.830 
so I just went with the hand crank
method<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.240> figure<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.330> you've<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.720> old

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
method I figure if you've got an old

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.210 
method I figure if you've got an old
generator<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.920> should<00:01:14.040> be

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
generator like this and it should be

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.670 
generator like this and it should be
hand<00:01:14.490> crank<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.970> start<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:16.350> does<00:01:16.470> require

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
hand crank to start and it does require

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
hand crank to start and it does require
a<00:01:16.770> little<00:01:16.890> bit<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> effort<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.490> get<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
a little bit of effort to get the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
a little bit of effort to get the
flywheels<00:01:18.090> turn<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.450> fast<00:01:18.630> enough<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.020> start

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
flywheels turn and fast enough to start

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.550 
flywheels turn and fast enough to start
but<00:01:19.970> once<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.150> them<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:21.930> then

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
but once you get them up and going then

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.859 
but once you get them up and going then
then<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> starts<00:01:23.729> off<00:01:23.850> pretty<00:01:24.299> easy<00:01:24.540> every

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
then it starts off pretty easy every

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.190 
then it starts off pretty easy every
single<00:01:25.170> time<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:26.390> this<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.509> an<00:01:27.600> ST<00:01:27.930> type

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
single time so this is an ST type

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.800 
single time so this is an ST type
generator<00:01:28.950> head<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.390> I've<00:01:30.390> actually<00:01:30.540> removed

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
generator head and I've actually removed

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.990 
generator head and I've actually removed
the<00:01:31.170> serpentine<00:01:31.619> belt<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.310> I've<00:01:32.729> still

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the serpentine belt there but I've still

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.510 
the serpentine belt there but I've still
got<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.829> it<00:01:34.829> comes<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
got it it's a it comes with the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.990 
got it it's a it comes with the
generator<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.570> mounted<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> cart

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
generator so it's mounted on the cart

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.140 
generator so it's mounted on the cart
for<00:01:39.140> Castor's<00:01:40.430> it's<00:01:41.430> pretty<00:01:41.640> heavy<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.030> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
for Castor's it's pretty heavy but it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:56.450 
for Castor's it's pretty heavy but it
does<00:01:42.299> roll<00:01:42.479> around<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.290> hand<00:01:43.530> pressure

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.600 

and<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.210> generator<00:01:57.600> actually<00:01:58.020> comes<00:01:58.260> with

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
and this generator actually comes with

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.330 
and this generator actually comes with
some<00:01:59.610> parts<00:01:59.970> that<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.300> gathered<00:02:00.810> in

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
some parts that I gathered in

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.290 
some parts that I gathered in
preparation<00:02:02.340> for<00:02:02.370> putting<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.940> thing<00:02:03.120> on<00:02:03.240> a

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
preparation for putting this thing on a

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.030 
preparation for putting this thing on a
trailer<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:04.140> never<00:02:04.320> actually<00:02:04.530> use<00:02:04.830> this

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
trailer and I never actually use this

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
electric pump and I was intending to use

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
the thermal driving head wasn't enough

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.810 
the thermal driving head wasn't enough
to<00:02:49.320> keep<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.590> temperature<00:02:49.950> cool<00:02:50.160> inside<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
to keep the temperature cool inside the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.449 
to keep the temperature cool inside the
generator<00:02:51.570> then<00:02:51.840> I'd<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:52.980> pump<00:02:53.250> kick

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
generator then I'd have that pump kick

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.310 
generator then I'd have that pump kick
on<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.850> circulate<00:02:54.390> some<00:02:54.540> additional<00:02:54.930> coolant

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
on to circulate some additional coolant

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.140 
on to circulate some additional coolant
then<00:02:56.100> I've<00:02:56.190> got<00:02:56.310> some<00:02:56.340> other<00:02:56.520> stuff<00:02:56.610> here<00:02:57.030> I've

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
then I've got some other stuff here I've

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.120 
then I've got some other stuff here I've
got<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.470> starter<00:02:58.470> motor<00:02:59.720> reservoir

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
got the starter motor reservoir

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.229 
got the starter motor reservoir

miscellaneous hoses mounts for the
radiator<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.840> then<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.650> came<00:03:04.950> with<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
radiator and then this came with the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.620 
radiator and then this came with the
generator<00:03:05.610> I've<00:03:05.820> actually<00:03:06.000> never<00:03:06.299> really

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630

done<00:03:07.620> anything<00:03:07.830> with<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.430> it's<00:03:08.790> got<00:03:08.940> a

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
done anything with it but it's got a

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.960

couple of spare head gaskets in it and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.509 
couple of spare head gaskets in it and

the couple other generator parts in here
mold<00:03:15.330> wrenches<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.260> put<00:03:16.620> some<00:03:16.890> things<00:03:17.070> like

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
mold wrenches and put some things like

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.080 
mold wrenches and put some things like

it and the cylinder temperatures will
get<00:03:43.230> up<00:03:43.380> there<00:03:43.560> pretty<00:03:43.740> quick<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:45.020> only<00:03:46.020> let<00:03:46.290> it

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
get up there pretty quick so only let it

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.080 
get up there pretty quick so only let it
around<00:03:46.560> here<00:03:46.770> for<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> few<00:03:47.190> seconds<00:03:47.580> but<00:03:47.760> we'll

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
around here for a few seconds but we'll

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.500 
around here for a few seconds but we'll
fire<00:03:48.300> it<00:03:48.330> up<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.720> let<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:48.870> get<00:03:49.050> up<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.260> speed
