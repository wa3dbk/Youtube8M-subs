 mario kart demonstrate this is a 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.070
 excellent game that remains in any

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.650
 years

 any is a good time to play 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.099
 marital and an excellent title to do 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.680
 and undo friendships so they have 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.150
 memories of how you were thrown 2 blood 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.030
 cells in the same race 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.910
 talking about bad luck but good for 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.730
 keep it fair let's choose just one 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.680
 track by game so in honor of the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.310
 sea launch the cartridge this is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.060
 my top 5 of mario kart tracks number 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.060
 5 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.620
 one of the most detailed tracks in my 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.690
 opinion the truth I really love the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 thematic that you have feels exit 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.009
 directly from donkey kong country and I 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.780
 love how to get out of the way you 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.700
 they start to throw what I think they are 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.729
 few in what you have idea that we 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.470
 launches but good also personally 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.899
 he was always trying to get me on 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.909
 ferry that goes through the river without power 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.590
 achieve it if you could all in the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.320
 comments but I really do not know if it's 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.229
 possible tell me how to do it if you know 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.539
 a simple track very good for 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.590
 start very good to measure your 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:38.390
 enemies and your rivals the truth 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.390
 backpack number 4 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.359
 when people talk about mario kart 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.850
 usually does not mention this great 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:52.090
 title of the series and the truth is a 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.490
 pity with this clue the one of sky garden 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.530
 shows that it is an excellent title is 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.719
 a track that at first glance seems 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.280
 quite simple but the fact that 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.709
 you can fall at any time what 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.380
 treater makes it quite interesting and the 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.270
 fact that it has shortcuts that require 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.789
 precise jumps makes it one of my 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.789
 favorite number 3 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.530
 this track and the turn back have many 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.330
 similarities the element of there 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.400
 traffic during the race does 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.830
 quite interesting but the truth 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.440
 I prefer this track more because it has more 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.270
 details as with my favorite is that 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.730
 You can try to climb the sides of the 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.320
 bridge this shortcut that can be the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.830
 difference between being in first place 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.020
 or be literally last 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.820
 it really makes it very interesting too 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.130
 that has car bombs and 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.010
 cars that have mushrooms with booster 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.860
 add a layer of difficulty and 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.090
 strategy to this track and the truth the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.090
 always consider the track 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.090
 representative of marking debts number 2 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.879
 this track is just great it 's 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:19.010
 vibrant colorful detailed and especially 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.560
 musical the fact that the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.629
 approximately 60% of the track is 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.269
 made of musical instruments being 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.450
 simply beautiful this is a clue 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.310
 full of obstacles at each turn has 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.069
 huge musical notes that they want 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.560
 crush piranhas plans they want 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.739
 eat the rhythm of small music 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.560
 Traps that move and make you lose 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.239
 the road drums that if they do not take them 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.569
 well you can get out of the track 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.720
 especially that of the shortcut then this 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.359
 track the truth is very very good almost 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.480
 is in my number 1 but good let's see 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.739
 what is number 1 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.739
 number 1 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.860
 that's how all the rawls rhythms are 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.320
 clues although they are hated by many 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.280
 fans of the series handle the pressure 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.470
 My favourites 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.770
 this is where you really measure your 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.250
 skills and the retas do not say the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.170
 true 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.940
 this is where you can also see everything 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.420
 the visual spectacle that can offer 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.300
 of the game is a lot of challenge a lot of fun 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.520
 also from the first Karl Kart up 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.280
 mario kart 8 these tracks are 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.280
 unforgettable for better or for worse 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.460
 well these are my favorite tracks of 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.200

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.060
