so<00:00:00.840> now<00:00:00.989> I<00:00:01.020> want<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.230> talk<00:00:01.380> about<00:00:01.589> setting<00:00:02.159> up

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
so now I want to talk about setting up

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
so now I want to talk about setting up
your<00:00:02.970> your<00:00:03.870> signal<00:00:04.350> standard<00:00:04.950> your<00:00:05.940> aspect

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
your your signal standard your aspect

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.320 
your your signal standard your aspect
ratio<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.290> your<00:00:07.950> frame<00:00:08.250> rate<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:08.910> basically

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
ratio and your frame rate so basically

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.400 
ratio and your frame rate so basically
this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.660> are<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.380> recording<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.340> HD<00:00:12.059> or<00:00:12.410> not

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
this is are you recording to HD or not

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.260 
this is are you recording to HD or not
HD<00:00:13.950> so<00:00:15.440> HD<00:00:16.440> high-definition<00:00:16.740> footage<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.970> your

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
HD so HD high-definition footage on your

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.370 
HD so HD high-definition footage on your
XH<00:00:18.600> a1<00:00:18.810> means<00:00:19.590> 1080i<00:00:20.630> that's<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.810> standard<00:00:22.109> it

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
XH a1 means 1080i that's the standard it

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.170 
XH a1 means 1080i that's the standard it
records<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.430> also<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> option<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
records in you also have the option to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.630 
records in you also have the option to
report<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.840> your<00:00:24.960> standard<00:00:25.350> definition<00:00:25.640> which

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
report to your standard definition which

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.589 
report to your standard definition which
is<00:00:26.670> for<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> DI<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.310> if<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> reason<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
is for a DI and if you have a reason to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.900 
is for a DI and if you have a reason to
record<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> standard<00:00:31.410> NIF<00:00:31.560> depth<00:00:32.040> definition

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
record the standard NIF depth definition

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.910 
record the standard NIF depth definition
then<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.540> know<00:00:33.630> go<00:00:33.780> ahead<00:00:33.899> go<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.649> it

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
then you know go ahead go for it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.680 
then you know go ahead go for it
but<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.610> bought<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.850> high-definition<00:00:36.300> camera

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
but you bought a high-definition camera

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.959 
but you bought a high-definition camera
so<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.410> assuming<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.980> want<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.399> recording

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
so I'm assuming you want to be recording

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.569 
so I'm assuming you want to be recording
in<00:00:39.180> HD<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.559> let<00:00:40.710> me<00:00:40.800> show<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.280> how<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.460> set

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
in HD so let me show you how you set

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.850 
in HD so let me show you how you set
that<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.780> want<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.960> hit<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.260> menu<00:00:43.649> button

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that up you want to hit your menu button

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.459 
that up you want to hit your menu button
and<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.360> very<00:00:45.539> first<00:00:45.600> options<00:00:46.260> where

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
and then the very first options where

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.970 
and then the very first options where
you<00:00:46.530> want<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> go<00:00:46.860> signal<00:00:47.160> setup<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.800> want

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
you want to go signal setup so we want

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.889 
you want to go signal setup so we want
to<00:00:50.070> switch<00:00:50.280> down<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.360> signal

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to switch down here we have signal

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.560 
to switch down here we have signal
standard<00:00:52.410> HD<00:00:53.370> let's<00:00:53.850> justwell<00:00:54.090> them<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.390> right

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
standard HD let's justwell them on right

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.020 
standard HD let's justwell them on right
now<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.590> click<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:57.000> actually

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
now so if I click this I can actually

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.319 
now so if I click this I can actually
see<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:57.809> options<00:00:58.289> here<00:00:59.280> are<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> options<00:00:59.579> HD

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
see my options here are the options HD

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.650 
see my options here are the options HD
which<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.690> 1080i<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.859> said<00:01:02.420> SD<00:01:03.420> which

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
which is 1080i like I said SD which

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660 
which is 1080i like I said SD which
stands<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:03.989> standard<00:01:04.470> definition<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.159> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
stands for standard definition and you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.210 
stands for standard definition and you
could<00:01:05.850> record<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.450> 16:9<00:01:07.260> which<00:01:07.950> means

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
could record that in 16:9 which means

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.710 
could record that in 16:9 which means
widescreen<00:01:08.729> which<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> video

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
widescreen which is what the video

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.690 
widescreen which is what the video
you're<00:01:10.020> watching<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.380> looks<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.189> then

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you're watching now looks like and then

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.590 
you're watching now looks like and then
SD<00:01:12.360> 4/3<00:01:13.140> which<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> more<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.600> square

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
SD 4/3 which is a more of a square

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.380 
SD 4/3 which is a more of a square
picture<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.799> same<00:01:16.979> aspect<00:01:17.340> ratio<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.820> older

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
picture the same aspect ratio that older

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.429 
picture the same aspect ratio that older
tube<00:01:18.659> TVs<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.759> set<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.720> want<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
tube TVs are in so set that up I want to

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.980 
tube TVs are in so set that up I want to
stay<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.619> HD<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.250> course<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.150> next<00:01:24.420> option<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
stay in HD of course the next option you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.380 
stay in HD of course the next option you
have<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.770> frame<00:01:25.979> rate<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:27.210> your

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
have is your frame rate and here your

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.090 
have is your frame rate and here your
options<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.020> 6<00:01:28.320> di<00:01:28.880> which<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.119> basically

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
options you have 6 di which is basically

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.789 
options you have 6 di which is basically
60<00:01:32.100> frames<00:01:32.400> interlaced<00:01:33.180> which<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:34.380> basic

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
60 frames interlaced which is your basic

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.310 
60 frames interlaced which is your basic
video<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.090> 30<00:01:36.390> frames<00:01:36.840> which<00:01:37.170> is

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
video then you have 30 frames which is

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.620 
video then you have 30 frames which is
30<00:01:37.560> frames<00:01:37.710> progressive<00:01:38.400> which<00:01:39.060> also<00:01:39.390> looks<00:01:39.570> a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
30 frames progressive which also looks a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.870 
30 frames progressive which also looks a
lot<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:39.930> video<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.590> then<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.250> 24

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
lot like video and then you have 24

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.910 
lot like video and then you have 24
frames<00:01:42.180> progressive<00:01:42.840> which<00:01:43.380> gives<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.740> more

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
frames progressive which gives a more

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
frames progressive which gives a more
film<00:01:44.310> look<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.299> play<00:01:45.570> around<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.960> these

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
film look so play around with these

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.219 
film look so play around with these
frame<00:01:46.530> rates<00:01:46.829> basically<00:01:47.659> 24<00:01:48.659> gives<00:01:49.020> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
frame rates basically 24 gives you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.380 
frame rates basically 24 gives you
essentially<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.430> said<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> more<00:01:50.820> film<00:01:51.119> look

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
essentially like I said a more film look

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.350 
essentially like I said a more film look
that<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.140> also<00:01:52.259> cause<00:01:52.560> problems<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:53.430> when

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that it can also cause problems of when

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.060 
that it can also cause problems of when
you<00:01:54.450> pan<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.930> camera<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> little<00:01:55.920> bit

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
you pan the camera you get a little bit

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.950 
you pan the camera you get a little bit
of<00:01:56.159> stuttering<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.509> don't<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:57.780> that

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
of stuttering and if you don't like that

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.190 
of stuttering and if you don't like that
maybe<00:01:58.170> switch<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.890> 30<00:01:59.340> F<00:01:59.549> 30<00:02:00.149> frames<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.780> then

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
maybe switch to 30 F 30 frames and then

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.280 
maybe switch to 30 F 30 frames and then
you<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> more<00:02:01.740> video<00:02:02.210> look<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:04.170> that

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
you get a more video look but that

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.490 
you get a more video look but that
stutter<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.890> gone<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:06.290> yeah<00:02:07.290> that's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
stutter is gone and yeah that's

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.999 
stutter is gone and yeah that's
basically<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.280> shoot<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.670> 24<00:02:09.300> frames

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
basically it I shoot in 24 frames

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.850 
basically it I shoot in 24 frames
because<00:02:11.009> I

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
because I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.080 
because I
I<00:02:11.920> just<00:02:12.160> think<00:02:12.310> it's<00:02:12.460> a<00:02:12.550> little<00:02:12.670> bit<00:02:12.910> better

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
I just think it's a little bit better

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.140 
I just think it's a little bit better
it's<00:02:13.780> kind<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:13.960> up<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.770> get<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.880> set

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
it's kind of up to you and get that set

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.190 
it's kind of up to you and get that set
up

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
up

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.770 
up
so<00:02:17.680> that's<00:02:17.890> setting<00:02:18.580> your<00:02:18.820> your<00:02:19.360> signal

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
so that's setting your your signal

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.520 
so that's setting your your signal
standard<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.560> your<00:02:20.680> frame<00:02:21.040> rate<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:22.540> your<00:02:23.290> XH

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
standard and your frame rate on your XH

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.710 
standard and your frame rate on your XH
