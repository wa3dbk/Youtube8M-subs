00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
will dip into the mid 50s but like I

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.059 
will dip into the mid 50s but like I
said<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:26.870> don't<00:03:26.959> really<00:03:27.290> notice<00:03:27.470> those<00:03:27.799> drops

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.500 
pretty fantastic as you can see I would
say<00:03:39.260> low<00:03:39.530> at<00:03:39.709> 1440p<00:03:40.489> on<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:40.970> potato<00:03:41.299> masher

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
say low at 1440p on a potato masher

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.690 
say low at 1440p on a potato masher
looks<00:03:42.079> significantly<00:03:42.290> better<00:03:43.010> than<00:03:43.340> the

30fps yes this is half the framerate at
the<00:04:19.250> PlayStation<00:04:19.789> 4<00:04:20.000> version<00:04:20.419> so<00:04:20.630> it's

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
the PlayStation 4 version so it's

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.010 
the PlayStation 4 version so it's
probably<00:04:21.229> not<00:04:21.349> for<00:04:21.709> everyone

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
probably not for everyone

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.200 
probably not for everyone
if<00:04:23.199> 30fps<00:04:23.800> honestly<00:04:24.520> doesn't<00:04:24.819> bother<00:04:24.970> you

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
if 30fps honestly doesn't bother you

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.150 
if 30fps honestly doesn't bother you
especially<00:04:25.360> for<00:04:25.900> things<00:04:26.020> like<00:04:26.199> the<00:04:26.620> campaign

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
especially for things like the campaign

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.439 
especially for things like the campaign
when<00:04:27.400> you're<00:04:27.520> not<00:04:27.639> competing<00:04:27.880> against<00:04:28.300> other

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449

when you're not competing against other
people<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.110> want<00:04:29.199> to<00:04:29.319> try<00:04:29.500> it<00:04:29.530> out<00:04:29.770> the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
people and you want to try it out the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.999 
people and you want to try it out the
game<00:04:30.580> looks<00:04:30.900> fantastic<00:04:31.900> on<00:04:32.020> 1440p<00:04:32.710> with

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
game looks fantastic on 1440p with

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:34.080 
game looks fantastic on 1440p with
everything<00:04:33.340> on<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.520> highest<00:04:33.819> visual

everything on the highest visual

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.120 
everything on the highest visual
settings<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:34.690> highly<00:04:35.289> recommend<00:04:35.319> trying<00:04:35.949> it

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
settings so I highly recommend trying it

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.839 
settings so I highly recommend trying it
at<00:04:36.310> least<00:04:36.569> now<00:04:37.569> if<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:38.020> want<00:04:38.199> a<00:04:38.259> game<00:04:38.410> at<00:04:38.560> 4k

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
at least now if you want a game at 4k

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.249 
at least now if you want a game at 4k
unfortunately<00:04:39.849> things<00:04:40.210> aren't<00:04:40.599> quite<00:04:40.990> as

feel it I know the potato masher version
is<00:04:43.060> doing<00:04:43.360> very<00:04:43.569> well<00:04:43.840> up<00:04:44.050> till<00:04:44.199> now<00:04:44.380> but<00:04:45.069> 4k<00:04:45.520> is

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
is doing very well up till now but 4k is

a<00:04:45.669> little<00:04:45.849> bit<00:04:45.940> of<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.090> problem<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:47.319> can<00:04:47.979> kind

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
a little bit of a problem you can kind

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.930 
a little bit of a problem you can kind
of<00:04:48.880> play<00:04:49.210> at<00:04:49.539> 30fps<00:04:50.349> with<00:04:51.099> everything<00:04:51.699> on<00:04:51.910> the

lowest<00:04:52.330> settings<00:04:52.660> 60<00:04:53.560> is<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.680> pipedream

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
lowest settings 60 is a pipedream

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.800 
lowest settings 60 is a pipedream
although<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.759> framerate<00:04:55.000> will<00:04:55.330> sometimes

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
although the framerate will sometimes

never going to get to 60 that's just the

never going to get to 60 that's just the

reality of it but if you want to play at
4k<00:05:04.870> it<00:05:05.289> is<00:05:05.349> technically<00:05:06.159> possible<00:05:06.220> just<00:05:06.849> at

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
4k it is technically possible just at

occasional frame stutter and if you're

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:11.820 
occasional frame stutter and if you're
thinking<00:05:10.840> well<00:05:11.020> what's<00:05:11.229> the<00:05:11.380> big<00:05:11.530> deal<00:05:11.710> of

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
thinking well what's the big deal of

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.290 
thinking well what's the big deal of
play<00:05:11.979> at<00:05:12.039> these<00:05:12.190> higher<00:05:12.400> resolutions<00:05:13.000> anyway

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.249 
play at these higher resolutions anyway
why<00:05:13.960> is<00:05:13.990> it<00:05:14.229> so<00:05:14.349> difficult<00:05:14.560> well<00:05:15.490> here<00:05:15.970> is<00:05:16.259> to

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
why is it so difficult well here is to

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.070 
why is it so difficult well here is to
scale<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:18.039> game<00:05:18.190> playing<00:05:18.490> at<00:05:18.610> 720p<00:05:19.270> as<00:05:19.720> if<00:05:19.960> you

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
scale the game playing at 720p as if you

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.409 
scale the game playing at 720p as if you
bought<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.380> Xbox<00:05:20.830> one<00:05:21.069> version<00:05:21.240> here<00:05:22.240> it<00:05:22.330> is

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
still a pretty awesome accomplishment

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.249

potato masher your monitor probably cost

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.020 
potato masher your monitor probably cost
more<00:05:56.440> than<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.919> computer<00:05:57.340> you're<00:05:57.520> playing<00:05:57.849> it

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
more than the computer you're playing it

more than the computer you're playing it
on

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.089 

battlefield<00:06:01.780> hardline<00:06:01.900> is<00:06:02.680> a<00:06:02.710> pretty

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
game on the potato masher it's

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.420 
game on the potato masher it's
noticeably<00:06:07.629> better<00:06:07.810> than<00:06:08.110> battlefield<00:06:08.560> 4<00:06:08.860> it

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
noticeably better than battlefield 4 it

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.129 
noticeably better than battlefield 4 it
doesn't<00:06:09.729> have<00:06:09.909> the<00:06:10.150> famous<00:06:10.479> memory<00:06:10.930> leak

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
doesn't have the famous memory leak

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.350 
doesn't have the famous memory leak
issue<00:06:11.379> and<00:06:11.800> just<00:06:12.580> seems<00:06:12.759> to<00:06:12.909> be<00:06:12.969> a<00:06:13.030> bit<00:06:13.210> more

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
issue and just seems to be a bit more

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.869 
issue and just seems to be a bit more
refined<00:06:13.840> although<00:06:14.319> I<00:06:14.349> can't<00:06:14.740> say<00:06:14.979> it<00:06:15.639> really

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:15.879 
refined although I can't say it really

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:17.969 
refined although I can't say it really
has<00:06:16.060> that<00:06:16.300> much<00:06:16.569> visual<00:06:17.050> improvement<00:06:17.650> in<00:06:17.740> some

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
has that much visual improvement in some

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.890 
has that much visual improvement in some
areas<00:06:18.340> I<00:06:18.460> think<00:06:18.490> it<00:06:18.729> may<00:06:18.879> not<00:06:19.060> look<00:06:19.270> quite<00:06:19.539> as

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
areas I think it may not look quite as

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.770 
areas I think it may not look quite as
good<00:06:20.199> as<00:06:20.409> battlefield<00:06:20.740> 4<00:06:21.360> still<00:06:22.360> it's

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
good as battlefield 4 still it's

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.600 
good as battlefield 4 still it's
visually<00:06:23.319> a<00:06:23.349> fairly<00:06:23.860> impressive<00:06:24.129> game

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
visually a fairly impressive game

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.459 
visually a fairly impressive game
although<00:06:25.210> I<00:06:25.240> can't<00:06:25.900> say<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.199> police-station

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
although I can't say the police-station

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.580 
although I can't say the police-station
version<00:06:27.250> is<00:06:27.340> anything<00:06:27.729> special<00:06:28.120> in<00:06:29.110> fact<00:06:29.379> I

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
version is anything special in fact I

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.249 
version is anything special in fact I
think<00:06:29.650> it's<00:06:29.919> one<00:06:30.069> of<00:06:30.189> the<00:06:30.310> worst<00:06:30.759> looking

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
think it's one of the worst looking

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.510 
think it's one of the worst looking
