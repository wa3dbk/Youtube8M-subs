00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320
 the karlsruher sc presents wildpark 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:12.269
 tv powered by bathing tv so yours 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.340
 Manuela still relatively early phase 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.269
 is from his serious injury 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 and cruciate ligament tear 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.720
 through this bout event and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.350
 thereby also a cartilage injury 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.630
 having had it as a companion injury 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.630
 the whole thing delays the temporal 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.170
 so clearly I am 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.800
 believe the reals was that, after all 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.390
 what matters now is that important 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.239
 I had fun because without fun 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.190
 just does not there but 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.600
 in the end responsible for him 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.309
 Exercises all together so that one 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.829
 as well progresses and he is too 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.309
 the one who drives and spurs me on 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.649
 Exercise well every day 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.899
 the medical department is the same 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.940
 important below 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.589
 to work finally every day 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.400
 stretch in the coming bowing to 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.930
 there are small progresses to come 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.900
 Every day, but finally we pull ourselves 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.619
 also to the high and always try 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.229
 to do more 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.150
 that means he does not just bring the body 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.770
 All right if you want there is also 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.110
 the head in the psyche asked every day 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.420
 So that 's a thing you used to do 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.100
 certainly intuitively already done so 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 but it matters more today 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.970
 has won because simply the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.250
 Pressure load also for such players 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.320
 I have to get higher and higher 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.740
 I have to work 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.920
 i have financial losses i have 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.540
 maybe no perspective anymore 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.180
 so these are all psyche 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.220
 components that reha too 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.040
 Of course, matisse affect ours 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.259
 of course , and then see players 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.259
 We demanded more today, too 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.430
 to collaborate in the direction 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.570
 eight and a half weeks after the operation 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.350
 and there can be quite a lot 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.439
 work on the power of course 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.420
 thighs and a perseverance and we 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.610
 look positive towards the whole he is 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.790
 a very stable person of his 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.340
 character structure very much 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.720
 reliable absolute profi too and 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.379
 because of that he already has a lot 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.750
 has experienced and as he has me 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.269
 expressed and also behave 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.269
 he wants that the basic requirement 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.129
 and I think that had to trust that 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.590
 we do that together with our team 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.610
 pack stream eternal for many many 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.260
 years while ksc accompanied the ksc 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.090
 is part of the ksc you have to say first 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.830
 Now there is one, so to speak 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.390
 official title is now 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.810
 remix bathing become a partner 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.280
 in this season 2 12 13 what is 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.569
 behind it was the trigger for you 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.239
 to say that this is indeed trite 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.610
 but it is a matter of the heart 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.750
 I have very nice times 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.329
 may from the ksc 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.510
 I also have the unfortunately 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.599
 to see negative medal side 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.209
 or have to and we will see again now 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.220
 I am in a very serious situation 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.810
 Grown up in the city I live in 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.420
 the city i am allowed to work in the city 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.620
 and the ksc is part of the city yes 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.930
 Of course, I'm constantly in 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.170
 contact to some players if 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.989
 actually once a week definitely 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.670
 at ksc 1000 through passes me the 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.220
 of course, play live 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.239
 otherwise now at the beginning with the 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.470
 crutches what a bit hard the 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.170
 to watch away games 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.359
 that tracked me in the live ticker and 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.080
 Of course it will change now after 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.100
 I can drive and 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.160
 then I will also be the selection player 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.170
 but by visiting the manuels 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.120
 experienced is it is a player of 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.340
 so that can handle very well that 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.500
 mentally worked out again 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.280
 the positive mood for yourself 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.650
 produce 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.770
 and I have to say it 's fun with him 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.120
 to work because he just knows and that 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.840
 He thinks he has a serious one now 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.780
 injury 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.270
 the forecasts are very good so they 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.340
 are well over 50 percent because of that 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.350
 One can never say so at the beginning 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.450
 it is now a career ending or has that 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.820
 players also have chances back in 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.040
 this high quality athletic 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.989
 return to play and in 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.060
 I have to say that he did 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.580
 Everything turned out so well that we were there 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.010
 can already say that very good 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.420
 Forecasts I would like to go back to football 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.490
 play 29 years 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.470
 I have a few more years so do not 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.790
 so I want to stop I am him 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.540
 in the goal come to the team too 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.830
 Helping is helping her and me 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.500
 I think I'm from the head and also from 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.240
 my environment so much strengthened that 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.770
 I can clearly define that, too 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.770
 can say that I will come back
