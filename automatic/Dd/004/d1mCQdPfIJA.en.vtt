fluffy<00:02:24.480> brush<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:25.650> gives<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.160> nice

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
fluffy brush and this gives that nice

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.770 
fluffy brush and this gives that nice
definition<00:02:26.760> near<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.240> base<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.420> your<00:02:27.720> lashes

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
definition near the base of your lashes

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.740

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
so you know its darkest at that part and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.480 
so you know its darkest at that part and
then<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> liner<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:31.740> lighter<00:02:32.040> or<00:02:32.340> not

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
then the liner is a bit lighter or not

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.810 
then the liner is a bit lighter or not
as<00:02:32.730> harsh<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:34.560> very<00:02:34.710> fluffy<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.340> do<00:02:35.490> like
