much need for it but if you wanted to
you<00:01:05.460> could<00:01:05.670> theoretically<00:01:06.080> salt<00:01:07.080> comes<00:01:07.290> off

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you could theoretically salt comes off

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.310 
you could theoretically salt comes off
here<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.280> taken<00:01:08.520> off<00:01:08.729> already<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.049> put

it back in there so it's kind of like a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.420 
it back in there so it's kind of like a
dual<00:01:13.080> layer<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.560> he<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.220> hard

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
dual layer one he get like your hard

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.249 
dual layer one he get like your hard
case<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> back<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.110> your
