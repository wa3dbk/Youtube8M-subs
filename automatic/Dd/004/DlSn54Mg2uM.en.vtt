00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
you know I kept on going up against good

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.029 
you know I kept on going up against good
guys<00:04:52.850> and<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.419> really<00:04:54.199> just<00:04:54.229> was<00:04:54.590> out<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:55.010> prove

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
something and I guess like the last

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.320 
something and I guess like the last
couple<00:04:57.830> runs<00:04:58.130> I<00:04:58.220> don't<00:04:58.370> even<00:04:58.460> know<00:04:58.729> where<00:04:59.210> it

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
couple runs I don't even know where it

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.659 
couple runs I don't even know where it
came<00:04:59.449> from<00:04:59.510> but<00:04:59.900> I<00:05:00.169> was<00:05:01.100> doing<00:05:01.250> some<00:05:01.520> stuff

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669
