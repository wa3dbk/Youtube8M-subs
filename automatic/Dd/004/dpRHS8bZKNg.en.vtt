all<00:00:01.079> right<00:00:01.290> I'm<00:00:01.469> getting<00:00:01.680> ready<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.979> take<00:00:02.159> part

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
all right I'm getting ready to take part

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.280 
all right I'm getting ready to take part
my<00:00:02.850> winter<00:00:03.120> setup<00:00:03.510> which<00:00:03.720> is<00:00:03.750> simply<00:00:04.170> an

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
my winter setup which is simply an

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.820 
my winter setup which is simply an
aerator<00:00:04.680> pumps<00:00:05.670> air<00:00:05.819> through<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.060> garden<00:00:06.390> hose

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
aerator pumps air through a garden hose

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.140 
aerator pumps air through a garden hose
down<00:00:07.830> into<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.220> bottom<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.550> pond<00:00:08.820> through

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
down into the bottom of the pond through

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.009 
down into the bottom of the pond through
a<00:00:09.179> nozzle<00:00:09.530> with<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> four<00:00:11.099> or<00:00:11.130> five<00:00:11.250> holes<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.820> it

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
a nozzle with a four or five holes in it

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.740 
a nozzle with a four or five holes in it
brings<00:00:13.019> up<00:00:13.200> bubbles<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.710> keep<00:00:14.480> oxygen<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
brings up bubbles to keep oxygen in the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.380 
brings up bubbles to keep oxygen in the
water<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.410> also<00:00:16.850> keeps<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> pond<00:00:18.210> from

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
water and it also keeps the pond from

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.090 
water and it also keeps the pond from
freezing<00:00:18.810> over<00:00:19.050> because<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.500> disturbs<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
freezing over because it disturbs the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.779 
freezing over because it disturbs the
surface<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.640> water<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:22.430> so<00:00:23.430> far<00:00:23.670> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
surface of the water and so far it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.000 
surface of the water and so far it
doesn't<00:00:24.330> matter<00:00:24.539> how<00:00:24.750> much<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:24.960> freezes<00:00:25.859> or

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
doesn't matter how much it freezes or

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.529 
doesn't matter how much it freezes or
how<00:00:26.099> much<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.400> snows<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:26.880> always<00:00:27.150> kept<00:00:27.420> a

how much it snows it's always kept a
good<00:00:27.720> circle<00:00:28.460> open<00:00:29.460> there<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.289> keeps<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
good circle open there and keeps the

this sleeve is a bigger hole which is
going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.810> reduce<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.409> pressure<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.490> also

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
going to reduce the pressure and it also

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.270 
going to reduce the pressure and it also
has<00:01:08.909> holes<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.890> made<00:01:11.100> with

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
has holes in it that I just made with

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100 
has holes in it that I just made with
the<00:01:11.369> drill<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:12.240> gonna<00:01:12.330> reduce<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> pressure

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the drill it's gonna reduce the pressure

the drill it's gonna reduce the pressure
coming<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.100> not<00:01:14.220> coming<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.549> real

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
coming out so it's not coming out real

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and settle inside the pond of course I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.899 
and settle inside the pond of course I
have<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.170> change<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> every<00:01:34.680> fall<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.700> that's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
have to change it every fall but that's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.990 
have to change it every fall but that's
the<00:01:36.299> setup<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:36.990> spring<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:38.340> it'll

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the setup I have for spring and it'll

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390 
the setup I have for spring and it'll
course<00:01:39.270> spill<00:01:39.689> over<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.920> front

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
course spill over in the front

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.090 
course spill over in the front
creating<00:01:42.409> disturbance<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.500> order<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.950> keep

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
creating disturbance in order to keep

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.789 
creating disturbance in order to keep
oxygen<00:01:44.310> flow<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.720> that's<00:01:45.869> my<00:01:46.049> buyers<00:01:46.350> set<00:01:46.680> up

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
oxygen flow and that's my buyers set up

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.260 
oxygen flow and that's my buyers set up
for<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> spring<00:01:47.399> I'm<00:01:47.520> gonna<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.970> right<00:01:48.090> now

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
for the spring I'm gonna do it right now

00:01:48.270 --> 00:03:12.789 
for the spring I'm gonna do it right now
and<00:01:48.570> let<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.380> what<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.590> looks<00:01:49.710> like

I'll put some in the front pond now this

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.440 
I'll put some in the front pond now this
will<00:04:22.650> grow<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.840> moving<00:04:24.840> water<00:04:24.870> without<00:04:25.680> soil<00:04:26.039> I

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
will grow in moving water without soil I

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.850 
will grow in moving water without soil I
just<00:04:27.450> throw<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.750> right<00:04:27.870> over<00:04:27.990> in<00:04:28.200> that<00:04:28.349> top<00:04:28.590> on

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
just throw it right over in that top on

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.680 
just throw it right over in that top on
and<00:04:29.849> it<00:04:30.479> will<00:04:30.630> establish<00:04:31.020> itself<00:04:31.410> quite<00:04:32.010> well

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
and it will establish itself quite well

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.190 
and it will establish itself quite well
as<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.960> season<00:04:34.349> warms<00:04:34.710> up<00:04:34.919> just<00:04:35.960> throw<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.080> on

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
as the season warms up just throw it on

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.240 
as the season warms up just throw it on
in<00:04:37.380> here

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.080 

of<00:04:40.580> course<00:04:40.850> it's<00:04:41.030> good<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.530> anchor<00:04:42.530> some<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:42.860> it

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
of course it's good to anchor some of it

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.570 
of course it's good to anchor some of it
like<00:04:44.090> so<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.810> has<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:44.990> base<00:04:45.620> so<00:04:46.310> it's<00:04:46.430> not

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
like so so it has a base so it's not

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.000 
like so so it has a base so it's not
moving<00:04:46.790> around<00:04:47.170> and<00:04:48.170> it'll<00:04:48.440> grow<00:04:48.530> there<00:04:48.770> it'll

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
moving around and it'll grow there it'll

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.070 
moving around and it'll grow there it'll
fill<00:04:49.280> this<00:04:49.370> whole<00:04:49.550> area<00:04:49.580> here<00:04:50.540> I<00:04:50.570> also<00:04:50.810> have<00:04:51.050> a
