00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.539
 hello guys all girls of lorite and me 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:10.320
 I bring today a tutorial on how to install 

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:12.600
 the x power that is an application a 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.450
 Program 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:20.480
 that helps us to play pc games 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.100
 with a control of the xbox 360 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.830
 well the first thing that will do us 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.170
 missing is going to be an xbox command 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.170
 like this one that goes by cable only 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.960
 is usually the command that came before with 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.100
 the fair X of 45 years but good 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.720
 It can also be found in 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.630
 shops 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:46.600
 and the cables are the wireless controls 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.600
 I think they do not help us for this 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.180
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.329
 connect the command through the usb port to 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.680
 our pc and come to the official website 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.450
 from microsoft 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.900
 in the hardware section 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.360
 in the part of the xbox 360 controls by 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.050
 windows 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.290
 at your door here down here 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.680
 we choose our operating system and 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.909
 be windows 7 view or windows xp the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.950
 bits that we have 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.950
 we select the Spanish language 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.310
 Spanish 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:34.420
 and we give to download if it will lower us 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:39.040
 this exe point that will help us 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:42.830
 install the drivers so that it works 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.970
 the command of the xbox in our pc 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.130
 I have that installed 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.660
 so the next step would be to install 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.920
 the program really the x power 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.710
 exists 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.690
 I know, leave a link with everything they do 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.640
 missing in the middle fire 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.640
 it's very simple now you will see 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.399
 then I left it to you 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.399
 is here 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.440
 x for 5.7 I left everything in one 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.210
 point save then you see here 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.580
 install is this 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.490
 the exe point 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.950
 and then the next thing you have 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.610
 what to do once you have it, we 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.610
 will teach now 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.650
 is to open it as you see I do not get anything 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.209
 because I do not have the control of the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:54.080
 xbox to the pc I connect it now and it comes out 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.970
 which are the command with their buttons and such 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.720
 do not 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.960
 then you see here 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.800
 to open 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:08.400
 and the file is this the xbox 360 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.610
 controls you open this and you download the 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.820
 command of the xbox by default 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.070
 Now what you have to do is 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.120
 select a template from which 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.360
 he has left all 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.830
 here in pro country there are more but 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.660
 they are at the weird point 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.860
 but good I how to do it game to the 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.340
 games that come out here 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.280
 because with these and they serve me but 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.870
 there is a lot more for example if I want 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.569
 Mr. playing speed world 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.060
 I already have all the things that I have here 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.470
 you need to play it you can 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:53.610
 run w go back the s rotate there 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.870
 from the menu with back with the m and good 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.780
 these little things 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.349
 and for example to play at al minecraft 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.360
 which is quite well known I also have 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.520
 here already the things put 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.680
 and what happens if you vote that is to play a 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.740
 game that comes out or if you are going to put 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.920
 imagine here something else not to have 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.609
 here something else holds for me to jump with 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.540
 the to jump with the see, you give the 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.830
 time you are and from here to space 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:30.950
 as you see now there are two spaces 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.420
 then I would do that with the two not if 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.070
 we press the see 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.550
 jump and with the jump also 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:44.180
 wrong then to remove this 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.180
 we can erase and we are already erased 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:52.050
 I eat I do not want that at all good and 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.150
 that's it now you can play 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.240
 other pc games with the command of the 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.480
 xbox or past the next video 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.760
 that I will upload with this same program to 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.970
 configure a command that is not from xbox 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.000
 for example that of the ps3 or the good 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.030
 that there was me that I know any command 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.530
 and nothing that's all I hope that I have 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.530
 liked the video and until next time
