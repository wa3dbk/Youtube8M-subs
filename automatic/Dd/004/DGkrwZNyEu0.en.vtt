hi<00:00:01.589> there<00:00:01.860> for<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.310> video<00:00:02.610> I'm<00:00:02.820> going<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.000> be

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hi there for this video I'm going to be

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.900 
hi there for this video I'm going to be
showing<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.950> the<00:00:04.950> first<00:00:05.100> part<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.520> assembling

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
showing you the first part of assembling

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.000 
showing you the first part of assembling
this<00:00:06.150> lining<00:00:06.629> once<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.290> get<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.529> first<00:00:07.799> one

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
this lining once you get this first one

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.379 
this lining once you get this first one
down<00:00:08.160> all<00:00:08.460> rest<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.820> them<00:00:08.970> will<00:00:09.150> hopefully

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
down all rest of them will hopefully

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.520 
down all rest of them will hopefully
make<00:00:09.780> sense<00:00:10.250> because<00:00:11.570> fabrics<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.780> shrink<00:00:13.200> or

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
make sense because fabrics can shrink or

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.970 
make sense because fabrics can shrink or
maybe<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.340> didn't<00:00:14.580> cut<00:00:14.820> super<00:00:15.210> accurately

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
maybe you didn't cut super accurately

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.019 
maybe you didn't cut super accurately
the<00:00:16.980> easiest<00:00:17.250> way<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.550> make<00:00:17.789> sure<00:00:17.940> you're

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the easiest way to make sure you're

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.550 
the easiest way to make sure you're
going<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.180> get<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> good<00:00:18.570> finished<00:00:18.930> result<00:00:19.289> and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
going to get a good finished result and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.250 
going to get a good finished result and
that<00:00:19.680> these<00:00:19.859> pieces<00:00:20.130> don't<00:00:20.430> shift<00:00:20.939> as<00:00:21.300> you're

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
that these pieces don't shift as you're

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.080 
that these pieces don't shift as you're
sewing<00:00:22.470> each<00:00:22.680> one<00:00:22.920> down<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.670> mark<00:00:23.910> them

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
sewing each one down is to mark them

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.330 
sewing each one down is to mark them
from<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> Centers<00:00:24.750> out<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> pin

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
from the Centers out so I have a pin

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.790 
from the Centers out so I have a pin
here<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.720> happen<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.260> these<00:00:28.470> pins

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
here and I happen to like these pins

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.470 
here and I happen to like these pins
because<00:00:29.250> they're<00:00:29.490> heat<00:00:29.760> resistant<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.449> can

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
because they're heat resistant you can

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.650 
because they're heat resistant you can
iron<00:00:30.779> over<00:00:31.140> them<00:00:31.260> they're<00:00:31.500> flat<00:00:31.910> I<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.540> love

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
iron over them they're flat I just love

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.299 
iron over them they're flat I just love
these<00:00:33.750> pins<00:00:34.020> anyway

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
these pins anyway

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.940 
these pins anyway
eat<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.360> piece<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.899> pattern<00:00:37.290> piece<00:00:37.500> B<00:00:37.739> which

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
eat this piece is pattern piece B which

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.790 
eat this piece is pattern piece B which
is<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> make<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> front<00:00:38.730> flap<00:00:39.350> box<00:00:40.350> part

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
is going to make the front flap box part

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
is going to make the front flap box part
of<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> bag<00:00:41.280> when<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.610> open<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.989> have

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
of the bag when it's open and I have

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.400 
of the bag when it's open and I have
just<00:00:43.379> folded<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.770> part<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.250> half<00:00:45.079> this<00:00:46.079> piece

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
just folded the part in half this piece

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.860 
just folded the part in half this piece
as<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.579> see<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> pin<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.480> just

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
as you can see and the pin is just

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.410 
as you can see and the pin is just
marking<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.399> I've<00:00:50.399> also<00:00:50.789> done<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> same<00:00:51.210> for

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
marking it I've also done the same for

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.930 
marking it I've also done the same for
the<00:00:51.660> zipper<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.590> when<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.309> fold<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> zipper

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the zipper and when you fold the zipper

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.380 
the zipper and when you fold the zipper
in<00:00:54.059> half<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:56.100> metal<00:00:56.340> stops<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
in half the little metal stops on the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.299 
in half the little metal stops on the
zipper<00:00:57.600> should<00:00:57.809> line<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.980> should<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
zipper should line up and so should the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.590 
zipper should line up and so should the
ends<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> zipper<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.420> made

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
ends of the zipper if it's made

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.720 
ends of the zipper if it's made
correctly<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> most<00:01:02.010> important<00:01:02.550> part

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
correctly but the most important part

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.179 
correctly but the most important part
would<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> make<00:01:03.300> sure<00:01:03.449> those<00:01:03.830> metal<00:01:04.830> ends

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
would be to make sure those metal ends

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.080 
would be to make sure those metal ends
are<00:01:07.040> equal<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.159> each<00:01:08.189> other<00:01:08.490> when<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.670> fold<00:01:08.909> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
are equal to each other when you fold it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.240 
are equal to each other when you fold it
in<00:01:09.210> half<00:01:09.710> because<00:01:10.710> that's<00:01:10.860> what's<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
in half because that's what's going to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.380 
in half because that's what's going to
matter<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> end<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:11.970> when<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.210> get

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
matter at the end of this when we get

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.859 
matter at the end of this when we get
this<00:01:12.479> bag<00:01:12.689> done<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.860> what<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.869> put

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
this bag done so what I do is I put

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.289 
this bag done so what I do is I put
these<00:01:16.020> two<00:01:16.259> pins<00:01:16.500> together<00:01:16.710> I've<00:01:17.700> lined<00:01:18.119> up

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
these two pins together I've lined up

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.300 
these two pins together I've lined up
these<00:01:18.450> centers<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.680> zipper<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.100> face

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
these centers and the zipper is face

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.120 
these centers and the zipper is face
down<00:01:20.520> now<00:01:20.759> by<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> way<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.130> in

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
down now by the way can you see this in

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
down now by the way can you see this in
case<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.400> zipper<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.970> face<00:01:24.180> down<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:27.290> I've

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
case the zipper is face down and I've

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.170 
case the zipper is face down and I've
put<00:01:28.829> these<00:01:28.950> two<00:01:29.159> pins<00:01:29.340> together<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.150> just

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
put these two pins together and I just

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.260 
put these two pins together and I just
love<00:01:30.659> these<00:01:30.869> wonder<00:01:31.290> clips<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.180> I'm

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.080 
leave those two pins in there because
now<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.049> last<00:01:52.290> piece<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.670> lining<00:01:53.909> fabric

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
now the last piece is the lining fabric

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.520 
now the last piece is the lining fabric
and<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.700> wrong<00:01:57.090> side<00:01:57.420> down<00:01:57.719> okay

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and it's going wrong side down okay

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.260 
and it's going wrong side down okay
they're<00:01:58.950> right<00:01:59.130> side<00:01:59.340> down<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:01:59.729> sorry<00:01:59.880> right

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
they're right side down I'm sorry right

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.630 
they're right side down I'm sorry right
side<00:02:00.659> down

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.600 

and<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.450> move<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> clip<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and I just move the clip then and it's a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.460 
and I just move the clip then and it's a
little<00:02:08.910> bit<00:02:09.000> easier<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.330> line<00:02:09.570> all<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.990> up<00:02:10.229> so

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
little bit easier to line all this up so

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.550 
little bit easier to line all this up so
now<00:02:11.420> everything<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.510> lined<00:02:12.750> up<00:02:12.930> from<00:02:13.050> here<00:02:13.320> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
now everything is lined up from here to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.600 
now everything is lined up from here to
here<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.850> can<00:02:15.030> remove<00:02:15.300> these<00:02:15.510> pins<00:02:15.870> and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
here so you can remove these pins and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.100 
here so you can remove these pins and
then<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.850> pin<00:02:18.090> down<00:02:18.120> rest<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.080> just

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
then you can pin down rest of it just

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.180 
then you can pin down rest of it just
with<00:02:19.410> wonder<00:02:19.740> clips<00:02:20.010> now<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:22.010> usually<00:02:23.010> just<00:02:23.130> put

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
with wonder clips now I usually just put

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.090 
with wonder clips now I usually just put
a<00:02:23.340> few<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:24.350> because<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.440> can<00:02:25.560> hold<00:02:25.650> rest<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.010> it

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
a few in because you can hold rest of it

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.410 
a few in because you can hold rest of it
when<00:02:26.220> you're<00:02:26.310> sewing<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:28.760> put<00:02:29.760> one<00:02:29.940> down<00:02:30.120> here

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
when you're sewing and put one down here

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.030 
when you're sewing and put one down here
on<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.600> end<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:36.330> now<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.050> can<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.530> when<00:02:37.740> we

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
on the end and now you can see when we

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.000 
on the end and now you can see when we
open<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.400> whole<00:02:38.580> thing<00:02:38.820> up<00:02:39.560> kind<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.620> pretend

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
open this whole thing up kind of pretend

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.860 
open this whole thing up kind of pretend
so<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.310> can<00:02:41.490> imagine<00:02:41.940> why<00:02:42.330> we're<00:02:42.540> doing<00:02:42.660> it

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
so you can imagine why we're doing it

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.400 
so you can imagine why we're doing it
this<00:02:42.990> way

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
this way

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.820 
this way
this<00:02:44.400> will<00:02:44.610> be<00:02:44.730> what<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.000> first<00:02:45.560> part<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.740> it

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
this will be what the first part of it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.040 
this will be what the first part of it
will<00:02:46.980> look<00:02:47.130> like<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:47.850> here's<00:02:48.060> your<00:02:48.180> lining<00:02:48.450> the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
will look like so here's your lining the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.949 
will look like so here's your lining the
zipper<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.620> then<00:02:50.340> here's<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.000> inside<00:02:51.510> lining

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
zipper and then here's the inside lining

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.330 
zipper and then here's the inside lining
of<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.440> first<00:02:52.650> pocket<00:02:53.130> now<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.890> sewing

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
of the first pocket now I like sewing

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.040 
of the first pocket now I like sewing
with<00:02:56.550> these<00:02:56.910> zippers<00:02:57.300> down<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.780> I'm<00:02:57.870> going<00:02:58.020> to

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
with these zippers down so I'm going to

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.020 
with these zippers down so I'm going to
move<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.320> zipper<00:02:58.650> down<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.830> little<00:02:59.160> bit<00:02:59.310> and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
move that zipper down a little bit and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.400 
move that zipper down a little bit and
again<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.270> don't<00:03:03.330> use<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.690> whole<00:03:03.810> lot<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.200> pins

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
again I don't use a whole lot of pins

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.560 
again I don't use a whole lot of pins
when<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.650> sew<00:03:05.040> but<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.370> do<00:03:05.490> put<00:03:05.940> one<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.270> here

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
when I sew but I do put one in here

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.380 
when I sew but I do put one in here
because<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.930> like<00:03:07.110> everything<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.650> be<00:03:07.680> perfect

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.920 
because I like everything to be perfect
so<00:03:09.390> I'll<00:03:09.480> put<00:03:09.720> one<00:03:09.930> pin<00:03:12.050> right<00:03:13.050> on<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.500> end

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
so I'll put one pin right on the end

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.180
