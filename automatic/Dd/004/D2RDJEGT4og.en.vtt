it<00:02:08.429> was<00:02:08.579> a<00:02:08.640> pretty<00:02:08.819> disappointing<00:02:09.420> result

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
it was a pretty disappointing result

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.300 
it was a pretty disappointing result
considering<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> form<00:02:10.560> we're<00:02:10.769> in<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
considering the form we're in and the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.009 
considering the form we're in and the
form<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.760> man<00:02:11.879> United<00:02:12.269> or<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.510> actually

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
form that man United or in actually

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.539 
form that man United or in actually
thought<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.500> time<00:02:13.709> might<00:02:13.980> actually<00:02:14.219> be

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
thought that this time might actually be

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.000 
thought that this time might actually be
the<00:02:14.670> time<00:02:14.879> we<00:02:15.000> beat<00:02:15.150> them<00:02:15.390> but<00:02:16.140> no<00:02:16.290> cooks<00:02:16.859> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
the time we beat them but no cooks the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.559 
the time we beat them but no cooks the
atmosphere<00:02:17.370> was<00:02:17.519> great<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.879> scene<00:02:18.090> was<00:02:18.329> great

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
atmosphere was great the scene was great

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.030

just<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.900> overall<00:02:19.230> experience<00:02:19.829> at<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
just the overall experience at the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.949 
just the overall experience at the
stadium<00:02:20.430> was<00:02:20.549> great<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:21.180> wish<00:02:21.629> we'd<00:02:21.870> have
