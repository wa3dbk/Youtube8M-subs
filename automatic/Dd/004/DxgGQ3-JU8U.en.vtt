00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
computer does is it chooses a state it's

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.760 
computer does is it chooses a state it's
a<00:00:14.820> secret<00:00:15.179> state<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.570> our<00:00:15.750> job<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.500> try<00:00:16.710> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
a secret state and our job is to try to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.130 
a secret state and our job is to try to
answer<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.550> ask<00:00:17.730> questions<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.600> figure<00:00:18.779> out

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
answer to ask questions to figure out

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.790 
answer to ask questions to figure out
what<00:00:20.100> state<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.760> program<00:00:21.630> selected<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.650> there's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
what state a program selected so there's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.590 
what state a program selected so there's
different<00:00:22.890> kinds<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.490> questions<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.970> can<00:00:24.150> ask<00:00:24.300> I

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
different kinds of questions I can ask I

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.080 
different kinds of questions I can ask I
can<00:00:24.960> ask<00:00:25.320> about<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.859> color<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> state<00:00:26.760> or

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
can ask about the color of the state or

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.880 
can ask about the color of the state or
I<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.510> ask<00:00:27.630> about<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.109> relative<00:00:28.619> direction

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I can ask about the relative direction

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.990 
I can ask about the relative direction
of<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.609> state<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.630> six<00:00:31.019> total<00:00:31.410> questions

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
of a state you have six total questions

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.639 
of a state you have six total questions
so<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.030> think<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> best<00:00:33.600> course<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.020> action<00:00:34.200> at

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
so I think the best course of action at

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.760 
so I think the best course of action at
least<00:00:35.130> right<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.960> ask<00:00:37.140> about<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
least right now is to ask about the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.770 
least right now is to ask about the
direction<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.700> state<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.480> try<00:00:39.719> to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
direction of a state so I like to try to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.110 
direction of a state so I like to try to
target<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> state<00:00:40.829> right<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> middle<00:00:41.520> I'm

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
target a state right in the middle I'm

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.900 
target a state right in the middle I'm
going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> ask<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.350> state<00:00:43.969> east<00:00:44.969> of

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
going to ask is the state east of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.790 
going to ask is the state east of
Missouri<00:00:47.910> Missouri<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.600> right<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.140> let's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
Missouri Missouri is right here let's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.549 
Missouri Missouri is right here let's
see<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.820> after<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.420> find<00:00:51.629> Missouri<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
see so after going to find Missouri and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.150 
see so after going to find Missouri and
then<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.399> click<00:00:53.670> ask<00:00:53.879> question<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.770> it's<00:00:55.770> not

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
then I click ask question and it's not

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.029 
then I click ask question and it's not
east<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.059> Missouri<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.590> states<00:00:58.859> that

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
east of Missouri so all the states that

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.950 
east of Missouri so all the states that
can<00:00:59.370> no<00:00:59.640> longer<00:00:59.670> be<00:01:00.149> possible<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
can no longer be possible as the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.319 
can no longer be possible as the
selected<00:01:01.440> state<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.859> grayed<00:01:02.520> out<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
selected state are grayed out so a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.660 
selected state are grayed out so a
grayed<00:01:03.629> out<00:01:03.660> looks<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:04.979> than<00:01:05.010> half<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
grayed out looks like more than half the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.770 
grayed out looks like more than half the
United<00:01:05.970> States<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.330> was<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> good

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
United States so that was a good

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.550 
United States so that was a good
question<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.330> I'm<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> ask<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.290> this

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
question so now I'm going to ask is this

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.020 
question so now I'm going to ask is this
state<00:01:10.920> east<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.729> let's<00:01:12.510> go<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> Utah<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> my

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

second question and it is east of Utah

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.770 
second question and it is east of Utah
at<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.530> time<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.430> two<00:01:20.610> three<00:01:20.970> four<00:01:21.240> five<00:01:21.509> six

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
at that time one two three four five six

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.460 
at that time one two three four five six
seven<00:01:22.020> eight

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
seven eight

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.600 
seven eight
I<00:01:22.820> only<00:01:24.320> eliminate<00:01:25.320> eight<00:01:25.530> states<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.369> right

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
I only eliminate eight states so right

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.340 
I only eliminate eight states so right
now<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> know<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.360> state<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.930> selected

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
now I know that the state the selected

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.140 
now I know that the state the selected
state<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.680> somewhere<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> middle<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
state is somewhere in the middle so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.410 
state is somewhere in the middle so
let's<00:01:30.329> start<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:31.700> we<00:01:32.700> might<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:33.060> able<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> ask

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
let's start with we might be able to ask

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.469 
let's start with we might be able to ask
a<00:01:33.659> color<00:01:33.930> question<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> minute<00:01:34.939> let's<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.240> say

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
a color question a minute let's just say

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.170 
a color question a minute let's just say
is<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.140> let's<00:01:37.350> ask<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.890> north<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.670> Kansas

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
is it let's ask if it's north of Kansas

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.639 
is it let's ask if it's north of Kansas
Kansas<00:01:42.180> being<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.689> orange<00:01:43.110> state<00:01:43.409> right

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
Kansas being this orange state right

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.300 
Kansas being this orange state right
here<00:01:43.680> asked<00:01:44.310> question<00:01:45.290> no<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.130> was<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
here asked question no so that was a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.649 
here asked question no so that was a
good<00:01:47.520> question<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:47.939> I've<00:01:48.149> narrowed<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.630> down

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
good question so I've narrowed it down

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.170 
good question so I've narrowed it down
to<00:01:49.020> only<00:01:49.680> looks<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.909> six<00:01:51.479> states<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:53.180> have

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
to only looks like six states I have

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.490 
to only looks like six states I have
three<00:01:54.869> questions<00:01:55.200> left<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.460> let's<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.409> want<00:01:58.409> to

three questions left so let's I want to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.109 
three questions left so let's I want to
try<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.740> ask<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.070> question<00:01:59.430> now<00:01:59.460> why<00:01:59.700> eliminate

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
try to ask a question now why eliminate
