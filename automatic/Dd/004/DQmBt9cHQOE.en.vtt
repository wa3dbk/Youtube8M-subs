00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.549 

more<00:00:46.610> than<00:00:46.700> what<00:00:46.880> feedback<00:00:47.150> was

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
more than what feedback was

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.690 
more than what feedback was
on<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> tanto<00:00:50.219> blade<00:00:50.370> they<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> see

so we got some great positive feedback
they<00:00:58.410> also<00:00:58.560> want<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:58.950> see<00:00:59.130> slotted<00:00:59.550> screw<00:00:59.760> so

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
they also want to see slotted screw so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.460 
they also want to see slotted screw so
you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.120> take<00:01:00.270> them<00:01:00.360> back<00:01:00.480> into<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.840> five<00:01:01.020> six

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
you can take them back into the five six

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.670 
you can take them back into the five six
persons

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
persons

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.220 
persons
also<00:01:04.309> we<00:01:04.430> got<00:01:04.550> great<00:01:04.730> feedback<00:01:04.790> initially<00:01:05.450> off

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
also we got great feedback initially off

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.190 
also we got great feedback initially off
we<00:01:06.470> made<00:01:06.650> some<00:01:07.510> actually<00:01:08.510> some<00:01:08.690> few<00:01:08.900> changes

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
we made some actually some few changes

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.370 
we made some actually some few changes
to<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.620> sheet<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.850> military<00:01:11.450> unit<00:01:11.780> basically

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
to the sheet the military unit basically

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.560 
to the sheet the military unit basically
suggested<00:01:12.950> that<00:01:13.040> there<00:01:13.250> would<00:01:13.460> be<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.940> some

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
suggested that there would be a some

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.950 
suggested that there would be a some
type<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:14.810> snap<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.710> was<00:01:16.480> originally<00:01:17.480> for

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
type of snap that was originally for

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.740 
type of snap that was originally for
sheath<00:01:18.170> consent<00:01:18.590> did<00:01:18.770> not<00:01:18.920> have<00:01:19.160> that<00:01:19.270> so<00:01:20.270> this

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
sheath consent did not have that so this

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.110 
sheath consent did not have that so this
was<00:01:20.930> snapped<00:01:21.080> in<00:01:21.440> place<00:01:21.790> you<00:01:22.790> didn't<00:01:22.970> have

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
was snapped in place you didn't have

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.450 
was snapped in place you didn't have
this<00:01:23.300> so<00:01:24.260> we<00:01:24.410> were<00:01:24.650> looking<00:01:24.890> from<00:01:24.980> the<00:01:25.130> aspect

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
this so we were looking from the aspect

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.250 
this so we were looking from the aspect
that<00:01:25.580> they<00:01:25.730> could<00:01:25.880> snap<00:01:26.120> it<00:01:26.330> off<00:01:26.450> they<00:01:26.870> didn't

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
that they could snap it off they didn't

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.780 
that they could snap it off they didn't
like<00:01:27.410> it<00:01:27.440> didn't<00:01:28.010> work<00:01:28.160> they<00:01:28.310> commend<00:01:28.670> this

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
like it didn't work they commend this

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.240 
like it didn't work they commend this
backwards<00:01:29.390> that's<00:01:30.230> what<00:01:30.410> a<00:01:30.440> snap<00:01:30.800> on<00:01:30.980> the<00:01:31.100> back

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
backwards that's what a snap on the back

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.130 
backwards that's what a snap on the back
if<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:32.210> really<00:01:32.480> don't<00:01:32.600> want<00:01:32.870> it<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:32.990> hundred

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
if you really don't want it a hundred

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.120 
if you really don't want it a hundred
percent<00:01:33.260> somebody

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
percent somebody

it comes with a firesteel and my

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.380 
it comes with a firesteel and my
sharpener<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:40.770> also<00:01:40.920> has<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> drain<00:01:41.640> hole<00:01:41.910> right

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
sharpener it also has a drain hole right

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.170 
sharpener it also has a drain hole right
here<00:01:42.450> there's<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.560> wire<00:01:43.800> here<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.400> that<00:01:44.580> drain

the<00:02:02.780> w12<00:02:03.200> in<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.560> G<00:02:03.770> 12<00:02:05.050> we're<00:02:06.050> going<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.230> make

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
the w12 in the G 12 we're going to make

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.339 
the w12 in the G 12 we're going to make
a<00:02:06.380> little<00:02:06.560> brubber

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.970 

all<00:02:10.349> these<00:02:10.560> core<00:02:10.860> glades<00:02:11.129> because<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.760> 550

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
all these core glades because of the 550

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.270 
all these core glades because of the 550
so<00:02:14.180> these<00:02:15.180> are

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
so these are

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.880 
so these are
Nigel<00:02:17.000> becoming<00:02:17.390> out

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.640 

probably<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.790> next<00:02:21.910> corner<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:23.410> there's<00:02:23.590> a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
probably in the next corner so there's a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.449 
probably in the next corner so there's a
tato<00:02:24.190> style<00:02:25.260> light<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.560> carry<00:02:26.800> light<00:02:27.069> it's

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
tato style light to carry light it's

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.699 
tato style light to carry light it's
