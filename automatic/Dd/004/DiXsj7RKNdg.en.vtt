00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
it has a really snug fit to it so let me

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:33.800

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.270 
go ahead and put it on and the combs
yourself<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.640> combs<00:02:35.910> are<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.680> place<00:02:37.680> kind<00:02:38.099> of

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
yourself the combs are a place kind of

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.160 
yourself the combs are a place kind of
awkward<00:02:38.849> I<00:02:40.700> think<00:02:41.700> sometimes<00:02:42.540> they<00:02:42.780> need<00:02:42.989> to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
awkward I think sometimes they need to

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.479 
awkward I think sometimes they need to
be<00:02:43.410> placed<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.550> little<00:02:44.760> bit<00:02:45.170> for<00:02:46.170> lower<00:02:46.769> than

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
be placed a little bit for lower than

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.960 
be placed a little bit for lower than
where<00:02:47.760> they<00:02:47.940> are<00:02:48.239> they're<00:02:49.140> kind<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.530> high<00:02:49.709> up

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
where they are they're kind of high up

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.600 
where they are they're kind of high up
towards<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.090> temple<00:02:51.510> area<00:02:51.959> but<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.739> think<00:02:53.160> you

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
towards the temple area but I think you

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.430 
towards the temple area but I think you
get<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.850> better<00:02:53.970> hold<00:02:54.769> if<00:02:55.769> if<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.420> columns<00:02:58.230> are

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
get a better hold if if the columns are

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.350 
get a better hold if if the columns are
place<00:02:58.860> maybe<00:02:59.370> about<00:02:59.760> half<00:03:00.000> an<00:03:00.209> inch<00:03:00.239> down<00:03:02.360> let
