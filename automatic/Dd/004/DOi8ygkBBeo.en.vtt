I<00:00:15.840> like<00:00:16.840> to<00:00:17.020> walk<00:00:17.230> you<00:00:17.290> through<00:00:17.619> mirepoix<00:00:18.400> as

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
I like to walk you through mirepoix as

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.340 
I like to walk you through mirepoix as
it<00:00:18.759> cuts<00:00:18.939> available<00:00:19.480> but<00:00:19.599> also<00:00:19.750> what<00:00:19.960> mirepoix

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
it cuts available but also what mirepoix

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.290 
it cuts available but also what mirepoix
means<00:00:22.260> mirepoix<00:00:23.260> and<00:00:23.529> aromatics<00:00:24.100> are<00:00:24.340> exactly

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
means mirepoix and aromatics are exactly

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.160 
means mirepoix and aromatics are exactly
the<00:00:25.480> same<00:00:25.750> style<00:00:26.590> of<00:00:26.769> vegetable<00:00:27.310> size<00:00:27.820> cut<00:00:28.420> etc

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
the same style of vegetable size cut etc

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.529 
the same style of vegetable size cut etc
however<00:00:30.300> AeroMax

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
however AeroMax

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.650 
however AeroMax
go<00:00:32.110> in<00:00:32.290> uncooked<00:00:33.280> so<00:00:33.940> it<00:00:34.000> could<00:00:34.180> go<00:00:34.300> into<00:00:34.449> it

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
go in uncooked so it could go into it

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.450 
go in uncooked so it could go into it
for<00:00:34.809> example<00:00:35.019> a<00:00:35.199> blonde<00:00:35.410> character<00:00:36.040> going<00:00:36.340> to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
for example a blonde character going to

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.780 
for example a blonde character going to
bullion<00:00:36.910> so<00:00:37.540> they<00:00:37.719> don't<00:00:37.930> get<00:00:38.110> cut<00:00:38.620> or<00:00:39.100> sauteed

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
bullion so they don't get cut or sauteed

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.069 
bullion so they don't get cut or sauteed
or<00:00:40.030> roasted<00:00:40.540> first<00:00:40.930> however<00:00:41.800> mirepoix<00:00:42.550> do<00:00:43.079> so

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
or roasted first however mirepoix do so

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.080 
or roasted first however mirepoix do so
essentially<00:00:44.649> anything<00:00:44.860> that<00:00:45.010> is<00:00:45.190> blonde<00:00:45.760> or

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
essentially anything that is blonde or

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.720 
essentially anything that is blonde or
white<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:46.930> would<00:00:47.050> use<00:00:47.230> aromatics<00:00:48.010> anything

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
white you would use aromatics anything

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.000 
white you would use aromatics anything
that<00:00:48.879> is<00:00:49.030> dark<00:00:49.570> and<00:00:49.870> roasted<00:00:50.379> you<00:00:50.739> would<00:00:50.890> use

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
that is dark and roasted you would use

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.130 
that is dark and roasted you would use
mirepoix<00:00:51.719> now<00:00:52.719> cut<00:00:53.289> the<00:00:53.440> veg<00:00:54.989> whatever<00:00:55.989> you're

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
mirepoix now cut the veg whatever you're

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.590 
mirepoix now cut the veg whatever you're
cooking<00:00:56.320> whatever<00:00:56.620> dish<00:00:57.039> is<00:00:57.280> used<00:00:57.640> for<00:00:58.329> the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
cooking whatever dish is used for the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.900 
cooking whatever dish is used for the
mirepoix<00:00:58.899> all<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.350> aromatics<00:00:59.860> be<00:01:00.399> mindful<00:01:00.760> of

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
mirepoix all the aromatics be mindful of

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.849 
mirepoix all the aromatics be mindful of
the<00:01:01.090> length<00:01:01.329> of<00:01:01.480> time<00:01:01.690> it<00:01:01.870> takes<00:01:01.899> to<00:01:02.199> cook<00:01:02.410> if

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
the length of time it takes to cook if

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.189 
the length of time it takes to cook if
it's<00:01:03.280> a<00:01:03.340> short<00:01:03.609> cut<00:01:03.910> for<00:01:03.969> example<00:01:04.629> 20<00:01:04.930> minutes

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
it's a short cut for example 20 minutes

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.070 
it's a short cut for example 20 minutes
30<00:01:05.440> minutes<00:01:05.680> small<00:01:06.550> mirepoix<00:01:06.910> a<00:01:07.330> lot<00:01:07.899> longer

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
30 minutes small mirepoix a lot longer

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.590 
30 minutes small mirepoix a lot longer
two<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.680> three<00:01:08.890> hours<00:01:09.070> larger<00:01:09.880> mirepoix<00:01:10.150> the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
two to three hours larger mirepoix the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.600 
two to three hours larger mirepoix the
simple<00:01:10.960> reason<00:01:11.140> behind<00:01:11.439> this<00:01:11.830> is<00:01:12.040> if<00:01:12.310> you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
simple reason behind this is if you

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.880 
simple reason behind this is if you
could<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:12.939> small<00:01:13.299> and<00:01:13.600> it<00:01:13.780> has<00:01:13.810> longer<00:01:14.350> cooking

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
could it small and it has longer cooking

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.310 
could it small and it has longer cooking
processes<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:16.090> will<00:01:16.360> break<00:01:16.600> down<00:01:16.630> into<00:01:16.869> a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
processes it will break down into a

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.670 
processes it will break down into a
puree<00:01:17.740> offering<00:01:18.640> a<00:01:18.729> cloudy<00:01:19.030> stock<00:01:19.450> or<00:01:19.689> a<00:01:19.750> soup

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
puree offering a cloudy stock or a soup

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.070 
puree offering a cloudy stock or a soup
that<00:01:20.920> doesn't<00:01:21.430> have<00:01:21.640> much<00:01:21.880> structure<00:01:22.479> so

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
that doesn't have much structure so

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.480 
that doesn't have much structure so
we're<00:01:23.229> looking<00:01:23.500> for<00:01:23.680> a<00:01:23.710> fine<00:01:24.009> balance<00:01:24.369> between

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
we're looking for a fine balance between

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.420 
we're looking for a fine balance between
size<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.390> afford<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:26.020> great<00:01:26.380> flavor<00:01:26.799> into<00:01:27.280> the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
size to afford a great flavor into the

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.240 
size to afford a great flavor into the
casserole<00:01:28.150> soup<00:01:28.570> or<00:01:28.780> boolean<00:01:29.140> or<00:01:29.470> stock<00:01:29.710> etc

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
casserole soup or boolean or stock etc

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.460 
casserole soup or boolean or stock etc
and<00:01:31.020> also<00:01:32.020> not<00:01:32.530> too<00:01:32.920> small<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:34.329> break<00:01:34.540> down<00:01:34.750> so

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
and also not too small to break down so

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.219 
and also not too small to break down so
be<00:01:35.650> mindful<00:01:35.890> of<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.250> cooking<00:01:36.549> size<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:38.170> I'm

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
be mindful of the cooking size what I'm

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.600 
be mindful of the cooking size what I'm
going<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.380> go<00:01:38.500> through<00:01:38.680> now<00:01:38.860> are<00:01:39.040> three<00:01:39.280> sides

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
going to go through now are three sides

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.090 
going to go through now are three sides
or<00:01:39.820> so<00:01:39.939> it's<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.180> large<00:01:40.570> mirepoix<00:01:41.110> for<00:01:41.409> example

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
or so it's a large mirepoix for example

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.870 
or so it's a large mirepoix for example
for<00:01:42.850> long<00:01:43.090> term<00:01:43.630> 8<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.500> 10<00:01:44.770> 12<00:01:45.130> maybe<00:01:45.250> 60<00:01:45.729> now

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
for long term 8 to 10 12 maybe 60 now

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.420 
for long term 8 to 10 12 maybe 60 now
stock<00:01:46.210> preparations<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:47.079> shorter<00:01:47.920> term<00:01:48.100> maybe

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
stock preparations a shorter term maybe

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.580 
stock preparations a shorter term maybe
two<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.850> four<00:01:49.119> hours<00:01:49.329> braising<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.079> something

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
two to four hours braising and something

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.380 
two to four hours braising and something
a<00:01:50.680> bit<00:01:50.950> shorter<00:01:51.460> if<00:01:51.790> you're<00:01:51.939> cooking<00:01:52.090> some

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
a bit shorter if you're cooking some

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.780 
a bit shorter if you're cooking some
lentils<00:01:52.810> some<00:01:53.140> pulses<00:01:53.409> and<00:01:53.890> any<00:01:54.340> up<00:01:54.549> to

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939

perhaps an hour so longer cooking
process<00:01:58.390> I<00:01:58.630> would<00:01:59.140> leave<00:01:59.350> everything<00:01:59.560> as<00:02:00.009> you

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
process I would leave everything as you

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.120 
process I would leave everything as you
see<00:02:00.340> here<00:02:01.030> as<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.380> only<00:02:02.500> difference<00:02:02.649> is

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
see here as is the only difference is

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.410 
see here as is the only difference is
the<00:02:03.610> garlic<00:02:04.030> clove<00:02:04.299> I<00:02:05.040> would<00:02:06.040> just<00:02:06.250> smash<00:02:07.210> with

the garlic clove I would just smash with

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.120 
the garlic clove I would just smash with
the<00:02:07.509> back<00:02:07.659> of<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.899> knife<00:02:08.049> and<00:02:08.380> leave<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.769> as<00:02:08.920> is

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
the back of the knife and leave it as is

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
everything else you see on the board we

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.470 
everything else you see on the board we
use<00:02:11.380> for<00:02:11.769> long-term<00:02:12.310> stock<00:02:12.670> cooking<00:02:13.150> for

use for long-term stock cooking for

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.110 
use for long-term stock cooking for
example<00:02:13.810> 10<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.319> 16<00:02:14.680> hours<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.280> next<00:02:15.970> one

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
example 10 to 16 hours the next one

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.940 
example 10 to 16 hours the next one
would<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.750> little<00:02:17.260> bit<00:02:17.379> longer<00:02:17.590> for<00:02:17.739> example

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
would be a little bit longer for example

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.149 
would be a little bit longer for example
casseroles<00:02:18.879> or<00:02:19.269> stocks<00:02:20.110> or<00:02:20.530> sources<00:02:21.010> that

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
casseroles or stocks or sources that

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.940 
casseroles or stocks or sources that
takes<00:02:21.459> six<00:02:21.930> maximum<00:02:22.930> six<00:02:23.170> hours<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.709> any

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
takes six maximum six hours and any

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:35.190 
takes six maximum six hours and any
between<00:02:24.250> four<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.489> six

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.860 

so<00:02:35.770> as<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.980> can<00:02:36.099> see<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.550> good<00:02:36.819> enough<00:02:37.060> size<00:02:39.870> not

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
so as you can see a good enough size not

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:50.600 
so as you can see a good enough size not
too<00:02:41.080> small<00:02:41.380> not<00:02:41.880> too<00:02:42.880> big

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.050 

now<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.600> size<00:02:51.810> will<00:02:52.050> afford<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.560> good<00:02:53.060> flavor

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
now this size will afford a good flavor

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.860 
now this size will afford a good flavor
and<00:02:54.540> also<00:02:55.470> stay<00:02:56.460> as<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.850> whole<00:02:57.270> structure<00:02:57.660> by

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
and also stay as a whole structure by

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.150 
and also stay as a whole structure by
the<00:02:57.900> end<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.260> cooking<00:02:58.500> process<00:02:58.680> because

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
the end of the cooking process because

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.440 
the end of the cooking process because
if<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.370> need<00:02:59.460> to<00:02:59.580> remove<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.060> can<00:03:00.240> remove

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
if you need to remove it you can remove

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.360 
if you need to remove it you can remove
it<00:03:00.600> comfortably<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.500> if<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:01.920> can<00:03:02.010> be<00:03:02.040> passed

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
it comfortably and if it can be passed

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.980 
it comfortably and if it can be passed
out<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:03.150> can<00:03:03.330> be<00:03:03.360> passed<00:03:03.570> out<00:03:03.780> without

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
out it can be passed out without

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.170 
out it can be passed out without
pureeing<00:03:04.650> into<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.950> stock<00:03:05.160> grill<00:03:05.370> sauce<00:03:05.580> now

that's for four to six hours preparation
anything<00:03:09.240> that<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.510> smaller<00:03:10.520> in<00:03:11.520> time<00:03:11.970> needs

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
anything that is smaller in time needs

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:54.090 
anything that is smaller in time needs
to<00:03:12.570> be<00:03:12.690> smaller<00:03:13.080> in<00:03:13.500> size
