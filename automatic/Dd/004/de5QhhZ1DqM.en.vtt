you always come on the show and explain
some<00:00:12.900> very<00:00:13.110> interesting<00:00:13.469> surgeries<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.250> you

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
some very interesting surgeries that you

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.599 
some very interesting surgeries that you
performed<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.990> do<00:00:16.109> one<00:00:16.350> foot<00:00:16.590> at<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.830> time<00:00:17.039> yeah

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
performed you do one foot at a time yeah

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.519 
performed you do one foot at a time yeah
this<00:00:17.850> case<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.690> know<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:18.990> really<00:00:19.230> important

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
this case you know it's really important

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.929 
this case you know it's really important
actually<00:00:19.800> when<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.010> consider<00:00:20.340> foot<00:00:20.580> surgery

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
actually when you consider foot surgery

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.340 
actually when you consider foot surgery
to<00:00:21.090> do<00:00:21.390> one<00:00:21.570> foot<00:00:21.720> at<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> time<00:00:21.869> because<00:00:22.260> that

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
to do one foot at a time because that

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.620 
to do one foot at a time because that
allows<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.890> walk<00:00:23.160> normally

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
allows you to walk normally

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.170 
allows you to walk normally
with<00:00:25.140> one<00:00:25.410> foot<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.890> recover<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> other

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
with one foot and recover in the other

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.670 
with one foot and recover in the other
foot<00:00:27.480> if<00:00:27.660> you're<00:00:27.779> doing<00:00:27.930> both<00:00:28.170> feet<00:00:28.500> then

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
foot if you're doing both feet then

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.200 
foot if you're doing both feet then
you're<00:00:28.800> at<00:00:28.890> risk<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.849> way<00:00:29.939> she<00:00:30.090> has<00:00:30.179> a

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
you're at risk so that way she has a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.840 
you're at risk so that way she has a
safe<00:00:30.539> stable<00:00:30.869> base<00:00:31.470> while<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.399> recovers

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
safe stable base while this recovers

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.600 
safe stable base while this recovers
once<00:00:33.210> she's<00:00:33.450> healed<00:00:33.660> there<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.230> switch<00:00:34.440> it

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.090 

can<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:39.090> show<00:00:39.300> everyone<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:39.780> home<00:00:39.930> yeah<00:00:40.440> all

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
can we show everyone at home yeah all

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.520 
can we show everyone at home yeah all
right<00:00:41.280> let's<00:00:41.489> zoom<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.030> show<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:43.140> results

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
right let's zoom in and show the results

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.369 
right let's zoom in and show the results
because<00:00:43.910> obviously<00:00:44.910> you're<00:00:45.629> still<00:00:45.750> healing

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
because obviously you're still healing

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
because obviously you're still healing
but<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:47.070> remarkable<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> difference<00:00:48.090> in

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
but it's remarkable the difference in

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.450 
but it's remarkable the difference in
the<00:00:48.329> length<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.660> her<00:00:48.750> first<00:00:49.050> first<00:00:49.860> oh<00:00:50.070> yeah

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the length of her first first oh yeah

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.189 
the length of her first first oh yeah
she's<00:00:50.789> two<00:00:51.000> weeks<00:00:51.030> post-op<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:52.020> see

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
she's two weeks post-op so you can see

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.540 
she's two weeks post-op so you can see
there's<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> lot<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> swelling<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.340> big

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
there's a lot of swelling in that big

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.040 
there's a lot of swelling in that big
toe<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> girth<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.719> his<00:00:54.840> toes

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
toe you can see the girth of his toes

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.229 
toe you can see the girth of his toes
significant<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.520> two<00:00:56.730> weeks<00:00:56.910> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
significant because this is two weeks of

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.299 
significant because this is two weeks of
surgery<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.020> her<00:00:58.379> bones<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:58.949> still

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
surgery so her bones are actually still

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.400 
surgery so her bones are actually still
healing<00:00:59.520> they're<00:01:00.120> held<00:01:00.420> together<00:01:00.600> by<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.960> screw

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
healing they're held together by a screw

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.200 
healing they're held together by a screw
which<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.039> pretty<00:01:02.250> significant<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
which is pretty significant in the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.060 
which is pretty significant in the
surgical<00:01:03.449> technique<00:01:03.840> what<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.680> allowed<00:01:04.890> us<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
surgical technique what it allowed us to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.740 
surgical technique what it allowed us to
do<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.000> take<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.180> look<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
do is if you take a look this is a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.590 
do is if you take a look this is a
standard<00:01:07.260> foot<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.520> what<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.880> did<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.210> we

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
standard foot and so what we did is we

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.780 
standard foot and so what we did is we
took<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> sliver<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.470> bone<00:01:10.799> out<00:01:11.130> during<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
took a sliver of bone out during the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.270 
took a sliver of bone out during the
surgery<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.900> move<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.439> back<00:01:13.680> now

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
surgery and then move this back now

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.890 
surgery and then move this back now
what's<00:01:14.460> cool<00:01:14.670> about<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.540> allowed<00:01:15.750> us

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
what's cool about that is it allowed us

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.240 
what's cool about that is it allowed us
to<00:01:15.930> actually<00:01:16.080> preserve<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> joint<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.159> we

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
to actually preserve the joint so we

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920 
to actually preserve the joint so we
didn't<00:01:17.400> even<00:01:17.520> touch<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.880> join<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.479> screw<00:01:18.810> that

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
didn't even touch to join the screw that

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.300 
didn't even touch to join the screw that
you'll<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> x-ray<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.070> minute

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you'll see on the x-ray in a minute

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.640 
you'll see on the x-ray in a minute
actually<00:01:20.490> sits<00:01:21.030> inside<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.259> two<00:01:22.409> bones

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
actually sits inside the two bones

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.460 
actually sits inside the two bones
holding<00:01:23.310> them<00:01:23.430> together<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.049> keeps

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
holding them together so that keeps

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.899 
holding them together so that keeps
these<00:01:25.740> two<00:01:25.890> bones<00:01:26.040> together<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.640> she<00:01:26.700> can

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
these two bones together so she can

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.490 
these two bones together so she can
recover<00:01:27.060> let's<00:01:27.630> go<00:01:27.750> look<00:01:27.930> at<00:01:28.080> excellent

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
recover let's go look at excellent

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.319 
recover let's go look at excellent
crystals<00:01:28.799> x-rays<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:29.280> x-rays<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.180> this

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
crystals x-rays because x-rays in this

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.899 
crystals x-rays because x-rays in this
case<00:01:30.540> really<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:31.110> tell<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> picture<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.759> is

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
case really do tell the picture this is

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.719 
case really do tell the picture this is
her<00:01:33.030> pre-op<00:01:33.299> x-ray<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.159> your<00:01:35.340> pre-op<00:01:35.579> x-ray

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
her pre-op x-ray so on your pre-op x-ray

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.130 
her pre-op x-ray so on your pre-op x-ray
you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.030> evaluate<00:01:36.329> what<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.810> call<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
you can evaluate what we call the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.420 
you can evaluate what we call the
parabola<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> foot<00:01:38.070> which<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
parabola of the foot which is the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.249 
parabola of the foot which is the
relationship<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.210> these<00:01:39.299> metatarsals<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
relationship of these metatarsals and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.859 
relationship of these metatarsals and
normally<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.579> parabola<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.420> number<00:01:42.689> two

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
normally the parabola is that number two

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.480 
normally the parabola is that number two
is<00:01:42.990> longer<00:01:43.560> than<00:01:43.680> number<00:01:43.920> one<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.280> can

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
is longer than number one but you can

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.969 
is longer than number one but you can
clearly<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.030> number<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:45.659> is

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
clearly see that number one is

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.780 
clearly see that number one is
significantly<00:01:46.979> longer<00:01:47.250> than<00:01:47.340> number<00:01:47.640> two

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
significantly longer than number two

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.760 
significantly longer than number two
which<00:01:48.210> translates<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.899> much<00:01:49.079> longer<00:01:49.530> first

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
which translates to a much longer first

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.639 
which translates to a much longer first
toe<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.149> then<00:01:51.329> pan<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> next<00:01:52.200> x-ray

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
toe so if we then pan to the next x-ray

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.469 
toe so if we then pan to the next x-ray
so<00:01:53.369> what<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.700> appreciate<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.210> first

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
so what you can appreciate is first

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.149 
so what you can appreciate is first
let's<00:01:54.720> look<00:01:54.810> at<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.960> length<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> toe<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
let's look at the length of the toe the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.100 
let's look at the length of the toe the
first<00:01:56.430> toe<00:01:56.610> sits<00:01:56.850> over<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.689> second<00:01:58.020> toe

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
first toe sits over here the second toe

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.139 
first toe sits over here the second toe
sits<00:01:58.290> over<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:58.560> now<00:01:59.310> right<00:01:59.700> after<00:01:59.850> surgery

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
sits over here now right after surgery

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.170 
sits over here now right after surgery
they're<00:02:01.020> natural<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:02.430> left<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:02.880> bit

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
they're natural we left it a little bit

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.120 
they're natural we left it a little bit
longer<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.719> normal<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.530> here's<00:02:04.799> really

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
longer so it's normal but here's really

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.590 
longer so it's normal but here's really
where<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> work<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.640> done<00:02:05.700> back<00:02:06.210> here<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
where the work was done back here at the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.570 
where the work was done back here at the
metatarsal<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.290> left<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.680> joint<00:02:08.160> alone

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
metatarsal we left this joint alone

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.190 
metatarsal we left this joint alone
that's<00:02:08.849> very<00:02:09.060> important<00:02:09.539> because<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:10.140> don't

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
that's very important because we don't

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.330 
that's very important because we don't
want<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.410> touch<00:02:10.560> her<00:02:10.709> joint<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.069> prevent

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
want to touch her joint to prevent

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.490 
want to touch her joint to prevent
arthritis<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:12.300> did<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.569> osteotomy<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.319> bone

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
arthritis we did the osteotomy the bone

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.760 
arthritis we did the osteotomy the bone
cut

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
cut

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.650 
cut
right<00:02:13.950> here<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.820> took<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.000> segment<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.480> bone

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
right here and we took a segment of bone

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.990 
right here and we took a segment of bone
out<00:02:16.010> translating<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.160> reduction<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.820> look

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
out translating to a reduction so look

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.340 
out translating to a reduction so look
at<00:02:18.090> where<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:18.330> bone<00:02:18.540> sat<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.930> relation<00:02:19.320> to

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
at where this bone sat in relation to

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.490 
at where this bone sat in relation to
number<00:02:19.650> two<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.010> now<00:02:20.880> look<00:02:21.210> it's<00:02:22.020> shorter

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
number two and now look it's shorter

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.230 
number two and now look it's shorter
actually<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.280> think<00:02:23.460> we<00:02:23.640> took<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.790> centimeter

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
actually I think we took a centimeter

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.420 
actually I think we took a centimeter
and<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.420> half<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.720> bone<00:02:24.870> away<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:26.130> that's<00:02:26.220> like

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
and a half of bone away so that's like

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.520 
and a half of bone away so that's like
two<00:02:26.640> shoe<00:02:26.820> sizes<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.330> do<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:28.050> that

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
two shoe sizes so do you you have that

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.070 
two shoe sizes so do you you have that
centimeter<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.220> bone<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.880> forgot<00:02:33.600> it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
centimeter of bone I forgot it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.540 
centimeter of bone I forgot it
so<00:02:34.320> where<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.950> keep<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.280> on<00:02:35.400> your

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
so where is it you keep it on your

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.630 
so where is it you keep it on your
dresser<00:02:36.920> with<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> rest<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.280> your<00:02:38.370> jewelry

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
I am so happy I'm amazed at the lack of

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.520 
I am so happy I'm amazed at the lack of
pain<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.940> I'm<00:02:45.360> super<00:02:45.690> excited<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.080> get<00:02:46.290> both

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
pain and I'm super excited to get both

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.110 
pain and I'm super excited to get both
