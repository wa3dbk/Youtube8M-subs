okay<00:02:13.720> let's<00:02:14.020> take<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.230> look<00:02:14.320> we'll<00:02:14.710> spread<00:02:14.920> the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
okay let's take a look we'll spread the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.720 
okay let's take a look we'll spread the
cards<00:02:15.280> out<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.760> see<00:02:16.660> what<00:02:16.810> we<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:18.520> we

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
cards out and see what we have so we

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.700 
cards out and see what we have so we
have<00:02:18.910> four<00:02:19.210> cards<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.750> are<00:02:19.840> face-up<00:02:20.050> we<00:02:20.590> have

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
of clubs for cards that have nothing to

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.940 
of clubs for cards that have nothing to
do<00:02:28.120> with<00:02:28.270> each<00:02:28.360> other<00:02:28.600> but<00:02:29.230> as<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.530> said<00:02:29.590> in<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
do with each other but as I said in the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.860 
do with each other but as I said in the
beginning<00:02:30.070> they've<00:02:30.880> discontinued<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.690> brown

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
beginning they've discontinued the brown

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.330 
beginning they've discontinued the brown
cards<00:02:32.350> because<00:02:32.620> maybe<00:02:32.830> they're<00:02:33.070> not<00:02:33.190> as

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
cards because maybe they're not as

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.280 
cards because maybe they're not as
bright<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.820> it's<00:02:34.030> colorful<00:02:34.420> as<00:02:34.810> some<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.200> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
bright and it's colorful as some of the

bright and it's colorful as some of the
other<00:02:35.470> cards<00:02:35.800> we<00:02:36.430> just<00:02:36.670> got<00:02:36.850> lucky<00:02:36.880> because<00:02:37.390> we

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
other cards we just got lucky because we

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.740 
other cards we just got lucky because we
found<00:02:38.050> four<00:02:38.770> pretty<00:02:39.310> colorful<00:02:40.030> cards<00:02:40.480> a

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
found four pretty colorful cards a

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.150 
found four pretty colorful cards a
turquoise<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:42.010> green<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:43.080> fuchsia<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.410> an

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
turquoise a green a fuchsia and an

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.910 
turquoise a green a fuchsia and an
orange<00:02:45.580> okay<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:46.690> is<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.870> self<00:02:47.230> working<00:02:47.650> trick

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
orange okay this is a self working trick

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.310 
orange okay this is a self working trick
so<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.280> performance<00:02:48.640> pretty<00:02:49.209> much<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.660> the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
so the performance pretty much is the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.930 
so the performance pretty much is the
tutorial<00:02:50.680> I'm<00:02:51.190> going<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.400> show<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.610> two<00:02:51.910> ways

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
tutorial I'm going to show you two ways

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.449 
tutorial I'm going to show you two ways
how<00:02:52.270> to<00:02:52.330> perform<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:52.930> trick<00:02:53.260> first<00:02:53.709> using

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
how to perform this trick first using

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.400 
how to perform this trick first using
four<00:02:54.700> different<00:02:54.730> color<00:02:55.300> backs<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:56.020> way<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.140> did

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
four different color backs the way I did

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.170 
four different color backs the way I did
in<00:02:56.530> my<00:02:56.650> performance<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.670> second<00:02:58.060> way

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
in my performance and the second way

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.449 
in my performance and the second way
will<00:02:58.420> be<00:02:58.510> using<00:02:58.900> one<00:02:59.170> deck<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.680> four<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.340> a

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
will be using one deck and four of a

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:00.990 
will be using one deck and four of a
kind

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
kind

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.170 
kind
so<00:03:01.209> using<00:03:01.690> four<00:03:02.110> different<00:03:02.440> color<00:03:02.590> backs

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
so using four different color backs

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.840 
so using four different color backs
we're<00:03:04.180> going<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.360> use<00:03:04.630> three<00:03:05.350> four<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.250> five<00:03:06.520> and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
we're going to use three four a five and

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.610 
we're going to use three four a five and
a<00:03:06.940> ten<00:03:07.180> you're<00:03:07.540> going<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.780> remove<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.260> exact

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
a ten you're going to remove the exact

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.560 
a ten you're going to remove the exact
same<00:03:08.860> cards<00:03:09.370> from<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.610> deck<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.060> using

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
same cards from the deck that you using

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.810 
same cards from the deck that you using
and<00:03:10.810> get<00:03:11.200> rid<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.380> them<00:03:11.620> we're<00:03:12.459> going<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.640> take

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
and get rid of them we're going to take

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.490 
and get rid of them we're going to take
these<00:03:13.030> four<00:03:13.360> cards<00:03:13.660> place<00:03:14.050> them<00:03:14.290> on<00:03:14.410> the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
these four cards place them on the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.620 
these four cards place them on the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
this my tutorial for this false cut is

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.960 
this my tutorial for this false cut is
right<00:03:35.680> over<00:03:35.950> here<00:03:36.190> it's<00:03:36.430> also<00:03:36.640> in<00:03:36.880> the

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970

Hindu shuffle so you're going to grab a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.800 
Hindu shuffle so you're going to grab a
portion<00:03:42.100> of<00:03:42.190> cards<00:03:42.579> from<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.940> middle<00:03:43.209> not

affecting the bottom four cards and

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.370 
affecting the bottom four cards and
you're<00:03:46.239> going<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.420> start<00:03:46.690> peeling<00:03:46.930> them<00:03:47.230> off

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
you're going to start peeling them off

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.170 
you're going to start peeling them off
just<00:03:48.190> like<00:03:48.400> this<00:03:48.720> right<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.989> top<00:03:51.150> then<00:03:52.150> you

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
just like this right to the top then you

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.180 
just like this right to the top then you
can<00:03:52.540> do<00:03:52.630> an<00:03:52.750> overhand<00:03:53.260> shuffle<00:03:53.560> if<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:53.980> like

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
just hold on to the cards on the bottom

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.069 
just hold on to the cards on the bottom
pick<00:03:57.160> up<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.430> group<00:03:57.579> of<00:03:57.730> cards<00:03:58.030> and<00:03:58.480> start

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
peeling them off so it looks like you're

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.520 
peeling them off so it looks like you're
shuffling<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.630> cards<00:04:01.840> but<00:04:02.260> you're<00:04:02.380> not
