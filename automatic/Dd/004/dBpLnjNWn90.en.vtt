00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello everyone in this video, I will tell you how 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.719
 call here such a scarf for a child 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.710
 from the set which is decorated with applique 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:17.070
 teddy bear or scarf recruit gray 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.619
 thread 6 loops and knit garter stitch 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.340
 that is, all the loops in the facial and purl 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.130
 knit facial rows immediately knit 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.320
 increase, that is, we add at the beginning and in 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.099
 the end of the row with 1 loop in every second 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.769
 row 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.670
 until you have needles 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.690
 20 loops will turn out further we knit directly to 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.910
 the right length and how much we need and 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.460
 we finish the scarf with the same butterflies 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.829
 as we did at the beginning that is, we subtract 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.440
 in every second row beginning at the end of the row 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.989
 one loop until the needles 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.960
 6 loops which we will not turn out 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.070
 closing it turns out such a basis for 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.680
 scarf which we further decorate for paws 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.170
 and dial 4 loops and further even 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.750
 at the same time , a garter stitch is added to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.140
 every second row at the beginning and at the end 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.610
 rows in one loop until 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.200
 we will fail 12 loops on the needle 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.810
 then knit 4 rows straight without increments 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.930
 after which we start decreasing we subtract 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.180
 also at the beginning and at the end of a row one by one 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.250
 loop 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.250
 so here I am knitting 2 together facial 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.240
 the beginning of the series and at the end of the series is similar to 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.770
 as long as we don't have to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.620
 needles 8 loops and then continue 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:50.820
 knit garter stitch without increments without 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:55.720
 downs straight up to a height of 30 rows and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:01.080
 closing the loop turns out such here 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.080
 paw which we knit 4 things 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.369
 for the head we collect on the spokes 6 loops and 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.000
 knit also with the increase fee 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.460
 viscous 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.890
 adding in every second row to those 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.670
 until the needles have 16 loops 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.410
 further knit right 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.440
 knitting 6 rows right next we start 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.900
 increments decrease symmetrically 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.360
 increase that is at the beginning and at the end 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.420
 every row in every second row 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.830
 until the needles are 6 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:41.630
 loops the remaining 6 loops close and 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.650
 the head is ready for the abalone we collect 6 loops 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.400
 and knit garter stitch 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.400
 4 rows straight 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.110
 then do a low start and end 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.110
 row 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.800
 first shelves immediately 2 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.420
 and knit the next row and at a height of 6 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.510
 rows close the loop and do it 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.350
 better broach for the edge to be 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.840
 more neat like that 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.780
 knit facial loop 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:41.050
 stretched the first again knit 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:45.810
 pulled stretched so doing up 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:49.930
 end of the row for the muzzle dial 4 loops 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.410
 then add through a row of one 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.600
 loop on each side 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.850
 then knit 4 rows straight garter 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.400
 viscous and then do likewise y 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:06.310
 butterfly 1 half point 2 butterfly 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.950
 here so we knit one more of 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.680
 night row with facial loops and close 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.840
 loops 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.510
 It turns out this detail tail 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.250
 knit similarly, too, the same circle 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.480
 knit crochet nose thinner 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:30.250
 knit a chain with blue threads 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:34.780
 from 4 air loops + one loop 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.680
 for lifting the first row of knit 4 columns 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.680
 without nakida 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.800
 and 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.490
 then turn knitting second row 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.620
 we knit similarly to the posts without nakida with 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.150
 this instead of the first column knit one 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.760
 loop for lifting and knit to make it 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:17.330
 smoother knitting for the back wall 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:20.710
 and the last row knit one air 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.710
 lifting loop 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:29.230
 then the next 2 loops knit together 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.230
 single crochet 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.810
 knit the last loop without single crochet 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:50.880
 we cut the thread here 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:54.150
 detail and now we collect a bear we sew 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.660
 to both ends of the scarf paws front and 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.660
 rear 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:09.540
 here we sew to one end 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:14.420
 head on her face and nose head 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:17.150
 sew ears and rear tail sew 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.560
 better to do it all with hidden stitches 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:25.080
 neatly gray thread so that the seams 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:28.260
 were invisible remains to make details 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:35.520
 cut out small felt out of felt 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:40.500
 ears we sew them do the same of felt 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:46.490
 zapla wheelbarrow sew a black thread from 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:50.160
 beads do eyes and hind legs 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:52.910
 also sew items from felt too 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.910
 black thread 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.550
 like that, we sew patches with a black thread 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:04.080
 glasses to hind legs 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:07.290
 on the muzzle eyebrow eyes here embroider 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.710
 muzzle also black thread and all the scarf 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.710
 ready 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:20.629
 all scarf is ready how to knit a hat you 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.629
