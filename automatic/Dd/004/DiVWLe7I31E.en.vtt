 cyborgs 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.269
 when we talk about them consciousness 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.940
 pop up footage from fantastic 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.469
 films and we do not believe that this can 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.100
 be in real life 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.910
 however they exist and already live 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.939
 among us 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.580
 about ten years ago jerry java la 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.519
 suffered from an accident 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.080
 part of his ring finger of his left hand 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.539
 had to amputate 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.030
 but jerry did not despair and decided to do 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.579
 something you would hardly have thought of 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.960
 sensible man he rooted in 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.340
 the rest of the limbs usb flash drive 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.800
 implanted drive hidden under 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.160
 prosthetic and attached to the undamaged 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.890
 finger areas many have heard the story 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.860
 Oscar Pistorius South Africans 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.379
 which both legs were amputated but it is not 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.420
 broke his character Pistorius 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.910
 uses created from carbon 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.590
 fiber prostheses made form 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.270
 English letter j 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.119
 they let him ok 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.010
 move regardless of disability 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.430
 Oscar even took part in 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.799
 Paralympic Games 2012 and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.080
 won the second place in the run for 200 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.610
 meters but shortly after graduation 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.790
 competition 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.549
 he was convicted of murdering his girlfriend 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.610
 moreover Oscar shot her by mistake 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.270
 mistaking for a robber, but that didn't save him 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.390
 from punishment the age of nine rob 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.270
 spence left without right eye after 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.850
 unsuccessful shot from a gun passed 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.130
 about five years with a glass implant 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.860
 the slave decided to replace it with a tiny 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.590
 battery operated camcorder 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.259
 a miniature device records everything 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.570
 he sees it in real time 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.450
 the recording can be watched online or 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.149
 see later comrades tim canon 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.250
 helped him put a real one under his skin 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.340
 electronic chip which is in mode 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.990
 real time captures the temperature 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.630
 then sends the data 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.459
 on a smartphone, according to canon 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.489
 technology can be embedded in the system 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.290
 smart home cram a person different 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.870
 types collecting data 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.989
 and mood and then home appliances 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.890
 will be able to create for him as much as possible 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.560
 comfortable atmosphere 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.680
 for example, make the lighting muted 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.469
 and turn on relaxing amal music 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.079
 county implanted himself and rfid carriers 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.510
 the hand of each hand between the index and 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.659
 thumb they let him 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.909
 open the doors of the house car or enter 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.579
 into your computer using quick 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.250
 scan also its chip associated with 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.650
 social media account implants 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.290
 hard to notice if amal himself is not 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.439
 wish them to demonstrate the cameras 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.900
 work hardening can be done without risk 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:57.599
 call a cyborg he lost both his legs and 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.389
 arm at train crash back in the distant 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.760
 childhood but using dentures replacing 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:05.250
 scheme all three missing limbs 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.189
 he was able to become an athlete player in 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.950
 golf and even a movie actor cameron has 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:13.439
 different sets of prostheses serving 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.590
 specific goals in some convenient to walk 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:19.139
 in others to run and in the third they swim 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.329
 give the clip quite an interesting life 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.790
 kevin warwick as well as before 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.220
 said county amal has 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.560
 several chips implanted into the body 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.139
 but besides that kevin has 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.120
 electronic implants one set he 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.819
 connected to his own nervous 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.669
 system and a different set to his wife 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.310
 now so his wife Kevin would n't do 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:43.590
 everything feels even at a great distance 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.139
 many scientists believe that all of his 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.579
 inventions serves for entertainment they 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:52.500
 for science, kevin thinks otherwise 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.870
 Terminator is exactly what they call Nigel 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.569
 most people and everything because u 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.849
 him the so-called terminator hand 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.489
 which most of us consider 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.979
 sheer fiction so friends here 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.229
 such hands exist and actively 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:10.109
 already used in real life and 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:11.099
 began that direct proof by the way 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.379
 this hand 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.199
 it is not difficult for him to shuffle the deck 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.150
 cards or even independently tie 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.829
 shoelaces 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.380
 famous nile harbisson do not distinguish 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.120
 many flowers still 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.280
 no but after scientists 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.730
 implanted into his brain a special 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.370
 antenna he began to hear the colors of the receiver 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.760
 understands what color the nile looks at and 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.410
 gives him beautiful sound waves 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.080
 Nil likes to listen to masterpieces 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.540
 architectures with interest he perceive 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.820
 and sounds from portraits of famous people 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.470
 by the way he easily perceives 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.660
 infrared radiation and ultraviolet on 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.380
 first place deservedly gone 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.560
 amazing man 140 years ago 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.670
 lost both hands about him to no one 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.830
 take care and he is practically without help 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.850
 he can hardly even cook 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.930
 yourself to eat 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:15.020
 he has only one true friend by 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.020
 nickname chuck who loves hair 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.300
 at first he walked on but then 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.180
 the government gave him a special 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.760
 equipped machine which is controlled 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.630
 using your feet in great happiness 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.090
 engineers from johns hopkins university 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.970
 wanted to help weight they want to 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.540
 40 years later , he again felt 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.920
 man for this, scientists have created 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.790
 special vest 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.800
 equipped with two bionic hands 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.200
 the device is controlled by the power of thought with 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.320
 using sensors placed on the nerve 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.870
 endings the human body is initially forest not 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.600
 understood what was going on like that 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.780
 possible but realizing he was so 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.270
 happy like no other for forty 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.930
 years later he felt again 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.690
 man dear friends thank you for 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.060
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.490
 release don't forget to tell about it 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.800
 I also recommend to my friends 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.560
 see about 10 cities that will be 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.330
 wiped out and about ghosts 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.330
 see you soon
