is<00:05:34.020> so<00:05:34.380> use<00:05:35.160> your<00:05:35.190> imagination<00:05:35.420> and<00:05:36.420> yeah<00:05:37.200> so

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
is so use your imagination and yeah so

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.010 
is so use your imagination and yeah so

color<00:05:40.880> kind<00:05:41.880> of<00:05:42.740> but<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:43.770> think<00:05:44.130> it's<00:05:44.220> really

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
color kind of but I think it's really

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.610 
color kind of but I think it's really
pretty<00:05:44.550> and<00:05:44.880> it's<00:05:45.450> not<00:05:45.630> too<00:05:45.960> dramatic<00:05:46.350> if<00:05:46.470> you

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
pretty and it's not too dramatic if you

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.560 
pretty and it's not too dramatic if you
use<00:05:46.740> it<00:05:46.860> lightly<00:05:47.070> but<00:05:47.460> you<00:05:48.090> can<00:05:48.240> build<00:05:48.390> it<00:05:48.450> up

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
use it lightly but you can build it up

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.350 
use it lightly but you can build it up
so<00:05:48.810> let's<00:05:49.470> do<00:05:49.560> this<00:05:49.680> um<00:05:49.970> yeah<00:05:50.970> I'm<00:05:51.090> not<00:05:51.240> really

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
so let's do this um yeah I'm not really

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.760 
so let's do this um yeah I'm not really
gonna<00:05:51.570> talk<00:05:51.960> while<00:05:52.200> I'm<00:05:52.260> putting<00:05:52.500> it<00:05:52.560> on<00:05:52.650> but

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770
