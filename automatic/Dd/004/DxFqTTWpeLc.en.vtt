00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
my guys I need to start learning how to

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.060 
my guys I need to start learning how to
proper<00:00:08.519> camera<00:00:08.730> because<00:00:09.420> again<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.230> into<00:00:10.830> doing

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
proper camera because again I into doing

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.430 
proper camera because again I into doing
a<00:00:11.099> whole<00:00:11.250> other<00:00:11.460> tech<00:00:11.820> because<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.960> don't

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
a whole other tech because I you don't

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
a whole other tech because I you don't
see<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.980> bottom<00:00:14.250> half<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.580> my<00:00:14.700> first<00:00:15.410> so<00:00:16.460> this

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
see the bottom half of my first so this

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.609 
see the bottom half of my first so this
video<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.420> be<00:00:18.539> science<00:00:19.109> related

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
video it's going to be science related

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.590 
video it's going to be science related
this<00:00:20.039> may<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.310> interesting<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.180> may<00:00:21.359> be<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
this may be interesting this may be the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.759 
this may be interesting this may be the
point<00:00:21.750> where<00:00:21.990> you'd<00:00:22.140> send<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> video

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
point where you'd send the video

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.590 
point where you'd send the video
straight<00:00:23.100> off<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.580> hopefully<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.300> incisal

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
straight off but hopefully the incisal

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.390 
straight off but hopefully the incisal
will<00:00:24.869> keep<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.230> there<00:00:25.380> because<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.160> about

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
will keep you there because it is about

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.980 
will keep you there because it is about
how<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.699> make<00:00:26.910> glowing<00:00:27.630> goldfish<00:00:29.630> if<00:00:30.630> anyone's

with allegedly of the week which was the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
with allegedly of the week which was the
genetic<00:00:45.920> manipulation<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.039> animals<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:49.020> at

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
genetic manipulation of animals and at

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.799 
genetic manipulation of animals and at
the<00:00:50.250> end<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> ledge<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.600> quick

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the end of the ledge it was just a quick

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.040 
the end of the ledge it was just a quick
bit<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.320> house<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.739> ankle<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.070> goldfish<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
bit of house and ankle and goldfish and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.080 
bit of house and ankle and goldfish and
I<00:00:55.050> mentioned<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.739> her<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.640> she<00:00:56.850> was<00:00:56.969> like

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I mentioned it to her and she was like

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
I mentioned it to her and she was like
you<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.510> make<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> video<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.199> comical<00:00:58.739> that

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
you have to make a video on comical that

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.529 
you have to make a video on comical that
I<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> make<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> video<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.210> glowing

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
I have to make a video on glowing

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.530 
I have to make a video on glowing
goldfish<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:02.359> it's<00:01:03.359> quite<00:01:03.510> simple<00:01:03.570> actually

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
goldfish so it's quite simple actually

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.880 
goldfish so it's quite simple actually
probably<00:01:06.540> more<00:01:06.750> simple<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.290> talk<00:01:07.500> about<00:01:07.650> than

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
probably more simple to talk about than

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.160 
probably more simple to talk about than
it<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.310> do<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.950> basically<00:01:12.170> simple

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it is to do but it's basically simple

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.039 
it is to do but it's basically simple
steps<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:14.369> take<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.909> fertilized<00:01:15.509> egg<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
steps you take a fertilized egg of a

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.050 
steps you take a fertilized egg of a
fish<00:01:16.320> because<00:01:16.979> obviously<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.460> fish<00:01:17.700> Liz's

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
fish because obviously if fish Liz's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.450 
fish because obviously if fish Liz's
eggs<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.450> video<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.799> bottom<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> tank

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
eggs on video on the bottom of the tank

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.060 
eggs on video on the bottom of the tank
the<00:01:20.820> male<00:01:20.970> fish<00:01:21.210> fertilizes<00:01:21.930> them<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the male fish fertilizes them so it's a

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.330 
the male fish fertilizes them so it's a
fertilized<00:01:23.820> egg<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.390> fish<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.159> can

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
fertilized egg of a fish and then we can

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.609 
fertilized egg of a fish and then we can
use<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.880> technique<00:01:27.450> called<00:01:27.659> little<00:01:28.200> extra

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
use a technique called little extra

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.460 
use a technique called little extra
operation<00:01:29.210> where<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.540> take<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.320> an

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
operation where we take just an

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.609 
operation where we take just an
electrical<00:01:32.100> current<00:01:33.140> applied<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.409> this

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
electrical current applied it to this

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.510 
electrical current applied it to this
egg<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.299> then<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.650> we<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.680> pores<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.400> our

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
egg and then like we have pores on our

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.569 
egg and then like we have pores on our
skin<00:01:38.939> every<00:01:39.780> cell<00:01:40.049> has<00:01:40.079> its<00:01:40.380> own<00:01:40.710> pause<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
skin every cell has its own pause so the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.109 
skin every cell has its own pause so the
pause<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.210> egg<00:01:42.540> starts<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.350> open<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
pause on this egg starts it open and

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.929 
pause on this egg starts it open and
then<00:01:45.119> from<00:01:45.390> there<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.350> pull<00:01:47.280> shoot

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
then from there we can just pull shoot

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.679 
then from there we can just pull shoot
the<00:01:48.869> shoot<00:01:49.619> our<00:01:49.860> own<00:01:49.890> gene<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.579> DNA<00:01:50.909> into<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the shoot our own gene and DNA into the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.469 
the shoot our own gene and DNA into the
egg<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.590> when<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.040> egg<00:01:53.399> develops<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.299> fish

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
egg so when the egg develops that fish

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.789 
egg so when the egg develops that fish
develops<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.259> gene<00:01:55.560> will<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:57.030> fish

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
develops the gene will be in that fish

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.999 
develops the gene will be in that fish
and<00:01:59.240> then<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.840> gene<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and then as for the gene we have to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.639 
and then as for the gene we have to
actually<00:02:02.310> create<00:02:02.520> our<00:02:02.909> own<00:02:02.939> gene<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.750> how<00:02:04.590> we

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
actually create our own gene and how we

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.130 
actually create our own gene and how we
go<00:02:04.860> about<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.729> by<00:02:06.540> winning<00:02:07.530> two<00:02:07.950> things

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
go about this is by winning two things

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.030 
go about this is by winning two things
we<00:02:10.140> need<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:11.039> fluorescent<00:02:11.760> protein<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
we need the fluorescent protein so the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.369 
we need the fluorescent protein so the
ouch<00:02:13.250> live<00:02:13.489> fuller<00:02:13.700> Isis<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.900> then<00:02:15.079> we<00:02:15.200> need<00:02:15.349> a

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
ouch live fuller Isis and then we need a

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.729 
ouch live fuller Isis and then we need a
promoter<00:02:15.829> and<00:02:16.540> then<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.689> proper<00:02:18.140> matter<00:02:18.500> is

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
promoter and then the proper matter is

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.080 
promoter and then the proper matter is
is<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.969> it's<00:02:20.329> a<00:02:20.569> response<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:22.250> if<00:02:22.640> there<00:02:23.060> is

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
is that it's a response so if there is

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.020 
is that it's a response so if there is
something<00:02:23.859> that<00:02:24.859> happens<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.640> fish

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
something that happens to the fish

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.949 
something that happens to the fish
that's<00:02:26.959> promote<00:02:27.379> a<00:02:27.409> response<00:02:28.069> to<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:29.299> it

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
that's promote a response to that and it

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.030 
that's promote a response to that and it
works<00:02:30.470> in<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:30.950> cell<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.349> set<00:02:33.650> where<00:02:33.920> to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
works in the cell and a set where to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.780 
works in the cell and a set where to
that<00:02:34.189> goldfish<00:02:34.640> glow<00:02:34.939> is<00:02:35.590> via<00:02:36.640> estrogen<00:02:37.640> or

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
that goldfish glow is via estrogen or

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.369 
that goldfish glow is via estrogen or
estrogen<00:02:38.090> however<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:39.049> say<00:02:39.560> in<00:02:39.829> your<00:02:40.129> country

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
estrogen however you say in your country

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.890 
estrogen however you say in your country
East<00:02:42.379> region<00:02:42.769> you<00:02:43.219> can<00:02:43.430> put<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> tiny<00:02:44.180> tiny<00:02:44.629> bit

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
East region you can put a tiny tiny bit

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.500 
East region you can put a tiny tiny bit
of<00:02:44.989> estrogen<00:02:45.109> and<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.769> fish<00:02:45.950> tank<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.510> then

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
of estrogen and the fish tank and then

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.599 
of estrogen and the fish tank and then
you<00:02:47.959> could<00:02:48.139> put<00:02:48.349> an<00:02:48.439> Eastridge<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.159> pramatta

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
you could put an Eastridge of pramatta

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.809 
you could put an Eastridge of pramatta
gene<00:02:50.019> inserted<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.409> it<00:02:51.560> as<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:52.609> and

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
gene inserted the in it as so and

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.970 
gene inserted the in it as so and
there's<00:02:53.000> estrogen<00:02:53.569> in<00:02:53.689> the<00:02:53.720> water<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.680> fish

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
there's estrogen in the water the fish

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.929 
there's estrogen in the water the fish
will<00:02:55.459> detect<00:02:55.849> it<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:57.769> Easter<00:02:58.730> trip

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
will detect it and the Easter trip

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.909 
will detect it and the Easter trip
promotes<00:02:59.299> will<00:02:59.510> work<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.019> then<00:03:00.620> if<00:03:00.799> you

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
promotes will work and then if you

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.369 
promotes will work and then if you
combine<00:03:01.159> that<00:03:01.489> issues<00:03:02.000> your<00:03:02.150> promoter<00:03:02.510> with<00:03:03.139> a

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
combine that issues your promoter with a

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.879 
combine that issues your promoter with a
fluorescent<00:03:04.040> gene<00:03:04.099> and<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:05.169> the<00:03:06.169> example

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
fluorescent gene and and the example

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.509 
fluorescent gene and and the example
where<00:03:07.159> are<00:03:07.280> always<00:03:07.549> given<00:03:07.909> a<00:03:08.090> GF<00:03:09.489> GFP<00:03:10.489> gene

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
where are always given a GF GFP gene

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.099 
where are always given a GF GFP gene
which<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.150> green<00:03:11.989> fluorescence<00:03:12.889> but<00:03:14.109> green

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
which is green fluorescence but green

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.039 
which is green fluorescence but green
fluorescence<00:03:15.829> protein<00:03:16.209> so<00:03:17.209> if<00:03:17.299> you<00:03:17.419> mix<00:03:17.659> the

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
fluorescence protein so if you mix the

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.680 
fluorescence protein so if you mix the
each<00:03:18.590> strip<00:03:19.069> romancer<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:19.849> a<00:03:20.269> green

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
each strip romancer and a green

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.559 
each strip romancer and a green
fluorescence<00:03:21.379> protein<00:03:21.470> together<00:03:22.449> when<00:03:23.449> there

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
fluorescence protein together when there

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:24.789 
fluorescence protein together when there
is<00:03:23.659> ichigen<00:03:24.139> in<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.349> water

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
is ichigen in the water

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.149 
is ichigen in the water
the<00:03:25.669> Easterner<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.299> promoter<00:03:26.750> works<00:03:27.139> and<00:03:27.500> then

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
the Easterner of promoter works and then

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.629 
the Easterner of promoter works and then
the<00:03:28.280> GFP<00:03:29.060> fluorescence<00:03:30.019> protein<00:03:31.449> responds<00:03:32.449> so

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
the GFP fluorescence protein responds so

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.819 
the GFP fluorescence protein responds so
as<00:03:34.639> long<00:03:35.510> as<00:03:35.750> there's<00:03:35.930> each<00:03:36.199> station<00:03:36.470> in<00:03:36.739> the

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
as long as there's each station in the

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.569 
as long as there's each station in the
water<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:38.359> fish<00:03:38.599> will<00:03:38.780> glob<00:03:39.159> maybe<00:03:40.159> not<00:03:40.340> as

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
water the fish will glob maybe not as

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.330 
water the fish will glob maybe not as
bright<00:03:40.909> as<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.900> gold<00:03:42.260> fish<00:03:42.500> nightlights<00:03:42.769> a

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
bright as the gold fish nightlights a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.080 
bright as the gold fish nightlights a
Sheldon<00:03:43.819> hut<00:03:44.000> but<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.930> facial<00:03:45.139> guar<00:03:45.620> green

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
Sheldon hut but the facial guar green

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.969 
Sheldon hut but the facial guar green
there<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.209> red<00:03:47.510> fluorescence<00:03:48.260> protein<00:03:48.319> and

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:48.979 
there is a red fluorescence protein and

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.399 
there is a red fluorescence protein and
the<00:03:49.069> yellow<00:03:49.340> fluorescence<00:03:49.909> protein<00:03:50.199> but<00:03:51.199> yeah

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
the yellow fluorescence protein but yeah

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.770 
the yellow fluorescence protein but yeah
it's<00:03:51.949> pretty<00:03:52.909> cool<00:03:53.090> having<00:03:53.479> them

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
it's pretty cool having them

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.189 
it's pretty cool having them
after<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.799> lecture<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.459> was<00:03:55.699> like<00:03:55.939> I<00:03:56.419> said<00:03:56.900> that

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:57.199 
after the lecture I was like I said that

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.719 
after the lecture I was like I said that
got<00:03:57.379> off<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.680> said<00:03:57.829> to<00:03:57.949> the<00:03:58.069> lecture<00:03:58.459> because

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:58.729 
got off and said to the lecture because

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:00.280 
got off and said to the lecture because
they<00:03:58.849> all<00:03:58.939> stand<00:03:59.299> at<00:03:59.419> the<00:03:59.510> end<00:03:59.599> and<00:03:59.840> I<00:03:59.930> was<00:04:00.049> like

the tail where the skin is a lot thinner
so<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:33.160> with<00:04:33.310> fish<00:04:33.550> because<00:04:33.880> that<00:04:34.090> skins<00:04:34.480> like

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
so and with fish because that skins like

so and with fish because that skins like
flaky

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
flaky

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.680 
flaky
they<00:04:36.700> flow<00:04:37.120> much<00:04:37.690> much<00:04:37.930> brighter<00:04:38.160> so<00:04:39.570> did<00:04:40.570> you

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
they flow much much brighter so did you

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.970 
they flow much much brighter so did you
understand<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:42.040> was<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.910> was<00:04:43.480> up<00:04:43.830> maybe<00:04:44.830> it

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
understand it was that was up maybe it

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.620 
understand it was that was up maybe it
doesn't<00:04:45.160> sound<00:04:45.490> as<00:04:45.640> fun<00:04:45.670> as<00:04:46.090> this<00:04:46.240> ISIL

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
doesn't sound as fun as this ISIL

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.410 
doesn't sound as fun as this ISIL
implies<00:04:46.990> but<00:04:47.530> if<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.640> look<00:04:48.850> at<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.180> in<00:04:49.330> the

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
implies but if you look at it in the

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.910 
implies but if you look at it in the
fact<00:04:49.660> that<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:49.930> just<00:04:49.960> have<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.440> make<00:04:50.680> this

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
fact that you just have to make this

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.880 
fact that you just have to make this
gene<00:04:51.220> through<00:04:51.850> two<00:04:52.210> things<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.410> issues<00:04:53.740> your

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
gene through two things the issues your

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.690 
gene through two things the issues your
promoter<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.970> GFP<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.220> use<00:04:57.220> electricity

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
promoter and the GFP and use electricity

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.030 
promoter and the GFP and use electricity
to<00:04:58.060> put<00:04:58.390> them<00:04:58.540> in<00:05:00.030> put<00:05:01.030> them<00:05:01.150> into<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.720> egg

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
to put them in put them into the egg

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.380 
to put them in put them into the egg
then<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.130> can<00:05:03.310> make<00:05:03.490> your<00:05:03.520> own<00:05:03.910> glowing

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
then you can make your own glowing

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.720 
then you can make your own glowing
goldfish<00:05:04.860> so<00:05:05.860> that's<00:05:06.040> pretty<00:05:06.250> cool

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
goldfish so that's pretty cool

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.000 
goldfish so that's pretty cool
then<00:05:07.000> let<00:05:07.720> us<00:05:07.750> know<00:05:07.930> what<00:05:08.080> you<00:05:08.170> think<00:05:08.770> oops

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
then let us know what you think oops

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.860 
then let us know what you think oops
isolate<00:05:09.640> videos<00:05:10.000> I'll<00:05:10.420> see<00:05:10.630> you<00:05:10.690> all<00:05:10.840> next

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
isolate videos I'll see you all next

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.200 
isolate videos I'll see you all next
