00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.260
 hello to all dear friends of me 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.460
 name is sergey m kept watching fashion 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.720
 for skyrim andrew and today we kind of 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.580
 100 issue here in general I will say everything in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.070
 late that what at least I say now 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.410
 actually mods themselves first mod it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.449
 daedric who got electric 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.019
 about veloster will mod as well, are not 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.079
 that mod mod is called hellish 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.780
 weapons and armor are actually things very 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.090
 I like the good I will explain it now 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.280
 order why is it totally total 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.640
 Daedric armor improvement 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.340
 and actually yes an hour show for some reason 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.320
 is this an improvement 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.620
 let's first look at ours 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.989
 sprigs so that's blacksmithing 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.149
 and now we have a new one up 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.030
 which after daedric is called 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.469
 hellish armor 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.040
 we also have a heavenly forge now 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.350
 hell is added that is you understand 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.600
 the authors have added their complete set 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.260
 armor and made it so that 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.150
 was balor that is what you need to swing 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.990
 or perfusion what is it actually 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.780
 separate section in the forge so here it is 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.850
 actually figured out as you can see 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.799
 the difference is not very big except 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.630
 they are some darker these 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.630
 look at the weapon 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.860
 then the difference will be palpable anyway 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 no other hellish ones that is like 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.210
 see the difference is palpable anyway there is 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.689
 difference nikita darker and more 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.740
 red at the edges of the pain is still fiery in 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.649
 in general, as you can see 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.869
 armor is good she protect very well 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.479
 I still think but customers are actually for 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.710
 making all this very much and not 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.020
 lungs for example 5 hellish not so heels 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.060
 cream is molded from fire salt 3 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.979
 ebony ore and the heart of the daedra and so 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.500
 every ingot is made right on 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.970
 pan required 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.310
 5 hellish ingots ie imagine 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.590
 imagine yes 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.870
 human heart and the fact that 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.700
 Well, the same weapon only from 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.310
 daedric set required to spend 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.680
 to create hellish then sit down and we 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.420
 cross daedric any hellish 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.210
 bullion human heart then work out 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.910
 hell depending on what it was in 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.710
 actually yes and the Greek set all 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.440
 equal if you look at the difference 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.480
 although the models did not change 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.970
 also here is a cape by the way which i 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.790
 not created for one reason only 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.840
 that so somewhere this is done on 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.480
 proper cats 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.090
 for one reason the reason is that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.910
 it actually requires a robe 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:57.390
 Necromancer I do not get such a life 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:59.489
 know where as well as now as then 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.190
 quite improving for human meat 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.840
 until you were heard for human meat 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.550
 like this and here we have a hellish weapon and 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.470
 armor let's move to the second set 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.420
 clothes we have more modest such for 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.750
 Warra 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.310
 less so thoughtful like this 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.769
 sorry 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.769
 well they and you too 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.720
 that's all more or less 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.760
 simple complete yes I think to many 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.800
 like purely because first 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.470
 it's just making kits 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.590
 already just armor and it looks quite 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.330
 lorna such 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.930
 proper leather armor of the thieves guild 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.850
 with parts of the chain mail itself 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.860
 defend a little grandmother in guild armor 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.060
 thieves yes for me it looks like nothing for 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.450
 thieves who want to look like 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.610
 original well this is actually all edges 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.980
 hens it in leather itself guided 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.560
 regular skin stripes of skin and so on and 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.400
 Pom steel bars still need to for 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:12.990
 bib and on gloves 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.660
 on this and everything in general what I wanted 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.260
 tell everyone thank you so much this one hundredth 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.890
 release 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.250
 100 issue already 100 issue rented it 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.350
 didn't know you like it or not hope that 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.940
 like for sure of course for this some 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.290
 I still have to apply strength 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.360
 its laziness to overcome well and so 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.270
 further it seems as judging by the views on 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.280
 comments you like it well if 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.740

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.560
 Like we will continue to hold out 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.290
 200 issue but I hope that yes we pull 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.060
 apocalypse doesn't seem to be coming 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:52.170
