00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.830 
hey guys
so<00:00:09.210> um<00:00:09.960> some<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.650> guys<00:00:10.740> requested<00:00:10.950> a

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
so um some of you guys requested a

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.200 
so um some of you guys requested a
Jordan<00:00:12.840> collection<00:00:13.590> but<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.280> figured<00:00:15.000> that

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
Jordan collection but I figured that

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.320 
Jordan collection but I figured that
that<00:00:15.240> video<00:00:15.690> would<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:15.960> entirely<00:00:16.619> too<00:00:17.250> long<00:00:17.330> so

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
that video would be entirely too long so

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.279 
that video would be entirely too long so
I<00:00:18.359> just<00:00:18.779> did<00:00:19.109> my<00:00:19.410> toffee<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.810> this<00:00:21.810> like

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
I just did my toffee and this like

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.330 
I just did my toffee and this like
really<00:00:23.420> like<00:00:24.420> took<00:00:25.109> me<00:00:25.410> forever

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
really like took me forever

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.800 
really like took me forever
think<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.760> doing<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> top<00:00:27.359> 20<00:00:27.689> but

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
think of you doing like the top 20 but

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.240 
think of you doing like the top 20 but
that<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.170> defeated<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.680> purpose<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
that just defeated the purpose of the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.400 
that just defeated the purpose of the
video<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:29.670> being<00:00:29.820> extremely<00:00:30.240> long<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.380> I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
video and I'm being extremely long so I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.100 
video and I'm being extremely long so I
