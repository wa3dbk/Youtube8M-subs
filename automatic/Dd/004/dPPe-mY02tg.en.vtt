gamma<00:00:12.870> doesn't<00:00:13.230> take<00:00:13.349> our<00:00:13.500> opportunities

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
gamma doesn't take our opportunities

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.400 
gamma doesn't take our opportunities
that<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.190> need<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:15.269> how<00:00:15.420> tall<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:16.139> know<00:00:16.170> it's

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
that we need and how tall you know it's

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.380 
that we need and how tall you know it's
probably<00:00:16.500> at<00:00:16.740> least<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.160> know<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.970> think

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
probably at least you know I think

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.599 
probably at least you know I think
probably<00:00:18.750> difference<00:00:19.170> between<00:00:19.609> Melbourne

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
probably difference between Melbourne

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.939 
probably difference between Melbourne
and<00:00:20.730> ask<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.180> man<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.810> they<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.350> poor

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
and ask the man is it that they do poor

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.650 
and ask the man is it that they do poor
trigger<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.460> wiser<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.330> execute

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
trigger on it wiser and they execute

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.259 
trigger on it wiser and they execute
them<00:00:24.779> very<00:00:24.960> well<00:00:25.160> Tom's<00:00:26.160> airway<00:00:26.430> particularly

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
them very well Tom's airway particularly

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.820 
them very well Tom's airway particularly
thrilled<00:00:27.630> by<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.779> gang<00:00:28.109> doing<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.650> but

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
thrilled by that gang doing that but

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.690 
thrilled by that gang doing that but
across<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> whole<00:00:29.910> gram<00:00:30.210> you'll<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.570> when

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
across the whole gram you'll be when

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.069 
across the whole gram you'll be when
we're<00:00:32.700> pretty<00:00:32.880> comfortable<00:00:33.059> top<00:00:33.510> timing<00:00:33.960> if

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
we're pretty comfortable top timing if

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.690 
we're pretty comfortable top timing if
you<00:00:34.230> obviously<00:00:34.590> intended<00:00:34.800> telling<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.520> them

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
you obviously intended telling of them

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.970 
you obviously intended telling of them
and<00:00:35.910> come<00:00:36.059> back<00:00:36.410> level<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.500> again<00:00:37.800> did<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
and come back level up again did you

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.580 
and come back level up again did you
think<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> had<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.879> momentum<00:00:39.210> or<00:00:40.200> we<00:00:40.469> have

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
think you had the momentum or we have

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.959 
think you had the momentum or we have
here<00:00:40.770> my<00:00:40.980> man<00:00:41.100> they're<00:00:41.370> all<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.579> think<00:00:41.790> probably

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
here my man they're all I think probably

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.430 
here my man they're all I think probably
why<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> little<00:00:42.629> bit<00:00:42.719> from<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:42.899> we're<00:00:43.200> doing

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
why a little bit from what we're doing

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.049 
why a little bit from what we're doing
and<00:00:43.620> again<00:00:43.920> that's<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.550> group<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and again that's the group and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.819 
and again that's the group and
developing<00:00:45.539> themselves<00:00:45.690> out<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.710> what

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
developing themselves out of it and what

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:47.500 
developing themselves out of it and what
we've<00:00:46.980> been

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
we've been

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.560 
we've been
why<00:00:47.600> do<00:00:47.809> we<00:00:47.929> see<00:00:48.649> myself<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.760> applies<00:00:50.329> we

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
why do we see myself and applies we

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.509 
why do we see myself and applies we
complement<00:00:51.530> each<00:00:51.589> other<00:00:51.800> instructions<00:00:52.399> and

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
complement each other instructions and

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.740 
complement each other instructions and
those<00:00:52.609> sorts<00:00:52.850> things<00:00:52.969> are<00:00:53.149> going<00:00:53.359> on<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.539> server

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
those sorts things are going on a server

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.380 
those sorts things are going on a server
coming<00:00:54.140> after<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:55.129> period<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.489> gun<00:00:55.670> we<00:00:56.239> did

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
coming after that period the gun we did

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.869 
coming after that period the gun we did
very<00:00:56.449> well<00:00:56.829> as<00:00:57.829> a<00:00:57.890> CEO<00:00:58.129> just<00:00:58.460> gotta<00:00:58.640> make<00:00:58.820> sure

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
very well as a CEO just gotta make sure

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.369 
very well as a CEO just gotta make sure
we<00:00:59.089> keep<00:00:59.210> practicing<00:00:59.690> that<00:00:59.930> over<00:01:00.289> the

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
we keep practicing that over the

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.670 
we keep practicing that over the
elements<00:01:01.989> did<00:01:02.989> you<00:01:03.079> feel<00:01:03.229> like<00:01:03.320> you're<00:01:03.440> really

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
elements did you feel like you're really

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.049 
elements did you feel like you're really
on<00:01:03.860> top<00:01:03.890> of<00:01:04.070> them<00:01:04.250> knowing<00:01:04.519> that<00:01:04.610> before<00:01:04.909> half

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
on top of them knowing that before half

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.430 
on top of them knowing that before half
time<00:01:05.089> you've<00:01:05.690> broken<00:01:05.930> them<00:01:06.140> down<00:01:06.170> because

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
time you've broken them down because

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.410 
time you've broken them down because
they<00:01:06.710> were<00:01:06.860> doing<00:01:07.070> things<00:01:07.399> that<00:01:07.460> just<00:01:07.670> thought

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
they were doing things that just thought

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.760 
they were doing things that just thought
would<00:01:08.570> normally<00:01:09.110> do<00:01:09.259> they'll<00:01:09.500> make<00:01:09.649> the

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
would normally do they'll make the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.260 
would normally do they'll make the
mistakes<00:01:10.130> they<00:01:10.280> were<00:01:10.340> turning<00:01:10.700> below<00:01:10.909> did<00:01:11.180> you

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
mistakes they were turning below did you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.969 
mistakes they were turning below did you
feel<00:01:11.420> like<00:01:11.539> you're<00:01:11.659> real<00:01:11.810> on<00:01:11.930> top<00:01:12.110> yeah<00:01:12.770> we

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
feel like you're real on top yeah we

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.050 
feel like you're real on top yeah we
were<00:01:13.039> applying<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.399> bit<00:01:13.549> pressure<00:01:13.759> there<00:01:13.970> in

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
were applying a bit pressure there in

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.249 
were applying a bit pressure there in
here<00:01:14.210> they<00:01:14.330> were<00:01:14.450> making<00:01:14.690> respect<00:01:15.110> with
