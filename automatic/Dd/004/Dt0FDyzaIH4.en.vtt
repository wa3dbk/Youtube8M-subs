nothing but good things to say about the

nothing but good things to say about the

traditional ACL repair for Thursday of
the<00:01:43.799> week<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.310> came<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> U<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.850> M<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:46.140> got

the week that we came to U of M and got
the<00:01:46.560> second<00:01:46.890> opinion<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.450> were

the second opinion and I think we were

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.560 
the second opinion and I think we were
headed<00:01:48.899> down<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.439> course<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:50.369> similar<00:01:51.299> to

the two episodes that had previously
failed<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:54.840> goes<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.409> say<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> more

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
failed it goes to say that a more

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.569 
failed it goes to say that a more

stabilizers<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.220> may<00:02:11.430> need<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.760> be

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
stabilizers that may need to be

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.110 
stabilizers that may need to be
addressed<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.599> addition<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.500> ACL<00:02:14.000> here<00:02:15.000> at

addressed in addition to the ACL here at

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.580 
addressed in addition to the ACL here at
the<00:02:15.180> University<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.720> Michigan<00:02:16.140> instead<00:02:16.500> of

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
the University of Michigan instead of

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.580 
the University of Michigan instead of
just<00:02:16.800> repairing<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:18.060> ACL<00:02:18.630> they<00:02:19.110> realized

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
just repairing the ACL they realized

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.050 
just repairing the ACL they realized
that<00:02:19.739> my<00:02:19.860> leg<00:02:20.040> was<00:02:20.069> bow-legged

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
that my leg was bow-legged

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.640 
that my leg was bow-legged
and<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.599> figured<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:21.959> might<00:02:22.319> have<00:02:22.440> been<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
and I figured that might have been a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.030 
and I figured that might have been a
cause<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.459> why<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.640> kept<00:02:23.910> tearing<00:02:24.269> so<00:02:25.080> they<00:02:25.380> did

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
cause and why I kept tearing so they did

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.479 
cause and why I kept tearing so they did
a<00:02:26.069> tibial<00:02:26.700> osteotomy<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:28.370> straightened<00:02:29.370> that

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
a tibial osteotomy and straightened that

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.410 
a tibial osteotomy and straightened that
leg<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.739> they<00:02:31.739> think<00:02:32.069> that's<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:32.430> will<00:02:32.760> keep

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
leg and they think that's what will keep

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.930 
leg and they think that's what will keep
it<00:02:33.569> from<00:02:33.720> tearing<00:02:34.110> again<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.650> had<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.670> first

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
it from tearing again I had the first

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.580 
it from tearing again I had the first
part<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.299> surgery<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.720> repair<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.230> six

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
part of the surgery to repair it six

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.620 
part of the surgery to repair it six
months<00:02:37.860> ago<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.370> second<00:02:38.730> part<00:02:38.970> one<00:02:39.239> month<00:02:39.450> ago

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
months ago the second part one month ago

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.920 
months ago the second part one month ago
and<00:02:39.989> no<00:02:40.920> real<00:02:41.160> pain<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.390> know<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.690> TV

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
and no real pain and I know the TV

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.509 
and no real pain and I know the TV
osteotomy<00:02:43.560> work<00:02:43.769> because<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.160> felt<00:02:44.370> more

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
osteotomy work because it felt more

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.020 
osteotomy work because it felt more
stable<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.500> think<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.980> when<00:02:47.549> someone<00:02:47.849> is

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
stable I think that when someone is

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.120 
stable I think that when someone is
trying<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.360> choose<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:49.080> place<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.590> take<00:02:49.799> care<00:02:50.010> of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
trying to choose a place to take care of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.339 
trying to choose a place to take care of
their<00:02:50.220> ACL<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:50.819> their<00:02:50.940> injury<00:02:51.390> they<00:02:52.140> should

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
their ACL on their injury they should

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.650 
their ACL on their injury they should
make<00:02:52.530> sure<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.099> place<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.610> well<00:02:54.330> versed

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
make sure that the place is well versed

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.259 
make sure that the place is well versed
to<00:02:54.870> take<00:02:55.049> care<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.260> all<00:02:55.530> problems<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:57.090> they

to take care of all problems that they

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.150 
to take care of all problems that they
may<00:02:57.420> encounter<00:02:57.510> because<00:02:58.380> in<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.769> end<00:02:58.890> while

into<00:03:15.660> getting<00:03:15.930> an<00:03:16.140> opinion<00:03:16.500> from<00:03:16.650> someone<00:03:16.950> who

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
into getting an opinion from someone who

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.539 
into getting an opinion from someone who

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
joint situations like dr. sue Kia just

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.400 
joint situations like dr. sue Kia just
the<00:03:23.670> peace<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.389> mind<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.049> receive

from getting that second opinion to me

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.270 
from getting that second opinion to me
is<00:03:27.389> worth<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:28.079> one<00:03:28.410> day<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.799> you'd<00:03:28.920> invest

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
is worth the one day that you'd invest

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.030 
is worth the one day that you'd invest
into<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:29.760> I'm<00:03:30.269> hoping<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.739> last
