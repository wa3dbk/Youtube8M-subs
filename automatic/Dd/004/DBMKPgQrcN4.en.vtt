through from he did not mark the bird if

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.590 
through from he did not mark the bird if
you<00:01:27.930> stay<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.470> long<00:01:28.770> enough<00:01:29.130> he<00:01:30.090> will<00:01:30.240> find

you stay out long enough he will find

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.830 
you stay out long enough he will find
the<00:01:30.689> bird<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.110> he<00:01:31.200> hasn't<00:01:31.439> marked<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.579> bird

I<00:02:11.700> want<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.840> teach<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.260> dog<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.800> there's<00:02:14.069> a

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
I want to teach a dog that there's a

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.750 
I want to teach a dog that there's a
specific<00:02:15.170> area<00:02:16.170> where<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.890> bird<00:02:17.160> fell<00:02:17.459> and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
specific area where that bird fell and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.980 
specific area where that bird fell and
that's<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.140> big<00:02:19.410> values<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.810> Y

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
that's one of the big values of the Y

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.020 
that's one of the big values of the Y
drill<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:22.709> gonna<00:02:22.830> elaborate<00:02:23.730> on<00:02:23.880> this

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
drill and I'm gonna elaborate on this

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.580 
drill and I'm gonna elaborate on this
that<00:02:24.390> whole<00:02:24.630> topic<00:02:25.670> later<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:28.260> me<00:02:28.410> that's

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
that whole topic later but to me that's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.670 
that whole topic later but to me that's
the<00:02:28.830> most<00:02:28.860> valuable<00:02:29.610> aspect<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.230> Y<00:02:31.380> drill

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the most valuable aspect of the Y drill

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.740 
the most valuable aspect of the Y drill
you<00:02:31.830> have<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.750> gunner<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.100> multiple<00:02:35.100> throws

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
you have a gunner and multiple throws

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.840 
you have a gunner and multiple throws
one<00:02:36.750> more<00:02:36.930> point<00:02:37.230> about<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.680> Y<00:02:37.830> drill<00:02:38.130> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
one more point about the Y drill the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.130 
one more point about the Y drill the
configuration<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:39.989> angle<00:02:40.650> back<00:02:40.830> angle<00:02:41.340> in

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
configuration is angle back angle in

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.350 
configuration is angle back angle in
flat<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:44.070> resembles<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.540> letter<00:02:45.780> Y<00:02:47.360> but

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
flat it resembles the letter Y but

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.390 
flat it resembles the letter Y but
that's<00:02:49.290> only<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:50.010> beginning<00:02:50.760> point<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:53.190> could

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
that's only a beginning point you could

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.810 
that's only a beginning point you could
throw<00:02:54.140> in<00:02:55.140> an<00:02:55.410> advanced<00:02:55.980> version<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:56.760> you

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
throw in an advanced version just so you

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.310 
throw in an advanced version just so you
have<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.269> idea<00:02:58.940> five<00:02:59.940> Birds<00:03:00.360> all<00:03:00.690> on<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
have this idea five Birds all on the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.930 
have this idea five Birds all on the
same<00:03:01.560> side<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.130> gun<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.459> when<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.700> have<00:03:02.910> a

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
same side of the gun and when you have a

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.509 
same side of the gun and when you have a
really<00:03:03.450> good<00:03:03.660> marker<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.320> can<00:03:04.590> pick<00:03:05.340> out

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
really good marker that can pick out

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.600 
really good marker that can pick out
these<00:03:05.760> spots<00:03:06.269> where<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.690> bird<00:03:07.500> falls<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:08.580> can

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
these spots where a bird falls you can

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.860 
these spots where a bird falls you can
throw<00:03:09.000> an<00:03:09.150> angle<00:03:09.510> in<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:10.910> flat<00:03:11.910> an<00:03:12.239> angle<00:03:12.660> back<00:03:12.840> a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
throw an angle in a flat an angle back a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.170 
throw an angle in a flat an angle back a
severe<00:03:13.440> angle<00:03:13.620> back<00:03:13.920> all<00:03:14.160> on<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.610> same<00:03:14.820> side

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
severe angle back all on the same side

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.449 
severe angle back all on the same side
of<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.510> gunner<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:16.200> really<00:03:16.709> fine<00:03:16.980> marker

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
of the gunner and a really fine marker

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.270 
of the gunner and a really fine marker
is<00:03:17.519> gonna<00:03:17.670> pick<00:03:17.940> all<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.209> those<00:03:18.480> birds<00:03:18.810> out<00:03:19.280> you

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
is gonna pick all of those birds out you

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.060 
is gonna pick all of those birds out you
can<00:03:20.459> throw<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.700> progression<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.630> short<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.500> longer

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
that can really mark will pick out all

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.530 
that can really mark will pick out all
of<00:03:27.329> those<00:03:27.600> spots<00:03:27.959> that's<00:03:28.709> what<00:03:29.269> that's<00:03:30.269> what<00:03:30.510> I

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
of those spots that's what that's what I

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.960 
of those spots that's what that's what I
want<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.930> try<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.170> do<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.620> it's<00:03:32.519> certainly

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
want to try to do and it's certainly

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.920 
want to try to do and it's certainly
possible<00:03:33.299> if<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.380> practice
