00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:20.029
 Yes everyone is Hello curve this time was increased cut Terui further lineup 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:27.220
 If you look at this , would it increase 3.5 45 things to 3 / 46.57.750 or something? 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:28.550
 That's right what standing 75 7.75 of this half-hearted figure has changed to lineup 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.690
 Shazam 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.070
 Me 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:40.630
 This is a reason why 6.51 this is why Nanako 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.750
 There is only volume there in orange length 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.440
 so 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.790
 I think this 6 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.790
 Leave the point as it is 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:01:01.670
 I'm not up to 7.75 and I have a feeling that I did not know it. 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:08.640
 What is the thickness of d 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:11.990
 Warini was 6.55 7.75 is I think the kana not it a nice little shake 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.310
 Not too thick than 11 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:20.840
 If to 7 hand and with a book than demand area Daimon is Bodiga 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 So 6.5, for example, more than ever before is also 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:30.510
 Day Kedomo is I feel it 's the bottom bar of the bait and then mist water system of school 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.690
 Or that when the further cloudy 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.180
 a 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:41.290
 Big the better to use it when you say you want aim is more effective 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.290
 I think that there are many before , especially 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.570
 When I went to this cat rig 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:52.630
 In got a thickness of the body 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:55.270
 It's just getting thicker and it's hard to cut 3 pieces 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 Effective appeal 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.650
 I'm looking forward to seeing if it will come out 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:08.860
 Pretty pretty room- 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:14.620
 I'm looking for a super skill in this area and skipping day or something like that 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:19.480
 I'll put out a bad idea right away, but I think it's usable. 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.510
 Minute which became thicker ok Well, the body has become harder in 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.880
 It is this deflection for a minute 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.480
 This now 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.400
 Sorry for taking from 10 inches 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.959
 If there is to spin that Thats to Nyanto Here 'will shoot Junichi This is do good in this 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.540
 For example, such a use I Toka going to and is not while no new card Funyanfunyan 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.180
 Although this is it's good at this because it is 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:50.000
 But still this when you this but it is a cat 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:56.989
 I want you to be blessed in such a way that there was some tension 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.130
 This name is because 75 is completely Kokkara destination can it change 6.5 things like that 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.460
 Not at all, but it's all right 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.750
 Thick it because it has become quite thick 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.590
 bar overall balance 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.440
 If you go wrong you will get 6 points 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:18.670
 I wish I think we better 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:21.680
 So man the venture etc. but four inches is what classic good in the cut body or 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.730
 I do not feel scaled up 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.950
 Part of the potential of 4 inches, such as hardness 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.670
 To say that it is a wave 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.290
 I feel like I can get it out by thickening the body 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:41.890
 This has a feeling it 's such are rising value 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.670
 If you can use it in various places Nedon and one shot here 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.920
 Also great Secretary 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.410
 I'm wondering if you're wondering why everyone 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.940
 We try using while expecting 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.240
