00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.610
 the girls welcome on this occasion 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.050
 I am in the kitchen as you can see 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.430
 the apron on because I love them 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.440
 show how I do one of the 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.869
 favorite homemade deep treatments 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.600
 for me it is a treatment that to me 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.390
 I love it because it leaves my hair very 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.520
 pretty defines me a lot more the curl 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.849
 I feel that it is more nourished more 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.010
 manageable brighter and I want 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.620
 share it with you because I know that 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.210
 many of you have asked me and I 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.579
 have asked me to make videos about 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.400
 deep treatments and about 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.580
 castell treatments 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.260
 This above all is very easy to do 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.350
 because we usually have the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.540
 ingredients in our little house so 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 I will show you below how 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.739
 I do and now we see each other 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.980
 to elaborate this deep treatment 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.370
 you're going to need half ripe avocado 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.720
 half ripe banana a quarter of milk 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.860
 of coconut 4 tablespoons of honey and 4 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.320
 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.930
 now we are going to remove the avocado 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.780
 of the shell we are going to take advantage of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.780
 maximum we can without wasting anything 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.550
 now we proceed to crush it very well 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:30.730
 with the fork do type type pasta 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.410
 puree that is well well well crushed 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.550
 to make it easier in this way 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.550
 work with he 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.299
 now we will proceed to do the same 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.429
 with the video we are going to crush him from the same 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.429
 way and let's do with it 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.230
 once we have the avocado and the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.450
 video made by him let's mix them 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.549
 each other to thus make a 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.549
 mix totally 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.030
 now we proceed to throw the 4 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.030
 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.319
 now we throw the 4 tablespoons of 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.810
 and now let's take a quarter of milk 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.849
 coconut 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.580
 remember that coconut milk can you 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.069
 make the yourself can be canned or 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.800
 any natural coconut milk that 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.310
 get now let's mix all the 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.260
 ingredients together let's mixing 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.920
 the best possible way for us to 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.220
 It is a very good pasta 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.220
 made 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.880
 Now comes the step that for me is the 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.560
 more important because in that way we 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:42.220
 facilitates the application and facilitates us 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.460
 remove the mask or treatment 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.930
 once we have applied it we will 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.500
 catch an average 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.739
 It can be a piece of a flannel 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.959
 a shirt that is very finite for 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.969
 that way is this treatment and 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.900
 that in that way its easier 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:07.900
 application and especially easier 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.900
 remove it 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.950
 if you skip this step, you may 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.919
 time to remove it 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.799
 very difficult and it costs you a lot 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.530
 a lot to remove all that pulp left 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.620
 as you see here all that pulp as not the 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.540
 da cuelas stays in your hair this 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.129
 way is easier to apply and we 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.680
 there is a creampie 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:35.020
 of a good consistency 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.419
 good girls, they have already seen how 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.160
 I do this deep treatment is very 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.979
 Well I recommend it a lot because 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.490
 to me personally I have an area a 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:48.190
 little you deserved was and this area is here 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.919
 in front sometimes we laugh like the 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.990
 Hair rest is a little more rebellious 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.080
 the curl is not defined much and every time 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.410
 that applied that this deep treatment 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.199
 specifically I notice how laughing how it 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.180
 define and I love that the hair after 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.840
 apply this treatment does not stay 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.780
 with frizz 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.910

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.039
