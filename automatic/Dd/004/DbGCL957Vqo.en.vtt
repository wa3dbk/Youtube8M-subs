so you see when you have those

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.560 
so you see when you have those

right-hand notes that actually enhances

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.180

you

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.140 

but<00:01:55.860> everything<00:01:56.100> starts<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:56.730> that<00:01:56.910> left

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
but everything starts with that left

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.090 
but everything starts with that left
hand<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.200> might<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.470> thinking<00:01:58.650> if<00:01:58.950> you're

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
hand and you might be thinking if you're

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.530 
hand and you might be thinking if you're
not<00:01:59.250> left-handed<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.120> it<00:02:00.240> might<00:02:00.390> be

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
not left-handed that it might be

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.120 
not left-handed that it might be
difficult<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.110> learn<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:01.410> left<00:02:01.620> hand<00:02:01.860> but<00:02:02.010> it

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
difficult to learn the left hand but it

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.370 
difficult to learn the left hand but it
really<00:02:02.340> isn't<00:02:02.670> all<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.720> really<00:02:03.840> need<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.110> do

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
really isn't all you really need to do

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.860 
really isn't all you really need to do
is<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.950> take<00:02:05.100> everything<00:02:05.430> slowly<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.300> have<00:02:06.690> an

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870
