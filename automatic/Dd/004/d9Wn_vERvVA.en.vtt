00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.750
 Hello 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.630
 Now he tells us in his diary about life 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.380
 what the area had 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.220
 when they arrived 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.480
 Y 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.480
 Nazi police at the time 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.090
 longer they have to go live though 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.520
 ah 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.770
 will be shared with those who send 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.430
 are a two - parent families and 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.430
 son peter 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.140
 Mr. Bowl 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.760
 Mr. Toxo 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.830
 but good also 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.060
 adolescence 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.890
 and good being a teenager 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.890
 not only also of love 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.570
 of the relationship with his family what 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.479
 never 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.670
 I think it's because she always 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.720
 she feels alone and that if she gives an image 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.760
 maternal and that is not the same 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.690
 good to start with my opinion them 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.760
 I want to recommend 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.270
 veteran frank who is from terramar 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.290
 editions that I loved is the study 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.520
 preliminary 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.520
 who tells us who wrote it 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.910
 the analysis that makes 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.410
 because he has asked me how much desire 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.410
 there may be right now in this 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.340
 your kid 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.550
 first because to nothing 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.920
 I could not create 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.209
 but 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.930
 because it is an area 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.130
 brain 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.440
 and even more serious 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.180
 because they say he can 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.850
 when he talks about his dreams 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.650
 singing because speech 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.620
 He also talks about the restrictions that 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.590
 they had the concentration Jews and we 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.210
 talks about everything they are in those 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.020
 times of all 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.020
 to the Jews 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.610
 and the whole thing once 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.440
 last letters he writes 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.620
 44 a lot I think it's one of the most 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.940
 important because they are common 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.940
 of your growth inside 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.920
 love relationship 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.150
 there is no doubt if it was like 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.730
 unconsciously I wanted it 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.730
 Y 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.730
 but 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.130
 as well 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.210
 because I like 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.230
 of sounds that survive 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.000
 sure not 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.810
 serious things sometimes do not 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.300
 listen to the radio 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.300
 an ink 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.650
 Y 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.220
 but no 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.220
 it's history I want them nothing 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:18.939
 connected 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.150
 Carlos, I think there are others 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.360
 but they leave you 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.200
 I recommend 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.580
 and I think he liked it 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:50.310
