00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.420
 x 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.360
 hello girls how are you today 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.490
 I bring 3d in addition to different flowers 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.290
 these can be done to your girls or 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.939
 If you like if you load a 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.349
 little flower and those good things are 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.600
 you can do it for yourself 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.430
 as well 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.260
 just like I showed them but I 'm going to 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.810
 show three options because they are three 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.540
 three different ways to find in 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.960
 the flower packets them with 32 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.150
 pretty so imbued few flowers 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.680
 so I cut a strip more or less 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.620
 first let's measure the size of 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.809
 our head and then we're going to go to 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.200
 paste with a little bit of silicon 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.200
 paste 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.010
 nothing else that part then let's take out 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.620
 all the flowers on the side of the twigs 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.449
 that I showed them at the beginning we were going to go 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.860
 but we are going to paste them well 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.200
 so they will not be stockings 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.430
 pointy from behind and they're going to 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.400
 hurt the forehead or head 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.800
 let's see how they fit well 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.330
 these are not going to be flower flowers 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.150
 around everything in the whole head 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.150
 it 's only at the front 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.930
 good guys so on we are going to 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.120
 go sticking flowers and some twigs 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.970
 so that it will not be half hair 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.980
 appealed the headband let's put a little 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.980
 of flowers and leaves 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.980
 ah 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.460
 good and more or less it would be like this already 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.590
 you want to add something else 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.830
 it depends on each one depends on the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.660
 likes and well I do not know but I did it like that 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.660
 a little simpler and not so loaded 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.950
 more or less that's how he's wearing 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.310
 well let's go with the second option 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.590
 this second option I found these 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.700
 two but what was half 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.100
 amarillito is like those wires milestones 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.350
 but those that play the little children that 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.900
 They give in school I think and it is manageable 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.930
 because this is lined with a 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.160
 very soft material and good I wanted to do it 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.260
 in this way so that more or less 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.180
 good is much easier to make them 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.490
 because since the closure is more 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.860
 accessible more manageable then it's going to 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.350
 much easier to make good I 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.980
 I did in this way to be able to create what 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.260
 that is a crown that is super easy 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.840
 of doing simply I wanted to do 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.880
 show them how I do it because good 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.800
 I liked this apart that there are girls who 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.860
 Well, they like to use these things 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.500
 in the head too so well then 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.380
 after the last two I cut them because 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.470
 I was not enough for around the head 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.180
 because good is up one I think and 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.170
 well the other two flowers I stuck 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.170
 then around 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.830
 Y 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.209
 and so you want to put more flowers 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.770
 it's up to you these will be two more shades 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.290
 or less interfere more or less 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.990
 colors and well that's how it would look like 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.060
 it's there if you want it loose and the 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.390
 back threads tie it down just loose no 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.750
 it depends on you because maybe 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.270
 you want to get more with volume 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.280
 level I think I did not want to tie 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.600
 totally so good so more or less 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.540
 it should be 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.880
 now we go with the third option that is 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.239
 much easier than both of us are going to 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.840
 take two flowers these has been of branch and 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.670
 a good elastic can be white or 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.390
 black you want but I chose 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.100
 black let's take out all the little flowers 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.880
 and we're going to cut the size elastic 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.880
 from our head 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.909
 now let's cut that part of 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.620
 back so it will not get bulky 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.409
 and it's not going to be ugly now that you 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.479
 you're going to put and we're going to hit 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.759
 very careful you're going to cut well 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.319
 well alright well so you can stick 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.319
 in this thin band-aid 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.710
 Y 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.710
 and 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.259
 and 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.880
 good as you can see it 's super easy 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.310
 to do I hope you like it and do it 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.750
 for your children or for yourselves well 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.430
 what a good girl this is an idea nothing 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.500
 more I hope you like it we'll see you 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.800
 the next tutorial bye bye thank you for 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.800

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.030
