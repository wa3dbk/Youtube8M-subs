want to make sure that it's not getting
to<00:03:07.240> a<00:03:07.270> boiling<00:03:07.690> point<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.950> want<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.190> slowly

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
to a boiling point you want to slowly

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.940 
to a boiling point you want to slowly
heat<00:03:09.880> this<00:03:10.090> oil<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:10.540> everything<00:03:11.440> infuses

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
heat this oil so everything infuses

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.980 
heat this oil so everything infuses
together<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.980> after<00:03:15.250> 30<00:03:15.970> minutes<00:03:16.360> there<00:03:16.780> you
