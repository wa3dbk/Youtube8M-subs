sampling to mobile drilling so we'll

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.510 
sampling to mobile drilling so we'll
have<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.820> client<00:00:35.820> that's<00:00:35.969> has<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:37.250> claim<00:00:38.250> block

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
have a client that's has a claim block

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.580 
have a client that's has a claim block
that<00:00:38.940> they've<00:00:39.120> staked<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.870> they'll<00:00:40.469> be

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
that they've staked that they'll be

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.369 
that they've staked that they'll be
interested<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.600> mineral<00:00:42.899> potential

interested in in the mineral potential

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.619 
interested in in the mineral potential
there<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.399> often<00:00:44.730> our<00:00:44.820> first<00:00:45.090> step<00:00:45.360> there

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
there and so often our first step there

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.080 
there and so often our first step there
is<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.800> drone<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.309> fly<00:00:48.030> in

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
is going in with the drone and fly in

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.990 
is going in with the drone and fly in
that<00:00:48.300> area<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> creating<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:50.000> elevation

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
that area and creating that elevation

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.569 
that area and creating that elevation
model<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.570> an<00:00:51.660> ortho<00:00:51.930> mosaic

high-resolution<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.110> show

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
high-resolution that we can then show

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.560 
high-resolution that we can then show
the<00:00:55.649> client<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.879> area<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.390> you'll

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the client this is the area that you'll

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
the client this is the area that you'll
be<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.199> you're<00:00:58.350> interested<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.160> that

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
be that you're interested in and that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.240 
be that you're interested in and that
we're<00:00:59.520> potentially<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> go<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
we're potentially going to go in and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.880 
we're potentially going to go in and
explore<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:03.270> then<00:01:03.390> from<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.320> manual

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
explore and then from there we do manual

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.410 
explore and then from there we do manual
soil<00:01:05.129> sampling<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.390> hand<00:01:06.930> auger<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:09.240> a

soil sampling with the hand auger and a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.230 
soil sampling with the hand auger and a
soil<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.780> crew<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.970> show<00:01:11.970> sort

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
soil and crew that is going to show sort

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.270 
soil and crew that is going to show sort
of<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.630> broad<00:01:12.869> idea<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> mineral

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
of just a broad idea of what the mineral

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.990 
of just a broad idea of what the mineral
content<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.060> soil<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:16.820> usually<00:01:17.820> working

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
content of that soil is usually working

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.060 
content of that soil is usually working
on<00:01:18.210> ridge<00:01:18.420> tops<00:01:19.490> areas<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.670> haven't<00:01:21.030> been

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
on ridge tops areas that haven't been

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
on ridge tops areas that haven't been
historically<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> Yukon<00:01:23.750> places<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
historically in the Yukon places that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.010 
historically in the Yukon places that
gold<00:01:25.110> has<00:01:25.890> been<00:01:26.070> found<00:01:26.280> Yukon<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.810> Gold

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
gold has been found Yukon the the Gold

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.600 
gold has been found Yukon the the Gold
Rush<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.530> Klondike<00:01:28.950> has<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:29.310> been<00:01:29.549> about

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
Rush and the Klondike has all been about

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.660 
Rush and the Klondike has all been about
placer<00:01:30.240> mining<00:01:30.509> mining<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> creeks<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
placer mining mining the creeks and the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.380 
placer mining mining the creeks and the
riverbeds<00:01:33.950> but<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.250> idea<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.670> all<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
riverbeds but the idea is that all the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.240 
riverbeds but the idea is that all the
gold<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.659> has<00:01:36.869> been<00:01:37.020> found<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.500> those<00:01:37.950> creeks

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
gold that has been found in those creeks

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.890 
gold that has been found in those creeks
and<00:01:38.400> river<00:01:38.549> beds<00:01:38.790> must<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.540> come<00:01:39.659> from<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
and river beds must have come from the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.200 
and river beds must have come from the
mountains<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.950> lot<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.640> people<00:01:41.880> still<00:01:42.030> think

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
mountains so a lot of people still think

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.450 
mountains so a lot of people still think
that<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.570> payload<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.229> still<00:01:44.130> up<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.340> those

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that the payload is still up in those

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.499 
that the payload is still up in those
mountains<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.970> that's<00:01:45.149> what<00:01:45.360> we've<00:01:45.479> been

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
mountains so that's what we've been

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.679 
mountains so that's what we've been
working<00:01:46.200> towards<00:01:47.540> exploring

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
working towards exploring

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.690 
working towards exploring
so<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> first<00:01:49.680> step<00:01:49.860> there<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.490> soil

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
so the first step there is the soil

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.940 
so the first step there is the soil
sampling<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.450> then<00:01:51.720> gets<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.380> soils<00:01:52.710> sent

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
sampling that then gets the soils sent

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.649 
sampling that then gets the soils sent
off<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.340> lab<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> good<00:01:54.270> mineral

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
off to the lab we get a good mineral

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.209 
off to the lab we get a good mineral
profile<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.380> now<00:01:56.340> are<00:01:56.579> able<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:58.130> take<00:01:59.130> an

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
profile and now are able to take an

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.719 
profile and now are able to take an
overlooked<00:01:59.579> overview<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.689> area<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.200> see

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
overlooked overview of that area and see

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.179 
overlooked overview of that area and see
exactly<00:02:02.729> how<00:02:03.479> many<00:02:03.540> parts<00:02:03.930> per<00:02:04.110> million<00:02:04.350> in

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
exactly how many parts per million in

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.580 
exactly how many parts per million in
those<00:02:05.520> soil<00:02:05.820> samples<00:02:06.240> are<00:02:06.479> gold<00:02:06.780> or<00:02:07.140> any

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
those soil samples are gold or any

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.790 
those soil samples are gold or any
mineral<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.129> shows<00:02:08.550> up<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:10.259> now<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.470> have

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
mineral that shows up so now we have

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.990 
mineral that shows up so now we have
along<00:02:11.459> with<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> drone<00:02:11.910> imagery

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
along with the drone imagery

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.930 
along with the drone imagery
able<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.030> see<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.450> exactly<00:02:16.320> where<00:02:16.530> these

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
able to see you exactly where these

kilometer squared with that that one

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.810 
kilometer squared with that that one
unit<00:05:21.320> and<00:05:22.320> then<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.770> workflow<00:05:23.250> is<00:05:23.370> so<00:05:23.550> quick

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
results from that within a week easily

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.710 
results from that within a week easily
so<00:05:30.630> that's<00:05:30.810> been<00:05:30.990> huge<00:05:31.200> for<00:05:32.240> for<00:05:33.240> us<00:05:33.390> in<00:05:33.570> that
