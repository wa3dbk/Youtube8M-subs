going to do now is I will show you how

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.820 
going to do now is I will show you how
it<00:01:02.629> sounds<00:01:02.659> when<00:01:03.350> it's<00:01:03.500> running

it sounds when it's running

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
it sounds when it's running
we'll<00:01:04.339> put<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.580> top<00:01:04.729> back<00:01:04.790> on<00:01:06.969> it<00:01:07.969> already<00:01:09.850> but

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
we'll put the top back on it already but

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.730 
we'll put the top back on it already but
actually<00:01:11.180> my<00:01:11.390> mistake<00:01:11.539> turn<00:01:12.289> the<00:01:12.380> switch<00:01:12.590> on

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
actually my mistake turn the switch on

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:36.590 
actually my mistake turn the switch on
first<00:01:14.079> manual

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.910 

that's<00:01:37.600> how<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:37.869> sounds<00:01:38.320> only<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.710> tell<00:01:38.890> you

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
that's how it sounds only to tell you

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.999 
that's how it sounds only to tell you
more<00:01:39.130> than<00:01:39.280> 60<00:01:39.729> 70<00:01:40.359> decibels<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:41.259> most<00:01:41.619> louder

the transfer switch inside is calling
for<00:02:06.459> and<00:02:06.579> we'll<00:02:06.670> look<00:02:06.819> at<00:02:06.970> that<00:02:07.000> in<00:02:07.239> a<00:02:07.299> minute

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
for and we'll look at that in a minute

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.660 
for and we'll look at that in a minute
and<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:09.489> have<00:02:09.670> your<00:02:09.819> basic<00:02:11.430> circuit<00:02:12.430> breaker

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
and you have your basic circuit breaker

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.699 
and you have your basic circuit breaker
protection<00:02:13.599> and<00:02:13.930> then<00:02:16.049> and<00:02:17.049> then<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.380> here<00:02:17.590> it

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
protection and then and then in here it

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.170 
protection and then and then in here it
would<00:02:17.799> be<00:02:17.980> your<00:02:18.280> wire<00:02:19.239> going<00:02:19.569> back<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:22.060> the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
would be your wire going back to the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.910 
would be your wire going back to the
panel<00:02:22.660> which<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.470> wire<00:02:23.650> that

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
panel which this is the wire that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.390 
panel which this is the wire that
supplies<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:26.110> power<00:02:26.140> when<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.799> electricity

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
supplies the power when the electricity

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.089 
supplies the power when the electricity
goes<00:02:27.549> out<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.269> you<00:02:28.390> have<00:02:28.569> your<00:02:28.890> signal<00:02:29.890> wires

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
goes out and you have your signal wires

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.390 
goes out and you have your signal wires
to<00:02:30.459> say<00:02:31.079> to<00:02:32.079> tell<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.470> when<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.650> come<00:02:32.920> on<00:02:33.040> and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
to say to tell it when to come on and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.530 
to say to tell it when to come on and
turn<00:02:33.579> off<00:02:34.110> it's<00:02:35.110> pretty<00:02:35.379> much<00:02:35.470> automatic<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
turn off it's pretty much automatic the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.090 
turn off it's pretty much automatic the
transfer<00:02:37.989> switch<00:02:38.230> we<00:02:38.470> could<00:02:38.650> say<00:02:38.769> we'll<00:02:38.920> talk

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
transfer switch we could say we'll talk

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.370 
transfer switch we could say we'll talk
about<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.519> minute<00:02:39.819> since<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.989> when<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.230> power

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
about the minute since is when the power

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.729 
about the minute since is when the power
goes<00:02:41.709> out<00:02:41.889> gives<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.880> five<00:02:43.060> seconds<00:02:43.569> and<00:02:43.810> then

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
goes out gives it five seconds and then

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.099 
goes out gives it five seconds and then
the<00:02:45.400> generator<00:02:45.850> will<00:02:46.060> start<00:02:46.329> will<00:02:46.600> run<00:02:46.840> for<00:02:47.079> a

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
the generator will start will run for a

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.400 
the generator will start will run for a
couple<00:02:47.410> seconds<00:02:47.799> get<00:02:47.980> up<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.190> speed<00:02:49.410> generate

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
couple seconds get up to speed generate

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.960 
couple seconds get up to speed generate
electricity<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.190> then<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.370> transfer<00:02:51.760> switch

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
electricity and then the transfer switch

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.509 
electricity and then the transfer switch
will<00:02:52.150> turn<00:02:52.180> over<00:02:52.359> and<00:02:53.290> transfer<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.889> power<00:02:54.100> to

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
will turn over and transfer the power to

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.440 
will turn over and transfer the power to
those<00:02:54.670> circuits<00:02:56.519> what<00:02:57.519> we<00:02:57.609> have<00:02:57.760> here<00:02:57.970> inside

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
those circuits what we have here inside

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.870 
those circuits what we have here inside
is<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.530> actual<00:02:59.829> transfer<00:03:00.280> switch<00:03:00.489> it's<00:03:00.670> kind

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
is the actual transfer switch it's kind

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.050 
is the actual transfer switch it's kind
of<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.000> brains<00:03:01.299> of<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.569> operation<00:03:03.060> this

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
of the brains of the operation this

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.789 
of the brains of the operation this
sense<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:05.280> if<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.489> power<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.389> the<00:03:07.510> main<00:03:07.799> house

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
sense is if the power and the main house

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.099 
sense is if the power and the main house
panel<00:03:09.280> goes<00:03:09.459> out<00:03:09.670> if<00:03:10.420> there's<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.690> loss<00:03:10.870> of

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
panel goes out if there's a loss of

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.009 
panel goes out if there's a loss of
power<00:03:11.440> based<00:03:12.310> on<00:03:12.609> this<00:03:13.329> circuit<00:03:13.780> here<00:03:13.900> right

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
power based on this circuit here right

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.449 
power based on this circuit here right
here<00:03:14.200> this<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.560> basically<00:03:14.889> feeds<00:03:15.220> back<00:03:15.400> into

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
here this is basically feeds back into

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.580 
here this is basically feeds back into
the<00:03:15.819> panel<00:03:16.120> from<00:03:16.269> this<00:03:16.859> if<00:03:17.859> this<00:03:18.130> goes<00:03:18.790> off

the panel from this if this goes off
these<00:03:20.590> circuits<00:03:21.099> will<00:03:21.250> go<00:03:21.370> off<00:03:21.870> they'll<00:03:22.870> lose

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
these circuits will go off they'll lose

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.460 
these circuits will go off they'll lose
power<00:03:23.760> that'll<00:03:24.760> send<00:03:24.910> this<00:03:25.030> signal<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:26.380> the

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
power that'll send this signal to the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.830 
power that'll send this signal to the
generator<00:03:26.889> to<00:03:27.069> start<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:28.000> get<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.329> speed<00:03:28.630> and

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
generator to start to get the speed and

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.259 
generator to start to get the speed and
then<00:03:28.930> transfer<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.560> power<00:03:29.769> back<00:03:30.639> in<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.239> that

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
then transfer the power back in and that

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.030 
then transfer the power back in and that
power<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:31.900> coming<00:03:32.079> in<00:03:32.290> right<00:03:32.319> here<00:03:32.500> this<00:03:32.980> is

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
back up or put on this panel and it's

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.010 
back up or put on this panel and it's
pretty<00:03:53.840> basic<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.590> way<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:54.890> would<00:03:55.010> work<00:03:55.040> is

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
pretty basic the way it would work is

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.790 
pretty basic the way it would work is
the<00:03:57.020> power<00:03:57.319> goes<00:03:57.650> out<00:03:57.770> here<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.430> senses<00:03:58.970> it

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
the power goes out here it senses it

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.009 
the power goes out here it senses it
generator<00:04:00.800> comes<00:04:00.980> up<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.190> speed<00:04:02.019> this

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
generator comes up the speed this

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.600 
generator comes up the speed this
automatically<00:04:03.590> switches<00:04:04.069> over<00:04:04.340> so<00:04:04.459> it's

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
automatically switches over so it's

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.820 
automatically switches over so it's
either<00:04:04.700> always<00:04:05.269> on<00:04:05.450> a<00:04:05.480> utility<00:04:05.900> or<00:04:06.680> it's

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
either always on a utility or it's

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.220 
either always on a utility or it's
always<00:04:07.250> or<00:04:07.849> it's<00:04:08.060> gonna<00:04:08.150> be<00:04:08.360> on<00:04:08.540> generator

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230

neither<00:04:10.069> one<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.250> these<00:04:10.400> will<00:04:10.550> be<00:04:10.670> off<00:04:10.819> at<00:04:10.940> the

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
neither one of these will be off at the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.170 
neither one of these will be off at the
same<00:04:11.239> time<00:04:11.480> then<00:04:12.110> it<00:04:12.230> is<00:04:12.470> instantaneous<00:04:13.180> right

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
same time then it is instantaneous right

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.910 
same time then it is instantaneous right
now<00:04:14.360> we<00:04:14.420> have<00:04:14.720> eight<00:04:14.930> circuits<00:04:15.440> being<00:04:15.620> fed
