is actually a hunting round so the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.970 
is actually a hunting round so the
penetration<00:02:14.820> on<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.360> not<00:02:15.600> too<00:02:15.750> great<00:02:16.020> 17

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
penetration on that is not too great 17

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.110 
penetration on that is not too great 17
HMR<00:02:17.610> now<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.690> first<00:02:18.900> one<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.110> shot<00:02:19.320> was<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.120> CCI

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
of an inch more it would have went

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.680 
of an inch more it would have went
through<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.870> second<00:02:34.290> one<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:35.070> federal

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690
