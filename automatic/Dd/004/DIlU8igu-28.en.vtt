right<00:02:29.690> back<00:02:29.900> into<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.440> gold<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.459> I'm<00:02:31.640> going<00:02:31.850> to

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
right back into the gold so I'm going to

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:42.640 
right back into the gold so I'm going to
very<00:02:32.270> carefully<00:02:34.090> peel<00:02:35.090> my<00:02:35.300> guides<00:02:35.510> off

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.710 

and<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.430> leaves<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.909> little<00:02:44.060> bit<00:02:44.209> of<00:02:44.330> sticker

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
and it leaves a little bit of sticker

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.140 
and it leaves a little bit of sticker
residue<00:02:45.200> on<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.590> gold<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.159> can<00:02:46.340> see<00:02:46.580> but

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
residue on the gold that you can see but

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.869 
residue on the gold that you can see but
that's<00:02:47.360> totally<00:02:47.569> fine<00:02:48.019> once<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.920> add<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
that's totally fine once you add the

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.080 
that's totally fine once you add the
topcoat<00:02:50.599> that<00:02:51.140> completely<00:02:51.500> disappears<00:02:55.090> so

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
topcoat that completely disappears so

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.820 
topcoat that completely disappears so
yeah<00:02:56.269> once<00:02:56.569> that<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:56.989> done<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.409> can<00:02:57.500> go<00:02:57.650> ahead

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
yeah once that is done you can go ahead

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.520 
yeah once that is done you can go ahead
and<00:02:58.310> add<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.489> topcoat<00:02:58.879> I<00:02:59.390> use<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.959> Sally<00:03:00.319> Hansen

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530

and add a topcoat I use the Sally Hansen
insta-dry<00:03:01.220> not<00:03:01.879> because<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:02.269> my<00:03:02.390> favorite

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840

from Essie and I'm going to go ahead and
apply<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:12.049> topcoat<00:03:12.470> that's<00:03:13.430> gonna<00:03:13.579> help<00:03:13.879> blend

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
apply a topcoat that's gonna help blend

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.990 
apply a topcoat that's gonna help blend
in<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.349> gold<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.099> mint<00:03:16.310> color<00:03:16.549> because

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
in the gold and the mint color because

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.660 
in the gold and the mint color because
they're<00:03:17.650> two<00:03:18.650> different<00:03:18.920> textures<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.579> there

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
they're two different textures and there

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.059 
they're two different textures and there
are<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.819> different<00:03:19.940> thickness<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.590> one<00:03:21.829> is<00:03:21.950> on

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
are a different thickness and one is on

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.289 
are a different thickness and one is on
top<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.489> other<00:03:22.640> one<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.000> they<00:03:23.120> don't

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
top of the other one so they don't

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.900 
top of the other one so they don't
necessarily<00:03:23.780> sit<00:03:24.590> flush<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.280> each<00:03:25.400> other<00:03:25.609> so

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
necessarily sit flush to each other so

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.610 
necessarily sit flush to each other so
the<00:03:26.030> top<00:03:26.209> coat<00:03:26.390> helps<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.720> even<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.109> out<00:03:27.170> and

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
the top coat helps to even that out and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.149 
the top coat helps to even that out and
it<00:03:28.280> helps<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:29.049> completely<00:03:30.049> erase<00:03:30.470> that

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
it helps to completely erase that

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.610 
it helps to completely erase that
sticker<00:03:31.609> residue<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:32.299> shows<00:03:32.629> up<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.019> is<00:03:33.349> my

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
sticker residue that shows up that is my

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.130 
sticker residue that shows up that is my
mint<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.459> gold<00:03:34.940> half<00:03:35.299> moon<00:03:35.510> manually<00:03:35.930> or<00:03:36.049> if
