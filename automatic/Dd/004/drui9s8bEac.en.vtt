the NBA in field goal percentage allowed
so<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.009> don't<00:01:47.220> expect<00:01:47.399> guys<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.970> shoot

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
so you don't expect guys the shoot

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.240 
so you don't expect guys the shoot
lights<00:01:48.479> out<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.899> begin<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:50.159> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
lights out to begin with I think you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.639 
lights out to begin with I think you
couple<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.540> fact<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.170> two

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
couple that with the fact you have two

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.980 
couple that with the fact you have two
extremely<00:01:53.340> efficient<00:01:53.939> coaches<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
extremely efficient coaches I think the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.050 
extremely efficient coaches I think the
Miami<00:01:55.290> Heat<00:01:55.530> coach<00:01:55.799> doesn't<00:01:56.640> get<00:01:56.880> enough

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
Miami Heat coach doesn't get enough

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.050 
Miami Heat coach doesn't get enough
credit<00:01:57.119> oh<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:58.439> because<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.399> he<00:01:59.850> has

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
they've hired tremendous people to help

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.850 
they've hired tremendous people to help
him<00:02:03.180> exactly<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.810> course<00:02:04.079> he<00:02:04.409> doesn't<00:02:04.619> make

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
him exactly of course he doesn't make

any adjustment of course game drive

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660 
any adjustment of course game drive
during<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.020> half<00:02:07.229> exactly<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.129> go<00:02:08.280> into<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
during a half exactly they go into the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.910 
during a half exactly they go into the
locker<00:02:08.819> room<00:02:09.319> exactly<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.440> get<00:02:10.619> somebody

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
locker room exactly you get somebody

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
exactly and I don't think they get the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.070 
exactly and I don't think they get the
credit<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:14.790> far<00:02:14.940> as<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.120> coaching<00:02:15.360> staff<00:02:15.570> does

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
credit as far as the coaching staff does

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.780 
credit as far as the coaching staff does
because<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.830> players<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.460> have<00:02:17.580> we

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
because of the players that you have we

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.790 
because of the players that you have we
have<00:02:17.910> those<00:02:18.030> kind<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.330> superstars<00:02:18.930> unless

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
have those kind of superstars unless

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.380 
have those kind of superstars unless
you're<00:02:20.040> Phil<00:02:20.280> Jackson<00:02:20.880> you're<00:02:21.000> really<00:02:21.300> not

you're Phil Jackson you're really not

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.790 
you're Phil Jackson you're really not

going to get the spotlights shined on

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.330 
going to get the spotlights shined on
with<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.940> said<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.480> think<00:02:24.900> defensively<00:02:25.740> both

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
with that said I think defensively both

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.190 
with that said I think defensively both
teams<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:27.090> been<00:02:27.210> doing<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.510> good<00:02:27.600> job<00:02:27.660> look<00:02:28.110> at

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
teams have been doing a good job look at

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.770 
teams have been doing a good job look at
the<00:02:28.320> total<00:02:28.680> sure<00:02:29.010> they<00:02:30.000> was<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.480> out<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
the total sure they was to it out of the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.300 
the total sure they was to it out of the
under<00:02:30.960> probably<00:02:31.380> be<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.500> exact<00:02:31.890> by<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> time

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
under probably be the exact by the time

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.620 
under probably be the exact by the time
we<00:02:32.430> go<00:02:32.550> home<00:02:32.700> too<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:32.970> then<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.270> perfect

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
we go home too and then the perfect

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.510 
we go home too and then the perfect
storm<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:34.500> why<00:02:34.800> these<00:02:34.860> players<00:02:35.310> aren't

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
storm for why these players aren't

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.670 
storm for why these players aren't
scoring<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.910> lot<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.570> fact<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.170> these<00:02:37.500> are

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
scoring a lot is the fact that these are

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.620 
scoring a lot is the fact that these are
proposition<00:02:38.340> bets<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:39.240> know<00:02:39.420> they're

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
proposition bets and we know they're

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.230 
proposition bets and we know they're
usually<00:02:39.900> inflated<00:02:40.740> on<00:02:40.830> star<00:02:41.160> players<00:02:41.520> towards

played<00:02:56.370> Ray<00:02:56.550> Allen<00:02:56.880> under<00:02:57.090> 10<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.480> half

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
played Ray Allen under 10 and a half

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.140 
played Ray Allen under 10 and a half
because<00:02:58.140> he<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.460> makes<00:02:59.700> total<00:02:59.970> sense

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
because he and that makes total sense

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.330 
because he and that makes total sense
and<00:03:00.750> when<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.230> look<00:03:01.260> at<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> data<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.040> mean<00:03:02.220> it

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
and when you look at the data I mean it

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.210 
and when you look at the data I mean it
totally<00:03:02.490> reflects<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.690> look<00:03:03.840> at<00:03:03.990> Wade

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
totally reflects that you look at Wade

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.290 
totally reflects that you look at Wade
regardless<00:03:05.220> he's<00:03:05.430> hurt<00:03:05.640> we<00:03:05.820> know<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.030> he's

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
regardless he's hurt we know that he's

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.940 
regardless he's hurt we know that he's
not<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> hundred<00:03:06.660> percent<00:03:06.780> there's<00:03:07.590> not<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.770> lot

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
not a hundred percent there's not a lot

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.530 
not a hundred percent there's not a lot
of<00:03:07.980> players<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.610> any<00:03:08.850> sport<00:03:09.240> that<00:03:09.360> are<00:03:09.450> gonna

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
of players in any sport that are gonna

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.240 
of players in any sport that are gonna
be<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.660> hundred<00:03:09.840> percent<00:03:09.990> right<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:11.010> late<00:03:11.220> in

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
be a hundred percent right this late in

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.440 
be a hundred percent right this late in
the<00:03:11.400> season<00:03:12.350> so<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.440> can't<00:03:14.190> really<00:03:14.280> just<00:03:14.760> put

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
the season so you can't really just put

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.090 
the season so you can't really just put
it<00:03:15.570> on<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.870> instead<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.590> look<00:03:16.800> at<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.070> like

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
it on that instead I look at it like

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.190 
it on that instead I look at it like
here's<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.790> guy<00:03:17.820> who<00:03:17.970> averaged<00:03:18.420> 21<00:03:18.750> point<00:03:19.050> two

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
here's a guy who averaged 21 point two

back on Thursday those older legs and

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.990 
back on Thursday those older legs and
he's<00:06:44.050> not<00:06:44.320> healthy<00:06:44.770> right<00:06:44.800> now<00:06:45.190> it's<00:06:45.730> going<00:06:45.910> to

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
he's not healthy right now it's going to

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.220 
he's not healthy right now it's going to
be<00:06:46.090> very<00:06:46.120> difficult<00:06:46.450> to<00:06:46.870> shoot<00:06:47.020> him<00:06:47.170> up

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
be very difficult to shoot him up

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.270 
be very difficult to shoot him up
whatever<00:06:47.410> they<00:06:47.560> have<00:06:47.650> to<00:06:47.710> do<00:06:47.830> to<00:06:47.860> bring<00:06:48.130> him

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
whatever they have to do to bring him

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.040 
whatever they have to do to bring him
out<00:06:48.370> there<00:06:48.610> and<00:06:48.790> I<00:06:49.480> think<00:06:49.750> there's<00:06:49.870> going<00:06:49.960> to

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
out there and I think there's going to

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.900 
out there and I think there's going to
be<00:06:50.080> a<00:06:50.170> clear<00:06:50.470> pattern<00:06:50.740> Wade<00:06:51.250> when<00:06:51.580> he's<00:06:51.730> not

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
be a clear pattern Wade when he's not

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.050 
be a clear pattern Wade when he's not
able<00:06:52.330> to<00:06:52.660> recoup<00:06:52.990> for<00:06:53.200> three<00:06:53.410> days<00:06:53.590> that<00:06:54.220> he's

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
able to recoup for three days that he's

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.580 
able to recoup for three days that he's
going<00:06:55.270> to<00:06:55.330> be<00:06:55.570> seeing<00:06:55.840> less<00:06:56.020> and<00:06:56.050> less<00:06:56.320> of<00:06:56.500> the

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
going to be seeing less and less of the

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.050 
going to be seeing less and less of the
action<00:06:56.860> I<00:06:56.950> think<00:06:57.130> under<00:06:57.340> 60<00:06:57.640> and<00:06:57.730> a<00:06:57.760> half<00:06:57.850> is

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
action I think under 60 and a half is

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.300 
action I think under 60 and a half is
solid<00:06:58.420> what<00:06:58.690> do<00:06:58.840> you<00:06:58.960> guys<00:06:59.110> think<00:06:59.170> I<00:06:59.650> agree<00:07:00.070> I

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
solid what do you guys think I agree I

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.010 
solid what do you guys think I agree I

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.780
