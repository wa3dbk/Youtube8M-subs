 brazil trix i'm a fan 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.940

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 speedy come back and learn the spirit 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.590
 vote it will be necessary for you to know 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.150
 perform your mastery perfectly 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.490
 football if you have not yet learned to be 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.119
 to return almost tutorial there learned 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.650
 sep 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.390
 The other day you come home and do the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.250
 speedy beauty, let's go 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.130
 a lot of people asked us to do a 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.940
 speedy 360 tutorial that is kind of 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.800
 fusion of a speed 1b twist and this is a 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.329
 of the largest applications you are on 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 seeing the spirit 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.420
 apart from this logically dismissing the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 faster votes for the park or 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.559
 then you can use it and the way you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.120
 you very well want 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.070
 then our first step to learning 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.890
 the spirit will be to find a place 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.820
 It's suitable for doing that, right, and we 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.620
 found here 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.760
 this stop safe in the low and wide 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.340
 sticking in my hand will not slip 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.930
 so look for a place like this will not 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.210
 to a piazza like that over there 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.939
 on the side of the bottle of wine as a baby 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.250
 left there or banisters like those there 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.930
 Above you can see there because those 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.240
 most dangerous places to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.380
 wall that you will not 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.950
 slip when trying to do the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.600
 spirit 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.280
 so you can learn the drivers 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.290
 knowing that doing is always going to be very 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.380
 Easy is all we'll do to 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.689
 people is to execute sef and then try not to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.490
 put that foot on the wall what can be 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.470
 a little difficult at first and such but there 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.090
 It's only for you to play the highest foot for 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.990
 go over the wall you can do 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 slowly 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:42.270
 So here it comes, calmly, I know. 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.530
 This is not a speed speed but it's like 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.479
 we get to do the speedy some 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.189
 people to learn the experience of sep 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.950
 but the idea is to jump and lead to 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.680
 The same leg that jumped is the leg that goes 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.509
 have started the second thing after you 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.790
 will learn to pass the foot is going to be 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.380
 jump before reaching the obstacle of the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.650
 same way you learned there in the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.440
 sex 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.180
 It's important thing, I do not know that you 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.850
 puts the foot in balance the weight in the 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.550
 speedy does not have the pec because it means 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.140
 that more weight goes to your arm 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.090
 so it will be necessary you push 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.530
 a wall down so your body 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.590
 climb back you back to the position 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.840
 standing by the time thinking we jump 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.300
 let's place the hand on the globe 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.330
 State and you push to go back to 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.260
 te pushes you even obstacle so that you 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.790
 can pass through it 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.410
 the third thing is one of the most 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.700
 important that we can forget the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.350
 iconta learning spirit will be the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.150
 next you have to do even though 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.990
 a scissors with legs the pieces go 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.480
 do it here 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.220
 if this does not happen, what I see 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.680
 a lot of people doing every day 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.380
 your spirit it does not come out fluent it 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.330
 He leaves but he does not go out with that fluency. 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.080
 speed and dynamics that exists in 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.850
 speedy 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.830
 So that you learn that there is 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.200
 I need you to keep your leg 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.610
 leaves first stretched as if you 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.480
 had kicked someone here on the side 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.340
 right 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.730
 so he always teaches his form 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.340
 is kicking here on the side and that leg 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.320
 stay with every friend who stays in the air 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.660
 hovering in the air while the other goes 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.000
 to pass down in the hour behind go 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.470
 making very slow here so you can see the 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.570
 disease has gone and that's how you 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.950
 have taken a step on the wall 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.739
 I really like doing it , it does not have 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.410
 how to do people here but it's so you 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.970
 has a wall here will do type 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.030
 and put your foot on the wall here. 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:35.050
 will become mine that I do not know if I come back with 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.400
 one foot on the wall it seems here then 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.959
 this type of exercise if you find 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.820
 a place like this will help you 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.560
 and expel at the end of the 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.910
 tutorial I'll put everything together here 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.720
 certain pieces that we have learned all 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.340
 together 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.580
 first you have to have your football if 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.190
 you do not ask it does it all done 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.799
 base speedy exit the jump you 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.620
 makes the body of the hand is the same 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.450
 seixal what add on speedy 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.700
 We will not touch the ball on the ground. 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.160
 this leg is hovering in the floating air 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.420
 in the stretched air preferably in addition 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.430
 we got a kick in the scissors 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.080
 spirit that we come here and the 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.580
 push from here to be able to come back 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.170
 to a wrong position 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.630
 so these three things that you will 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.980
 add to the being that comes back to transform 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.989
 and linen esp back 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.660
 together everything jumps before doing right 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.730
 stay that leg ready to push 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.710
 back with this one while the land 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:33.669
 from below, think about the side ae 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.340
 Do not forget the right pair of scissors. 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.500
 crucial in order to make your spirit 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.200
