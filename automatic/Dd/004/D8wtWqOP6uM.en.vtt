just a really awesome cover conceal it
from<00:03:22.870> Maybelline<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.850> it's<00:03:24.850> like<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.480> and

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
from Maybelline and it's like that and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.569 
from Maybelline and it's like that and
obviously<00:03:26.079> if<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:26.709> put<00:03:26.950> your<00:03:27.100> foundation

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
obviously if you put your foundation

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.610 
obviously if you put your foundation
over<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.180> green<00:03:28.390> won't<00:03:28.630> peek<00:03:28.840> through<00:03:29.110> but

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
over it the green won't peek through but

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.259 
over it the green won't peek through but
you<00:03:29.680> basically<00:03:30.070> just<00:03:30.190> put<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.640> on<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.790> blemish

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
you basically just put it on a blemish

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.900 
you basically just put it on a blemish
rub<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.560> neutralizes<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.400> redness

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
rub it in and it neutralizes the redness

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.030 
rub it in and it neutralizes the redness
so<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.180> redness<00:03:34.600> goes<00:03:35.200> away<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.829> then<00:03:35.980> you

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
so the redness goes away and then you

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.140 
so the redness goes away and then you
put<00:03:36.160> your<00:03:36.280> foundation<00:03:36.760> on<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.060> that's

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
put your foundation on and that's

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.759 
put your foundation on and that's
basically<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.690> really<00:03:37.930> good<00:03:38.079> way<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.290> hide<00:03:38.530> your

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
basically a really good way to hide your

basically a really good way to hide your
blemishes<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:40.120> think<00:03:40.420> this<00:03:40.540> works<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.140> amazing

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
it's one of my favorites but i think

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.470 
it's one of my favorites but i think
this<00:04:47.050> is<00:04:47.260> so<00:04:47.530> cute<00:04:47.920> there<00:04:48.520> was<00:04:48.670> a<00:04:48.700> two<00:04:49.060> piece<00:04:49.300> er

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.340 
but i think this is more appropriate for
a<00:04:51.250> little<00:04:51.580> baby<00:04:51.790> girl<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.510> she's<00:04:53.170> two<00:04:53.320> years
