00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.150 
I don't know if you've seen but about
two<00:02:41.270> or<00:02:41.420> three<00:02:41.570> weeks<00:02:41.720> ago<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.200> little<00:02:43.010> some

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
two or three weeks ago a little some

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.710 
two or three weeks ago a little some
leaked<00:02:43.400> gameplay<00:02:43.640> about<00:02:44.120> half<00:02:44.360> an<00:02:44.510> hour's

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
leaked gameplay about half an hour's

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.030 
leaked gameplay about half an hour's
worth<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.080> was<00:02:45.170> leaked<00:02:45.380> online<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
worth that was leaked online and the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.270 
worth that was leaked online and the
game<00:02:46.250> didn't<00:02:46.730> look<00:02:46.880> great<00:02:47.210> in<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.780> video<00:02:48.280> and

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
game didn't look great in that video and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.920 
game didn't look great in that video and
I<00:02:50.000> actually<00:02:50.210> think<00:02:50.480> it's<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.780> guy<00:02:50.900> who

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
I actually think it's the guy who

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.080 
I actually think it's the guy who
uploaded<00:02:51.470> his<00:02:51.650> fault<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.160> think<00:02:52.670> he<00:02:52.850> had<00:02:53.060> the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
uploaded his fault I think he had the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.820 
uploaded his fault I think he had the
game<00:02:53.360> settings<00:02:53.720> low<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.320> he<00:02:54.410> rendered<00:02:54.710> it

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
game settings low and he rendered it

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.190 
game settings low and he rendered it
badly<00:02:55.070> because<00:02:55.460> when<00:02:55.790> I<00:02:55.820> played<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.480> felt

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
badly because when I played it it felt

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.950 
badly because when I played it it felt
the<00:02:57.950> same<00:02:58.220> if<00:02:58.460> not<00:02:58.490> better<00:02:58.700> graphics<00:02:59.420> wise<00:02:59.630> as

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
the same if not better graphics wise as

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.040 
the same if not better graphics wise as
Scotty<00:03:00.470> room<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:01.640> also<00:03:01.820> had<00:03:02.150> first<00:03:02.510> person

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
Scotty room it also had first person

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.440 
Scotty room it also had first person
which<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.320> wasn't<00:03:03.530> expecting<00:03:03.860> like<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:05.270> could

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
which I wasn't expecting like you could

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.720 
which I wasn't expecting like you could
see<00:03:05.630> your<00:03:05.780> sword<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.350> shield<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.920> stuff<00:03:07.220> or<00:03:07.520> I

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
see your sword and shield and stuff or I

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.550 
see your sword and shield and stuff or I
think<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.600> was<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.720> little<00:03:08.840> bit<00:03:09.020> buggy<00:03:09.260> because

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
think it was a little bit buggy because

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.810 
think it was a little bit buggy because
they're<00:03:09.710> still<00:03:09.920> building<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.310> game<00:03:10.490> is<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:10.790> I

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
they're still building the game is so I

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.840 
they're still building the game is so I
think<00:03:10.910> it's<00:03:11.180> doing<00:03:11.480> alpha<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.430> but<00:03:13.430> then<00:03:13.610> they

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
think it's doing alpha so but then they

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.600 
think it's doing alpha so but then they
said<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.540> me<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:15.050> on<00:03:15.770> its<00:03:15.980> way<00:03:16.040> into<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.400> game

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
said to me is on its way into the game

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.100 
said to me is on its way into the game
