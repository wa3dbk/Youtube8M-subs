in the HP Envy 17 now we're going to
take<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.550> look<00:00:08.670> at<00:00:08.790> some<00:00:08.970> applications<00:00:09.599> that

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
take a look at some applications that

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.209 
take a look at some applications that
are<00:00:09.900> specifically<00:00:10.349> designed<00:00:10.469> for<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.040> leap

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
are specifically designed for the leap

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.650 
are specifically designed for the leap
motion<00:00:11.250> technology<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.240> see<00:00:12.389> if<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.570> is

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
motion technology and see if it is

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.959 
motion technology and see if it is
useful<00:00:12.900> or<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:14.070> an<00:00:14.130> unnecessary<00:00:14.340> gimmick

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
useful or just an unnecessary gimmick

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:25.570 
useful or just an unnecessary gimmick
let's<00:00:15.450> get<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.780> it

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.849 

now<00:00:26.509> let's<00:00:26.660> start<00:00:26.869> by<00:00:26.960> enabling<00:00:27.320> leap<00:00:27.679> motion

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
now let's start by enabling leap motion

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.800 
now let's start by enabling leap motion
now<00:00:28.310> to<00:00:28.369> do<00:00:28.640> this<00:00:28.789> you<00:00:29.000> simply<00:00:29.029> press<00:00:29.599> the

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
appear sliced off with a leap motion

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.720 
appear sliced off with a leap motion
tester<00:00:39.379> this<00:00:39.680> is<00:00:39.829> basically<00:00:40.190> an<00:00:40.370> introduction

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
tester this is basically an introduction

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.610 
tester this is basically an introduction
on<00:00:41.030> how<00:00:41.090> to<00:00:41.239> use<00:00:41.659> the<00:00:41.870> leap<00:00:41.989> motion<00:00:42.019> technology

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
on how to use the leap motion technology

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.860 
on how to use the leap motion technology
and<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:43.190> does<00:00:43.339> the<00:00:43.430> job<00:00:43.579> very<00:00:43.640> nicely<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.750> have

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
and it does the job very nicely you have

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.180 
and it does the job very nicely you have
a<00:00:44.930> few<00:00:45.110> screens<00:00:45.440> which<00:00:45.650> you<00:00:45.739> can<00:00:45.920> switch

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
a few screens which you can switch

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.040 
a few screens which you can switch
between<00:00:46.339> and<00:00:46.760> each<00:00:46.909> one<00:00:47.210> has<00:00:47.420> something<00:00:47.600> new

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
between and each one has something new

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.110 
between and each one has something new
for<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:48.680> interact<00:00:49.159> with<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.820> can<00:00:49.970> move

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
for you to interact with you can move

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.910 
for you to interact with you can move
all<00:00:50.390> of<00:00:50.420> these<00:00:50.629> particles<00:00:51.019> around<00:00:51.379> by<00:00:51.559> waving

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
all of these particles around by waving

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.500 
all of these particles around by waving
your<00:00:52.010> hands<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:52.519> my<00:00:52.579> favorite<00:00:53.030> is<00:00:53.149> this<00:00:53.329> one

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
your hands and my favorite is this one

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.090 
your hands and my favorite is this one
right<00:00:53.690> here<00:00:53.750> where<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.320> sensor<00:00:54.680> shows<00:00:54.860> you

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
right here where the sensor shows you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.920 
right here where the sensor shows you
why<00:00:55.280> it's<00:00:55.430> these<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:56.089> animation<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.839> way

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
why it's these the animation and the way

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.779 
why it's these the animation and the way
it<00:00:57.050> consistently<00:00:57.590> keeps<00:00:57.949> up<00:00:58.100> with<00:00:58.280> my<00:00:58.399> finger

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
it consistently keeps up with my finger

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.310 
it consistently keeps up with my finger
movements<00:00:59.210> is<00:00:59.300> really<00:00:59.539> quite<00:00:59.690> impressive<00:01:00.140> you

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
movements is really quite impressive you

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.830 
movements is really quite impressive you
can<00:01:01.100> also<00:01:01.340> paint<00:01:01.670> these<00:01:01.910> blue<00:01:02.180> neon<00:01:02.449> lines

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
can also paint these blue neon lines

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.749 
can also paint these blue neon lines
with<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.289> maximum<00:01:03.679> of<00:01:03.920> 10<00:01:04.129> fingers<00:01:04.519> which<00:01:04.670> is

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
with a maximum of 10 fingers which is

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.249 
with a maximum of 10 fingers which is
pretty<00:01:04.910> cool<00:01:05.149> I<00:01:05.390> like<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.899> way<00:01:05.990> it<00:01:06.050> sparkles

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
pretty cool I like the way it sparkles

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.290 
pretty cool I like the way it sparkles
as<00:01:06.619> you<00:01:06.740> draw<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:06.950> lines<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:07.820> reminds<00:01:08.119> me<00:01:08.210> of

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
as you draw the lines it reminds me of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.850 
as you draw the lines it reminds me of
this<00:01:08.420> box<00:01:08.660> lightsabers<00:01:09.350> make<00:01:09.560> when<00:01:09.740> they<00:01:09.830> are

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
this box lightsabers make when they are

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.770 
this box lightsabers make when they are
cutting<00:01:10.190> a<00:01:10.280> hole<00:01:10.460> through<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:10.789> wall<00:01:11.030> but<00:01:11.750> I

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
cutting a hole through a wall but I

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.749 
cutting a hole through a wall but I
digress<00:01:12.080> all<00:01:12.530> in<00:01:12.740> all<00:01:12.890> this<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.280> really<00:01:13.520> nice

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
digress all in all this is a really nice

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.219 
digress all in all this is a really nice
little<00:01:14.060> tech<00:01:14.240> demo<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.660> get<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.869> started<00:01:14.929> with

little tech demo to get you started with
leap<00:01:15.410> motion<00:01:16.060> now<00:01:17.060> let's<00:01:17.210> try<00:01:17.390> out<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.539> game<00:01:17.810> now

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
leap motion now let's try out a game now

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.810 
leap motion now let's try out a game now
I<00:01:18.140> was<00:01:18.350> surprised<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.950> find<00:01:18.979> out<00:01:19.369> that<00:01:19.429> this

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
I was surprised to find out that this

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.490 
I was surprised to find out that this
game<00:01:20.060> was<00:01:20.210> actually<00:01:20.360> associated<00:01:21.259> with<00:01:21.380> the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
game was actually associated with the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.469 
game was actually associated with the
Disney<00:01:21.800> film<00:01:21.950> wreck-it<00:01:22.070> Ralph<00:01:22.550> that's<00:01:23.060> pretty

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
Disney film wreck-it Ralph that's pretty

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.969 
Disney film wreck-it Ralph that's pretty
much<00:01:23.630> where<00:01:23.869> all<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.080> fun<00:01:24.259> ends<00:01:24.500> it's

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
much where all the fun ends it's

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.919 
much where all the fun ends it's
basically<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.610> very<00:01:25.670> similar<00:01:26.149> racing<00:01:26.630> game<00:01:26.750> to

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
basically a very similar racing game to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.660 
basically a very similar racing game to
Mario<00:01:27.259> Kart<00:01:27.590> but<00:01:27.830> lacking<00:01:28.130> in<00:01:28.399> pretty<00:01:28.640> much

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
Mario Kart but lacking in pretty much

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.330 
Mario Kart but lacking in pretty much
everything<00:01:29.300> that<00:01:29.330> made<00:01:29.599> that<00:01:29.780> game<00:01:29.959> fun<00:01:30.340> once

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
everything that made that game fun once

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.650 
everything that made that game fun once
we<00:01:31.429> get<00:01:31.520> all<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:31.789> for<00:01:31.970> now<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.270> let<00:01:32.360> us<00:01:32.390> talk

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
we get all that for now and let us talk

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.960 
we get all that for now and let us talk
about<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:33.020> leap<00:01:33.170> motion<00:01:33.349> controls<00:01:33.979> one<00:01:34.849> of

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
about the leap motion controls one of

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.190 
about the leap motion controls one of
the<00:01:35.090> neat<00:01:35.270> things<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.660> can<00:01:35.750> do<00:01:35.959> in<00:01:36.050> this<00:01:36.140> game

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
the neat things you can do in this game

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.109 
the neat things you can do in this game
is<00:01:36.380> build<00:01:36.739> your<00:01:36.890> own<00:01:36.920> cart<00:01:37.399> you<00:01:37.849> can<00:01:37.970> grab

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
is build your own cart you can grab

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.850 
is build your own cart you can grab
wheels<00:01:38.479> drop<00:01:38.899> them<00:01:39.050> onto<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.349> cart<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:39.770> then

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
wheels drop them onto the cart and then

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.290 
wheels drop them onto the cart and then
release<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.160> whole<00:01:40.310> bunch<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.580> sweets<00:01:40.880> onto<00:01:41.179> it

release a whole bunch of sweets onto it

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.669 
release a whole bunch of sweets onto it
and<00:01:41.420> your<00:01:41.509> vehicle<00:01:41.690> is<00:01:41.989> done<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.440> ready<00:01:42.560> to

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
and your vehicle is done and ready to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.499 
and your vehicle is done and ready to
race<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:43.190> thought<00:01:43.729> this<00:01:43.849> was<00:01:44.000> really<00:01:44.360> quite

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
race I thought this was really quite

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:45.940 
race I thought this was really quite
creative<00:01:44.869> actually<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.649> follows<00:01:45.830> the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
creative actually and it follows the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.979 
creative actually and it follows the
movie<00:01:46.220> very<00:01:46.340> closely<00:01:46.670> now<00:01:47.450> let's<00:01:47.599> move<00:01:47.720> on<00:01:47.899> to

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:47.989 
movie very closely now let's move on to

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:49.210 
movie very closely now let's move on to
the<00:01:48.080> most<00:01:48.200> interesting<00:01:48.709> part<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.039> game

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
the most interesting part of the game

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.430 
the most interesting part of the game
the<00:01:49.610> racing<00:01:50.090> before<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.810> timer<00:01:51.020> goes<00:01:51.259> down

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
the racing before the timer goes down

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.809 
the racing before the timer goes down
the<00:01:51.619> game<00:01:51.770> presents<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.280> with<00:01:52.310> an<00:01:52.520> on-screen

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
the game presents you with an on-screen

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.520 
the game presents you with an on-screen
graphic<00:01:53.390> which<00:01:53.569> wants<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.020> position<00:01:54.349> both

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
graphic which wants you to position both

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.529 
graphic which wants you to position both
your<00:01:54.739> fists<00:01:55.160> above<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.670> leap<00:01:55.819> motion<00:01:55.970> sensor

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
your fists above the leap motion sensor

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.300 
your fists above the leap motion sensor
once<00:01:56.989> you<00:01:57.080> have<00:01:57.170> done<00:01:57.319> so<00:01:57.349> you<00:01:57.530> can<00:01:57.679> steer<00:01:58.129> your

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
once you have done so you can steer your

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.830 
once you have done so you can steer your
hands<00:01:58.489> in<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.819> air<00:01:58.849> and<00:01:59.149> now<00:01:59.300> will<00:01:59.450> actually

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
hands in the air and now will actually

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.419 
hands in the air and now will actually
steer<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.229> car<00:02:00.379> in<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.590> game<00:02:00.739> that<00:02:01.310> is<00:02:01.399> a

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
steer the car in the game that is a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.160 
steer the car in the game that is a
really<00:02:01.879> nifty<00:02:02.030> idea<00:02:02.509> there<00:02:02.899> are<00:02:02.929> a<00:02:03.050> couple

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
really nifty idea there are a couple

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.260 
really nifty idea there are a couple
problems<00:02:03.470> though<00:02:03.860> your<00:02:04.459> fists<00:02:04.819> have<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.000> very

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
problems though your fists have a very

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.910 
problems though your fists have a very
narrow<00:02:05.569> range<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:05.989> movement<00:02:06.470> above<00:02:06.739> the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
narrow range of movement above the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.650 
narrow range of movement above the
sensor<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.550> many<00:02:07.759> times<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.209> fails<00:02:08.450> to

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
sensor and many times it fails to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.330 
sensor and many times it fails to
recognize<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.259> position<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.709> your<00:02:09.830> hands<00:02:10.160> and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
recognize the position of your hands and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.949 
recognize the position of your hands and
you<00:02:10.399> end<00:02:10.610> up<00:02:10.700> driving<00:02:11.120> into<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.420> wall<00:02:11.599> a<00:02:11.660> lot

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
you end up driving into the wall a lot

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.540 
you end up driving into the wall a lot
more<00:02:12.170> than<00:02:12.319> you<00:02:12.440> would<00:02:12.500> expect<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:13.250> don't<00:02:13.430> get

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
more than you would expect you don't get

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.220 
more than you would expect you don't get
much<00:02:13.730> accuracy<00:02:14.150> with<00:02:14.420> your<00:02:14.599> steering<00:02:14.900> either

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
much accuracy with your steering either

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.410 
much accuracy with your steering either
that's<00:02:15.739> one<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.160> reasons<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.670> always<00:02:17.120> miss

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
that's one of the reasons I always miss

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.660 
that's one of the reasons I always miss
the<00:02:17.599> power-ups<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.620> really<00:02:19.430> irritating

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
the power-ups it's really irritating

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.790 
the power-ups it's really irritating
when<00:02:20.629> you<00:02:20.720> do<00:02:20.870> get<00:02:21.050> powerup<00:02:21.410> though<00:02:21.560> like<00:02:21.769> a

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
when you do get powerup though like a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.530 
when you do get powerup though like a
projectile<00:02:21.980> quite<00:02:22.819> cleverly<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.390> do<00:02:23.510> a

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
projectile quite cleverly you do a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.970 
projectile quite cleverly you do a
punching<00:02:23.930> motion<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.470> fires<00:02:24.769> at<00:02:24.860> your

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
punching motion and it fires at your

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.680 
punching motion and it fires at your
opponent<00:02:25.400> again<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.209> really<00:02:26.480> quite

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
opponent again that is really quite

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.509 
opponent again that is really quite
nifty<00:02:27.110> but<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.410> good<00:02:27.560> things<00:02:27.800> really<00:02:28.040> askew

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
nifty but the good things really askew

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.400 
nifty but the good things really askew
and<00:02:28.640> far<00:02:28.819> between<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.629> being<00:02:29.840> said<00:02:30.050> when<00:02:30.290> it

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
and far between that being said when it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.320 
and far between that being said when it
works<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.860> quite<00:02:31.129> nice<00:02:31.310> but<00:02:31.610> after<00:02:31.910> one<00:02:32.120> match

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
works is quite nice but after one match

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.420 
works is quite nice but after one match
your<00:02:32.629> arms<00:02:32.840> do<00:02:32.989> get<00:02:33.260> really<00:02:33.590> quite<00:02:33.800> tired<00:02:34.130> and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
your arms do get really quite tired and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.560 
your arms do get really quite tired and
then<00:02:34.520> you'll<00:02:34.700> just<00:02:34.880> want<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.090> play<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.300> game

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
then you'll just want to play the game

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.060 
then you'll just want to play the game
with<00:02:35.720> physical<00:02:36.080> controls<00:02:36.530> as<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.920> would<00:02:37.040> be

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
with physical controls as it would be

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.309 
with physical controls as it would be
far<00:02:37.400> less<00:02:37.580> frustrating<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.390> more<00:02:38.570> enjoy

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
far less frustrating and more enjoy

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.530 
far less frustrating and more enjoy
so<00:02:39.739> yeah<00:02:40.189> this<00:02:40.519> game<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.760> not<00:02:41.209> really<00:02:41.510> that

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
so yeah this game is not really that

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.270 
so yeah this game is not really that
impressive<00:02:44.379> next<00:02:45.379> we've<00:02:45.500> got<00:02:45.530> duck<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.040> kill

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
impressive next we've got duck and kill

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.770 
impressive next we've got duck and kill
which<00:02:46.519> I<00:02:46.640> actually<00:02:46.790> downloaded<00:02:47.569> from<00:02:47.659> the

store this is a very crude game and
you'll<00:02:50.060> soon<00:02:50.329> see<00:02:50.569> why<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.349> objective<00:02:51.769> of<00:02:51.829> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
game is to basically kill as many ducks

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.259 
game is to basically kill as many ducks
as<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:53.959> can<00:02:54.170> before<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.530> timer<00:02:54.739> goes<00:02:54.980> out<00:02:55.269> yep

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
as you can before the timer goes out yep

as you can before the timer goes out yep
that's<00:02:56.900> what<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.109> game<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:57.769> I

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
that's what the game is and I

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.190 
that's what the game is and I
intentionally<00:02:58.489> downloaded<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.150> what<00:03:00.019> can<00:03:00.140> I

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
intentionally downloaded it what can I

intentionally downloaded it what can I
say<00:03:00.439> I<00:03:00.650> find<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.189> very<00:03:01.220> therapeutic<00:03:02.079> good<00:03:03.079> good

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379

I really etat to someone anyway the
controls<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.569> this<00:03:05.629> game<00:03:05.720> really<00:03:06.049> caught<00:03:06.379> my

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
controls of this game really caught my

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.839 
controls of this game really caught my
eye<00:03:06.530> as<00:03:06.859> you<00:03:06.890> are<00:03:07.099> supposed<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.459> shape<00:03:07.670> your

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
eye as you are supposed to shape your

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.369 
eye as you are supposed to shape your
finger<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.329> thumb<00:03:08.480> into<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.840> gun<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:09.290> then

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
finger and thumb into a gun and then

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.710 
finger and thumb into a gun and then
fling<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.769> up<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.189> fire<00:03:10.430> kind<00:03:11.359> of<00:03:11.450> like<00:03:11.569> how

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
fling it up to fire kind of like how

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.509 
fling it up to fire kind of like how
Cowboys<00:03:12.170> would<00:03:12.379> normally<00:03:12.680> shoot<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.430> that's

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
Cowboys would normally shoot and that's

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.680 
Cowboys would normally shoot and that's
how<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.730> are<00:03:13.879> supposed<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.180> fire<00:03:14.420> at<00:03:14.599> the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
how you are supposed to fire at the

Ducks<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.650> game<00:03:15.889> was<00:03:16.099> very<00:03:16.400> awkward<00:03:16.849> to

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
Ducks this game was very awkward to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.369 
Ducks this game was very awkward to
control<00:03:17.269> up<00:03:17.420> for<00:03:17.569> us<00:03:17.690> but<00:03:17.870> after<00:03:17.930> playing<00:03:18.260> it

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
control up for us but after playing it

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.750 
control up for us but after playing it
for<00:03:18.470> about<00:03:18.560> five<00:03:18.859> to<00:03:19.010> ten<00:03:19.190> minutes<00:03:19.459> you'll<00:03:19.639> get

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
for about five to ten minutes you'll get

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.069 
for about five to ten minutes you'll get
the<00:03:19.879> hang<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.569> will<00:03:20.720> have<00:03:20.750> some

the hang of it and you will have some

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.259 
the hang of it and you will have some
good<00:03:21.349> fun<00:03:21.560> with<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.829> too<00:03:21.859> this<00:03:22.849> is<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.030> better

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
good fun with it too this is a better

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.119 
good fun with it too this is a better
example<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.840> leap<00:03:24.019> motion<00:03:24.170> technology<00:03:24.620> as<00:03:25.010> the

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
example of leap motion technology as the

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.920 
example of leap motion technology as the
game<00:03:25.310> really<00:03:25.639> takes<00:03:25.849> it<00:03:26.030> into<00:03:26.209> account<00:03:26.629> and<00:03:26.840> it

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
game really takes it into account and it

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.229 
game really takes it into account and it
is<00:03:27.019> a<00:03:27.049> lot<00:03:27.349> of<00:03:27.439> fun<00:03:27.650> as<00:03:27.799> a<00:03:27.829> result<00:03:28.220> as<00:03:28.849> I<00:03:29.060> bring

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
is a lot of fun as a result as I bring

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.179 
is a lot of fun as a result as I bring
this<00:03:29.329> video<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.750> close<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:30.470> would<00:03:30.799> just<00:03:31.040> like

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
this video to a close I would just like

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.770 
this video to a close I would just like
to<00:03:31.220> remind<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:31.790> leap<00:03:32.180> motion<00:03:32.359> can<00:03:32.750> be

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
to remind you that leap motion can be

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.080 
to remind you that leap motion can be
used<00:03:33.049> for<00:03:33.230> other<00:03:33.349> applications<00:03:33.470> as<00:03:34.280> well<00:03:34.519> but

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
used for other applications as well but

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.460 
used for other applications as well but
this<00:03:35.239> was<00:03:35.359> just<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.599> short<00:03:35.629> example<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.349> give

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470

you<00:03:36.620> guys<00:03:36.799> an<00:03:37.010> idea<00:03:37.099> as<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:37.549> how<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.879> worked<00:03:38.090> in

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
you guys an idea as to how it worked in

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:38.830 
you guys an idea as to how it worked in

I<00:03:38.870> personally<00:03:39.290> am<00:03:39.530> not<00:03:39.650> convinced<00:03:40.159> of<00:03:40.310> this

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
I personally am not convinced of this

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.190 
I personally am not convinced of this
technology<00:03:40.970> yet<00:03:41.420> as<00:03:41.629> it<00:03:41.750> needs<00:03:41.959> a<00:03:42.019> lot<00:03:42.170> more

technology yet as it needs a lot more

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.259 
technology yet as it needs a lot more

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
tuning in someone should make a game

in first-person I could see that being

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.680 
in first-person I could see that being
