this<00:02:58.019> is<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.889> know<00:02:59.010> four<00:02:59.609> days<00:03:00.090> out<00:03:00.359> you<00:03:00.659> can't

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
this is you know four days out you can't

this is you know four days out you can't
be<00:03:01.019> specific<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:01.950> would<00:03:02.099> say<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> better

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
be specific but I would say the better

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.099 
be specific but I would say the better
chance<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:03.000> severe<00:03:03.359> weather<00:03:03.420> could<00:03:03.780> be<00:03:03.810> North

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
then Wednesday that deep low moves just

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.479 
then Wednesday that deep low moves just
north<00:03:13.079> of<00:03:13.200> New<00:03:13.349> England<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.829> there's<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.250> cold

north of New England and there's a cold
front<00:03:14.730> coming<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.989> we've<00:03:16.709> seen<00:03:16.950> other

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
front coming in and we've seen other

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.280 
front coming in and we've seen other
runs<00:03:17.519> that<00:03:17.730> bring<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.090> well-defined<00:03:18.599> wave<00:03:19.019> of

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
runs that bring a well-defined wave of

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.470 
runs that bring a well-defined wave of
low<00:03:19.470> pressure<00:03:19.500> along<00:03:20.160> that<00:03:20.849> front<00:03:21.090> but<00:03:21.359> it's

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
low pressure along that front but it's

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.089 
low pressure along that front but it's
going<00:03:21.599> to<00:03:21.690> be<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.810> slow<00:03:22.139> mover<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.680> Wednesday

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
going to be a slow mover so Wednesday

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.470 
going to be a slow mover so Wednesday
