instead<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.610> create<00:03:59.760> compost<00:04:00.420> which<00:04:00.750> helps

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
instead to create compost which helps

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.130 
instead to create compost which helps
actually<00:04:01.980> minimize<00:04:02.940> our<00:04:03.269> carbon<00:04:03.660> footprint
