this<00:00:51.300> doesn't<00:00:51.660> mean<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.989> should<00:00:52.170> only<00:00:52.379> play

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
this doesn't mean you should only play

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650

who aren't very good at the game but
this<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.689> actually<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> worst

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
this is actually one of the worst

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.130 
this is actually one of the worst
strategies<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.579> there<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.840> happen<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
strategies out there if you happen to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.080 
strategies out there if you happen to
face<00:01:37.380> off<00:01:37.619> against<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.040> good<00:01:38.220> player<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> he

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
face off against a good player and he

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.399 
face off against a good player and he
knows<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.450> you're<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> roll

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
knows that you're going to roll

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.230 
knows that you're going to roll
he<00:01:40.770> will<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.100> position<00:01:41.520> himself<00:01:41.670> where<00:01:42.210> he

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
he will just position himself where he

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.480 
he will just position himself where he
can<00:01:42.329> hit<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.780> first<00:01:43.040> that's<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.250> problem

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
can hit you first that's the problem

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.580 
can hit you first that's the problem
with<00:01:44.729> rolling<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.600> can't<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.960> anything<00:01:46.229> until

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
with rolling you can't do anything until

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.069 
with rolling you can't do anything until
the<00:01:46.710> roll<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.100> over<00:01:47.430> running<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.509> dashing<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the roll is over running and dashing and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.690 
the roll is over running and dashing and
using<00:01:49.380> your<00:01:49.470> shield<00:01:49.680> when<00:01:49.799> necessary<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.460> much

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
using your shield when necessary is much

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.609 
using your shield when necessary is much
better<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.930> still<00:01:52.170> grab<00:01:52.439> or

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
better because you can still grab or

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.590 
better because you can still grab or
attack<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> more<00:01:54.060> important<00:01:54.450> thing<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
attack but the more important thing is

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.990 
attack but the more important thing is
to<00:01:54.840> keep<00:01:55.049> your<00:01:55.259> movement<00:01:55.619> unpredictable<00:01:56.369> I'm
