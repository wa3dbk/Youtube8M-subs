 super fun super easy to do me 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.210
 it is in any case the sequence of 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.210
 three exercises of support the 30 seconds 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.530
 by the at 6,10 repeatedly to do 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.930
 no limit in total so we'll get 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.880
 calculate time with m dilapidation 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.290
 I have on the phone 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.300
 a report that will save him from zeal 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.500
 for sound but not thoughts so we 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.850
 goes against 7 above the throat you 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.560
 explain it can do it you 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.020

 do not do that anymore if it does not 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.490
 take from all this is rather 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.290
 police or to ask if this is 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.550
