00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.760
 very good we all get one more day with 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:05.830
 all of you this time 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.280
 will finish another little guide of things that 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.320
 we should not do in rne kits because then 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.820
 are things that are pretty basic the 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.400
 truth is nothing any mystery that 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.699
 unknown but they are things that really 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.930
 they help us, they can help us a lot 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.119
 to have more options to earn the 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.070
 games as I always say and way 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.420
 informative these guides that I'm going 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.060
 doing for example as previous that 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.439
 I did how to climb a diamond not the 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.689
 I do it alone, it's not only my opinion 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.000
 I'm based on the opinion of 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.280
 professional people who have a level of 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.899
 professional game and that are things that 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.340
 I really see that they can serve in all 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.510
 the game levels I say it because 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.160
 then there is some comment on how 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.690
 can you tell how it is diamond if 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.670
 you do not play the game professionally 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.020
 well, all I do is raise 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.969
 all the information that I have of everything 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.160
 type of players and the raises here of 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.680
 graphic form so that we can all 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.199
 with knowing each other we start again and 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.570
 with this little guide things that do not 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.100
 we should do never say this in 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.260
 champion section 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.360
 two basic examples would be gidi game is 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.440
 over you the banquet that translated 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.940
 would be 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.530
 the finished game does not go to this 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.450
 oil this is the typical phrase that usually 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.890
 say some players when they go and 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.260
 to some character that they consider 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.590
 to be broken not that this is 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.570
 for example, what is typical 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.580
 champion broken and feels is also very 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.110
 criticized when new banias and certain 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.790
 things and the other team takes it and you 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.990
 you say ok and even banned us to this 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.610
 this is lost 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.550
 do not do that please because all the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.760
 games are winnable then another example 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.700
 is or maicon del 59 in Spanish we are going to 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.409
 come to the point 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.960
 that his team composition is a lot 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.969
 better really why do you think that 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.880
 because you have made a bad composition 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:47.039
 can be but really you in these two 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.750
 phrases you're seeing on screen 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.189
 example you do not win to do but I know what 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.799
 they catch you you do not really know if that 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.630
 set if that's going to be good is going to be bad 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.250
 is going to be a feeder is going to be a troll not 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.840
 you know it or simply to see that 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.030
 be applied given a champion that neither 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.289
 he does not even know if he knows how to use, you're going to give 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.969
 the game for lost 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.429
 that already going to start with the wrong foot 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.679
 heading message for all this have a 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.989
 positive state a good roll in the 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.340
 loneliness team plus win rate option now 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.019
 that if not if you start already of bad money 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.030
 with young people is that normalized 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.590
 this is that he is stupid and then things 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.480
 they are not going to go too, not as a game in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.290
 team that is the most important thing in this 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.030
 game 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.180
 another pretty important point is never 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.150
 es pÃ©rez or demand is the blue bufo for 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.519
 what do I say this well we have the habit 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.920
 or the mania not that the mid line then the 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.409
 second blue diver takes it well 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.810
 this is not this is not this is not 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.879
 his patrimony as here I say we have 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.069
 two important points who takes the 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.439
 blue diver is a decision of jungle not 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.150
 it depends because because you your decision 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.310
 as milk line is to win the line of my 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.250
 whitening skirting etcetera etcetera 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.700
 etcetera the jungle is from the jungle and he is 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.040
 he who can give you the blue buff 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.810
 if he wants to because that's his thing like that 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.120
 that you do not have is not bound to give you 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.169
 you the blue whenever you want it and 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.629
 as I say in the second point 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:06.400
 we will get blue is a privilege not 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.290
 an equity obligation what does it mean 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.669
 what if you are left with the blue diver 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.280
 is for you to have a little more 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:14.439
 easy opposite your other to me is not something 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.209
 that is yours is always the no when catching 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.069
 you will always take me the blue 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.139
 because blue depends on if you 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.139
 wants to leave the jungle or not for that 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.580
 It's the jungle and it's his jester he goes with 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.750
 to get experience 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.750
 and certain other things 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.189
 at this point we have never follow 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.049
 blindly to some partner what 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.090
 means this we have always seen some 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.500
 partner that is going to federated 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.170
 called 10-0 is believed to be 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.450
 can with everyone and gets by his 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.819
 jungle try to catch the enemies and 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.620
 get even more kills the first 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.989
 question what you should do is this will be 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.780
 sure or be on guard this 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.159
 area is safe to get in here 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.109
 really if you think it is not 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.209
 saved do not follow your partner because 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.579
 really or ping and ale or explain that 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.049
 be careful because really the most 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.519
 important is that you think for yourself 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.319
 not because someone goes to 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.459
 go ahead and it is created as we said you should not 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.739
 you follow him 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.269
 blindly to kill but you must 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.269
 think well what to do at any time 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.420
 another little dot and a pretty important one and 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.370
 fundamental is do not expect to win all 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.670
 the games of only that is something 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.070
 impossible or is it impossible 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.930
 it's more the professional players the 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.670
 pros those who are in challenger those who 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.410
 they earn money with this they do not earn all the 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.260
 games is impossible to win all 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.090
 the rank ets games you always have to 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.160
 lose and here are the two points 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.920
 fundamental now impossible games of 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.770
 to win that is very important what is important 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.600
 is not to recreate not to rage just to accept it or 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.680
 be you have to win but also 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.500
 you have to lose because it is impossible 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.290
 win all the important thing to climb 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.210
 level is based on earning more than 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.100
 you lose not winning all the games what 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.030
 means this you even if you have a wing 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.220
 51 percent rate that is 1% more 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.080
 of half you are already earning more than 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.200
 losing if you follow if you continue with 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.680
 that 51 percent statistic always 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.230
 you're going to go up rather than go down, so if 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.380
 you play a lot of games you're going to get 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.610
 to go up a lot and you're not going to go down like that 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.680
 that the important thing is always to have a 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.020
 positive point if you already tell me you want a 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.460
 good trade of 49 percent then 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.449
 obviously you are going to go down more than 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.300
 going up 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.729
 and a point that I consider fundamental is 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.370
 never have and listen to what gamer 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.930
 means this and it is not a trolley or if not 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.849
 that when I talk about it, it's never 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.360
 you have first I mean do not listen to 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:40.460
 people in general because because you 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.969
 as I say here do not do things because 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.499
 you see them or because a friend says back 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:48.139
 the second point is you yourself 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:50.479
 you must assimilate this and understand why it 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.309
 does and the clearest example that I've 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:56.330
 found the one that came to my head 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:58.310
 choose tea rice that destroys to fit these 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.889
 typical this is typical of you are in 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.520
 I hope someone bites a champion 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:07.400
 that you consider or pe or something like that and you 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.259
 they say you take a champion in 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.060
 specific that with that bust 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.740
 sure for example the example that I put 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.349
 they catch a fit that is a champion 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.909
 quite powerful and says do not catch it late 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.789
 that sure the Busting 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:22.249
 because then then the typical one goes 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:24.499
 he takes rice but he really does not know how to use 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:26.919
 Rice does not know what skills you have and 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:29.310
 Do not know how to make counter pick of it 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:32.070
 then he is really catching 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.260
 and they had been better any 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.590
 another type of pic for example to the best 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.660
 of co-management that is a set against fit and 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.340
 It is much easier for you than with a rice 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.870
 why why why with the set 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.520
 you can play more or less and the recio 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.890
 you have no idea but as you have been told 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.210
 that is with perpignan fit, because you 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.130
 you take it and try your luck without 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.160
 even know what the character does 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.290
 Most importantly , know why rice 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.810
 is tell tell what skills you have 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:00.000
 how can you do with traffic and not 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.950
 simply because they tell you and that's 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.130
 more basically what I come to explain 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.870
 in this in this graph, even if you do 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.129
 case to the people but to think for you 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.599
 same 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:12.099
 so well this would be all you already know 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:13.839
 that you can support the video with a 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.369
 like to share it with you if 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:18.989
 you write the channel if you have not done yet 

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:18.989
 a greeting and see you later
