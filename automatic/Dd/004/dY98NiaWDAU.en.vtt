great way for you to keep those
measurements<00:00:21.750> accurate<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:23.250> what<00:00:23.939> I'm<00:00:24.060> using

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
measurements accurate so what I'm using

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.810 
measurements accurate so what I'm using
is<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> digital<00:00:25.590> scale<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> got<00:00:26.609> from

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
is a digital scale that I got from

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.300 
is a digital scale that I got from
Target<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.960> use<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.590> especially<00:00:28.859> when

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
Target and I use this especially when

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.700 
Target and I use this especially when
I'm<00:00:29.429> competing<00:00:29.789> because<00:00:30.439> everything<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.560> so

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
I'm competing because everything is so

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.750 
I'm competing because everything is so
specific<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.780> I<00:00:33.780> use<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.739> kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.700> off

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
specific and I use it kind of on and off

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.280 
specific and I use it kind of on and off
through<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> offseason<00:00:36.360> over<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> years

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
through the offseason over the years

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.540 
through the offseason over the years
I've<00:00:37.469> kind<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.739> gotten<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> better<00:00:38.100> idea<00:00:38.309> of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
I've kind of gotten a better idea of

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.790 
I've kind of gotten a better idea of
what<00:00:38.640> an<00:00:38.820> actual<00:00:39.120> actual<00:00:39.660> serving<00:00:40.079> size<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.440> by

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
what an actual actual serving size is by

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.709 
what an actual actual serving size is by
eyeball<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.850> if<00:00:41.969> you're<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.300> starting<00:00:42.420> out

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
eyeball but if you're just starting out

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.510 
eyeball but if you're just starting out
this<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.110> also<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.410> great<00:00:43.620> tool<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> make<00:00:44.340> sure

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
this is also a great tool to make sure

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.069 
this is also a great tool to make sure
that<00:00:44.640> you're<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:44.910> overeating<00:00:45.750> or

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
that you're not overeating or

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.740 
that you're not overeating or
undereating<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> calories<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.600> add

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
undereating because the calories can add

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.619 
undereating because the calories can add
up<00:00:48.870> very<00:00:48.899> fast<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:51.860> this<00:00:52.860> scale<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.219> got<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.850> from

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
up very fast so this scale I got is from

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.350 
up very fast so this scale I got is from
Target<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.920> about<00:00:56.070> 20<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> 30<00:00:56.730> dollars<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
Target it was about 20 to 30 dollars and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.450 
Target it was about 20 to 30 dollars and
I<00:00:57.750> recommend<00:00:58.170> getting<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.500> digital<00:00:58.920> scale<00:00:59.129> it's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
I recommend getting a digital scale it's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.520 
I recommend getting a digital scale it's
much<00:01:00.390> better<00:01:00.570> than<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.899> ones<00:01:01.079> with<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.289> bar

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
much better than the ones with the bar

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
much better than the ones with the bar
that<00:01:01.770> goes<00:01:01.800> back<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.219> forth<00:01:02.449> but<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.690> you're

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
that goes back and forth but what you're

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.810 
that goes back and forth but what you're
going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.290> place<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.830> bowl<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.400> your

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
going to do is place the bowl or your

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.700 
going to do is place the bowl or your
plate<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.330> top<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> scale<00:01:07.260> before<00:01:07.619> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
plate on top of the scale before you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.760 
plate on top of the scale before you
turn<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.450> then<00:01:09.450> turn<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.650> way

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
turn it on then turn it on so that way

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
turn it on then turn it on so that way
it's<00:01:11.070> zeroed<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.640> before<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> put<00:01:12.150> any<00:01:12.450> food

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
it's zeroed out before you put any food

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.020 
it's zeroed out before you put any food
in<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> bowl<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.890> reason<00:01:14.250> why<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.430> because<00:01:14.790> if

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
in the bowl the reason why is because if

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.370 
in the bowl the reason why is because if
you<00:01:15.150> add<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.049> bowl<00:01:17.210> after<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.990> turn<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> on

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you add the bowl after you turn it on

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.660 
you add the bowl after you turn it on
it's<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> measurement<00:01:20.580> of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
it's going to take the measurement of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
it's going to take the measurement of
the<00:01:20.759> bowl<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.420> food<00:01:21.630> together<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.560> then

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the bowl and the food together and then

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.200 
the bowl and the food together and then
it's<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.340> very<00:01:23.700> accurate<00:01:24.119> at

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
it's not going to be very accurate at

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.480 
it's not going to be very accurate at
all<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> digital<00:01:25.710> scale<00:01:25.890> measures<00:01:26.310> in

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
all but the digital scale measures in

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030 
all but the digital scale measures in
grams<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.689> measures<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.200> ounces<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.799> you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
grams and it measures and ounces and you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.069 
grams and it measures and ounces and you
can<00:01:29.189> switch<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.729> ounces<00:01:30.090> by<00:01:30.329> pushing<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.810> unit

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
can switch to ounces by pushing the unit

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.600 
can switch to ounces by pushing the unit
button<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:32.689> measure<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:33.900> meats<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.350> ounces<00:01:34.770> but

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
button I measure my meats and ounces but

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
button I measure my meats and ounces but
you<00:01:35.759> could<00:01:35.909> also<00:01:36.030> measure<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.720> grams<00:01:37.020> if

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you could also measure it in grams if

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.819 
you could also measure it in grams if
you<00:01:37.290> wanted<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.570> its<00:01:39.960> measured<00:01:40.170> out<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> 0

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
you wanted to so its measured out to 0

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.770 
you wanted to so its measured out to 0
grams<00:01:41.220> right<00:01:41.490> now<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.939> what<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:42.659> gonna

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
grams right now and what I'm gonna

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.429 
grams right now and what I'm gonna
measure<00:01:42.990> today<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:44.430> raw<00:01:44.640> almond<00:01:45.439> these

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
measure today is just raw almond these

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.410 
measure today is just raw almond these
are<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:46.710> raw<00:01:46.920> shelled<00:01:47.420> california-grown

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
are just raw shelled california-grown

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.219 
are just raw shelled california-grown
almond<00:01:49.939> and<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> back<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.990> look<00:01:52.110> at

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229

that nutrition label this is really

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.899

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.460 
5 grams of carbs and 6 grams of protein
and<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.450> whole<00:02:09.720> bag<00:02:09.989> you'll<00:02:10.289> see

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and then in this whole bag you'll see

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.550 
and then in this whole bag you'll see
that<00:02:10.619> there's<00:02:10.830> 16<00:02:11.400> servings<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.720> multiply<00:02:13.230> all

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
that there's 16 servings so multiply all

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.710 
that there's 16 servings so multiply all
numbers<00:02:14.010> by<00:02:14.190> sixteen<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.819> that's<00:02:15.360> how<00:02:15.540> many

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
numbers by sixteen and that's how many

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.589 
numbers by sixteen and that's how many
calories<00:02:15.870> would<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.650> entire<00:02:17.580> bag<00:02:17.940> but

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
calories would be in that entire bag but

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.400 
calories would be in that entire bag but
we're<00:02:18.810> not<00:02:18.900> going<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.110> measure<00:02:19.200> out<00:02:19.380> the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
we're not going to measure out the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.900 
we're not going to measure out the
entire<00:02:19.709> bag<00:02:19.920> today<00:02:20.190> we're<00:02:20.430> gonna<00:02:20.610> measure<00:02:20.790> out

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
entire bag today we're gonna measure out

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.780 
entire bag today we're gonna measure out
one<00:02:21.090> serving<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:22.620> we're<00:02:23.370> gonna<00:02:23.459> measure<00:02:23.640> out

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
one serving so we're gonna measure out

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:47.180 
one serving so we're gonna measure out
28<00:02:24.270> grams<00:02:42.980> about<00:02:43.980> one<00:02:44.400> more<00:02:44.610> maybe<00:02:44.790> two<00:02:46.190> more

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
28 grams about one more maybe two more

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.039 
28 grams about one more maybe two more
okay<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.780> we've<00:02:48.900> got<00:02:48.959> 28<00:02:49.590> grams<00:02:50.330> that's<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.600> 29

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
okay so we've got 28 grams that's the 29

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.830 
okay so we've got 28 grams that's the 29
now<00:02:52.260> but<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.920> get<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.160> idea<00:02:53.269> there<00:02:54.269> isn't

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
now but you get the idea there isn't

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.630 
now but you get the idea there isn't
very<00:02:54.900> many<00:02:55.380> almonds<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:55.980> there's<00:02:56.190> probably

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
very many almonds in there's probably

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.240 
very many almonds in there's probably
about<00:02:56.760> 20<00:02:57.269> or<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.349> it's<00:02:58.620> really<00:02:58.830> good<00:02:59.220> to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
about 20 or so so it's really good to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.589 
about 20 or so so it's really good to
kind<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:02.280> curiosity<00:03:02.849> purposes<00:03:03.299> and

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
kind of just for curiosity purposes and

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.420 
kind of just for curiosity purposes and
if<00:03:03.900> you're<00:03:04.080> really<00:03:04.349> trying<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.920> make<00:03:05.220> some

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
if you're really trying to make some

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.490 
if you're really trying to make some
changes<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.849> your<00:03:05.940> body<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.900> measure<00:03:07.170> out<00:03:07.349> your

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
changes in your body to measure out your

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.320 
changes in your body to measure out your
food<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:07.890> can<00:03:08.040> see<00:03:08.280> what<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> serving<00:03:09.150> size

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
food so you can see what a serving size

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.350 
food so you can see what a serving size
is<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.290> less<00:03:10.470> than<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.680> handful<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.360> you

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
is this is less than a handful and you

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.970 
is this is less than a handful and you
know<00:03:12.450> facts<00:03:13.049> especially<00:03:13.230> with<00:03:13.739> higher

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
know facts especially with higher

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.979 
know facts especially with higher
calorie<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.760> very<00:03:14.940> dense<00:03:15.120> foods<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
calorie and very dense foods the

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.580 
calorie and very dense foods the
calories<00:03:16.290> can<00:03:16.440> out<00:03:16.530> very<00:03:16.769> quickly<00:03:17.329> so<00:03:18.590> if

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
calories can out very quickly so if

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.410 
calories can out very quickly so if
