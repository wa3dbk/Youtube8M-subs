secretly using this two little wheels

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.190 
secretly using this two little wheels
choose<00:01:40.310> where<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.340> want<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.850> send<00:01:42.720> our<00:01:42.960> little

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.940 
choose where we want to send our little
just<00:01:43.440> Cal<00:01:43.920> test<00:01:44.160> okay<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:45.000> shortest<00:01:45.540> follow

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
just Cal test okay the shortest follow

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.800 
just Cal test okay the shortest follow
the<00:01:46.950> stairs<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.150> at<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.390> beginning<00:01:48.510> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the stairs here so at the beginning of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
the stairs here so at the beginning of
the<00:01:48.900> game<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.230> go<00:01:49.580> anywhere<00:01:50.580> but<00:01:50.850> then

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the game they can go anywhere but then

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.560 
the game they can go anywhere but then
they<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.780> only<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.260> to<00:01:52.290> three<00:01:53.010> other<00:01:53.480> so<00:01:54.480> we

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
they can only go to three other so we

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.270 
they can only go to three other so we
have<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.960> coaches<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.770> top<00:01:55.980> dial

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
have the coaches this is the top dial

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.090 
have the coaches this is the top dial
and<00:01:56.580> then<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.420> offspring<00:01:57.930> would<00:01:58.080> be<00:01:58.200> that's

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and then the offspring would be that's

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.420 
and then the offspring would be that's
it

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
it

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.850 
it
and<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.240> there's<00:02:01.610> six<00:02:03.050> location<00:02:04.050> on<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.710> main

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and so there's six location on the main

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.940 
and so there's six location on the main
board<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.610> library<00:02:06.090> decrypt<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:07.230> laboratory

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
board the library decrypt the laboratory

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.830 
board the library decrypt the laboratory
the<00:02:08.130> observatory<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.090> garden<00:02:09.480> and<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the observatory the garden and the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.730 
the observatory the garden and the
museum<00:02:10.260> and<00:02:10.560> there's<00:02:11.040> also<00:02:11.660> an<00:02:12.660> outdoor<00:02:14.420> place

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
museum and there's also an outdoor place

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.310 
museum and there's also an outdoor place
which<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:17.010> actually<00:02:17.550> actually<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.320> four

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
which is actually actually one of four

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.020 
which is actually actually one of four
different<00:02:19.560> one<00:02:19.950> okay<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.670> have<00:02:20.820> one

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
different one okay you have one

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.280 
different one okay you have one
different<00:02:21.540> fall<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.590> each<00:02:22.710> game<00:02:23.270> so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
different fall in the in each game so

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.050 
different fall in the in each game so
first<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.530> choose<00:02:25.740> where<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.130> send<00:02:26.970> your

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
first you choose where you send your

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.510 
first you choose where you send your
little<00:02:27.300> contest<00:02:27.540> then<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.800> choose<00:02:29.220> what<00:02:29.460> you

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
little contest then you choose what you

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.790 
little contest then you choose what you
want<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.820> spoon<00:02:30.120> your<00:02:30.510> offspring<00:02:30.810> okay

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
want to spoon your offspring okay

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.760 
want to spoon your offspring okay
so<00:02:32.040> basically<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.820> try<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.060> guess<00:02:33.530> where<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
so basically you try to guess where the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.520 
so basically you try to guess where the
other<00:02:34.950> people<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.940> make<00:02:36.450> sense<00:02:36.690> are<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.410> to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
other people and make sense are going to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.000 
other people and make sense are going to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
go and spawn the offspring there

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.580 
go and spawn the offspring there
yeah<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.610> try<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.910> go<00:02:42.180> where<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.410> other

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.260 
yeah and you try to go where the other
player<00:02:44.010> don't<00:02:44.310> think<00:02:44.550> you're<00:02:44.670> gonna<00:02:44.760> go<00:02:45.000> so

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
player don't think you're gonna go so

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.650 
player don't think you're gonna go so
you<00:02:46.020> are<00:02:46.550> there's<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> lot<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.790> double<00:02:48.300> guessing

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
you are there's a lot of double guessing

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.229 
you are there's a lot of double guessing
and<00:02:49.020> running<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.970> then<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:51.989> all<00:02:52.200> reveal<00:02:53.239> what

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
and running so then we all reveal what

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.670 
and running so then we all reveal what
we<00:02:54.360> chose<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:55.220> we<00:02:56.330> move<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.510> pounds<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.140> we

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
we chose and we move the pounds and we

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.590 
we chose and we move the pounds and we
see<00:02:58.860> what<00:02:59.010> happens<00:02:59.370> let's<00:02:59.910> make<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.360> little

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
see what happens let's make a little

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.230 
see what happens let's make a little
eggs

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
eggs

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.730 
eggs
yeah<00:03:02.100> yeah<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.520> yeah<00:03:04.240> yeah<00:03:04.510> perfect

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
yeah yeah and yeah yeah perfect

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.780 
yeah yeah and yeah yeah perfect
so<00:03:06.310> if<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.880> are<00:03:07.030> alone<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.810> room<00:03:08.550> it's<00:03:09.550> quite

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
so if you are alone in a room it's quite

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.400 
so if you are alone in a room it's quite
easy<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.180> get<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.480> take<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.660> companions<00:03:11.230> in

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
easy you get to take the companions in

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.270 
easy you get to take the companions in
front<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.740> you<00:03:11.830> okay<00:03:12.660> if<00:03:14.010> there's<00:03:16.650> one<00:03:17.650> or<00:03:17.920> more

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
offspring then you try to negotiate

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.210 
offspring then you try to negotiate
it's<00:03:52.570> either<00:03:52.810> everybody<00:03:53.650> agrees<00:03:54.190> that

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
it's either everybody agrees that

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.050

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
one of you will get the components Oh

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.010 
one of you will get the components Oh
nobody<00:04:02.110> agrees<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.800> then<00:04:03.130> everyone<00:04:03.730> lose<00:04:04.570> one

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020

nobody agrees and then everyone lose one
Cal<00:04:05.320> points<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:06.070> why<00:04:06.220> would<00:04:06.400> one<00:04:06.520> player<00:04:06.760> agree

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
Cal points so why would one player agree

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.760 
Cal points so why would one player agree
to<00:04:07.390> give<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.690> component<00:04:08.110> to<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.260> other<00:04:08.410> for

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
to give the component to the other for

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.710 
to give the component to the other for
example<00:04:09.190> if<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.580> are<00:04:09.760> really<00:04:10.120> low<00:04:10.450> on

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
example if you are really low on

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.810 
example if you are really low on
components<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.710> I'm<00:04:11.980> not<00:04:12.160> going<00:04:12.490> to<00:04:12.550> take<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
components and I'm not going to take the

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.150 
components and I'm not going to take the
damage<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.540> I'm<00:04:13.870> not<00:04:14.080> I<00:04:14.110> would<00:04:14.500> say<00:04:14.680> I'll<00:04:14.920> take

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
damage and I'm not I would say I'll take

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.039 
damage and I'm not I would say I'll take
the<00:04:15.280> component<00:04:15.760> all<00:04:15.940> will<00:04:16.570> agree<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.840> disagree

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
the component all will agree to disagree

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.430 
the component all will agree to disagree
and<00:04:17.470> we'll<00:04:17.650> both<00:04:17.770> lose<00:04:18.430> usually<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.480> can<00:04:20.230> afford

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
and we'll both lose usually I can afford

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.620 
and we'll both lose usually I can afford
to<00:04:20.620> lose<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.799> you<00:04:21.160> can<00:04:21.460> maybe<00:04:22.240> you<00:04:22.360> should<00:04:22.540> make

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
to lose it you can maybe you should make

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.250 
to lose it you can maybe you should make
a<00:04:22.690> deal<00:04:22.930> that's<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.560> exactly

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
a deal that's it exactly

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.610 
a deal that's it exactly
now<00:04:26.260> we<00:04:26.890> can<00:04:27.040> also<00:04:27.250> go<00:04:27.580> over<00:04:28.330> there<00:04:28.630> okay<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:29.290> do

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
now we can also go over there okay to do

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.230 
now we can also go over there okay to do
so<00:04:29.790> we<00:04:30.790> want<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.470> point<00:04:32.470> both<00:04:32.800> arrows<00:04:33.220> at<00:04:34.000> the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
so we want to point both arrows at the

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.090 
so we want to point both arrows at the
same<00:04:34.420> location<00:04:34.870> it<00:04:35.470> doesn't<00:04:35.800> matter<00:04:35.920> where

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
same location it doesn't matter where

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.290 
same location it doesn't matter where
it's<00:04:36.190> just<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.490> they<00:04:36.580> are<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.790> same<00:04:36.970> if<00:04:37.240> we

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
it's just that they are the same if we

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.380 
it's just that they are the same if we
do<00:04:37.600> so<00:04:37.870> our<00:04:38.590> contest<00:04:39.100> is<00:04:39.250> just<00:04:39.430> teleports<00:04:40.180> over

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
do so our contest is just teleports over

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.070 
do so our contest is just teleports over
there<00:04:41.070> but<00:04:42.070> we<00:04:42.220> don't<00:04:42.370> get<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:43.030> place<00:04:43.630> our

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
there but we don't get to place our

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.040 
there but we don't get to place our
offering<00:04:44.620> this<00:04:44.770> time<00:04:45.360> okay<00:04:46.360> makes<00:04:46.660> it<00:04:46.750> easier

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
offering this time okay makes it easier

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.690 
offering this time okay makes it easier
for<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.290> other<00:04:47.320> other

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
for the other other

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.030 
for the other other
there<00:04:49.360> we<00:04:49.570> can<00:04:49.720> take<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.020> silver<00:04:50.740> key

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
there we can take the silver key

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.660 
there we can take the silver key
