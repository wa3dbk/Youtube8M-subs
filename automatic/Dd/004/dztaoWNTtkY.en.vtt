powershot<00:00:46.540> is<00:00:46.990> a<00:00:47.020> 24<00:00:47.560> millimeter<00:00:47.770> so<00:00:48.580> what

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
powershot is a 24 millimeter so what

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.400 
powershot is a 24 millimeter so what
exactly<00:00:48.880> does<00:00:49.300> it<00:00:49.360> does<00:00:49.630> you<00:00:50.110> know<00:00:50.230> for

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
exactly does it does you know for

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.870 
exactly does it does you know for

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
now with a wide-angle lens you can

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.719 
now with a wide-angle lens you can
actually<00:01:04.600> go<00:01:04.869> in<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.979> know<00:01:06.100> like<00:01:06.310> half<00:01:06.579> the

there's<00:01:08.229> 24<00:01:08.619> millimetres<00:01:09.130> they<00:01:09.280> have<00:01:09.369> 26

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
there's 24 millimetres they have 26

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.480 
there's 24 millimetres they have 26
millimeters<00:01:10.420> but<00:01:10.689> I<00:01:10.979> would<00:01:11.979> recommend<00:01:12.369> at

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
millimeters but I would recommend at

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.460 
millimeters but I would recommend at
least<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.759> 24<00:01:13.210> millimetres<00:01:13.840> just<00:01:14.110> like<00:01:14.229> this

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
least a 24 millimetres just like this

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.180 
least a 24 millimetres just like this
camera<00:01:14.680> is<00:01:15.630> another<00:01:16.630> thing<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:17.170> audio<00:01:17.950> you

an excellent job

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.590 
an excellent job
another<00:01:42.100> thing<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:42.610> let's<00:01:43.450> see<00:01:43.570> here

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
another thing is let's see here

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.780 
another thing is let's see here
optical<00:01:46.600> image<00:01:47.080> stabilization<00:01:47.790> you

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
optical image stabilization you

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.550 
optical image stabilization you
definitely<00:01:49.299> need<00:01:49.450> not<00:01:49.600> see<00:01:49.960> that<00:01:50.140> now<00:01:50.350> what

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
definitely need not see that now what

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.560 
definitely need not see that now what
exactly<00:01:50.650> is<00:01:51.070> that<00:01:51.159> basically<00:01:52.060> what<00:01:52.210> that<00:01:52.240> is

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
exactly is that basically what that is

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.450 
exactly is that basically what that is
is<00:01:52.869> let's<00:01:53.530> say<00:01:53.650> you<00:01:53.740> like<00:01:53.890> recording<00:01:54.340> and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
is let's say you like recording and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.859 
is let's say you like recording and
you're<00:01:54.580> walking<00:01:54.760> what<00:01:55.510> that<00:01:55.659> would<00:01:55.780> basically

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
you're walking what that would basically

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.830 
you're walking what that would basically
do<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.560> smooth<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.340> out<00:01:57.400> so<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.390> way<00:01:58.570> doesn't

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
do is smooth it out so this way doesn't

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.390 
do is smooth it out so this way doesn't
show<00:01:58.990> anything<00:01:59.290> like<00:01:59.619> too<00:01:59.799> bumpy<00:02:00.040> or<00:02:00.189> anything

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
show anything like too bumpy or anything

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.120 
show anything like too bumpy or anything
like<00:02:00.610> that<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:01.960> also<00:02:02.530> want<00:02:02.920> something

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
like that so you also want something

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.380 
like that so you also want something
