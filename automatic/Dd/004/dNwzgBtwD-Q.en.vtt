 special 500 rose the truth has I been 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.590
 quite past that number that 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.080
 we did very quickly thank you 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.699
 again and so I have taken advantage of it 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.400
 to do it also the video has 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.269
 make a special of a kind of 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.560
 special video 100 and 500 subscribers 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.150
 so we 're going to see you there 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.859
 your screens in your in the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.640
 title of the video that is about the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.530
 creation of a clan clan a clan 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.930
 competitive is mike to go wrong 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.670
 is maite sp if there is no better name 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.559
 I know that name is not too good 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.870
 but good if you have any idea 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.539
 suggested and good then what is going to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.469
 consist this well as you can 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.379
 imagine will try to be a clan 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.360
 where good players who are still in 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.010
 channel or that are subscribed or that are 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.660
 mike players are going to be able to 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.390
 demonstrate your skills and go to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.040
 be able to participate in tournaments to play 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.310
 with people is a level and good 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.890
 have fun not at the end 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.170
 How will the whole process work? 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.079
 well what you have to do if you have and 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.090
 if you want to participate if you think that 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.250
 you have enough qualities because 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.930
 obviously everyone knows how good 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.759
 is and obviously does not need to be a 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.799
 genius of evil does not need to be the best 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.119
 of the world because if not probably already 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.729
 you would be in another clan winning 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.539
 competitions but yes to have a 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.310
 a certain level is what is needed 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.659
 Well, as I say if you think you have that 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.369
 level the only thing you have to do is 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.350
 send me a private message on youtube 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.479
 private attention do not put it in the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.000
 comments because you can not put it in 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.970
 the comments but you also have me 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.630
 send a private message on youtube 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.789
 where the subject is inscription 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.189
 to candice fashion and all clan entry 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.549
 of smile and where I put what is 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.649
 your username of the smile and your 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.830
 skype if you do not have is to fall for bonilla 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.200
 and I would talk as it goes 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.259
 well then when I go receiving the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.060
 messages I will talk to you and I will do 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.440
 some tests in what will consist the 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.510
 tests then nothing complicated not you 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.970
 you scare only because they are going to be 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.310
 the games with me and with two friends 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.049
 that they are going to help me that they are melo alexi and 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.480
 johnny you are two good players of the 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.530
 poorly play a few games and maybe to 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.959
 make a kind of battle good 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.060
 between johnny for example and you but 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.010
 do not panic because it is not any 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.900
 tremendous challenge in nothing that you can not 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.239
 overcome if you are a good guy not 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.940
 basically if only after then 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.819
 we will evaluate if there are many 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.129
 participants or few, well, well, 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.629
 who will see who we catch the 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.840
 requirements to enter would only be 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:53.120
 have a level between 25 and 30 more 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.150
 pulling to 30 for good to be able to participate 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.980
 in rne that are leagues and can also 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.579
 so practice individually for 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.849
 for good for future competitions and 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.470
 I say to that level 25 23 then it 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.790
 can enter because we're going to be 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.560
 weeks in which obviously not 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.079
 let's compete we will not be 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.760
 seriously so to speak with which 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.510
 you can enter and have also 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.060
 some gods in 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.579
 good in another one not to also be able to 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.220
 participate in leagues are 12 but if 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.599
 you have 10 so it also works, that is, in that 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.239
 margin we're not going to get very 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.780
 strict because good because it does not 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.700
 I miss no other thing the country does not matter 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.500
 it does not matter if you are from Spain I am from Peru 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.079
 If I'm from Argentina, if I'm from Mexico 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.329
 but we will have to put some 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.280
 common schedules not for example about 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.299
 all the people of Latin America 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.250
 Obviously, he's going to have to 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.340
 to adjust a little to the schedules for 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.290
 to be able to play with the grain people and 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.000
 well, that's basically everything 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.099
 send applications if you want 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.459
 accomplices of the requirements that I am what 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.859
 pretty good and basically good at 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.540
 what will the plan consist of or what does it have 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.060
 It's good to join this clan because 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.290
 you should unite them to this clan and good 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.049
 because you are going to do if you are 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.459
 investigate then basically what we're going 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.269
 to do at the beginning what we intend 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.120
 is to have a group of good people who 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.280
 can play with each other and then 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.079
 have fun and practice 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.579
 I mean you are going to connect 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.139
 you are going to see how many people the clan is 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.000
 connected you will be able to play with them 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.910
 If not then not if you do not feel like it 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.340
 play and well then you are going to be able to 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.720
 that practical way to create links 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:36.330
 and then create a clan and where each 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.120
 one knows what he wants and not what 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.160
 know how to do and know more or less then play 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.180
 with your classmates 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.950
 after a few weeks or months of 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.560
 preparation let's start to participate 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.880
 in tournaments obviously we will not go to 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.980
 a face-to-face USA tournament in the 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.020
 first month because it would be impossible but 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.130
 yes what tournaments that organizes is maite or 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.100
 other websites for example end of 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.660
 week in which your Saturday and a Sunday 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.670
 same is one hour each day with which 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.650
 we are going to be able to participate there go 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.210
 moving forward and in this way then make us 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.280
 a gap in the competitive world of 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.590
 smith that is growing pretty me 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.120
 I think it's quite worth it because 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.320
 one of them to this dog to another 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.820
 all right 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.200
 if you join this clan as it is a clan 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.270
 that will be directly related 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.180
 with the channel you are going to have a public already 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.150
 that will be encouraging you will be 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.430
 well then waiting and will be 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.650
 Well, it is dependent on you 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.240
 because I'm going to upload many of the 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.160
 games that you play I will go 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.530
 presenting and it's going to be a kind of 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.750
 clan that is very close to the channel no no 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.510
 we will leave it aside but it is going to 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.400
 be a clan that really has a 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.930
 paper in the channel so that's 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.580
 basically everything is being done to me very 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.990
 long the video but I do not care 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.210
 because I really think it's a 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.130
 very interesting topic and that you can 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.720
 interesting enough as I tell you in 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.550
 send me requests do not be afraid 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.040
 because maybe saying good is not that I 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.630
 I 'm not really good but yes 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.310
 that you can be, no, you do not need 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.140
 nor as god to be a teacher 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.660
 only then have a little bit of 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.980
 practice a little bit of skill 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.290
 obviously if I am level 5 and just 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.890
 start then let some time pass 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:19.380
 because well, the level is going to be a 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.790
 little bit high and that's basically everything 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.230
 I do not expect that you liked the idea that 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.630
 you participate so much you asked me 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.150
 so let's see if it is now reflected in the 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.040
 the messages that you send me in the 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.540
 participation and nothing I hope has 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.590
 liked and you are enjoying is maite 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.590
 until another goodbye
