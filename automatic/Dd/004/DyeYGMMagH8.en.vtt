00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
going to do so the big question the ban

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.060

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.070 

it's<00:02:49.360> because<00:02:50.360> government<00:02:50.690> didn't<00:02:50.870> like<00:02:50.900> the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
it's because government didn't like the
