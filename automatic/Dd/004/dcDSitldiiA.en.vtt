00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
lot of potential and I think this the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.710 
lot of potential and I think this the
shield<00:02:22.489> are<00:02:22.730> just<00:02:22.910> losing<00:02:23.180> some<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:23.570> their

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.770 
Ambrose has got a lot of potential and I
just<00:02:30.920> think<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.250> know<00:02:31.400> right<00:02:32.269> now<00:02:32.480> at<00:02:32.660> this

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
just think you know right now at this

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.390 
just think you know right now at this
pay-per-view<00:02:32.989> it<00:02:33.590> would<00:02:33.769> be<00:02:33.860> better<00:02:34.040> for<00:02:34.160> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
pay-per-view it would be better for the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.420 
pay-per-view it would be better for the
you<00:02:35.360> know<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.750> shield<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.769> retain<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.190> tag

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
you know the shield to retain the tag

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.310 
you know the shield to retain the tag
titles<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:38.000> have<00:02:38.030> Dean<00:02:38.330> lose<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.810> title<00:02:39.170> and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
titles that have Dean lose the title and

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.810 
titles that have Dean lose the title and
I<00:02:39.950> don't<00:02:40.100> necessarily<00:02:40.220> want<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.580> see<00:02:40.730> him

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
I don't necessarily want to see him

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.090 
I don't necessarily want to see him
break<00:02:41.030> up<00:02:41.209> just<00:02:41.450> yet<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.930> was<00:02:42.560> still<00:02:42.620> one<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.010> the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
break up just yet I was still one of the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.350 
break up just yet I was still one of the
people<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.400> wanted<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.790> see<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.120> shield

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
break up before they ever lost like so

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.490 
break up before they ever lost like so
they<00:02:47.180> could<00:02:47.330> come<00:02:47.480> in<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.660> be<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:47.900> we<00:02:48.410> were

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
the title oh the one they face they face

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.390 
the title oh the one they face they face
to<00:03:12.140> use<00:03:12.260> those<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.590> pre-show<00:03:12.890> last<00:03:13.190> month

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
to use those of the pre-show last month

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.580 
to use those of the pre-show last month
right<00:03:14.060> that's<00:03:14.269> when<00:03:14.450> they<00:03:14.690> apparently<00:03:15.290> the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
right that's when they apparently the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.840 
right that's when they apparently the
match<00:03:15.739> was<00:03:15.920> like<00:03:16.040> praise<00:03:16.340> because<00:03:16.579> it<00:03:16.730> was<00:03:16.820> a

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
match was like praise because it was a

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.460 
match was like praise because it was a
really<00:03:17.000> good<00:03:17.209> man<00:03:17.420> oh<00:03:17.630> yeah<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:17.989> remember

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
really good man oh yeah I remember

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.319 
really good man oh yeah I remember
watching<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.549> was<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.700> little<00:03:20.090> slower

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
watching it and it was a little slower

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.580 
watching it and it was a little slower
to<00:03:20.420> get<00:03:20.570> started<00:03:20.840> but<00:03:20.959> by<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.200> enemy<00:03:21.500> like

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
to get started but by the enemy like

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.440 
to get started but by the enemy like
okay<00:03:21.920> yeah<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.400> was<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.579> pretty<00:03:22.850> decent<00:03:23.299> match

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
okay yeah that was a pretty decent match

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.910 
okay yeah that was a pretty decent match
um<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.130> think<00:03:25.489> it<00:03:25.670> all<00:03:25.760> depends<00:03:26.030> who<00:03:26.209> v<00:03:26.920> their

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
um so I think it all depends who v their

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.380 
um so I think it all depends who v their
shield<00:03:28.190> was<00:03:28.340> gonna<00:03:28.519> face<00:03:28.730> for<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.970> tag<00:03:29.150> titles

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
shield was gonna face for the tag titles

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.420 
shield was gonna face for the tag titles
I<00:03:29.780> think<00:03:30.290> if<00:03:30.410> they're<00:03:30.590> going<00:03:30.829> up<00:03:30.920> against<00:03:31.340> the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
I think if they're going up against the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.580 
I think if they're going up against the
Usos<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:32.060> would<00:03:32.209> see<00:03:32.390> in<00:03:32.480> retaining<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.110> then<00:03:33.530> I

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
Usos I would see in retaining and then I

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.170 
Usos I would see in retaining and then I
would<00:03:33.709> see<00:03:33.829> Dean<00:03:34.040> Ambrose<00:03:34.370> retaining<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.970> if

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
would see Dean Ambrose retaining to if

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.000 
would see Dean Ambrose retaining to if
they're<00:03:35.660> going<00:03:35.840> up<00:03:36.019> against<00:03:36.230> like<00:03:36.350> Mark<00:03:36.620> Henry

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
they're going up against like Mark Henry

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.819 
they're going up against like Mark Henry
in<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.430> you<00:03:38.030> know<00:03:38.120> Big<00:03:38.390> Show<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:38.959> could<00:03:39.650> see

title and you know we'll see where we go
from<00:04:23.420> there<00:04:23.780> but<00:04:23.900> definitely<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.980> thing<00:04:25.190> you

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
from there but definitely the thing you

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.890 
from there but definitely the thing you
want<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.520> watch<00:04:25.670> out<00:04:25.910> for<00:04:25.940> is<00:04:26.300> maybe<00:04:26.570> some

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
want to watch out for is maybe some

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.170

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
interference it is an hour long so the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.910 
interference it is an hour long so the
question<00:04:29.510> is<00:04:29.600> are<00:04:29.810> we<00:04:29.870> going<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.500> get<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.620> longer

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
question is are we going to get a longer
