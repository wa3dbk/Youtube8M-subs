is this is the original sculpture the
piece<00:00:39.260> that<00:00:39.379> was<00:00:39.500> molded<00:00:39.949> and<00:00:40.100> then<00:00:40.879> has<00:00:41.000> been

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
piece that was molded and then has been

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.689 
piece that was molded and then has been
produced<00:00:41.570> as<00:00:43.120> as<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.180> fiber<00:00:44.720> glass<00:00:44.989> sculpture

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
produced as as a fiber glass sculpture

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.479 
produced as as a fiber glass sculpture
for<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:46.760> Moline<00:00:47.150> process<00:00:47.600> we<00:00:47.839> have<00:00:47.930> there

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
for the Moline process we have there

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.139 
for the Moline process we have there
basically<00:00:49.930> gets<00:00:50.930> all<00:00:51.909> everything<00:00:52.909> has<00:00:53.030> to

basically gets all everything has to

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.450 
basically gets all everything has to
come<00:00:53.210> apart<00:00:53.629> to<00:00:53.809> be<00:00:53.930> more<00:00:54.110> than<00:00:54.320> so

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
come apart to be more than so

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.280 
come apart to be more than so

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
themselves sometimes a motivation for

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.060 
themselves sometimes a motivation for
other<00:01:52.420> work<00:01:52.659> it<00:01:52.900> depends<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.470> know<00:01:53.500> but<00:01:53.950> it's

when<00:01:58.509> it<00:01:58.630> was<00:01:58.720> molded<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.470> be<00:01:59.650> reproduced

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
when it was molded to be reproduced

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.640 
when it was molded to be reproduced
everything<00:02:01.270> was<00:02:01.390> molded<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:01.990> was<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.140> mold<00:02:02.440> that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
everything was molded it was a mold that

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.200 
everything was molded it was a mold that
hasn't<00:02:02.860> tabletops<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:03.729> bones

hasn't tabletops and bones

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.560 
hasn't tabletops and bones
there's<00:02:04.869> molds<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.320> big<00:02:05.650> molds<00:02:06.070> of<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.190> body

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
there's molds of big molds of the body

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.330 
there's molds of big molds of the body
and<00:02:07.570> that's<00:02:07.690> why<00:02:07.869> it<00:02:08.050> was<00:02:08.259> dissembled<00:02:08.890> you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
and that's why it was dissembled you

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.490 
and that's why it was dissembled you
know<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:10.300> was<00:02:10.420> originally<00:02:10.750> taken<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:11.110> pieces

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
know it was originally taken to pieces

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.650 
know it was originally taken to pieces
so<00:02:11.709> but<00:02:11.890> all<00:02:12.250> these<00:02:12.340> individual<00:02:12.760> parts<00:02:13.060> could

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
so but all these individual parts could

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.040 
so but all these individual parts could
be<00:02:13.720> molded<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.770> then<00:02:15.730> reassembled<00:02:16.390> when<00:02:16.930> we

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
be molded and then reassembled when we

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.210 
be molded and then reassembled when we
may<00:02:17.170> get<00:02:17.350> your<00:02:17.500> sculpture

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.490 

so

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.910 
description I mean thinking about the
other<00:02:55.370> pieces<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.879> relates<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.590> yeah<00:02:57.590> it's

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
other pieces it relates to yeah it's

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.210 
other pieces it relates to yeah it's
usually<00:02:58.129> debauchery<00:02:58.879> leading<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.690> chaos<00:03:00.220> at

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
usually debauchery leading to chaos at

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.680 
usually debauchery leading to chaos at
the<00:03:01.340> same<00:03:01.519> time<00:03:01.700> from<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:01.940> technical<00:03:02.269> you<00:03:02.569> know

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
the same time from a technical you know

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.449 
the same time from a technical you know
having<00:03:02.989> worked<00:03:03.470> on<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:03.950> if<00:03:04.010> technical

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
having worked on it and if technical

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.490 
having worked on it and if technical
aspect<00:03:04.849> it's<00:03:05.420> very<00:03:05.720> organized

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
aspect it's very organized

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.160 
aspect it's very organized
I<00:03:06.650> guess<00:03:07.280> my<00:03:07.549> message<00:03:08.299> which<00:03:08.599> would<00:03:08.750> be<00:03:08.870> Paul

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
I guess my message which would be Paul

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.170 
I guess my message which would be Paul
will<00:03:09.319> take<00:03:09.500> like<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> snapshot<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.400> chaos<00:03:10.849> if

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
will take like a snapshot of chaos if

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.210 
will take like a snapshot of chaos if
you<00:03:11.239> like<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.450> disorder<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.230> then<00:03:12.859> he'll<00:03:13.069> want

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
you like a disorder and then he'll want

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.330 
you like a disorder and then he'll want
