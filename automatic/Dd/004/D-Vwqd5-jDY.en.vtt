00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.360
 old and do my voluntary 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.260
 ecological year on the school farm 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.260

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.640
 Toni feed and ask with the cows 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.859
 To tell explains to the children before that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.140
 how it works what is important on what 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.300
 We have to take care and if we have the cows with us 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.279
 have noticed the machine we go to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.510
 win the situation selection sometimes 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.340
 sometimes less 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.649
 and then we notice the completely from 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.710
 hand and can always try the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.420
 these taste 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.190
 i have been doing youth work for a long time and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.079
 I also wanted it in my 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.340
 do voluntary service and so on 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.469
 agriculture was something for me 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.680
 completely new where I have no 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.239
 had a clue and there she just had 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.399
 I do not know much new and 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.899
 Offered sexy and then too 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.149
 the Christian with on the farm 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.300
 that 's really easy for me 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.500
 only the right one was 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.720
 It was important for me to go after that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.180
 my abi was really something else 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.100
 I do not know right now on the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.350
 squat next bank and there one 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.640
 bit on land acidify but 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.900
 there really somehow as 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.909
 make meaningful and me still 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.659
 develop no new pages 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.860
 So getting to know each other can be special 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.840
 is actually the main thing the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.540
 children arrive as usual because 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.700
 you never know what's coming and going 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.409
 stole in the morning and think about what should be ours 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.909
 be made and then come the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.040
 Children or six o'clock here that works 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.079
 never or thinks very well there still can 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.790
 so much more can be done by children 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.000
 yes it is very nice all around it 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.250
 this usually works pretty well 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.110
 it then make the children it from the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.720
 day that is always one 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.070
 surprise 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.759
 the dafa closer to the first free 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.689
 opening 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.140
 but at the beginning what an incredibly exhausting 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:03.930
 time consuming and I have a long time 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:05.909
 used but now it has sometimes 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.439
 that you are unbelievable about the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.420
 Children can be annoyed if it is not so 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.430
 Do exactly what you want and then 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.510
 at another time during the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.250
 week or when they leave again 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.690
 then you notice everything thankfully 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.440
 somehow that's what you do and 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.819
 how much you invest in it and that 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.090
 returns an incredible and that 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.630
 So are the moving moments where we are 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.630
 just like never 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.170
 absolutely good at the fsj is that me 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.109
 here so many people and children know 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.569
 I learn so much too 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.670
 Learning about education is also allowed a lot 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.469
 discovered something new and that's just me 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.950
 So I'm enjoying a lot of outdoors 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:03:01.140
 very very close are the whole animal 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.849
 offered the in the yard if again 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.060
 new calf comes to the world or 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.670
 new where finished and then there 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.430
 can be and it always attracts 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.019
 very very extraordinary moments and 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.670
 For example, now I was at one 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.109
 cap the butter because it is too 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.519
 little bit but the calf is right

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.310
