that in these first three or four
measures<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.940> right<00:01:02.120> hand

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.660 

there's<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.300> cheese<00:01:51.780> saying<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.800> what<00:01:53.400> we<00:01:53.520> do

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
there's a cheese saying that what we do

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.500 
there's a cheese saying that what we do
with<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> middle<00:01:54.540> notes<00:01:54.840> build<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.440> up<00:01:55.890> by<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
with the middle notes build up up by a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.180 
with the middle notes build up up by a
half<00:01:57.510> step<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.229> bottom<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.740> those<00:01:58.890> down

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
half step and the bottom of those down

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:07.240 
half step and the bottom of those down
by<00:01:59.990> half<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.520> example<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.390> C<00:02:06.600> major

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
by half so for example in the C major

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.770 
by half so for example in the C major
there's<00:02:08.250> our<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.550> courses<00:02:09.030> genes<00:02:09.330> take<00:02:09.600> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
there's our one courses genes take the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.070 
there's our one courses genes take the
same<00:02:10.020> five<00:02:10.590> numbers<00:02:11.070> down<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.550> B<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.720> then<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
same five numbers down to B and then the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:22.510 
same five numbers down to B and then the
male<00:02:13.260> members<00:02:13.650> up<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:20.300> five<00:02:21.300> six<00:02:21.510> five<00:02:21.690> and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
male members up to five six five and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.470 
male members up to five six five and
then<00:02:23.520> one<00:02:24.650> good<00:02:25.650> listen<00:02:26.070> transpose<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.940> key

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
then one good listen transpose the key

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.820 
then one good listen transpose the key
of<00:02:27.600> F<00:02:27.750> major<00:02:28.010> here<00:02:30.140> now<00:02:31.140> what's<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.620> key

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
of F major here now what's in the key

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.500 
of F major here now what's in the key
signature<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.310> F<00:02:32.610> major<00:02:33.769> there's<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:35.269> flat<00:02:36.269> in

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
signature of F major there's a flat in

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.430 
signature of F major there's a flat in
it<00:02:36.630> right<00:02:36.870> one<00:02:37.769> flat<00:02:38.040> B<00:02:38.250> flat<00:02:38.280> there<00:02:39.050> so<00:02:40.050> if<00:02:40.260> I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
it right one flat B flat there so if I

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.940 
it right one flat B flat there so if I
change<00:02:41.250> my<00:02:41.430> C<00:02:41.640> signature<00:02:42.150> here<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.650> that's<00:02:43.860> a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
change my C signature here so that's a

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.850 
change my C signature here so that's a
major<00:02:46.519> there's<00:02:47.519> my<00:02:47.670> new<00:02:47.850> one<00:02:48.090> chord<00:02:48.390> here

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
major there's my new one chord here

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.640 
major there's my new one chord here
let's<00:02:49.860> see<00:02:49.980> my<00:02:50.100> new<00:02:50.250> one<00:02:50.430> for

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
let's see my new one for

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.140 

now<00:02:53.650> what's<00:02:53.830> my<00:02:53.890> five<00:02:54.220> six<00:02:54.459> five<00:02:54.640> core<00:02:54.970> gonna

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
now what's my five six five core gonna

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.569 
now what's my five six five core gonna
be<00:02:55.269> spelled<00:02:58.680> tell<00:02:59.680> me<00:02:59.799> how<00:02:59.920> I<00:02:59.950> spelled<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.400> five

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
be spelled tell me how I spelled it five

be spelled tell me how I spelled it five
six<00:03:00.730> five<00:03:04.860> five<00:03:07.349> six<00:03:08.349> five<00:03:15.840> actually

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:49.099 

let's<00:03:39.909> try<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:44.609> three<00:03:45.609> one<00:03:46.590> five<00:03:47.590> two<00:03:47.920> one

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
let's try that three one five two one

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:55.110 
let's try that three one five two one
five<00:03:50.109> three<00:03:50.139> one

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.550 

five<00:03:55.660> six<00:03:55.900> five<00:03:56.050> one<00:03:56.819> more<00:03:58.230> then<00:03:59.230> eyes<00:03:59.500> I<00:04:01.560> use

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
five six five one more then eyes I use

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:11.550 
five six five one more then eyes I use
the<00:04:02.680> Force<00:04:02.920> one<00:04:04.170> five<00:04:05.170> six<00:04:05.319> five<00:04:09.239> anytime<00:04:10.560> so

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
the Force one five six five anytime so

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.809 
the Force one five six five anytime so
you<00:04:11.680> can<00:04:11.830> do<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.010> without<00:04:12.190> even<00:04:12.400> thinking

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
you can do it without even thinking

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.060 
you can do it without even thinking
about<00:04:12.880> it
