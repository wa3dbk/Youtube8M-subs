00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.370
 the staff here on the starting lineup on the next 22nd year will not bring more 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.220
 convenience and ask for you ok 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.670
 lately I've played a lot 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.069
 very masters degree 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:14.429
 during that time, no 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.739
 I have learned to relax more in the session 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:19.609
 that is 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.110
 to prepare myself brothers 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.450
 and play more and enjoy more than the game is rolling so we 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.859
 will talk about it 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.599
 we will prepare 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:29.949
 and play more 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.679
 because it's important that you do it semester 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:34.580
 I do not work like this, Miguel. 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.720
 I like fish 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.860
 often mayor of books and northeast 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.360
 to prepare warmth rape seven years 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.370
 I did these things when you arrive in this game everything that happened in this game 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.840
 totally different 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840
 of what you had planned or for different paths 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.980
 that's where we can find the situation or sometimes the assignment 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.100
 of the player weighs exactly the way if he planned this one can also be thus the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.360
 predictable people a little bloated and such 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.430
 So I thought about it to reduce this work, but there's one more thing. 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.600
 Pleasurable to stop being such a job 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.100
 which pointed out I like to quote the fuel a suggestion 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.620
 for the masters who work the most for improvisation 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.290
 in the game 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.730
 So I've been doing something like this lately for a couple of years now. 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.410
 joÃ£o stock car begins to prepare are in a very simple and pass way 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.430
 by generic situations 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.430
 does not mean sometimes 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.130
 characters of the same that will work with the villain in the symbol 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.180
 eudes generous a city eg ps if you were not 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.060
 edition 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.880
 a combat scene 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.650
 f 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.310
 seven lines with a laser beam the year over from somewhere 'something like that 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.760
 so I think only one situation 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.370
 but I do not think 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.000
 I do not prepare 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.640
 the power movement this story to the end of this plot if you think only in the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.460
 problem you're going to put 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.789
 there the exotic cross character of the players 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.850
 6 5 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.029
 worry if weather will be said 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:16.039
 if the villain will be able to get in and pick them up at a certain place 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.130
 they just the most generic stuff right? 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.269
 I usually make a list of names 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.809
 genesis 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.029
 or sometimes when I'm out sometimes I do not even know just a list of names 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.949
 even at play time the way things go 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.649
 I'm putting 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.669
 The first tip is that of GM 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.419
 for similar situations that you think 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.649
 the references for its opening to stand out in the bottom of the network 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.819
 think of the problem and not of the solution 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.089
 the thinking in the solution that the players their work is not only in adventures 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:50.939
 of the signs that the same action average three days of action should all be 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:51.790
 solve 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.099
 this problem of the team will be put 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.439
 is the other thing is to focus on what is happening in the game 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.659
 there with your plans there I think it's happening to see the players 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.379
 are doing around here where any motivation of the characters he 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.529
 work with it 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:09.909
 working with history is happening now the story is now the 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.919
 moment of the game and not the one you thought 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.809
 The one you thought to be broken timidly leaves only structures 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.210
 ideas 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.379
 and need to happen in the game 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.459
 An improvisation tip if you pick up the game tape and do what 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.139
 is obvious 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.849
 another conclusion to any sequence colombia 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.179
 that situation 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:32.389
 want anyway 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.089
 Then you get more into the game. It gets more fun and I went more than I noticed. 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.939
 that 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.340
 It's those moments that when you fought in my game group, it's cool for me. 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.809
 I talked to the players, it's not 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.809
 focus on the characters players focused on the motivations 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:49.400
 milena 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 for players to find their character's motivation 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.319
 I need a publication thinking like source 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.810
 the Brazilian history 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.029
 of the characters is something that we pass decide to stop 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:06.349
 advent certain players each with a character will connect 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.729
 among them history 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.239
 I'll get out of there 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.329
 it's made much more fun 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.329
 the last tip is for who are the tips 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.530
 The guy is happening in history, focusing on each one. 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.809
 the last tip 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:23.159
 relax do not lose 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:26.419
 I think often people who are left seven enter the air 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.150
 the sameness gets tense full of rossetto life may be this not 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.750
 with this action may be something that goes on to 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.919
 offering 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.110
 I refuse your creativity to create situations at the time creates situations 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.180
 interesting 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.909
 rpb suppers 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.229
 if they did not hear it appeared the ball player 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.999
 my brother left now because they come to know that in the 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.290
 As far as you're going to have fun more prepared - he said 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.370
 He repeats but begins to 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.240
 so this is it pro today so skip the plans and programs nilton rock 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.029
 in haste on account 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.469
 and everyone should serve as an example and no one else
