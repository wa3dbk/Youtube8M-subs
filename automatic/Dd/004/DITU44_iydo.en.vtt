00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.790
 and then personal beauty in this video here I 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.300
 I will show the applications that comes the LG 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.730
 f60 and how to disable some releasing 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.060
 more internal memory or how you can 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.539
 see this folder here 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 several applications that I do not use 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:28.529
 those I caught peeking the movie are maps 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.399
 is the drive here in galt i do not use 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.280
 only a few then I will leave only 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.399
 Because I use it here with you, you can see 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.020
 which has only one page 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.180
 applications is to modify the pressure and 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.059
 if android it has bond with the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.329
 Tim operator in case of here come 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.030
 here the services chile tim a service 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.039
 Steam from chip 2 and not that hill 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.559
 applications with the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.440
 however in this case you are using a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.690
 Hi, okay, and I have to ask myself. 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.059
 if I bought here the functional tim 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.659
 This is how it works when you 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.549
 active internet here has here 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.119
 app updates 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.240
 so if you want you can download all 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.100
 the pecs are to consume more memory 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.549
 because many people here are 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.369
 applications that you do not need 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.009
 will use if you use some 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.170
 Tim highlight services I recommend 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.530
 You go down like this because they're 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 here instead of garden in the appliance 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.770
 they came here in case you want and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.390
 move combat 4 in aroma in 3 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.659
 they are game apps 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.689
 modified are not those big games 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.570
 is with more realistic graphics 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.240
 in case you want to download you can download them 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.270
 are the simplest staying games have here 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.640
 these then I will not upgrade because the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.479
 mother of god 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.250
 these national applications here too 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.820
 basically no no 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.869
 I use none then if you do not use 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.880
 I do not recommend you, but I will. 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.840
 disable it too 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.890
 and here as you can see the various 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.660
 applications have been updated 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.260
 especially those of the globe as such 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.130
 consume almost all internal space 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.700
 I'll show you only he has four 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.910
 gigas 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.120
 however as the system or android occupies 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.340
 part of the text which has available a 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.250
 Giga and a half I put some photos only 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.400
 You see very few even the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.260
 applications have been updated 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.900
 only 780m remained of very little 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.480
 you put us here she accepts 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.180
 but 11 applications with content 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.680
 for sd card 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.739
 You will come here to justice. 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.319
 in apps 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.920
 here are the ones downloaded in case they were 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.280
 updated it has consumed enough memory 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.329
 Filipe Ana you will roll here is the 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.049
 SD card 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:19.420
 does not even have to run once again 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.760
 here will appear all 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.799
 look for the applications you do not 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.299
 please, in this case interest here 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:33.669
 applications and disable 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.859
 he has 1.36 and oh the data is gone 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.980
 seeing 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:44.919
 I will also look for those of the goal that 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:47.709
 I do not use the browser cynicism 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:49.719
 drive I do not use this 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.700
 application if you do not use it too. 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:54.669
 divine regret 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.459
 the case is consuming us in ee 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.349
 mail 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.690
 here was how you updated you will have a 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:10.510
 uninstall updates block because 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:13.870
 O dropped sharply and wipe data 4.81 m 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.750
 Then you got enough then. 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.139
 30 and disable it if you do not 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.599
 disable it will be updated and 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.510
 here again the used knife 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:27.070
 Let's look for the mail that sad that 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.539
 It's my email. 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.539
 here the play bank I do not use 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.479
 enough in movies I do not 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.930
 use our problem in the video 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.780
 certain things movies in prehistory 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:53.090
 disable delete lost data 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:54.650
 also personal in music and here you have 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.370
 what to let go because it's a man 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:02.120
 dangerous one that has one to fight and games 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.570
 here you do not need that is preached 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.060
 you can download games at will 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.250
 three services what you need 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.310
 for history also the brazen butt 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:17.060
 does not use as you can see almost 50 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:23.509
 mb that occupies the hangout here also 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:25.360
 uses enough or worries to fall 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.039
 quite also 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.099
 Good folks, this is not a miracle. 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.349
 here it will surely be missing 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.449
 but spacing is a hand on the wheel 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:38.389
 so mass also hit optimism 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:43.550
 gekko gts optimism case you use 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:46.220
 so I can not unlearn, do not try 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.070
 disabling these here such force to 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.220
 these things because it 's the system then 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.729
 You do not have to touch these here or 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.220
 try it's on the street view here too 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:01.580
 Can you think, felitta, he is? 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.669
 google maps then if you 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.099
 disable can qualify and if you 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.530
 want to enable it again you go 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.509
 enter here with the same procedure and 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.000
 will say it one more time, it's just here 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:16.039
 all gods livable 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.210
 in case you want to military it again 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:21.650
 bar has here enable simple ready 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.050
 and efficient 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.039
 well here we go in internal storage 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:30.820
 As you can see you already had a bath have 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:35.050
 considerable 0,92 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:37.480
 milito ie 920 m of base indicates 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.300
 was done with 700 professionals myself 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.720
 A mistake with you can see here 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:46.390
 some take the screen here today too 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.400
 have been disabled do not recommend either 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.240
 that you download these here 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.240
 the operator or 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.840
 So that's it folks , I hope you
