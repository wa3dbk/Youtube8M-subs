00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.070

 where do you come from all the time 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.649

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.260

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.010
 Hello Subscribers Channel Brain me 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.589
 name is optimister and today I will tell 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.200
 and perhaps the best comic 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.439
 marvel publishers and do not count for cars 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.600
 logy marvel or wonders confess 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.310
 Immediately comics from Marvel I like any 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.090
 another sensible adult not 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.460
 love very much 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.560
 no, of course I wonder the universe 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.600
 individual characters and films of this 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.520
 companies i watch with interest in movies and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.439
 while any missed Well 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.509
 comics separately with them i 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.520
 Prefer not to mess with school 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.409
 years I bought read spiderman a and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.210
 X-Men later read a separate story 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.650
 about wolverine Hawk and some others 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.420
 heroes but over the years 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.340
 over the years I have got a taste and i 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.040
 learned not to spend money and time on 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.049
 mediocre picture books 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.299
 hitting the warm lamp refined 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.130
 comic book 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.619
 however, occasionally I still come across 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.990
 creations from marvel and forced to admit 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.450
 and this publisher has the stuff 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.579
 claiming the title is not comic but 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.530
 books and one such example is 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.780
 book miracles 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.240
 so what miracles is this cult 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.939
 comic marvel consisting of 4 short 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.659
 stories they are all written by the author kurt 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.489
 tendril and drawn 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.860
 the truth is great artist alex 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.930
 Ross history and I fight incredibly 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.840
 soulful while drawing 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.700
 Ross is sometimes frightening realistic and their 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.620
 teamwork is not a retelling 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.430
 next crusade team 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.400
 people in tights 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.440
 this is a story about a simple person photographers 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.690
 fillet shilda who lives in new york 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.209
 literally next door to what's happening 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.040
 around miracles he becomes one of 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.680
 witnesses of the appearance of a man-torch 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.569
 sees how the mutant decides to declare his 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.910
 existence freezes waiting 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.220
 apocalypse along with the rest 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.379
 simple people and after that he still 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.870
 will ponder the death of a loved one for 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.940
 one man superhero story book 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.610
 Miracles Regarding Superhero Theme 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.500
 only partly the plot 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.370
 talks about a simple person who 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.290
 lucky 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.019
 or vice versa not fortunate enough to live 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.140
 in such a dangerous but still fantastic 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.480
 the world around miracles people fly 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.760
 through the air someone burns and does not feel 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.129
 at the same time pain and someone shoots from the eyes 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.410
 someone lets the web out of their hands at any 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.599
 time in the center of a big city 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.290
 witness the battle of great heroes and 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.480
 villains 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.060
 and coming home to find out that your relatives 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.489
 hiding in the basement of a frightened mutant 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.620
 how not to go crazy in this world how 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.480
 keep reason and stay is not easy 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.120
 a good person but also loving 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.730
 family man and father after reading this 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.069
 books in my head flashed a variety 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.919
 thoughts about how dangerous it really is 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.260
 live in a world full of incredible how 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.870
 fascinating and at the same time shaky everything 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.239
 these are super heroes like supervillains 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.430
 rarely notices ordinary mortals whom 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.230
 and save people perceive over 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.470
 people are almost like gods 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.720
 some are inspired by them others are afraid 3 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.329
 but few people hate that 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.970
 hero and villain as well, can be 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.340
 everyone do you have super powers or not 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.099
 you just need to be able to act 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.349
