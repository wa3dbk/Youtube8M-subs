00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
back I'm still not convinced that

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560 
back I'm still not convinced that
they're<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> same<00:00:55.920> color<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.390> can

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
they're at the same color but as you can

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.410 
they're at the same color but as you can
say<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.170> two<00:00:59.039> slabs<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.789> just<00:01:00.210> looks

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
say it's in two slabs that just looks

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.720 
say it's in two slabs that just looks
like<00:01:00.510> two<00:01:00.930> big<00:01:01.170> tiles<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.039> my<00:01:02.250> wall<00:01:02.460> yeah

and then we've got down at the bottom
end<00:01:53.250> yeah<00:01:53.790> another<00:01:54.090> jawline<00:01:54.420> yeah<00:01:55.049> which<00:01:55.470> he

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
end yeah another jawline yeah which he

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.319 
end yeah another jawline yeah which he
said<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:55.950> myself<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.790> okay<00:01:57.149> with

said with myself and I was okay with
that<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:57.689> there<00:01:57.869> again<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:59.219> it's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that but there again I think it's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.810 
that but there again I think it's
noticeable<00:02:00.149> yeah<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:02.250> if<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.430> look<00:02:02.549> at

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
noticeable yeah and and if you look at

in<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.780> workshops<00:04:05.290> where<00:04:05.769> proofs<00:04:06.069> they<00:04:06.310> had

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
in the workshops where proofs they had

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:13.050 
in the workshops where proofs they had
five<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:09.180> had<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.299> patch<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.720> two<00:04:12.060> pieces

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
five and I had to patch the two pieces

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.449 
five and I had to patch the two pieces
fitted<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.810> one<00:04:14.019> at<00:04:14.169> the<00:04:14.290> front<00:04:14.410> and<00:04:14.739> one<00:04:15.400> at

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
fitted in one at the front and one at

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.849 
fitted in one at the front and one at
the<00:04:15.579> back<00:04:15.819> on<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.690> hop<00:04:16.870> but<00:04:17.260> they've<00:04:17.709> actually

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
the back on the hop but they've actually

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.250 
the back on the hop but they've actually
cut<00:04:18.190> it<00:04:18.340> out

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
cut it out

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.220 
cut it out
and<00:04:20.530> then<00:04:20.830> we've<00:04:21.040> got<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.370> smash<00:04:21.820> back<00:04:22.230> it

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
and then we've got the smash back it

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.500 
and then we've got the smash back it
just<00:04:23.260> look<00:04:23.590> like<00:04:23.620> two<00:04:23.980> big<00:04:24.340> tiles<00:04:24.940> being<00:04:25.270> put

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
just look like two big tiles being put

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.480 
just look like two big tiles being put
on<00:04:25.630> previously<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.530> I've<00:04:26.800> got<00:04:26.980> a<00:04:27.070> long<00:04:27.250> nice

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
on previously and I've got a long nice

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.320 
on previously and I've got a long nice
piece<00:04:27.790> of<00:04:28.210> granite

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
piece of granite

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.470 
piece of granite
there<00:04:31.330> was<00:04:31.450> actually<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:32.610> bevel<00:04:33.610> in<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:34.210> top

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
there was actually a bevel in the top

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.980 
there was actually a bevel in the top
which<00:04:35.110> I've<00:04:35.290> not<00:04:35.440> got<00:04:35.680> no<00:04:36.000> that's<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.390> actually

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
which I've not got no that's I actually

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.500 
which I've not got no that's I actually
don't<00:04:38.230> understand<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:38.890> business<00:04:39.220> because<00:04:39.610> I

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.400 

which<00:04:43.510> I'm<00:04:43.690> pleased<00:04:43.930> with<00:04:44.640> how<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.930> the

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
which I'm pleased with how the the

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.740 
which I'm pleased with how the the
drains<00:04:47.740> actually<00:04:48.580> got<00:04:48.790> well<00:04:49.150> succinct

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
drains actually got well succinct

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.890 
drains actually got well succinct
previously<00:04:50.740> they<00:04:51.400> went<00:04:51.610> away<00:04:52.120> from<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:52.660> sink

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
previously they went away from the sink

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.880 
previously they went away from the sink
so<00:04:53.380> I'd<00:04:54.160> have<00:04:54.280> had<00:04:54.430> water<00:04:54.610> on<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.940> top<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.300> me

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
so I'd have had water on the top so me

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.440 
so I'd have had water on the top so me
yeah<00:04:56.890> no<00:04:57.190> that's<00:04:57.340> why<00:04:57.550> that's<00:04:57.760> because<00:04:58.150> they

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
yeah no that's why that's because they

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.300

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
were caught on a CNC machine unlike last

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.860 
were caught on a CNC machine unlike last
time<00:05:00.460> where<00:05:00.790> they<00:05:00.910> would<00:05:01.030> cook<00:05:01.180> in<00:05:01.600> your<00:05:01.750> back

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870
