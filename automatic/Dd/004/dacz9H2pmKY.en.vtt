00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello everybody and there is other tessano matter 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.069
 came in this new video then 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.649
 you will surely read from the title 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.530
 something that will make the points play 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.509
 questions in the head but now there 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.730
 I explain why this title 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.830
 watching my library assists world 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.109
 my library and I realized that there 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.779
 are the titles of the books I have 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.000
 read but remember 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.070
 that is, I don't remember the plot of that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.619
 certain book I know I read it 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.619
 I remember reading it but I have no idea 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.210
 what you talk about we don't remember and 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.190
 so I said 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.770
 we share this with the world 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.680
 lack of memory and let's see if not 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.360
 I'm the only one who reads books and then if 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.160
 forget them perfect you're a martin genius 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.980
 the first book I don't remember 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.850
 absolutely have read this is for 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.730
 nike di claudia I would say that I remember 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.989
 just talking about something that 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.270
 look like vampires but don't remember them 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.559
 no I don't remember but I know I have it 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.290
 bed 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.450
 so if someone elected him maybe 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.080
 tell me if it is worth reading it on 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.170
 second title I read but not 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:21.840
 remember and mark hurd market of ok 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 difficult p yes and kristin family cast 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.220
 okay this is what i saw in 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.500
 many book all 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.500
 I have seen in many fact it is practically 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.420
 I know there are executed there followed 34 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.159
 am i read it when it came out 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.280
 complete this book immediately after that 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.040
 had just come out because I was short 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.420
 taken from vampires supernatural things 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.460
 because he had just elected twilight e 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.560
 so I say okay morning you say it 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.390
 but I don't remember anything myself 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.189
 I only remember that there was a school for 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.840
 something 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.000
 a brand but nothing more so good 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.610
 well 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.150
 the third book I read but says not 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.150
 I remember nothing and let me in 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:18.470
 john ajvide lindqvist if I have this one 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.540
 read this book because I remind you that 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.730
 I had seen the movie they had given up 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.300
 italy 1 on some mediaset channel e 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.030
 probably and therefore I remained 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.890
 enthusiastic and I went the books I have 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.970
 since there was also the book and it goes 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.620
 taken 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.390
 I vaguely remember the story vi 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.880
 I always remember talking about something that 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.670
 got to do with vampires or supernatural 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.020
 with some scenes but if you asked me it is 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.970
 liked this book probably yes 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.400
 probably if I say it now yes I will 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.870
 will like it I will not like it but not me 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.700
 I remember this so now here 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.350
 probably will have to prepare me for the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.380
 bombing but a book that does not 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.019
 I remember reading this is what I am 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.170
 these until luca in the dark and many 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.910
 living in dallas di carla the rhythm 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.170
 because they all have complicated names 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.150
 in any case they are the first two books 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.410
 of the series of books from which the 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.180
 true blood blog tv series 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.280
 I think so, so I read books for 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.900
 caputo they talked about vampires ie I want to 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.209
 say I showed you three books that 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.549
 speak the vampires you are with 5 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.980
 martina is not fixed with vampires but 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.630
 not at all but to whom I think only myself 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.340
 I can think of that 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.030
 in any case he read these two books 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.310
 because I was talking about vampires I was curious about 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.140
 read the story then a friend of mine 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.600
 had said that the figure beautiful series 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.430
 so I do read the book or not 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.920
 I remember nothing, I just remember that 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.970
 probably they drink blood from the bar 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.100
 those blood pockets 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.440
 sony such a thing is not possible 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.910
 is confusing me and now we move on to 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.940
 cloud excludes the highlight 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.660
 a book that everyone has read 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.360
 read but I almost don't remember it at all 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.330
 for nothing I read it a long time ago 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.820
 and now I'm talking about memories of a 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.270
 artwork hold'em geisha 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.299
 I know that this guy is the low that is all 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:22.950
 they worship memories of a geisha and a mere 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.840
 I remember and then it happens that I have it 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.000
 already read number I would like it 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.770
 read but then the boom never why 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.690
 I say okay martina law has read the 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.520
 companies something you haven't read and 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.250
 therefore I always remain with the ignorance of 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.230
 not knowing practically almost nothing about 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.060
 I may have read this book so 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.250
 too read perhaps a test tube in a 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.500
 period that I was too stressed and 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.000
 I was not able to assimilate 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.190
 information but I don't remember anything 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.270
 they just say something with Japan 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:54.510
 she who becomes Greece is enough 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:59.730
 sister who does some work a little bit 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:01.500
 just go bad hurt hurt deep and 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.090
 then I show a night's dream of 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.950
 midsummer of william shakespeare that 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.630
 actually I remember but not enough I have it 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.270
 put in this video because I have to ledger 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.490
 apple tree for the examination of English literature 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.890
 so I don't remember it enough 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.510
 to take the exam and then I have to 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.370
 then reread to a TV and books that 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.370
 I do not remember 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.419
 carry-on a little something is unfortunately not 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.900
 quite 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:27.660
 I said 7 times enough so ok 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.370
 ok it's the last book I read but that 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.100
 I remember absolutely nothing I say 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:37.440
 only that I did not like that I have 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:42.240
 it is therefore thought to be the haunted house 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.800
 the af kraft lovecraft that as I repeat myself 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.300
 I remember nothing, I just do that 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.130
 when I read it he had not given me 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.770
 just nothing the fact that he didn't 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.880
 given nothing he did forget e 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.790
 so now tell me if I'm not 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.470
 the only one to read books ea 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.450
 forget them or if I'm a person who 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.010
 you would like to flog to kill put 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.380
 at the stake because it does not remember this 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.210
 who actually read I care about 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.090
 remember me books that I tie myself to that is 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:13.020
 I read for myself to learn for 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:16.110
 increase them and yet I forget them 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.490
 this bothers me because in the end I 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.770
 like to read I like stories 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.370
 always a disappointment when you then 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.100
 forget 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.080
 with time you forget you details 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.360
 forget the things that maybe were 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.730
 important and therefore nothing 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.320
 after this video I totally useless 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.910
 I greet you a car and is passing 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.590
 under the house thanks 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.000
 after this video I totally useless 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.250
 I greet you I refer you to a neighbor 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.790
 video i hope you don't rate me 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:45.020
 another for what I said nothing 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.020
 a big kiss hello
