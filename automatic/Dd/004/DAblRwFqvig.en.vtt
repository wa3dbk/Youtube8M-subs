water what's nice about our sprouter is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.460 
water what's nice about our sprouter is
that<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> lid<00:01:08.820> acts<00:01:09.119> as<00:01:09.300> a<00:01:09.330> diffuser<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.260> that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that the lid acts as a diffuser so that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.770 
that the lid acts as a diffuser so that
the<00:01:10.650> sprouts<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.369> moved<00:01:11.670> around<00:01:11.940> by<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> strong
