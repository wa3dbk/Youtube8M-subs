00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:59.629
 Duty beast from the very best of the against 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.670
 you just can not stand it 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.829

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.840
 But the despair of the day brings it to life 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.850
 luck is there indeed counter and one 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.550
 Countermeasure is called the type of 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.500
 The band will be alive and again 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.530
 At any rate, black ops 2 can not gamble 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.939
 with this act and that's why I am 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.380
 forward this video dynatrace 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.070

 already used to it 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.579

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.240
 certainly be chosen and has none 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.579
 future more in the call of duty 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.170

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.299
