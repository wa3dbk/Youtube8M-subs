00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
wasn't the highwayman although that was

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.690 
wasn't the highwayman although that was
extremely<00:02:19.440> important<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.070> has<00:02:20.190> been<00:02:20.459> in<00:02:20.580> my

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700

go<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.940> college<00:02:30.180> maybe<00:02:30.720> because<00:02:31.110> if<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.350> don't

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
some point you gotta cross that line and

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.190 
some point you gotta cross that line and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
start learning for yourself that's when

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.449 
start learning for yourself that's when
it<00:02:39.239> opens<00:02:39.510> up<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.840> turns<00:02:39.989> on<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.620> tell

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
it opens up and turns on so I tell

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:55.720 
it opens up and turns on so I tell
everybody<00:02:41.880> figure<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.630> out

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:04.760
