this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.439> tutorial<00:00:01.740> on<00:00:02.159> how<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.490> solve<00:00:02.879> the

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
this is the tutorial on how to solve the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.230 
this is the tutorial on how to solve the
Rubik's<00:00:03.290> 1x1<00:00:04.290> cube<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:05.430> cube<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.970> pretty

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
Rubik's 1x1 cube this cube is pretty

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.110 
Rubik's 1x1 cube this cube is pretty
much<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.870> easiest<00:00:07.080> cube<00:00:07.770> ever<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.820> solve

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
much the easiest cube ever to solve

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.839 
much the easiest cube ever to solve

anyways<00:00:23.490> what<00:00:24.180> I'm<00:00:24.330> going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.720> teaching

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
anyways what I'm going to be teaching

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.620 
anyways what I'm going to be teaching
you<00:00:25.140> today<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.400> called<00:00:26.640> algorithms

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
you today is what is called algorithms

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.970 
you today is what is called algorithms
and<00:00:27.930> what<00:00:28.320> happens<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.779> their<00:00:30.779> design<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
and what happens are is their design to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.000 
and what happens are is their design to
get<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.369> place<00:00:32.850> into<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.840> place<00:00:34.170> and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
get one place into the right place and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.850 
get one place into the right place and
that<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.570> what<00:00:36.780> I'm<00:00:36.899> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.350> displaying

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
that is what I'm going to be displaying

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.110 
that is what I'm going to be displaying
here<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.579> tutorial<00:00:40.399> anyways<00:00:41.399> let's<00:00:41.879> get

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
here in this tutorial anyways let's get

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.549 
here in this tutorial anyways let's get
learning<00:00:42.629> how<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> solve<00:00:43.140> this

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
learning how to solve this

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.029 
learning how to solve this
you<00:00:44.250> only<00:00:44.460> need<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.760> walk<00:00:45.000> when<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:46.289> algorithm

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
you only need to walk when one algorithm

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.450 
you only need to walk when one algorithm
and<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.730> very<00:00:48.030> easily<00:00:48.920> but<00:00:49.920> first<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.370> all

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and it is very easily but first of all

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.869 
and it is very easily but first of all
before<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.449> into<00:00:51.809> actually<00:00:52.879> doing

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
before we get into actually doing

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.340 
before we get into actually doing
algorithms<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.629> wanted<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> show<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.170> what

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
algorithms I wanted to show you what

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.670 
algorithms I wanted to show you what
algorithms<00:00:56.030> like<00:00:57.030> there's<00:00:57.719> letters<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
algorithms like there's letters and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.510 
algorithms like there's letters and
algorithms<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.690> let<00:01:00.690> me<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:00.870> show<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.770> what

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
algorithms and let me just show you what

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.420 
algorithms and let me just show you what
those<00:01:02.760> letters<00:01:02.969> mean<00:01:03.650> U<00:01:04.650> stands<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> up

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
those letters mean U stands for the up

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.910 
those letters mean U stands for the up
side<00:01:05.700> R<00:01:06.180> stands<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> right<00:01:07.200> side<00:01:07.470> L

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the frost side d stands for the down

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.200 
the frost side d stands for the down
side<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.670> B<00:01:15.119> stands<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.350> back<00:01:16.500> side<00:01:17.210> all

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
side and B stands for the back side all

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.830 
side and B stands for the back side all
right<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:21.200> what<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.970> algorithms<00:01:24.600> if

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
right and what if in the algorithms if

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.219 
right and what if in the algorithms if
there<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.070> letter<00:01:26.310> U<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.960> means

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
there is just the letter U that means

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.789 
there is just the letter U that means
turn<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.880> cube<00:01:31.130> turn<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.549> face<00:01:33.799> clockwise

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
turn the cube turn the up face clockwise

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.050 
turn the cube turn the up face clockwise
90<00:01:35.729> degrees

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.800 

and<00:01:39.229> same<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.830> other<00:01:40.950> things<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.940> if<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:42.510> have

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and same for other things but if I have

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.039 
and same for other things but if I have
an<00:01:43.110> apostrophe<00:01:44.600> above<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:46.220> letter<00:01:47.780> or<00:01:48.780> right

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
an apostrophe above a letter or right

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.230 
an apostrophe above a letter or right
beside<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.440> letter<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.130> means<00:01:50.400> turn<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
beside a letter that means turn it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
beside a letter that means turn it
anti-clockwise<00:01:55.100> now<00:01:56.100> let's<00:01:56.369> get<00:01:56.520> into

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
anti-clockwise now let's get into

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.040 
anti-clockwise now let's get into
solving<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:58.229> one<00:01:58.860> by<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.340> cube<00:01:59.869> you<00:02:00.869> only

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
solving the one by one cube you only

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.200 
solving the one by one cube you only
need<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.440> know<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.979> algorithm<00:02:02.399> as<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.970> said

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
need to know one algorithm as I said

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.870 
need to know one algorithm as I said
before<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.490> algorithm<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:10.440> I

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
before and that algorithm is you you I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.770 
before and that algorithm is you you I

in that algorithm that algorithm is the
only<00:02:15.989> algorithm<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.980> will<00:02:17.400> need<00:02:17.640> to

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
only algorithm that you will need to

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.420 
only algorithm that you will need to
know<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.209> doing<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.110> algorithm<00:02:19.709> will<00:02:20.040> make
