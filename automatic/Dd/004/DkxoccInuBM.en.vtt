people had said about it I think it is

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.530 
people had said about it I think it is
pretty<00:01:55.500> much<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> same<00:01:56.009> thing<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:57.180> I'll<00:01:57.299> kind

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
pretty much the same thing and I'll kind

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.039 
pretty much the same thing and I'll kind
of<00:01:57.570> get<00:01:57.719> into<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.799> uh<00:01:59.719> right<00:02:00.719> out<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
of get into that but uh right out of the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.370 
of get into that but uh right out of the
bottle<00:02:01.469> when<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.159> open<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> up<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.960> does<00:02:04.170> have

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
bottle when you open it up it does have

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.150 
bottle when you open it up it does have
a<00:02:04.409> similar<00:02:04.890> vibe<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:07.320> mall<00:02:07.590> when<00:02:08.129> I

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
a similar vibe to the mall when I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.559 
a similar vibe to the mall when I
smelled<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.759> thought<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.030> smelled<00:02:09.330> that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
smelled it I thought I smelled that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.120 
smelled it I thought I smelled that
before

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
before

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.830 
before
and<00:02:10.430> finally<00:02:10.730> hitting<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.240> was<00:02:11.450> kind<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.720> the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
and finally hitting it was kind of the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.160 
and finally hitting it was kind of the
same<00:02:12.850> vanilla<00:02:13.850> smell<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.630> get<00:02:14.780> when<00:02:15.050> you

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
same vanilla smell that you get when you

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.550 
same vanilla smell that you get when you
have<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.410> when<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.430> spray<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:16.760> them<00:02:17.090> all<00:02:17.560> a

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
out and kind of toned it down but a very

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
out and kind of toned it down but a very
similar<00:02:26.920> vanilla<00:02:27.920> based<00:02:28.540> smell<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.810> don't<00:02:30.050> know

if it has vanilla notes in it but that's

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.930 
if it has vanilla notes in it but that's
just<00:02:32.930> kind<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.500> vibe<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.220> get<00:02:34.280> right<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.850> the
