one of the remarkable things about a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.929 
one of the remarkable things about a
honeybee<00:00:23.250> colony<00:00:23.849> is<00:00:24.060> how<00:00:24.800> it<00:00:25.800> evolves<00:00:26.160> over

honeybee colony is how it evolves over

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.179 
honeybee colony is how it evolves over
the<00:00:27.060> course<00:00:27.270> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.660> year<00:00:27.989> the<00:00:28.439> honeybee<00:00:28.890> is

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the course of the year the honeybee is

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.970 
the course of the year the honeybee is
unique<00:00:30.560> it's<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.770> only<00:00:32.189> social<00:00:33.350> bee<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.920> is

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
unique it's the only social bee that is

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.610 
unique it's the only social bee that is

are blooming they forage for nectar they

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.569 
are blooming they forage for nectar they
convert<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.590> into<00:00:52.739> honey<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.129> they<00:00:53.219> store

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
convert it into honey and they store

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.639 
convert it into honey and they store
that<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.030> that's<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.390> fuel<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.379> they<00:00:55.500> used

that and that's the fuel that they used

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.170 
that and that's the fuel that they used

keep the cluster warm very select few of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.709 
keep the cluster warm very select few of
the<00:01:01.379> bees<00:01:01.590> are<00:01:01.890> social<00:01:02.519> and<00:01:02.760> honeybees<00:01:03.480> are

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the bees are social and honeybees are

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.020 
the bees are social and honeybees are
kind<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.050> one<00:01:04.289> of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.500> pinnacles<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
kind of one of the pinnacles of that a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.690 
kind of one of the pinnacles of that a
honeybee<00:01:06.479> colony<00:01:07.289> is<00:01:07.580> considered<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
honeybee colony is considered a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.749 
honeybee colony is considered a
superorganism<00:01:09.500> meaning<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.679> entire<00:01:11.130> colony

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
superorganism meaning the entire colony

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:19.570 
superorganism meaning the entire colony
is<00:01:12.380> is<00:01:13.380> really<00:01:13.800> one<00:01:14.360> individual<00:01:15.360> being

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.969 

they<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.970> moved<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.290> orchards

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
they can be moved in and out of orchards

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.310 
they can be moved in and out of orchards
and<00:01:23.220> fields<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.850> require<00:01:24.320> insect

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and fields that require insect

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.950 
and fields that require insect
pollination<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.610> seed<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.300> then<00:01:27.360> fruit<00:01:27.660> set

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
pollination for seed and then fruit set

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.570 
pollination for seed and then fruit set
and<00:01:28.260> so<00:01:28.710> honey<00:01:28.950> bees<00:01:29.160> are<00:01:29.190> really

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
and so honey bees are really

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.430 
and so honey bees are really
indispensable<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.600> about<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.870> third<00:01:31.260> of

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
indispensable for about a third of

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.950 
indispensable for about a third of
everything<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:31.979> eat<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:33.630> ape<00:01:33.690> culture

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
everything we eat the ape culture

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.469 
everything we eat the ape culture
industry<00:01:34.500> has<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.860> 2.4<00:01:35.520> million<00:01:35.880> beehives

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.530 
industry has about 2.4 million beehives
nationwide<00:01:37.260> and<00:01:37.920> about<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.160> third<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.729> them<00:01:38.970> die

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
nationwide and about a third of them die

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.870 
nationwide and about a third of them die
off<00:01:39.810> every<00:01:40.410> winter<00:01:40.680> which<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.280> very<00:01:41.640> very

off every winter which is very very

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.550 
off every winter which is very very

these insecticides out here it's got to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.020 
these insecticides out here it's got to
be<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.470> cause<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.550> started<00:01:59.880> investigating

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
be the cause so I started investigating

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.609 
be the cause so I started investigating
it<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.720> make<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> case<00:02:01.110> against<00:02:01.920> them<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:04.350> my

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it to make a case against them and to my

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.830 
it to make a case against them and to my
amazement<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.280> came<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.789> totally<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.240> obstacle

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
amazement I came to totally the obstacle

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.259 
amazement I came to totally the obstacle
ocean<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.830> believe<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.820> primary

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
ocean and I believe that the primary

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.220 
ocean and I believe that the primary
reason<00:02:12.690> we're<00:02:13.050> losing<00:02:13.410> bees<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.670> whole

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
reason we're losing bees is this whole

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.470 
reason we're losing bees is this whole
parasitic<00:02:16.230> mite<00:02:16.500> syndrome<00:02:17.160> which<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:17.850> all<00:02:18.269> of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
high mite populations and all of us

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.030 
high mite populations and all of us
beekeepers<00:02:42.450> saw<00:02:42.660> higher<00:02:43.320> levels<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.799> mites

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
beekeepers saw higher levels of mites

beekeepers saw higher levels of mites

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.000 
levels was unavailable for a while this
summer<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:57.900> maybe<00:02:58.140> commercial<00:02:58.739> beekeepers

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
summer so maybe commercial beekeepers

summer so maybe commercial beekeepers

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
might levels went way up so coming up

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.350
