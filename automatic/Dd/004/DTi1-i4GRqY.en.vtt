allow that crease to gradually form as

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.760 
allow that crease to gradually form as
you<00:03:22.970> rock<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.390> out<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.690> way<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.200> it'll<00:03:24.650> try

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
you rock it out of the way and it'll try

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.350 
you rock it out of the way and it'll try
to<00:03:24.830> close<00:03:25.130> back<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.580> you<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.000> may<00:03:26.120> have<00:03:26.210> to

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
to close back on you so you may have to

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.240 
to close back on you so you may have to
sit<00:03:26.510> here<00:03:26.540> hold<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:26.990> out<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.260> way<00:03:27.380> until<00:03:28.040> it

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
sit here hold it out of the way until it

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.930 
sit here hold it out of the way until it
gets<00:03:28.460> used<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.050> ya<00:03:30.050> position<00:03:30.710> at<00:03:30.860> rest<00:03:31.100> so

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
gets used to that ya position at rest so

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.570 
gets used to that ya position at rest so
now<00:03:32.090> you've<00:03:32.300> exposed<00:03:32.800> these<00:03:33.800> two<00:03:34.070> heater<00:03:34.310> core

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
now you've exposed these two heater core

circulation line and we've kind of
scored<00:04:33.979> it<00:04:34.100> you<00:04:35.090> can<00:04:35.180> use<00:04:35.330> some<00:04:35.510> sort<00:04:35.540> of<00:04:35.810> a

drill bit or a Sharpie or pointer for
lack<00:04:40.010> of<00:04:40.220> any<00:04:40.370> better<00:04:40.610> tool<00:04:40.850> we<00:04:41.000> had<00:04:41.120> a<00:04:41.150> roofing

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
lack of any better tool we had a roofing

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.050 
lack of any better tool we had a roofing
nail<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.130> we<00:04:43.130> kind<00:04:43.640> of<00:04:43.729> poked<00:04:44.500> into<00:04:45.500> the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
nail and we kind of poked into the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.950 
nail and we kind of poked into the
weather<00:04:47.060> sealer<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:48.100> found<00:04:49.240> cavity<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.450> then

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
weather sealer and found cavity and then

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.690 
weather sealer and found cavity and then
we<00:04:51.080> went<00:04:51.290> further<00:04:51.680> along<00:04:52.070> until<00:04:52.370> we<00:04:52.490> found

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
we went further along until we found

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.100 
we went further along until we found
some<00:04:52.880> resistance<00:04:53.419> so<00:04:53.570> we<00:04:53.600> knew<00:04:53.780> we<00:04:53.930> were<00:04:54.020> on

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
some resistance so we knew we were on

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.469 
some resistance so we knew we were on
the<00:04:54.290> the<00:04:54.320> rubber<00:04:54.770> drain<00:04:55.070> hose<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.610> then<00:04:56.360> we

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
the the rubber drain hose and then we

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.510 
the the rubber drain hose and then we
went<00:04:56.690> further<00:04:56.960> until<00:04:57.470> it<00:04:57.620> opened<00:04:58.130> up<00:04:58.220> again

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
went further until it opened up again

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.880 
went further until it opened up again
and<00:04:58.669> we<00:04:58.760> found<00:04:58.940> another<00:04:59.270> void<00:04:59.540> we<00:05:00.290> scored<00:05:00.740> up

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
and we found another void we scored up

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.800 
and we found another void we scored up
on<00:05:01.100> each<00:05:01.250> side<00:05:01.520> where<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.910> void<00:05:02.090> began<00:05:02.479> and

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
on each side where the void began and

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.990 
on each side where the void began and
where<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.500> tube<00:05:03.710> was<00:05:03.919> in<00:05:04.100> the<00:05:04.190> middle<00:05:04.490> now

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
where the tube was in the middle now

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.570 
where the tube was in the middle now
we're<00:05:05.150> going<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:05.300> drill<00:05:05.600> a<00:05:05.630> hole<00:05:06.580> underneath

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
we're going to drill a hole underneath

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.460 
we're going to drill a hole underneath
this<00:05:07.880> line<00:05:08.150> in<00:05:08.390> between<00:05:08.510> those<00:05:08.870> two<00:05:09.050> points

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
this line in between those two points

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.469 
this line in between those two points
very<00:05:09.620> very<00:05:10.340> shallow<00:05:10.550> holes<00:05:10.970> so<00:05:11.210> that<00:05:11.330> we<00:05:11.390> don't

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
very very shallow holes so that we don't

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.000 
very very shallow holes so that we don't
penetrate<00:05:12.020> and<00:05:12.200> get<00:05:12.290> into<00:05:12.530> anything<00:05:12.830> we<00:05:12.919> don't

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
penetrate and get into anything we don't

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.550 
penetrate and get into anything we don't
want<00:05:13.250> to<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:13.640> get<00:05:14.390> into

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
want to I get into

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.960 
want to I get into
and<00:05:15.680> we'll<00:05:15.950> be<00:05:16.070> right<00:05:16.250> back<00:05:16.550> with<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.940> results

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
and we'll be right back with the results

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:30.159 
and we'll be right back with the results
from<00:05:17.300> that<00:05:17.540> drill
