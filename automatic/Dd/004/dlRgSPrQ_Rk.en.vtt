00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
here and I find we're doing kindling

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.130 
here and I find we're doing kindling
wood<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:20.060> made<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> little<00:00:21.840> heavier

wood I made this one a little heavier

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:57.729 
wood I made this one a little heavier
than<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> last<00:00:22.350> one

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739

it<00:04:24.300> just<00:04:24.540> seems<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:25.050> work<00:04:29.390> time<00:04:30.390> to<00:04:30.510> hit

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
it just seems to work time to hit

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.660 
it just seems to work time to hit
something<00:04:30.870> like<00:04:30.990> that<00:04:31.260> with<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.590> either<00:04:31.740> with

an axe and everything like that it's

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.270 
an axe and everything like that it's
easy<00:04:36.020> enough<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.200> do<00:04:37.790> but<00:04:39.680> you<00:04:40.680> got<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.070> much

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
easy enough to do but you got so much

00:04:41.280 --> 00:05:00.260 
easy enough to do but you got so much
control<00:04:54.500> or<00:04:55.500> not<00:04:58.400> we<00:04:59.400> got<00:04:59.580> so<00:04:59.790> much<00:04:59.940> control

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
control or not we got so much control

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.830 
control or not we got so much control
with<00:05:00.510> us<00:05:00.950> with<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.070> system<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:03.330> you<00:05:03.420> saw<00:05:03.630> how

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
with us with the system and you saw how

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.350 
with us with the system and you saw how
easy<00:05:04.080> it<00:05:04.200> was<00:05:04.410> to<00:05:04.470> split<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.490> relatively<00:05:06.090> big

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
easy it was to split a relatively big

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.780 
easy it was to split a relatively big
round<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:07.080> so<00:05:07.410> on<00:05:08.630> this<00:05:09.630> has<00:05:10.250> like<00:05:11.250> every<00:05:11.610> home

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
round and so on this has like every home

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.890 
round and so on this has like every home
state<00:05:12.060> should<00:05:12.240> have<00:05:12.270> one<00:05:12.630> but<00:05:14.420> anytime<00:05:15.420> I<00:05:15.720> go

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
state should have one but anytime I go

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.200 
state should have one but anytime I go
out<00:05:15.960> into<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.260> bush<00:05:16.910> one<00:05:17.910> of<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.030> first

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
out into the bush one of the first

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.020 
out into the bush one of the first
things<00:05:18.390> I'm<00:05:18.540> in<00:05:19.190> all<00:05:20.190> right<00:05:20.280> you<00:05:20.550> want<00:05:20.790> to<00:05:20.850> have

you can chuck her in the thing this is
like<00:05:33.750> I<00:05:33.840> said<00:05:33.900> this<00:05:34.140> is<00:05:34.320> native<00:05:34.680> a<00:05:34.860> piece<00:05:35.040> of

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
like I said this is native a piece of

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.320 
like I said this is native a piece of
maple<00:05:35.340> and<00:05:36.350> I<00:05:37.460> should<00:05:38.460> get<00:05:38.640> pretty<00:05:39.270> good

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
maple and I should get pretty good

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.660 
maple and I should get pretty good
service<00:05:39.780> out<00:05:39.930> of<00:05:39.960> it<00:05:40.140> all<00:05:41.100> right<00:05:41.220> I'm<00:05:41.460> going<00:05:41.640> to

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
be I grew up a lot of kindling wood and

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.670 
be I grew up a lot of kindling wood and
you<00:05:47.820> know<00:05:47.940> this<00:05:48.120> is<00:05:48.270> birch<00:05:48.480> so<00:05:49.410> it<00:05:49.500> really
