 Hello everyone, welcome to the review 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:12.540
 samsung tv 40 diagonal 6 series 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.190
 model of this TV 6307 let's 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.710
 consider this review what goes into 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.449
 set and the TV itself its size and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.359
 So let's start the set 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.000
 we have accordingly documentation 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:32.759
 here comes the warranty card instruction 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.309
 for one year there are such rings 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.309
 they are used for mounting on the wall 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:47.370
 bracket included also go alone 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.640
 a pair of glasses like this 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.199
 active glasses work on batteries 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.120
 Now this method is combined with them 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:02.850
 the ears come here so beautiful 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:06.320
 black box model points drawn 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.320
 here 4100 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.020
 further the wipe for wiping micro of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.250
 subway figures 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 remote control is very 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.900
 functional can also drive 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.680
 player built in 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.740
 the most necessary modern in this 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.800
 tv 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:43.520
 comes next 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:51.260
 stand stand glossy cool 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:56.450
 Looks very will look beautiful 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:59.620
 and the bundle still has this one 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.010
 plug it is put on the back 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:08.140
 TV when you install the stand 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.140
 that is, now I will try to show 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:17.000
 about here for this purpose 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:19.850
 it is clear yes that's right in 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.850
 the set is on the TV itself now I am 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:28.640
 I'll take it all away and put it worth it 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.890
 or look around the corner let's consider 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.650
 TV itself a little closer let's start 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.050
 probably from the size of the diagonal of this 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.959
 40 inch televisions 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:43.610
 if you don't really understand inches, I 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:47.030
 I can tell you that it is 107 centimeters 107 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:51.709
 centimeters diagonally up to 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.570
 TV 54 centimeters but there is a frame 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:59.140
 Now it stands to be a little bit 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:11.660
 In the middle of the world it will be 5 5 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:13.690
 centimeters high and length 92 792 slept 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.690
 and 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.829
 This TV has a thin 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:28.299
 frame around the edges which is very good 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:32.280
 affects the viewing of the image then 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:35.709
 there is not a hindrance somewhat just as it were 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.930
 very comfortable further consider the back 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.410
 the panel and the side that is on the back 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.110
 panels 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:49.930
 so on the back we have four 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:56.320
 bracket holes are also available 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:57.440
 unit with connectors here two inches i 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.920
 there is 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:05.620
 the service cable lan for 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.620
 internet scart components 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.580
 fiber optic cables 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.270
 fiber optic up cable can 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.950
 to plug 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:21.130
 for audio there is also an antenna connector here 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:25.660
 we have a socket for connecting the cord and 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.530

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.670

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:41.750
 right and pressing in the middle also with us 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:50.300
 there is still a sidebar here as well 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:53.270
 we also have here 2 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.470
 port usb to connect flash drives 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.750

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.600
 mouse and keyboard that is all 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.180
 TV is quietly maintained and 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.320
 called smart i.e. translation smart 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:10.430
 that is, everything will work fine and 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:14.330
 no problems there is also a connector for 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.960
 connect card for television code 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.390
 there do not know well, our country is in my 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.180
 not true so everyone uses either 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:27.720
 satellite dishes either 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.730
 Analogues of TV vader analog 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.040
 Well, everything is such a TV with such 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.310
 parts supplied with us 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.830

 Full hd resolution i.e. 3d to thin 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.320

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.630
 hertz 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.370
