00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:09.809
 brothers I welcome everyone today 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.269
 Balcony dragged the same handle here 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.020
 knife to 100 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:18.800
 I completed the very interesting tree I 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.800
 I know what kind of tree 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.859
 brazilian tree then i will try in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.640
 directory see the name 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:38.989
 Here if me suspicion that it can 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:42.390
 to be here that is she is hard as a bone 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.579
 by analogy, approximately as 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.500
 sensations, that is, it does not go away. 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.710
 no trace of a nail nicks place for 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.730
 countries left 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:59.850
 eaten up a bunch of sandpaper means somehow his 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.000
 I didn’t soak it in water 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.390
 does not take oneself that is if wet 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.189
 stay in front of the juice is enough what 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.010
 so thick gummy let's say 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.909
 structure I can't even explain general 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.770
 here while blades they ground sharpened 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:25.170
 drink set here like a bolster and 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.670
 that is, this patent means from the castle from 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:33.210
 closet were such here 2 damn 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.369
 rectangular and generally shore decided 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.610
 use but nothing principle method 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.740
 Beauty is not particularly needed, but here a million 4 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:47.479
 it means a layer of alina with epoxy as here 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.000
 space well what can we say already 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.610
 cut with horus i go this to stalin 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.610
 prada used to not hold hands 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.680
 will cut no doubt loves 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:12.229
 Well, well, that is, it's thick enough 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.229
 here I have 33 millimeters but 8 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.980
 let's try now apple muscle 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:24.380
 as he will we will collapse of course therefore 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.380
 rolls off but the cut cleaning istrin and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.880
 does r6 m5 mean another finish marking 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.070
 I didn’t clean 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.050
 say there on balance in principle 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.739
 OK, that is, he is like that 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.470
 let's just say that's the balance he has here 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.230
 in the center almost now very 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.560
 Light turned out to have such a very cut 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:54.780
 peculiar came out here the usual to 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.830
 the kitchen knife is like that 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.790
 can even be cut thin 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.040
 the plates didn't even do anything 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.940
 do not wring it cuts to the end with 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:13.260
 ok in general r6 m5 good knife but 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.910
 we are all the same and the paper planes but I 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.380
 wouldn't there be a razor task 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.239
 think it is basically nothing 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.170
 say this can micro file will 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:30.739
 so I did like this 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:34.799
 dropping from the butt means to the tip 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:38.060
 somewhere around 03 and so on a millimeter 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.890
 then the devil is Scandinavian and only then 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.890
 somewhere millimeter 2 from the edge already such 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.870
 here lenticular such triple triple such 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:52.110
 it turns out a way to say this information 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.540
 blade firebox that is then bang and down 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:02.790
 then Scandinavian and in the end still such 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:05.670
 years let us go for a muck means what else 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.340
 I wanted to say that about the a6m 5 metal 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:16.019
 really dry if its not very 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:20.359
 subtly bring about do not know 03 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.820
 but at night it keeps its edge worthy 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.300
 not jammed anything even hitting 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.640
 glass 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:33.030
 still worthy of a knife universal 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:37.530
 case to not do for each knife chi 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.370
 hun me take you to basically all large 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.360
 knives here climbed from anyway 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:49.349
 match you stayed I decided to use 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:52.169
 Well, what else can I say on the tests I 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:55.349
 I tried to suffer hard wood 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.599
 tree for 6 5 dryly it goes with such 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:05.390
 slip everything to me very touches 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:08.070
 let's say so a shirt stabs like this 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:14.220
 I still liked vodka 100 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:18.659
 . basis murez where we in quantity 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.120
 carbon and it will regret almost no 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:24.330
 stainless steel if wet it rather dried 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.580
 2 and it is our 75 does not appear 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.720
 covered of course so thin 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:33.630
 here with specks take 2 wet not 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.750
 very polished, that's why 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.680
 may be left to polish more 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.680
 will rust less 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:46.339
 Rosewood handled well coming 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.189
 although solid is also enough material a 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:51.619
 This one will need to see whether 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:52.360
 is it a jacaranda or some other tree 

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:57.889
 hoop 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:01.449
 looked at the directory of rooms here but 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:05.719
 it does not grow very deep on the coast 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:11.209
 on the continent brought you fights to me 0 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:13.629
 5 in a log lying that's why such a 

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:17.619
 that's what happened brother 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.619
 miracle-Yuda disables all
