or on the edge wall of the pelvic bone
and<00:00:50.670> we're<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:50.969> going<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.149> cut<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.719> circle

cut off if you can come up here group we

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.179 
cut off if you can come up here group we
cut<00:01:15.460> off<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.909> top<00:01:16.149> of<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:17.500> pecker<00:01:17.799> it's

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
cut off the top of this pecker it's

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.679 
cut off the top of this pecker it's
right<00:01:18.399> here<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:20.530> you<00:01:20.710> look<00:01:21.149> we<00:01:22.149> cut<00:01:22.390> off<00:01:22.539> the

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
right here if you look we cut off the

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.330 
right here if you look we cut off the
top<00:01:22.930> of<00:01:22.960> that<00:01:23.200> so<00:01:23.439> this<00:01:23.590> can<00:01:23.740> actually<00:01:24.039> just<00:01:24.189> be

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
top of that so this can actually just be

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.070 
top of that so this can actually just be
pulled<00:01:24.610> out<00:01:24.789> through<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.479> bottom<00:01:25.810> here

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
pulled out through the bottom here

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.050

like this it opens up so we're going to
take<00:02:24.100> our<00:02:24.310> knife<00:02:25.109> to<00:02:26.109> clear<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.530> tool<00:02:26.739> we're

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
take our knife to clear the tool we're

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.560 
take our knife to clear the tool we're
going<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.609> take<00:02:27.790> our<00:02:27.940> knife<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.299> we're<00:02:28.450> going

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
going to take our knife and we're going

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.240 
going to take our knife and we're going
to<00:02:28.600> insert<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.079> here<00:02:29.109> and<00:02:29.769> we're<00:02:29.950> just<00:02:29.980> going

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
to insert it here and we're just going

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.009 
to insert it here and we're just going
to<00:02:30.280> cut<00:02:30.489> forward<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:31.510> now<00:02:31.660> what<00:02:31.780> I'm<00:02:31.870> going<00:02:31.900> to

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
to cut forward so now what I'm going to

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.990 
to cut forward so now what I'm going to
do<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.260> I'm<00:02:32.380> going<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.530> take<00:02:32.739> my<00:02:33.370> grandfather's

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
knife and the rectifier I'm going to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.160 
knife and the rectifier I'm going to
take<00:02:37.090> my<00:02:37.269> knife<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.660> I'm<00:02:37.780> going<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.959> put<00:02:38.079> it

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
take my knife and I'm going to put it

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.240 
take my knife and I'm going to put it
right<00:02:38.200> here<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:39.220> slides<00:02:39.519> between<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
right here and it slides between the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.059 
right here and it slides between the
rectifier<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.810> blade<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.260> then<00:02:44.980> I'm

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
rectifier and the blade and then I'm

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.530 
rectifier and the blade and then I'm
going<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.220> take<00:02:45.400> my<00:02:45.549> blade<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.060> I'm<00:02:46.209> gonna<00:02:46.299> cut

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
going to take my blade and I'm gonna cut

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.620 
going to take my blade and I'm gonna cut
forward<00:02:46.980> one<00:02:48.060> two<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.380> now<00:02:50.380> we<00:02:50.739> just<00:02:50.920> cleared

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
forward one two and now we just cleared

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.170 
forward one two and now we just cleared
our<00:02:52.630> tool<00:02:52.989> again<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:54.609> take<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:54.910> off

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180

very<00:03:14.140> easy<00:03:15.810> again<00:03:16.810> we're<00:03:17.140> using<00:03:17.170> our<00:03:18.360> our<00:03:19.360> own

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
very easy again we're using our our own

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.210 
very easy again we're using our our own
knives<00:03:20.129> with<00:03:21.129> the<00:03:21.370> tool<00:03:22.830> we're<00:03:23.830> going<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.010> take

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
knives with the tool we're going to take

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.089 
knives with the tool we're going to take
apart<00:03:24.910> then<00:03:25.269> we<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:26.379> put<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.620> back<00:03:26.739> in<00:03:26.980> our

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
any knife with a belt loop the rectifier

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.350 
any knife with a belt loop the rectifier
will<00:03:34.870> work<00:03:35.049> with<00:03:35.319> you<00:03:36.160> take<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.549> rectifier

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
will work with you take the rectifier

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.870 
will work with you take the rectifier
now<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:38.650> just<00:03:38.799> put<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.099> on<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.340> back<00:03:39.519> edge<00:03:39.760> of

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
now you just put it on the back edge of

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.240 
now you just put it on the back edge of
that<00:03:40.000> belt<00:03:40.329> loop<00:03:40.569> right<00:03:40.930> here<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.890> just<00:03:42.010> goes

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
that belt loop right here it just goes

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.630 
that belt loop right here it just goes
right<00:03:42.430> in<00:03:42.610> there<00:03:42.819> goes<00:03:43.810> around<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:45.430> comes

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
right in there goes around and it comes

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.960 
right in there goes around and it comes
down<00:03:45.879> like<00:03:45.940> this<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:47.560> take<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.129> you<00:03:48.700> lock

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
down like this you take it and you lock

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.890 
down like this you take it and you lock
over<00:03:49.299> and<00:03:49.629> then<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.680> could<00:03:50.860> take

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.470 

or<00:03:56.900> a<00:03:56.959> little<00:03:57.319> tie<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:58.730> you<00:03:59.060> just<00:03:59.209> wrap<00:03:59.450> it

without product the number without

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.170 
without product the number without
rectifier<00:04:21.349> is<00:04:22.099> probably<00:04:22.550> one<00:04:22.669> of<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:22.789> safest

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
rectifier is probably one of the safest

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.330 
rectifier is probably one of the safest
products<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.660> use<00:04:23.870> for<00:04:24.110> this<00:04:24.560> lower<00:04:24.800> area<00:04:25.099> if

I<00:04:26.870> did<00:04:27.259> this<00:04:27.410> video<00:04:27.740> file<00:04:28.130> with<00:04:29.120> bare<00:04:29.360> hands

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
I did this video file with bare hands

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.680 
I did this video file with bare hands
this<00:04:29.840> time<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:30.669> just<00:04:31.669> want<00:04:31.910> everybody<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.389> know
