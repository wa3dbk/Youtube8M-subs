00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.450
 that the demands of 4.9 to today we 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.730
 ends up for the fourth episode 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.160
 is surely one of the last 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.410
 about the city of sands like you 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.939
 see behind me it's the last 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.779
 days of the city before its closure 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.330
 which will be Saturday 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.279
 normally by eleva who so we go 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.190
 iron in hop view 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.210
 inside and in this video so 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.690
 just I'm doing a little review of my 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.160
 adventure a few days from the end so 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.730
 it's Wednesday and I'm going to make a 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.800
 small balance sheet 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.600
 so for me of my adventure since I 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.430
 do not think it finally tells me that it 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.940
 changes a lot compared to the end 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.239
 of the week 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.239
 I think finally gesture I hope you m 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.000
 it's called the end of the city ​​of 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.460
 sands the last minutes or even the 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.100
 last hours if I can live if 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.020
 I have time to get them back 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.979
 software etc 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.350
 so I'm going to start so I'm going 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.990
 to separate without negative point into positive what 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.310
 that's going to bring and etc 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.899
 we will start with the positives 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.280
 1 doel adventure first of all this 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.190
 adventure allowed me to meet 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.149
 people for example like cyrano so me 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.100
 what I liked about this adventure 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.930
 is that the big youtuber and the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.950
 little youtuber meet each other 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.610
 mix dirty how could I 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.530
 to say that hate each other in quotation marks and 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.770
 that's what really pleased me is that 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.569
 I know most of you 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.899
 watch this video are there thanks to his 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:50.060
 fans in relation to his live he 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.100
 had done and 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.170
 I know you're here most 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.990
 thanks to him so I thank you very much and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.250
 that's why I found that 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.630
 although we can mix and so 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.890
 not right that I take the maneuvers 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.399
 frigated outside I think the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.590
 positive points with ie that's it 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.759
 it was a great adventure finally it's 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.550
 still still and it will continue 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.150
 during lastly two three days this 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:22.130
 adventure we broke out well 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.239
 this app and delusions so here I 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.989
 think I could say that on 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.930
 the positives 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.019
 no I was talking about the negatives he 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.610
 there is not much 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.459
 finally if there is a guru actually who 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.260
 appears to me yeah I mean I want 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.010
 say in quotes warm tea but I 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.130
 think it's not the month that 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.080
 would curb employees that's it i'm been 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.819
 a bit surprised at the maturity of 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.489
 some youtuber and some 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.989
 people who finally you she's going that 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.590
 happened was based on trust 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.870
 for to recruit people for the city 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.970
 that's right he said on twitter who 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.090
 would like and his dreams he had to also 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.109
 receive messages on skype but 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.370
 it's true that it's a bit based on the 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.350
 trust and what shocked me a bit 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.510
 it's the maturity of some people 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.430
 I do not have to say that I have a mature 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.989
 exceptional either but I think 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.420
 still be a more mature minimum 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.700
 that some people I quote you 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.959
 Examples without citing 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.010
 people for example 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.810
 in my opinion you doubt it we have a 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.220
 protection around the city they have 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.870
 bounded by the feet that in my opinion 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.870
 you know it and 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.840
 the game turns 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.360
 hop so I said that so like you 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.440
 know there are pillars around the 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.730
 quoted and in fact there are some 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.810
 people actually making potions 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.180
 and who balances them directly 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.670
 inside the city ​​and therefore salty in 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.620
 big yesterday I got killed twice 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.060
 because of potions that have been thrown at 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.260
 the interest of the city so we can even 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.060
 could stay safe 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.600
 finally inside this city 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.650
 who is supposed to be protected without pvp 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.760
 normal and otherwise it's just 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.890
 to go they wedding turf all 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.299
 simply we are without protection without 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.640
 nothing and when you see that there is a 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.709
 full diam's who comes to expect us 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.030
 at the exit of the limits of the city 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.320
 it's not for me it's not 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.480
 especially when we're getting trimballe 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.560
 duster would just have to go a little bit 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.640
 to wander and that we are between 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.590
 quotes that chain because they 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.980
 finally do like me who would just like 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.980
 visit 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.380
 this is a little bit finally not hesitated 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.060
 but going to explore a toaster must not 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.220
 to be killed and yesterday that's what I 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.970
 see these are just two examples 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.060
 that I quote them here just for 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.730
 the small points the positives and 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.210
 negatives of the palace adventure always 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.440
 not open of course so after I you 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.870
 talked about the risks that it brings me is 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.350
 so just is it okay 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.780
 bring down you thanks to his fans at 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.620
 so who made a huge publicity blow 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.540
 during a live and then yona he has when 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.780
 even a little who subscribed is going a 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.430
 majority who subscribed to the chain 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.639
 for the content precisely that made me 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.249
 very pleasure 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.560
 could that have brought me the 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.699
 may see me soon on my channel 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.699
 I will not say more 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.879
 maybe there are seven months kim and 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.590
 guess it in the comments but I 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.639
 say no more is that some 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.310
 thing may be that they risk 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.479
 to arrive 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.490
 otherwise , what will it bring 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.830
 my low it was two awesome weeks in 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.969
 company of two full of people 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.069
 that I know and that is that I 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:49.430
 did not know beautiful encounters 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:50.689
 also of course not to say that have 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.909
 makes that bad encounters in 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:55.900
 this game anyway it was an adventure 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:59.120
 huge hoping for a season 2 since 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.590
 saw how these parties saw how you 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.129
 have you watched you followed 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.889
 you even discovered us through 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:09.560
 the city of sands it brings a plus 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.790
 that I think that no minecraft series 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.150
 will have relative 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.380
 to the extent that she could have a 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.800
 some youtuber who did it 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.080
 know 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.490
 the vaccine to young people I remember 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.650
 you put that if that's what I 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.780
 could say other I think it's 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.780
 just stay just a little message for 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.090
 you to have the end for you for 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.440
 talk a little bit to take stock of 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.440
 the adventurous just a few days from the end 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.140
 yeah you're adventuring nice that I 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.260
 will probably do it again if I'm invited 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.440
 if there is a season 2 a day anyway 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.930
 I hope it otherwise I think that Friday 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.510
 you will have the basic fashion preview so the 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.850
 any last bass that we have so 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.880
 just after the loss so from the base 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.230
 watermelons that was done so the 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.610
 drop exceeds and that was destroyed by 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.130
 ipe yesterday anyway she was only serving 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:07.090
 more for nothing since the pnj watermelons 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:11.319
 was removed so that's when we have 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:13.400
 even proved our pleasure but 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:14.800

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.620
 good note at the end so saturday 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.720

 Hello everyone
