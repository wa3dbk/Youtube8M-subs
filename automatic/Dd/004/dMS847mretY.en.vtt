00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.690
 One of the kids is already here, no 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.160
 an advanced warfighter video and this 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.349
 Once you have a confirmed low departure 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.210
 on violin good I'll put with the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.549
 ball with silencer and charger has 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.010
 expanded and streaky because the pen and the v 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.200
 the guard birt the defense script me 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.110
 it seems this time so let's see if 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.980
 we can link the little bit on this map 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.980
 green moment 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.590
 game in this module that I usually spend 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480
 is what I throw myself back through the sheets 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.720
 to sack and I usually send many 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.640
 times because I do not look anymore or where they are 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.430
 the enemies I will go crazy for the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.180
 veneer let's go 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.180
 being here 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.750
 behind look at it 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.750
 let's run run 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.110
 we caught is I have behind 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.100
 you 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.470
 also 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.000
 or where it comes out 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.240
 now let's go here 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.970
 this does not go this or yes 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.460
 you do not know 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.460
 it does not come out so let's wait 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.150
 the variable of telmo I have we are going to 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.520
 have it and see if it's worth hits 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.740
 Well, let's see if that's how we see ourselves 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.460
 little bit better let's go 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.630
 I still think someone 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.310
 and another and another on the corner 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.540
 come on come on we have the guards 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.790
 you commit this is not normal that you 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.549
 seen this less bad 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.170
 It is worth 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.490
 eat now I will catch up to the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.490

 of octopus are we going 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.819
 ok i'm going to keep moving though 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.400
 it seems that everyone looks around here so 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.249
 let's fuck how he gets this is that with 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.190
 silencer does not just lose the one of its 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:49.160
 rifle this avenger 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.190
 to see if they could be chapitas look uncle 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.010
 that reach that has I can not I have not 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.819
 able to catch that we will support this 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.280
 to see surcharge 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.770
 I do not know right now where they come from but I 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.550
 It seems that around here 6 look around here 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.590
 it does not come 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.590
 I have seen but it does not come to see it above 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.739
 it is far worth it worth me 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.739
 there are 75 points left for him to see yes 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.980
 if I can catch the plate is 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.120
 we caught someone else around here has a 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.700
 wind they're coming out of here 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.600
 so let's see 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.530
 very far not uncle 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.420
 It happened has not happened but let him 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.010
 it's worth but the p 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.240
 let's see if I can bust the turret that 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.240
 then so that it does not exist 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.550
 let's go for now we're going to burst 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.350
 this 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.350
 busted and me 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.730
 I'm going to bring you guards and cover a 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.560
 little more it seems to come all for 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.730
 here while you go 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.730
 while looking 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.550
 There is another and another does not fuck you 28-3 mother 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.200
 mine come let's see if I can take out 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.220
 another recipe like the one before that 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.220
 been pretty cool 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.230
 as you know here 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.580
 I have everyone here is like how 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.580
 we do but they come they come 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.770
 to see that it did not come out okay there is another eye 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.240
 I have everyone here I'm not going up 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.240
 to see if someone from here 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.430
 then given this entry 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.229
 let's see why I have them for the 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.229
 left 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.900
 no fuck is that I can not go after something 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.900
 also everywhere 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.060
 the truth that goes super well in your 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.969
 stage function that even connected the 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.489
 silencer is flippant what kills 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:11.229
 and now they take it from me let's give the 

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:14.110
 back around here better to see if I can 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:17.339
 catch the most slowly not because it is 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.339
 that I get to the mogollÃ³n 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:26.289
 Y 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:30.099
 You see, come on, come on, it looks like they're going to 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.460
 come out here and from this part I do not 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.460
 like 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.330
 look uncle down the middle aisle 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.720
 I still do not just leave sorry come 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.580
 come on 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.360
 and follow me 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.949
 let's go 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.870
 the one that seems to come around here for the 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.870
 half if there are a few here 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.880
 p 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.460
 hydro 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.770
 We're going over there 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.830
 be here are here 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:14.600
 it's so fast 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.600
 You can go from far as it costs 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.250
 OK 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.650
 I'm going to recharge I've always gone 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.750
 fast charger 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:34.060
 many times after I was left without 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:35.229
 ammunition that's why I do not have 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.540
 a lot for the network to know if we can 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.340
 secure a little 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.680
 and he was not playing he had gone out there 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.960
 or what was this man doing but good 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.960
 to throw this to see that I do not get caught 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.310
 look first where are we going to this the 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.830
 my own 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.800
 Red 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:59.800
 you'll see because there's another one we're going to 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.289
 bombs there are two more uncle can not be 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.669
 my mother 47 6 come 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:06.669
 there is almost no time left 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:16.849
 and the other one that was shooting 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:20.889
 he has not caught me is fine by here yes 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:20.889
 look let's go let's go 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.470
 should not wake the mother plates 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.300
 mine what an incredible departure especially the 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.210
 first hairline that started there butt 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.490
 it's been pretty cool game 49 to 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.440
 738 confirmed casualties should not 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.539
 have caught as many but good as yes 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.759
 that helps a lot to get the 

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:44.639
 streak and that after I was already 

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:46.319
 I was playing quite a lot and I already 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.509
 killed there was having the streak and I 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:50.630
 so they caught between 3 or 4 above in this 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:54.030
 map which are the corridors so 

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:56.520
 pretty short you do not appear there by 

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.169
 all the corridors and they caught me then 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.800
 every two times three but well I hope that 

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:00.800
 you liked it
