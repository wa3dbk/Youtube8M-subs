dun dun I'm looking through my camera so
it's<00:05:00.510> hard<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.720> see<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.170> note<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.860> then<00:05:02.430> you

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
it's hard to see the note and then you

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.750 
it's hard to see the note and then you
skip<00:05:02.820> all<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.180> way<00:05:03.300> down<00:05:03.510> right<00:05:04.230> here<00:05:04.380> and

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
skip all the way down right here and

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:13.970 
skip all the way down right here and
then<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:06.000> go<00:05:06.150> right<00:05:06.360> here<00:05:12.470> then<00:05:13.470> go<00:05:13.620> up<00:05:13.740> here

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
then you go right here then go up here

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.960 
then you go right here then go up here
so<00:05:15.740> you<00:05:16.740> might<00:05:16.920> have<00:05:17.040> to<00:05:17.190> watch<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.670> little

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
so you might have to watch that a little

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.390 
so you might have to watch that a little
bit<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.870> then<00:05:18.990> go<00:05:19.380> back<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:19.830> watch<00:05:19.950> it<00:05:20.190> but

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
yeah so that's that so at the end it

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:31.820 
yeah so that's that so at the end it
should<00:05:23.220> sound<00:05:23.550> like

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.950 

and<00:05:51.490> pretty<00:05:51.730> much<00:05:51.910> is<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.060> same<00:05:52.420> thing

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
and pretty much is the same thing

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.450 
and pretty much is the same thing
if<00:05:54.960> you're<00:05:55.140> using<00:05:55.350> three<00:05:55.710> fingers<00:05:55.800> to<00:05:56.280> watch
