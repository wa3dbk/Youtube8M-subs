00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.530
 bench press lying one of the most popular 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.580
 Exercise Many say that 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.029
 doing 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.700
 iron lost speed and lost 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.910
 quality yes it is not for many 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.700
 gym workouts like 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.550
 addition to the general occupation of combat 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.220
 the arts will be very helpful here 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.360
 the most important thing to put right with you 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.680
 purpose and understand that if you 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.540
 drummer then your 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.640
 training programs will be 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.170
 radically different those who 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.820
 only engaged in powerlifting or 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.650
 bodybuilding is different things different 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.860
 goals ie your program will be 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.589
 much easier and much more modest you 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.680
 you will take one exercise as a basis 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.110
 suppose it could be if 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.860
 lying and add a few 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.550
 isolating exercises involved 11 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.250
 week as an addition but on permanent 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.310
 word you increase your show when 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:22.310
 provided you eat well 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.460
 at least 4 times a day or maybe 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.060
 more than 6 in small portions more 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.140
 number of times and this is not a secret and 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.290
 recovery meaning you must be good 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.950
 rest relax the easiest way 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.710
 it is normal sleep that is you lie down and 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.479
 get up without others to choose for yourself 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.580
 such lies that you got up without 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:50.390
 alarm clock and how to determine for yourself those 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.090
 indicators that would be ideal for 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.259
 for example you have body weight 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.800
 suppose 70 kilogram is in the bench press 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.710
 for you a very good result will be 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.940
 if you go out on your own body weight 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.649
 that is, you will work 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.200
 70 kg approximately 6-10 times 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.989
 if you go out at figure 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.810
 its own weight of 70 kilograms 80 on 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.610
 6-10 times they are already more serious 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.640
 figure but if you add to 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.590
 to own weight of 20 kilograms it will be 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.019
 more than enough here 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.319
 today let me try to make 100 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:40.349
 kilogram for 10 races 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:42.769
 own body weight guided by 85 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.769
 kilogram 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.790
 thank you all and until next time
