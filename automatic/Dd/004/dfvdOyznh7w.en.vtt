00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 this mysterious ancient and artificial 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.350
 seven-pointed star of origin 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.450
 unknown call hole star of 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.550
 return was discovered in Norway and its 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.799
 remarkable structure provides evidence of the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.640
 existence of advanced technology in the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.350
 seniority on November 30, 2007 a 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.480
 construction worker is 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.369
 found with this hole drilled from 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.170
 seven tips on the basis of a 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.080
 mountain during the works of 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.910
 construction of a new parking 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 So far it seems that nobody has 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.530
 seen a hole similar to the star 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.489
 seven-pronged or has been able to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.110
 explain how geologists were made 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.809
 Drilling engineers scientists in 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 the whole country have been contacted but 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.950
 So far no one has arrived with 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.920
 an answer to how this was done 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.500
 remarkable hole after digging some 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.079
 meters inside the mountain cutting 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.449
 great chunks of rock the worker of 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.039
 the construction noticed a strange hole 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.590
 in the form of a star in two of the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.600
 boulders the hole was very 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.210
 deep and went into the middle of the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.310
 ground with a downward angle of 20 to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.310
 30 degrees 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.549
 unfortunately the hole was covered with 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.350
 mud and still has not recovered but 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.720
 according to those who saw it too 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.899
 It had the shape of a seven star 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.780
 tips approximately four meters from 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.210
 hole was dug from the mountain in 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.310
 the top of the mountain was a layer of 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.759
 clay and earth that according to the neighbors 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.950
 they have never been touched the last time 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.979
 there was some construction activity in 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.200
 the area was in the 50s when a 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.810
 part of the mountain was diverted to 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.299
 create parking spaces 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.399
 either way the hole was found 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.020
 several meters inside the edge 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.840
 from the area where the construction 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.360
 previous was carried out inside the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.970
 hole is completely smooth and the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.429
 seven points about six centimeters 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.619
 diameter have a perfectly shape 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.649
 symmetrical and with a background that has the 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.840
 very smooth surface and polished the hole 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.869
 follow directly through the layers 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.000
 of sediments not in parallel many 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.220
 theories have been presented about the 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.090
 origin of the hole but so far 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.280
 none 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.160
 has been able to explain its origin or 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.650
 technology used to create it the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.050
 ancient inhabitants of the earth possessed 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.940
 advanced drilling technology and 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.129
 the evidence can be found in 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.750
 all corners of the world 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.090
 the prehistoric builders 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.310
 they used stones the material of 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.860
 harder coating found in the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.470
 Earth to create holes perfectly 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.569
 rounded we do not know what kind of 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.840
 machinery was used to create these 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.329
 perfect holes we also do not know what 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.730
 kind of unknown civilization possessed 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.160
 those remarkable engineering skills 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.380
 of the stone in antiquity these 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.900
 stones that are very hard and yet 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.209
 someone used impressive technique of 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.129
 Cutting holes in the stone reveals 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.319
 that our ancestors were 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.780
 familiar with a very technology 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.069
 advanced that we have been unable to 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.069
 use in modern times
