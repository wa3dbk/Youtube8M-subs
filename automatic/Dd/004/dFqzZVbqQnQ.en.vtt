 in this tournament you had anyway 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.640
 a hen that was not very simple 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.930
 especially with the sbs that you are 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.160
 all the same happy to have managed to 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.510
 to pass the hens is that coming 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.100
 maybe that was your goal 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.230
 you really wanted to go further 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.560
 it was the goal of the team to pass 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.379
 hens 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.299
 we managed to lose 3 go of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.369
 the normal species then to win both 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.689
 matches that remain and so we have enough 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.790
 pleased with our journey in 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.369

 you are still top 13 16 worldwide 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.909
 it's not nothing especially when we see the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.310
 this is the best of the best teams 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.600
 global who are here is that that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.729
 encourages you for the rest of the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.409
 season and what are you going for suddenly 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.209
 really turn to Europe for 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.880
 the rest of the competitions and we'll see 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.409

 we will also see everyone at home and we 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.799
 decide what will happen 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.240
 very well then more compared to 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.159
 tournaments what do you think of 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.569
 level of play here to you who participated 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.979
 really has a lot 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.259
 competitions in France and Europe 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.939
 is it really a level 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.609
 totally different it's completely 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.259
 different to France already europe 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.509
 hayatou are all the best players of the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.679
 world it can be anyone even 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.880
 Australian occupants who is 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.499
 that they were void actually they are 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.369
 super strong and they beat almost 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.170
 everyone has it for now 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.099
 are at the leader braga of always so he 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.869
 must pay attention to everyone 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.029
 to be thorough on all matches and 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.709
 it is to do everything very well what 

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:09.179
 team what team your most 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.170
 impressed apart from two precisely the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.740
 Australian you said it's the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.360
 teams that have most impressed 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.220
 for the moment we will go optical 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.200
 we really did not expect this level 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.160
 there especially after the 3-0 defeat this morning 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.080
 when the pilots are koala 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.920
 in the semifinals in 2006 our nerves they have 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.570
 beat the usb 3 2 no kate as usual they 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.520
 are as usual nobody 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.520
 wait there and in the big moment they 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.320
 are on the bo xi school what's changing 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.670
 not a team that wins 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.340
 exactly then I'm going to ask you your 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.040
 prognosis for the top 3 in this 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.630
 event and in your opinion between tcm and 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.500
 also shelling because there are on the 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.310
 many people's lips what is 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.700
 the team that will do the best 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.700
 result 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.920
 I think it's going to be very pounding 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.320
 online seats that will be taken will be 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.670
 priced but in lan are too tense on 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.140
 looks like they're missing they'll have less 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.370
 that little by little trick to be 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:03.040
 stronger for me if the drivers 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:06.370
 present but in hero's school 1st 1st obtuse 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.230
 4 msv very well and a word about 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.640
 rises that they are always in the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.970
 picture that has just won their 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.680
 3-0 match against immunities 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.690
 there they will have a very good match 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.830
 complicated against sb you played them yesterday 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.750
 do you think it's feasible 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.540
 that's how it's going to get stronger 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.709
 so if they take as would say 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.270
 that they do not take the lead to say that 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.310
 it's dna and it takes too much beam 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.410
 stronger than if I match you 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.970
 on a background and they can win very 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.830
 Well I'll just put a final 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.930
 question what do you think of this 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.180
 event that's from where you 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.040
 we are the stations of the mini-stage etc. 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.810
 it's huge it's in front of the staples 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.680
 center 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.880
 the coaches and from the outside I thought 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.800
 not that it was like that it's a bit 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.150
 for me it's a bit nil on the outside 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.950
 the coach went inside it's 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.709
 Huge all big is America 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.209
 sticks very well good congratulations for 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.070
 your journey did you still do 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.660
 a very beautiful course this output of 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.550
 chickens you lost against 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.989
 best teams in the world pretty much I 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.550
 think all of France is really 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.459
 very proud of the course you did 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.500

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.709
 from the rest of the stay and leave the word of 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.230
