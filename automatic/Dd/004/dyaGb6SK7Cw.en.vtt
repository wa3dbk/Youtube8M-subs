hi<00:00:01.040> last<00:00:02.040> time<00:00:02.220> we<00:00:02.340> saw<00:00:02.490> how<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.669> make<00:00:02.820> an

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hi last time we saw how to make an

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.220 
hi last time we saw how to make an
action<00:00:03.210> that<00:00:03.270> would<00:00:03.419> give<00:00:03.570> us<00:00:03.659> wood<00:00:03.810> grain<00:00:04.049> in

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
action that would give us wood grain in

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.200 
action that would give us wood grain in
two<00:00:04.350> colors<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:05.430> time<00:00:05.640> we're<00:00:05.759> going<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.970> use

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
two colors this time we're going to use

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.940 
two colors this time we're going to use
or<00:00:06.420> possibly<00:00:06.779> abuse<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.230> action<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:07.799> we

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
or possibly abuse that action so that we

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.169 
or possibly abuse that action so that we
can<00:00:08.099> make<00:00:08.189> wood<00:00:08.400> that<00:00:08.550> has<00:00:08.670> more<00:00:08.910> than<00:00:09.059> two

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
can make wood that has more than two

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.240 
can make wood that has more than two
colors<00:00:09.480> in<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:10.469> don't<00:00:10.650> need<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.800> just<00:00:11.070> run

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
colors in it you don't need to just run

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.290 
colors in it you don't need to just run
actions<00:00:11.639> from<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.849> top<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.210> bottom

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
actions from the top to the bottom

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.330 
actions from the top to the bottom
without<00:00:12.570> stopping<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.500> can<00:00:13.650> use<00:00:13.799> pieces<00:00:14.070> of

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
without stopping you can use pieces of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.770 
without stopping you can use pieces of
them<00:00:14.490> or<00:00:14.670> interrupt<00:00:15.059> them<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.240> return<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.660> them

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
them or interrupt them in return to them

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.109 
them or interrupt them in return to them
let's<00:00:16.320> see<00:00:16.500> how<00:00:16.619> by<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.490> way<00:00:17.609> if<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.820> haven't

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
let's see how by the way if you haven't

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.010 
let's see how by the way if you haven't
made<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.330> action<00:00:18.600> then<00:00:18.720> you'll<00:00:18.810> probably

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
made the action then you'll probably

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.420 
made the action then you'll probably
want<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.470> take<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> look<00:00:19.890> at<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.039> last<00:00:20.220> tutorial

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
layers in a different document and I'm

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.800 
layers in a different document and I'm
just<00:02:29.970> going<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.180> hold<00:02:30.330> down<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.570> shift<00:02:30.600> key

just going to hold down the shift key

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.390 
just going to hold down the shift key
and<00:02:31.050> drag<00:02:31.290> them<00:02:31.410> into<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.620> one<00:02:31.890> shift

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.890 
and drag them into this one shift
constrains<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> position<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.690> they'll

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
constrains the position so that they'll

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.240 
constrains the position so that they'll
land<00:02:34.110> exactly<00:02:34.290> where<00:02:34.709> they<00:02:34.800> were<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.070> last

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
document since they were the same size

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.050 
document since they were the same size
they'll<00:02:37.080> be<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.290> right<00:02:37.410> place<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.850> as<00:02:38.970> you

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
they'll be in the right place and as you

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.660 
they'll be in the right place and as you
can<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.209> we<00:02:39.540> don't<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.500> use<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
can see we don't have to just use the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.150 
can see we don't have to just use the
regular<00:02:41.720> blend<00:02:42.720> mode<00:02:42.959> with<00:02:43.290> one<00:02:43.920> hundred

percent<00:02:44.190> opacity<00:02:44.459> this<00:02:45.330> one<00:02:45.510> I've<00:02:45.600> set<00:02:45.810> to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
percent opacity this one I've set to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.930 
percent opacity this one I've set to
overlay<00:02:46.260> at<00:02:46.380> eighty-three<00:02:46.739> percent<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.730> one

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
overlay at eighty-three percent this one

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.210 
overlay at eighty-three percent this one
is<00:02:48.060> multiply<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:49.350> one<00:02:49.590> I've<00:02:49.739> set<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.100> normal

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
is multiply this one I've set to normal

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.560 
is multiply this one I've set to normal
but<00:02:50.459> it's<00:02:50.580> eighty-seven<00:02:51.180> percent<00:02:51.209> opacity

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
but it's eighty-seven percent opacity

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.920 
but it's eighty-seven percent opacity
this<00:02:52.470> one<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.800> set<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.070> color<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:53.940> so

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
this one is set to color and so on so

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.180 
this one is set to color and so on so
once<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.230> have<00:02:55.410> all<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.860> these<00:02:55.950> different

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
once you have all of these different

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.860 
once you have all of these different
colors<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.730> there<00:02:56.970> are<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.060> lot<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.300> colors<00:02:57.690> now

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
colors and there are a lot of colors now

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.990 
colors and there are a lot of colors now
in<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.459> make<00:02:59.580> them<00:02:59.700> all<00:02:59.760> into<00:02:59.880> a

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
in this you have to make them all into a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.340 
in this you have to make them all into a
single<00:03:00.030> layer<00:03:00.510> in<00:03:00.630> order<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.930> take<00:03:01.080> them<00:03:01.230> into

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
single layer in order to take them into

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.350 
single layer in order to take them into
the<00:03:01.440> liquify<00:03:02.070> filter<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:02.940> i'm<00:03:03.000> going<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.239> hold

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the liquify filter so i'm going to hold

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.810 
the liquify filter so i'm going to hold
down<00:03:03.450> shift<00:03:03.900> option<00:03:04.200> command<00:03:04.470> that's<00:03:05.310> shift

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
down shift option command that's shift

wood grain in all kinds of colors which
looks<00:03:57.600> really<00:03:57.900> good<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:59.060> I<00:04:00.060> still<00:04:00.480> have<00:04:00.630> all<00:04:00.720> of

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
these layers down here so if I wanted to

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.430 
these layers down here so if I wanted to
I<00:04:02.549> could<00:04:02.940> hide<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> composite<00:04:03.989> change<00:04:04.290> the

I could hide the composite change the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.130 
I could hide the composite change the
opacity<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:05.070> could<00:04:05.820> rearrange<00:04:06.299> them<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:06.930> could

opacity I could rearrange them I could

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.680 
opacity I could rearrange them I could
do<00:04:07.230> all<00:04:07.380> sorts<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.709> things<00:04:07.769> change<00:04:08.070> the

do all sorts of things change the
various<00:04:09.690> masks<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.650> were<00:04:10.829> on<00:04:10.950> them<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.250> then

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
various masks that were on them and then

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.620 
various masks that were on them and then
I<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.120> run<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.269> new<00:04:12.420> composite<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:12.989> have<00:04:13.380> the

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
I can run a new composite and have the

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.849 
I can run a new composite and have the
different<00:04:15.630> wood<00:04:15.720> in<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.930> same<00:04:16.140> basic<00:04:16.620> colors

different wood in the same basic colors

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.130 
different wood in the same basic colors
I<00:04:17.070> can<00:04:17.310> do<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:17.489> sorts<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.820> stuff<00:04:18.019> doing<00:04:19.019> it

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
I can do all sorts of stuff doing it

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.719 
I can do all sorts of stuff doing it
this<00:04:19.169> way<00:04:19.260> is<00:04:19.410> very<00:04:19.829> flexible<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.549> it's

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
this way is very flexible and it's

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.130 
this way is very flexible and it's
really<00:04:21.000> easy<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.299> get<00:04:21.479> whatever<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:21.930> that

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
really easy to get whatever it is that

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.219 
really easy to get whatever it is that
you<00:04:22.200> want<00:04:22.700> so<00:04:23.700> that's<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.120> next<00:04:25.020> time<00:04:25.140> we'll

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
you want so that's that next time we'll

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.420 
you want so that's that next time we'll
take<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.410> look<00:04:25.560> at<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.710> simpler<00:04:26.070> wood<00:04:26.250> grain

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
take a look at a simpler wood grain

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.620 
take a look at a simpler wood grain
that's<00:04:26.610> easier<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:26.940> make<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.330> so

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
that's easier to make and so

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.810 
that's easier to make and so
for<00:04:27.900> small<00:04:28.110> areas<00:04:28.140> until<00:04:28.740> then<00:04:29.430> this<00:04:29.550> has<00:04:29.700> been

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
for small areas until then this has been

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.250 
for small areas until then this has been
Robin<00:04:30.120> wood<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.480> I<00:04:30.720> hope<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:30.990> found<00:04:31.140> this

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
Robin wood and I hope you found this
