the front do that I used an antenna
small<00:02:05.900> and<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.080> sunk<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:06.470> into<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.799> ground<00:02:06.920> and

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
small and I sunk it into the ground and

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.590

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
something that you normally you've got a

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.620

little<00:02:12.920> bit<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.340> curve<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.970> generally

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
little bit of a curve to it generally

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.810 
little bit of a curve to it generally
speaking<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.260> guess<00:02:15.890> not<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.340> much<00:02:16.489> if<00:02:16.670> it's

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
speaking I guess not so much if it's

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.280 
speaking I guess not so much if it's
made<00:02:17.090> out<00:02:17.239> of<00:02:17.269> metal<00:02:17.480> or<00:02:17.720> wood<00:02:17.930> or<00:02:17.959> whatever

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
made out of metal or wood or whatever

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.070 
made out of metal or wood or whatever
but<00:02:18.760> i'm<00:02:19.760> thinking<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.239> cloth<00:02:20.540> awnings<00:02:20.930> here

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
but i'm thinking of cloth awnings here

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.900 
but i'm thinking of cloth awnings here
so<00:02:21.230> i<00:02:21.290> used<00:02:21.560> wall<00:02:21.860> curves<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.400> i<00:02:22.459> put<00:02:22.640> them<00:02:22.760> on

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
so i used wall curves and i put them on

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.460 
so i used wall curves and i put them on
a<00:02:22.940> little<00:02:23.329> bit<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.540> an<00:02:23.630> angle<00:02:23.840> i<00:02:23.959> believe<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.380> is

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
a little bit of an angle i believe it is

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.340 
a little bit of an angle i believe it is
a<00:02:24.530> 10-degree<00:02:25.250> angle<00:02:25.280> forward<00:02:26.230> discreet<00:02:27.230> that

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
a 10-degree angle forward discreet that

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.750 
a 10-degree angle forward discreet that
drooping<00:02:27.829> effect<00:02:28.130> make<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.459> little<00:02:28.549> bit

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
drooping effect make it a little bit

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.430
