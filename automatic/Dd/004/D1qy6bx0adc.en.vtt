00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.529
 hi guys today another self help 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.540
 injured in search of a sweet that is 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.519
 street food for the celiac 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.380
 so that it does not contain group traces 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.360
 but at the same time I also want a 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 sweet without butter because it is less pure 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.160
 I put better stop but in these books 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 guys there are all the sweets that you don't 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.310
 when exactly my case 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.650
 then you know what I do, I invent it 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.890
 and you want muffins without it 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.410
 gluten without butter we prepare together 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.000
 to prepare 10 12 muffins are 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:39.180
 250 g of fresh ricotta are required 60 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.030
 grams of fructose or 120 g of 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.980
 sucrose then classic sugar 3 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.850
 eggs 15 grams of bitter cocoa powder 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:54.260
 70 grams of cornstarch 8 grams of yeast 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.789
 for desserts and a pinch of salt 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.340
 we would start with the careful 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.320
 we move by an electric mixer and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:10.200
 we pour the three eggs then we add the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.729
 fructose a small piece of salt 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.729
 and we operate in everything 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.990
 now that we have also mixed the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.840
 ricotta cheese 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.640
 if we make cocoa together with 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.750
 cornstarch in a small bowl and we help each other 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 with help in a spoon and together 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.880
 we are also the baking powder 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.460
 and now let's add the 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:50.130
 our cocoa mixture and spoons 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.380
 another time ricotta and this is the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.150
 consistency in our cream for the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.560
 marketing 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.370
 here I prepared a mold 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.320
 classic for muffins and now let's go to 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.610
 place the paper cups in a paper 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.370
 silicone 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.100
 how you find yourself better and then we'll go to 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.780
 fill all the cups up to the three 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.780
 quarters in capacity 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.690
 here we are already filling up mine 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.060
 internships with a ladle with the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.620
 spout livi advice so avoided by 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.780
 dirty anyway if you don't have the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.210
 You can paper or silicone cups 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.220
 also use the simple mold though 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.380
 I recommend buttered and before 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.540
 even floured a little oil 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.010
 and a bit of corn starch in this case 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.320
 in the meantime and I recommend installments of 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.890
 preheat the oven to 180 degrees 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.870
 I filled 10 muffin cups e 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.730
 now we can then bake in the oven 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.459
 warm 180 degrees for about 15 minutes later 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.709
 the chieti you will let rest inside 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.769
 of the oven two more minutes and then there 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.780
 you can churn out if you want a muffin from 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.480
 tender heart on a bike and I recommend one 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.850
 culture always at 180 degrees but for 12 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.650
 minutes and then turn them out immediately like this 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.270
 will indeed very soft heart 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.850
 inside of 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.420
 but ready to be served to yours 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.580
 guests 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.410
 if you want to make them even nicer 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.600
 you can cover me like a class of 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.370
 zhouqu someone icing chocolate 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.410
 But this time I prefer you this way 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.410
 simple natural like video pope
