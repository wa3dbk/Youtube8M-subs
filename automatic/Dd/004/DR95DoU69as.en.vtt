00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.999 
all the clutter from the spawn area and
that<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.030> actually<00:00:12.330> ended<00:00:12.719> up<00:00:12.929> concluding<00:00:13.410> the

that I actually ended up concluding the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.630 
that I actually ended up concluding the
spawn<00:00:14.309> building<00:00:14.880> itself<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:16.139> actually<00:00:17.130> got

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
spawn building itself I actually got

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.560 
spawn building itself I actually got
dealt<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.420> record<00:00:18.890> me<00:00:19.890> destroying<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:21.150> the

dealt to record me destroying the the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.150 
dealt to record me destroying the the
old<00:00:21.689> spawn<00:00:22.020> building<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> old<00:00:22.890> shop

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
old spawn building and the old shop

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.880 
old spawn building and the old shop
building<00:00:24.080> it<00:00:25.080> was<00:00:25.199> time<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.410> build<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.859> new

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
building it was time to build a new

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.689 
building it was time to build a new
spawn<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.060> new<00:00:27.210> shop<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.340> so<00:00:29.340> yeah<00:00:29.490> it's

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
spawn and a new shop and so yeah it's

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.600 
spawn and a new shop and so yeah it's
time<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.090> these<00:00:30.179> guys<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> go<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.710> had<00:00:32.099> been<00:00:32.309> I'd

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
time for these guys to go I had been I'd

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.760 
time for these guys to go I had been I'd
have<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> bunch<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.329> ideas<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.989> far<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
have a bunch of ideas as far as what to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.880 
have a bunch of ideas as far as what to
build<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.640> spawn<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:37.440> nothing<00:00:37.739> really

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
build for the spawn but nothing really

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.310 
build for the spawn but nothing really
specific<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.540> then<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.809> had<00:00:39.960> found<00:00:40.200> that

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
specific but then I had found that

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.639 
specific but then I had found that
critter<00:00:40.770> had<00:00:41.070> made<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:42.079> monument<00:00:43.079> type

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
critter had made this monument type

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.569 
critter had made this monument type
thing<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.530> kind<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.860> copied<00:00:47.460> it

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
thing and so I just kind of copied it

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.080 
thing and so I just kind of copied it
over<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.149> modified<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.320> used<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.370> sort

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
over and modified it and used it as sort

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.619 
over and modified it and used it as sort
of<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.390> template<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.670> makes<00:00:53.670> make<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> new<00:00:54.329> spawn

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
of a template to makes make a new spawn

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.529 
of a template to makes make a new spawn
I<00:00:55.100> guess<00:00:56.100> still<00:00:56.340> build<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> wall<00:00:56.910> around<00:00:57.270> it

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
I guess still build the wall around it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.099 
I guess still build the wall around it
we<00:00:58.230> built<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.559> bunch<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.829> other<00:00:59.010> stuff<00:00:59.100> nearby<00:01:00.109> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
we built a bunch of other stuff nearby I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.619 
we built a bunch of other stuff nearby I
built<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.920> biodome<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> middle<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
built the biodome in the middle of it

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.410 
built the biodome in the middle of it
that<00:01:03.870> was<00:01:04.019> delts<00:01:04.470> idea<00:01:04.970> he<00:01:05.970> had<00:01:06.060> helped<00:01:06.299> me

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that was delts idea he had helped me

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.910 
that was delts idea he had helped me
build<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.689> small<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.350> decided<00:01:07.740> it

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
build a small one but I decided it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.550 
build a small one but I decided it
needed<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.310> bigger<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> extra

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
needed to be bigger and then the extra

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.730 
needed to be bigger and then the extra
waterfall<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.280> top<00:01:11.869> yeah<00:01:12.869> i<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.170> added<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
waterfall on top yeah i just added a

um but yeah I just I feel like it makes
a<00:01:36.270> cool<00:01:36.509> place<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.970> for<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.299> start<00:01:39.570> out

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
a cool place for for you to start out

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.240 
a cool place for for you to start out
when<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.079> start<00:01:40.439> out<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> server<00:01:41.040> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
when you start out on the server it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.039 
when you start out on the server it
makes<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> good<00:01:42.150> first<00:01:42.990> impression<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:45.049> feel

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
makes for a good first impression I feel

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.660 
makes for a good first impression I feel
like<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> old<00:01:46.500> spawn<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.130> seemed<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.490> little

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
like the old spawn just seemed a little

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.210 
like the old spawn just seemed a little
bit<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.210> don't<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.659> amateur<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.500> guess<00:01:50.040> it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
bit I don't know amateur I guess it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.190 
bit I don't know amateur I guess it
really<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.579> was<00:01:50.790> far<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.509> was<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
really it was far as I was the like the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.770 
really it was far as I was the like the
very<00:01:52.290> first<00:01:52.590> thing<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> built<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.700> it

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
very first thing that I built I it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.120 
very first thing that I built I it
opened<00:01:54.780> up<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> server<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.500> public<00:01:55.950> there

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
opened up the server to the public there

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.280 
opened up the server to the public there
was<00:01:56.310> no<00:01:56.460> buildings<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.060> nothing<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.630> that's

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
was no buildings or nothing and that's

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.020 
was no buildings or nothing and that's
what<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.560> started<00:01:59.009> building<00:01:59.340> before<00:01:59.490> anybody

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
what I started building before anybody

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.220 
what I started building before anybody
else<00:02:00.240> even<00:02:00.479> joined<00:02:01.049> up<00:02:03.229> but<00:02:04.229> yeah<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.560> mean

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
else even joined up but yeah I mean

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.550 
else even joined up but yeah I mean
just<00:02:06.190> time<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.550> evolve<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.810> server<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.380> move

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560

the city hall and faq area and you got
the<00:02:36.060> new<00:02:37.060> shop<00:02:38.850> delton<00:02:39.850> geforce<00:02:40.300> had<00:02:40.540> made<00:02:40.870> a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
the new shop delton geforce had made a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.800 
the new shop delton geforce had made a
shop<00:02:41.320> but<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:42.070> ended<00:02:42.430> up<00:02:42.550> being<00:02:42.820> too<00:02:43.120> small<00:02:43.480> for

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
shop but it ended up being too small for

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.720 
shop but it ended up being too small for
the<00:02:43.900> items<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.380> we<00:02:44.890> wanted<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.220> put<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.610> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the items that we wanted to put in the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.770 
the items that we wanted to put in the
shop<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:47.970> then<00:02:49.110> geforce<00:02:50.110> got<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.500> idea<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:51.780> get

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
shop so then geforce got the idea to get

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.780 
shop so then geforce got the idea to get
another<00:02:53.080> plug-in<00:02:53.410> that<00:02:53.590> would<00:02:53.920> allow<00:02:54.190> like

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
another plug-in that would allow like

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.390 
another plug-in that would allow like
the<00:02:54.970> floating<00:02:55.240> items<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.070> we<00:02:57.070> got<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> new

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
the floating items so we got a new

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.250 
the floating items so we got a new
plug-in<00:02:57.700> for<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:58.510> then<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.810> built<00:02:59.080> it

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
plug-in for that and then I built it

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.850 
plug-in for that and then I built it
like<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.680> shelves<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:01.350> dealt<00:03:02.350> built<00:03:02.680> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
like the shelves and dealt built the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.630 
like the shelves and dealt built the
wall<00:03:03.100> around<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:05.130> yeah<00:03:06.130> I<00:03:06.160> think<00:03:06.400> I

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
wall around that and yeah I think I

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.900 
wall around that and yeah I think I
built<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.090> roof<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.630> most<00:03:08.050> of<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.350> roof<00:03:08.910> but

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
built the roof and most of the roof but

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.830 
built the roof and most of the roof but
yeah<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.090> was<00:03:10.180> kind<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:12.630> communal<00:03:13.630> build

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
yeah it was kind of a communal build

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.270 
yeah it was kind of a communal build
there<00:03:14.170> on<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.470> shop<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.990> think<00:03:16.990> it<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.860> don't

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
there on the shop but I think it I don't

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.190 
there on the shop but I think it I don't
know<00:03:18.340> add<00:03:18.580> something<00:03:19.270> new<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> server

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
know add something new to the server

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.930 
know add something new to the server
something<00:03:20.620> cool<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:21.100> lot<00:03:21.489> of<00:03:21.520> people<00:03:21.790> have

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
something cool a lot of people have

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.100 
something cool a lot of people have
commented<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.480> they<00:03:22.630> haven't<00:03:22.810> ever<00:03:22.989> seen

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
commented that they haven't ever seen

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.470 
commented that they haven't ever seen
anything<00:03:23.680> like<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:23.920> as<00:03:24.280> far<00:03:24.430> as<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.730> the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
anything like that as far as the the

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.030 
anything like that as far as the the
items<00:03:26.050> that<00:03:26.320> are<00:03:26.440> floating<00:03:26.680> that's

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
items that are floating that's

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.820 
items that are floating that's
definitely<00:03:27.489> an<00:03:27.670> add-on<00:03:27.940> type<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.540> thing<00:03:28.830> but

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
definitely an add-on type of thing but

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.770 
definitely an add-on type of thing but
yeah<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.640> I<00:03:30.730> know<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.910> makes<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.330> server<00:03:31.540> look

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
yeah and I know it makes the server look

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.370 
yeah and I know it makes the server look
cool<00:03:32.310> along<00:03:33.310> with<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.670> city<00:03:34.030> hall<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:34.510> guess<00:03:34.930> a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
cool along with the city hall I guess a

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.600 
cool along with the city hall I guess a
critter<00:03:35.770> had<00:03:35.980> built<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:37.290> it's<00:03:38.290> just<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:39.280> don't

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
critter had built that it's just I don't

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.949 
critter had built that it's just I don't
know<00:03:39.730> we<00:03:40.000> don't<00:03:40.120> really<00:03:40.209> use<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.540> for<00:03:40.810> anything

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
know we don't really use it for anything

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.840 
know we don't really use it for anything
specific<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.680> guess<00:03:41.830> I<00:03:41.980> had<00:03:42.100> posted<00:03:42.430> some<00:03:42.640> rules
