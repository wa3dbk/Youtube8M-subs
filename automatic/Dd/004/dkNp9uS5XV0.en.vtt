00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.649
 general hello today decided to take off 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.019
 a small video about the exact topic 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.880
 single knife that fell into the hands already 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.509
 long time ago but dude you didn't reach 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.090
 hands right now i'm finally like 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.250
 ended not tidied up 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.609
 and decided to conduct a tundra from tests on 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.830
 him 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.650
 but generally I would like a little bit just 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.560
 tell about this knife here so here it is 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.630
 looks like 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.020
 so this knife did my grandfather did grandfather 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.480
 I understand that I liked to do it myself 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.469
 these are the so -called hunting knives 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.500
 large large 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:47.460
 here is this knife left me from my grandfather 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.460
 my grandfather's name was too late 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.660
 earring namesake well, that's when I was always 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 the little saw that always where 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.079
 we went there in the woods somewhere there for 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.930
 mushrooms there is something else 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.670
 always took some knife with me 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.720
 he was visible to you too 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.970
 passion for knives and so 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.680
 further to the whole island were not 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.900
 pen knives there are some old 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.640
 which if interesting of course I can too 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.680
 then show so this knife he's not 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.330
 got from grandfather 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.330
 Unfortunately, only one at all 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.119
 In fact, my grandfather had a lot of knives which he 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.600
 did well here so how would it seem to me 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.500
 most interesting that he 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.100
 was according to the characteristics of this knife 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:41.080
 it means the length of this knife is the total large 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.940
 the knife is 29 centimeters long 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.020
 blade somewhere about 17 centimeters 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.200
 means the materials from which made 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.509
 This knife is a mystery to me, but 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.649
 here but but as far as I could something 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.009
 identify so to speak here by 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.270
 stick to 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.929
 the handle is dial-up here is something like 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.110
 ebonite and org glass yes such here it is 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:13.480
 stavochki and gold 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:16.390
 here is the blade itself the blade itself is made rather 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.880
 that's how i could figure it out because 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.530
 he talked to his father he 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.989
 said that grandfather basically did 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.049
 knives from either bearing or steel 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.450
 that at 12 it 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.489
 files maybe something was done 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.850
 fast cutter I don't know well anyway 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.880
 this is most likely a file though 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.010
 maybe something else means 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.720
 look anyway this is some 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.579
 carbon because when I got 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.859
 this knife seems to fall into my hands 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.720
 On the bottle all in hotter not I had to 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.209
 for a long time to polish it with goi paste 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.579
 with the help of dremel there, that is all 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.560
 take it all here order there 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.190
 polishing Well this is understandable in itself 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.700
 now it oxidizes itself and the blade itself was 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.489
 so bad enough condition were 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.730
 such powerful enough chips that's it 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.890
 not jam just like school like 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.560
 it was evident that something was cut spent 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.630
 solid maybe some nails whether 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.390
 wire do not know well anyways these 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.660
 school and removed the legs peretochil here 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.980
 because it is thick enough, but 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:30.810
 among he is somewhere around 1 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.810
 millimeter approximately 1 millimeter 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.060
 pulled it out at 15 degrees from each 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.270
 parties so that somehow he was more 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.960
 or less a robe whose 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:48.470
 here's what else but heavy knife heavy weighs 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:53.420
 he order I will say for sure there is no stock on 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:04:01.670
 scales all that is necessary so it weighs he 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:06.470
 we are 0 and we are 227 grams 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.630
 But such weighty weighty legs here 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.130
 Well, by all indications, here's how I 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.230
 I understand this cold weapon 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:18.500
 butt thickness is about four 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:20.709
 millimeters here is this knife I sharpened why 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.500
 in chinese apex flame 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:29.000
 Cuts now perfectly can even slightly 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.820
 shaving a long blade is enough 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.700
 convenient for chopping for some else for 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:39.140
 something immediately visible than newer this 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.790
 knife as we know what it is 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.590
 Moscow society of hunters and 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.100
 fishermen there they had hunting 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.260
 knives 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.620
 here is this particular knife to me very much 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.480
 reminds me was on the channel once here 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.980
 my slavish knife is one hunting one 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.640
 here's a knife in shape 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.500
 not very much like that Major 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.200
 Here I want to continue to test 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.840
 its because the knife is already retired 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.700
 you can say but I still really 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.020
 I wonder how this steel will behave 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.990
 because it stays for me 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.030
 a mystery and I do not know what it is 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.460
 let's see in general try to see 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.540
 we know how good this knife is then remember 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.700
 that grandfather made the knife 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.020
 that's why I have such a special one for him 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.230
 attitude to this knife 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.390
 Here is a very warm relationship to this 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.730
 cold steel let's say okay 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.630
 follow and further behind and video up to new 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.630
 meetings yet
