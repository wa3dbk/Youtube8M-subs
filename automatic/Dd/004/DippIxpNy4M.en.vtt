lisent ways but now my tail bone hurts
and<00:02:53.420> first<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.990> thought<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.260> was<00:02:54.380> just<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.680> cyst

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
and first I thought it was just a cyst

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.940 
and first I thought it was just a cyst
because<00:02:55.720> I've<00:02:56.720> gotten<00:02:56.960> cysts<00:02:57.350> like<00:02:57.410> below<00:02:57.770> my

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
because I've gotten cysts like below my

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.710 
because I've gotten cysts like below my
tailbone<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.520> it<00:02:58.730> had<00:02:58.880> like<00:02:59.030> this<00:02:59.180> almost<00:02:59.510> the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
tailbone and it had like this almost the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.420 
tailbone and it had like this almost the
same<00:02:59.900> exact<00:03:00.290> pain<00:03:00.530> but<00:03:00.740> there<00:03:00.920> was<00:03:01.010> no<00:03:01.160> bump

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
same exact pain but there was no bump

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.020 
same exact pain but there was no bump
and<00:03:02.170> acting<00:03:03.170> gets<00:03:03.350> rid<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.560> like<00:03:03.980> cysts<00:03:04.850> and

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
and acting gets rid of like cysts and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.260 
and acting gets rid of like cysts and
any<00:03:05.150> kind<00:03:05.420> of<00:03:05.510> like<00:03:05.690> bump<00:03:05.960> like<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.350> um<00:03:07.180> but<00:03:08.180> I

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
any kind of like bump like that um but I

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.320 
any kind of like bump like that um but I
think<00:03:08.450> that's<00:03:08.570> just<00:03:08.660> like<00:03:08.900> tailbone<00:03:09.410> pain<00:03:10.330> so

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330

think that's just like tailbone pain so
