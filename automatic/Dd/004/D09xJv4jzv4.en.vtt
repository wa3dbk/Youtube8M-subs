her I've noticed that happens quite a
quite<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.290> lot<00:02:25.500> like<00:02:25.740> we<00:02:26.010> usually<00:02:26.190> end<00:02:26.370> up

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
quite a lot like we usually end up

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.980

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
about that spot too much but after

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.370 
about that spot too much but after
you're<00:05:42.820> gonna<00:05:42.910> see<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.360> I<00:05:43.390> actually<00:05:43.600> found

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
you're gonna see that I actually found

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.110 
you're gonna see that I actually found
out<00:05:44.650> about<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:45.010> spawn<00:05:45.220> went<00:05:45.550> there<00:05:45.790> and

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
out about the spawn went there and

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.270 
out about the spawn went there and
that's<00:05:46.480> the<00:05:46.630> worst<00:05:46.810> mistake<00:05:47.020> I<00:05:47.380> made<00:05:48.040> because

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.260 
that's the worst mistake I made because
then<00:05:49.270> i<00:05:50.070> found<00:05:51.070> that<00:05:51.250> you<00:05:51.730> can't<00:05:51.940> really<00:05:52.060> get

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
then i found that you can't really get

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.460 
then i found that you can't really get
too<00:05:52.420> much<00:05:52.570> kills<00:05:52.810> here<00:05:52.960> unless<00:05:53.140> you<00:05:53.290> count

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
too much kills here unless you count

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.530 
too much kills here unless you count
there<00:05:53.680> for<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:53.860> long<00:05:54.010> time<00:05:54.280> and<00:05:54.490> you<00:05:54.970> my<00:05:55.120> i'm<00:05:55.270> not

Craig<00:06:34.840> moving<00:06:35.170> down<00:06:35.320> and<00:06:35.560> no<00:06:36.070> one<00:06:36.220> really

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
Craig moving down and no one really

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.870 
Craig moving down and no one really
spawned<00:06:36.940> so<00:06:37.690> then<00:06:38.010> yeah<00:06:39.010> I<00:06:39.040> ended<00:06:39.400> up<00:06:39.490> losing

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
spawned so then yeah I ended up losing

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.120 
spawned so then yeah I ended up losing
so<00:06:40.030> it<00:06:40.090> was<00:06:40.240> like<00:06:40.300> 14<00:06:40.840> and<00:06:41.050> 13<00:06:41.500> and<00:06:41.740> then<00:06:41.830> it<00:06:42.040> was

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
so it was like 14 and 13 and then it was

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.800 
so it was like 14 and 13 and then it was
fourteen<00:06:42.580> 14<00:06:43.090> I<00:06:43.210> believe<00:06:43.450> they<00:06:43.570> don't<00:06:43.630> know
