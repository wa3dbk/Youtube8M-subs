00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
leechline on at the boot top and also at

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.039 
leechline on at the boot top and also at
the<00:00:11.610> end<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.880> your<00:00:11.969> boom<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.570> she's<00:00:12.750> cutting

some scrap here with a hot knife so it
doesn't<00:00:14.849> unravel<00:00:14.940> then<00:00:15.809> we'll<00:00:15.929> actually<00:00:16.109> so

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.620 

notice<00:02:12.950> how<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.160> leechline<00:02:13.460> will<00:02:14.030> lay<00:02:14.270> once

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
notice how the leechline will lay once

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.960 
notice how the leechline will lay once
we<00:02:14.810> get<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.050> over<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.530> boo<00:02:15.740> top<00:02:16.069> it<00:02:16.760> will

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
we get it over to the boo top it will

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.890 
we get it over to the boo top it will
lay<00:02:18.340> lengthwise<00:02:19.340> with<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.360> length<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.810> the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
boot top and again she sews over that

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.570 
boot top and again she sews over that
whole<00:02:26.410> primary<00:02:27.410> first<00:02:27.830> stitch<00:02:28.130> trying<00:02:28.490> to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.500 

because<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.830> line<00:02:44.130> will<00:02:44.400> wrap<00:02:44.850> around<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
because this line will wrap around the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.780 
because this line will wrap around the
mast<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.650> better<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.100> have<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.520> line

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
mast it is better to have this line

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.880 
mast it is better to have this line
secured<00:02:48.270> at<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.390> very<00:02:48.720> tip<00:02:49.080> this<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.740> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
secured at the very tip this is a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.620 
secured at the very tip this is a
completely<00:02:50.460> different<00:02:50.640> sail<00:02:51.030> cover<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:51.600> we

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
completely different sail cover but we

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.020 
completely different sail cover but we
want<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.960> show<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.530> we've<00:02:53.430> skipped<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.910> in

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
want to show this we've skipped that in

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.570 
want to show this we've skipped that in
the<00:02:54.120> previous<00:02:54.450> sail<00:02:54.720> cover<00:02:55.020> by<00:02:55.260> mistake<00:02:55.710> so<00:02:56.250> we

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
the previous sail cover by mistake so we

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.100 
the previous sail cover by mistake so we
actually<00:02:56.730> take<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.270> once<00:02:57.540> it's<00:02:57.720> secured

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
actually take this once it's secured

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.690 
actually take this once it's secured
down<00:02:58.260> with<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.590> fabric<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.190> we<00:02:59.340> saw<00:02:59.550> it

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
down with that fabric and we saw it

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.900 
down with that fabric and we saw it
nearly<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> very<00:03:00.540> tip<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.140> sail<00:03:01.860> cover<00:03:02.220> that

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
nearly a very tip of the sail cover that

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.850 
nearly a very tip of the sail cover that
way<00:03:03.150> when<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.480> wraps<00:03:03.720> around<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.260> mast<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
way when it wraps around the mast it

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.100 
way when it wraps around the mast it
doesn't<00:03:05.459> fold<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:05.970> material<00:03:06.480> over<00:03:06.630> at<00:03:06.900> this

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
doesn't fold this material over at this

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.440 
doesn't fold this material over at this
end<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:07.680> she's<00:03:08.370> just<00:03:08.400> going<00:03:08.790> over<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.180> Leafs

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
end so she's just going over the Leafs

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.449 
end so she's just going over the Leafs

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
other portions of this video but what I

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.659 
other portions of this video but what I
want<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.500> discuss<00:04:20.859> with<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.190> now<00:04:21.220> is

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
want to discuss with you now is

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.780 
want to discuss with you now is
appropriate<00:04:22.270> spacing<00:04:22.810> for<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.110> fasteners

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
appropriate spacing for the fasteners

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.090 
appropriate spacing for the fasteners
the<00:04:24.790> first<00:04:25.150> fastener<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.890> should

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
the first fastener that you should

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.670 
the first fastener that you should
position<00:04:27.610> is<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:28.090> one<00:04:28.300> that<00:04:28.870> would<00:04:29.080> be<00:04:29.110> at<00:04:29.410> the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
position is the one that would be at the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.040 
position is the one that would be at the
front<00:04:29.950> or<00:04:30.370> at<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.610> mast<00:04:30.820> side<00:04:31.450> of<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.810> cover

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
front or at the mast side of the cover

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.880 
front or at the mast side of the cover
and<00:04:33.000> basically<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.300> good<00:04:34.630> rule<00:04:34.900> of<00:04:34.930> thumb<00:04:35.110> is<00:04:35.800> to

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
and basically a good rule of thumb is to

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.880 
and basically a good rule of thumb is to
position<00:04:36.550> that<00:04:36.730> fastener<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.200> it<00:04:38.500> is

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
position that fastener so that it is

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.710 
position that fastener so that it is
roughly<00:04:39.430> half<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.330> distance<00:04:41.200> back<00:04:41.950> from<00:04:42.720> the

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
roughly half the distance back from the

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.690 
roughly half the distance back from the
back<00:04:44.080> of<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.500> boot<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.180> start<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:47.020> the

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
back of the boot to the start of the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.140 
back of the boot to the start of the
transition<00:04:48.700> point<00:04:49.690> for<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.790> what<00:04:51.790> I<00:04:51.820> want<00:04:52.090> to

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
transition point for the what I want to

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.550 
transition point for the what I want to
say<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.360> radical<00:04:53.730> incline<00:04:54.730> up<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:56.110> the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
say the radical incline up to the the

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.140 
say the radical incline up to the the
boot<00:04:56.710> top<00:04:56.980> here<00:04:57.280> so<00:04:57.310> from<00:04:57.790> here<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.030> here

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
boot top here so from here to here

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.140 
boot top here so from here to here
roughly<00:04:58.930> half<00:04:59.140> that<00:04:59.169> position<00:04:59.919> is<00:05:00.040> here<00:05:00.400> and

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
roughly half that position is here and

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.300 
roughly half that position is here and
if<00:05:01.300> we<00:05:01.330> bring<00:05:01.570> that<00:05:01.630> down<00:05:02.080> we're<00:05:02.590> right<00:05:03.160> in

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
if we bring that down we're right in

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.090 
if we bring that down we're right in
this<00:05:03.400> position<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:05.169> point<00:05:05.440> being<00:05:05.680> you<00:05:05.800> don't

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
this position the point being you don't

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.100 
this position the point being you don't
want<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.400> get<00:05:06.550> too<00:05:06.820> close<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.479> front<00:05:07.690> or

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
want to get too close to the front or

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.290 
want to get too close to the front or
you<00:05:08.380> won't<00:05:08.530> have<00:05:08.800> enough<00:05:09.100> material<00:05:09.790> in<00:05:09.970> here

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
you won't have enough material in here

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.510 
you won't have enough material in here
when<00:05:10.810> this<00:05:10.960> is<00:05:11.200> filled<00:05:11.470> out<00:05:11.650> by<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:11.919> mast<00:05:12.250> and

you're on nothing more than boom so if

you're on nothing more than boom so if
you<00:06:11.970> want<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.360> cover<00:06:12.599> to<00:06:12.900> loosely<00:06:13.319> hang<00:06:13.740> down

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
below the boom then it's appropriate

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.710 
below the boom then it's appropriate
just<00:06:17.250> to<00:06:17.340> put<00:06:17.490> a<00:06:17.520> fastener<00:06:18.060> here<00:06:18.300> and<00:06:18.539> you'd
