00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.400
 for the run we need one 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.210
 garlic clove the werster chop small 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.440
 and then sauté well in olive oil 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.759
 every now and then stir the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.000
 garlic to be fried today 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.380
 but definitely not black 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.480
 and after sautéing in the garlic 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.660
 we have now passed the pass 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.830
 Add tomatoes and a splash of cream 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.539
 also comes to the whole I leave 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.859
 then on a small flame another 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.320
 bit simmer highly 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.340
 occasionally around and now that became 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.809
 Whole still screaming with pepper 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.910
 there is still white pepper from the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.579
 peppermill and a bit of salt 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.090
 but underlined it side and king around 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.050
 the other things 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.719
 Now we need a bit more 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.460
 peppers the first nuclear 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.989
 remove 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.879
 the practical you can either in 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.890
 cutting cubes or rings as well 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:05.280
 such a popular and follow 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.170
 we make a big casserole and then 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.549
 I 'll add the cord I have 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.070
 I opted for penny noodle here 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.470
 just give shape and then come 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.390
 just the sauce over it 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.930
 up to two big ladles above 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.930
 then sprinkle the peppers over and sprinkle 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.759
 then just mix it all up 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.900
 stir in the spoonful and spoon everything 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.310
 now also some fresh tomatoes 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.619
 the tomatoes then just cut in 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.299
 quarter or even in eighth and put 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.490
 then over the noodles over here comes 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.380
 one more then one and there too 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.930
 still and the whole is now but with 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.579
 I 've got some cheese 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.659
 this Emmentalerkäse decided 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.040
 unfortunately, but also fits and if that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.170
 whole then the conclusion from the oven 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.299
 it should look like this 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.890
 I hope you got hungry and 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.360
 looking forward to the next videos 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.880
 I wish you but in any case 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.950
 first have fun cooking and yes 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.950
 good appetite and until the next video
