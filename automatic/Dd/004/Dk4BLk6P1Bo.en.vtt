straight here it's a little diagonal one
reason<00:01:24.350> is<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.469> footwork<00:01:25.009> I<00:01:25.310> can<00:01:25.789> actually

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
reason is the footwork I can actually

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.410 
reason is the footwork I can actually
come<00:01:26.389> in<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.899> do<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:28.009> strike<00:01:28.850> with<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.090> end<00:01:29.299> of

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
way think about this moving this looked

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.870 
way think about this moving this looked
a<00:02:53.660> little<00:02:53.780> bit<00:02:54.019> of<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.260> action<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:55.010> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
a little bit of the action of the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.770 
a little bit of the action of the
naginata<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.870> as<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.410> actually<00:02:57.590> is<00:02:57.800> traveling

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
naginata and as it actually is traveling

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.360 
naginata and as it actually is traveling
maybe<00:02:59.780> even<00:03:00.260> other<00:03:00.440> through<00:03:00.739> other<00:03:00.890> combine

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
maybe even other through other combine

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.320 
maybe even other through other combine
as<00:03:02.150> I'm<00:03:02.630> moving<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.819> through<00:03:04.819> three<00:03:05.150> to

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
as I'm moving so you through three to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.170 
as I'm moving so you through three to
these<00:03:05.480> positions
