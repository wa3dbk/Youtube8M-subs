singer<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> main<00:01:53.430> class<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.850> i<00:01:53.909> use

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
singer this is the main class that i use

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.749 
singer this is the main class that i use
for<00:01:54.290> trials<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.350> osiris<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.100> i<00:01:56.130> would<00:01:56.369> use<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
for trials of osiris but i would use the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.760 
for trials of osiris but i would use the
firebolt<00:01:57.390> grenades<00:01:57.719> because<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.530> take

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
firebolt grenades because this can take

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
firebolt grenades because this can take
out<00:01:58.920> enemies<00:01:59.280> from<00:01:59.399> around<00:01:59.729> corners<00:02:00.329> as<00:02:00.450> well

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
out enemies from around corners as well

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.620 
out enemies from around corners as well
as<00:02:01.229> hit<00:02:01.530> multiple<00:02:02.219> enemies<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.880> addition<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
as hit multiple enemies in addition to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510 
as hit multiple enemies in addition to
that<00:02:03.810> now<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.350> your<00:02:04.439> third<00:02:04.799> column<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.340> would

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
that now for your third column I would

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.100 
that now for your third column I would
definitely<00:02:05.759> suggest<00:02:06.119> using<00:02:06.450> fire<00:02:06.810> born

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
definitely suggest using fire born

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.990 
definitely suggest using fire born
because<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.469> can<00:02:07.799> come<00:02:08.220> back<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.520> life<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
because you can come back to life and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.059 
because you can come back to life and
then<00:02:09.090> flame<00:02:09.420> shield<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.869> definitely<00:02:10.770> helpful

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
then flame shield is definitely helpful

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.130 
then flame shield is definitely helpful
because<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.790> me<00:02:11.970> lay<00:02:12.120> an<00:02:12.270> enemy<00:02:12.840> right

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
because you can me lay an enemy right

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.870 
because you can me lay an enemy right
after<00:02:13.470> using

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
after using

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.700 
after using
radiance<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.450> then<00:02:14.630> have<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> shield<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.620> you

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
radiance and then have a shield so you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.220 
radiance and then have a shield so you
will<00:02:15.890> not<00:02:16.040> die<00:02:16.310> right<00:02:16.580> away<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.090> then<00:02:17.150> I'm<00:02:18.050> not

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
will not die right away and then I'm not

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.600 
will not die right away and then I'm not
really<00:02:18.440> sure<00:02:18.530> about<00:02:18.770> this<00:02:18.920> fifth<00:02:19.190> row<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.490> can

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
really sure about this fifth row you can

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.430 
really sure about this fifth row you can
kind<00:02:19.820> of<00:02:19.880> choose<00:02:20.090> whatever<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.720> then<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.080> would

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
kind of choose whatever and then I would

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.800 
kind of choose whatever and then I would
suggest<00:02:21.650> using<00:02:21.950> Viking<00:02:22.550> funeral<00:02:22.940> because<00:02:23.120> you

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
suggest using Viking funeral because you

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.290 
suggest using Viking funeral because you
can<00:02:24.200> make<00:02:24.710> your<00:02:24.920> enemies<00:02:25.130> burn<00:02:25.640> longer<00:02:25.910> for

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
can make your enemies burn longer for

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.600 
can make your enemies burn longer for
all<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.540> those<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:26.930> ignite<00:02:27.460> sunburst<00:02:28.460> is

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
all of those that you ignite sunburst is

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.100 
all of those that you ignite sunburst is
also<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:28.940> decent<00:02:29.390> perk<00:02:29.570> because<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:29.990> can

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
also a decent perk because you can

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.960 
also a decent perk because you can
create<00:02:30.290> more<00:02:30.530> orbs<00:02:30.890> for<00:02:31.070> your<00:02:31.190> team<00:02:31.460> and<00:02:31.640> then

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
create more orbs for your team and then

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.450 
create more orbs for your team and then
I<00:02:32.030> do<00:02:32.090> like<00:02:32.420> using<00:02:32.900> extra<00:02:33.440> agility<00:02:33.890> there<00:02:34.220> and

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
I do like using extra agility there and

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.700 
I do like using extra agility there and
then<00:02:34.610> for<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.120> last<00:02:35.360> column<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:36.020> would<00:02:36.440> use

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
then for the last column I would use

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.220 
then for the last column I would use
either<00:02:37.010> touch<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.460> flame<00:02:37.880> or<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.240> gift<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.720> Sun

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
either touch a flame or the gift of Sun

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.750 
either touch a flame or the gift of Sun
because<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:39.860> can<00:02:40.130> get<00:02:40.340> an<00:02:40.520> additional

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
because you can get an additional

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.330 
because you can get an additional
grenade<00:02:41.330> but<00:02:41.780> touch<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.110> flame<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.740> also<00:02:43.130> useful

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
grenade but touch a flame is also useful

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.550 
grenade but touch a flame is also useful
because<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.880> does<00:02:44.090> make<00:02:44.420> your<00:02:44.870> enemies<00:02:45.080> burn

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
because it does make your enemies burn

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.710 
because it does make your enemies burn
over<00:02:45.920> time<00:02:46.160> now<00:02:46.460> for<00:02:46.490> my<00:02:46.820> weapon<00:02:47.210> loadout<00:02:47.570> i

over time now for my weapon loadout i

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.660 
over time now for my weapon loadout i
would<00:02:47.960> suggest<00:02:48.170> using<00:02:48.470> thorn<00:02:49.040> or<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.460> last

reroll<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.060> get<00:03:17.300> perfect<00:03:17.630> balance<00:03:17.930> and

reroll it to get perfect balance and

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.260 
reroll it to get perfect balance and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
final round any sniper that has final

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.450 
final round any sniper that has final
round<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.600> pretty<00:03:20.870> good<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.830> then<00:03:21.980> prettiest

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
round is pretty good and then prettiest

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.100 
round is pretty good and then prettiest
revenge<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.910> also<00:03:23.240> very<00:03:23.360> nice<00:03:23.630> because<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.020> has

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
revenge is also very nice because it has

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.230 
revenge is also very nice because it has
very<00:03:24.410> low<00:03:24.620> stability<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:25.790> can<00:03:25.970> shoot<00:03:26.150> it

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
very low stability and you can shoot it

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.450 
very low stability and you can shoot it
very<00:03:26.480> quickly<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.110> get<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.530> easy<00:03:27.830> kill<00:03:28.130> every

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
very quickly and get a easy kill every

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.030 
very quickly and get a easy kill every
time<00:03:28.640> now<00:03:29.000> for<00:03:29.030> your<00:03:29.720> rocket<00:03:30.440> launcher<00:03:30.800> over

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
time now for your rocket launcher over

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.770 
time now for your rocket launcher over
or<00:03:31.250> for<00:03:31.490> your<00:03:31.580> heavy<00:03:31.790> this<00:03:32.120> doesn't<00:03:32.360> matter<00:03:32.600> as

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
or for your heavy this doesn't matter as

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.630 
or for your heavy this doesn't matter as
much<00:03:32.810> but<00:03:33.200> i<00:03:33.260> would<00:03:33.470> suggest<00:03:33.640> definitely

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
much but i would suggest definitely

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.430 
much but i would suggest definitely
using<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:35.000> rocket<00:03:35.510> launcher<00:03:35.840> because<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
using a rocket launcher because the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.170 
using a rocket launcher because the
grenade<00:03:36.770> launchers<00:03:37.220> have<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.550> much<00:03:37.880> better

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
grenade launchers have a much better

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.790 
grenade launchers have a much better
chance<00:03:38.300> of<00:03:38.750> getting<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.110> kill<00:03:39.320> and<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.680> can

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
chance of getting the kill and you can

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.350 
chance of getting the kill and you can
still<00:03:39.920> kill<00:03:40.190> your<00:03:40.310> enemies<00:03:40.610> even<00:03:40.760> after<00:03:41.210> your

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
still kill your enemies even after your

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.210 
still kill your enemies even after your
death<00:03:41.690> for<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.230> perks<00:03:42.530> on<00:03:42.770> your<00:03:42.920> grenade

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
death for the perks on your grenade

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.860 
death for the perks on your grenade
launcher<00:03:43.520> I<00:03:43.640> would<00:03:43.910> suggest<00:03:44.120> trying<00:03:44.630> to

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
launcher I would suggest trying to

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.870 
launcher I would suggest trying to
reroll<00:03:45.260> in<00:03:45.560> order<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:46.040> get<00:03:46.310> grenades<00:03:46.700> and

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
reroll in order to get grenades and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.240 
reroll in order to get grenades and
horseshoes<00:03:46.940> or<00:03:47.720> tracking<00:03:48.380> grenades<00:03:49.130> and

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
horseshoes or tracking grenades and

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.010 
horseshoes or tracking grenades and
horseshoes<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:50.090> pretty<00:03:50.330> good<00:03:50.510> because<00:03:50.690> it

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
horseshoes is pretty good because it

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.199 
horseshoes is pretty good because it
based<00:03:51.320> on<00:03:51.500> proximity<00:03:51.830> so<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:52.880> is<00:03:53.030> very

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
based on proximity so this is very

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.080 
based on proximity so this is very
useful<00:03:53.660> in<00:03:53.810> PvP<00:03:54.440> as<00:03:54.620> well<00:03:55.250> but<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.700> pretty

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
useful in PvP as well but that pretty

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.210 
useful in PvP as well but that pretty
