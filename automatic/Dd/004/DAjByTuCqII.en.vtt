able to really get into the blending as

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.400 
able to really get into the blending as
far<00:02:28.090> as<00:02:28.240> trying<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.600> take<00:02:28.810> them<00:02:28.960> in<00:02:29.080> my<00:02:29.170> hair

far as trying to take them in my hair

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.050 
far as trying to take them in my hair
out<00:02:29.590> make<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:29.920> look<00:02:30.160> realistic<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.820> all<00:02:30.910> of

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
out make it look realistic and all of

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.780 
out make it look realistic and all of
that<00:02:31.090> what<00:02:32.050> I<00:02:32.080> did<00:02:32.230> was<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.710> took<00:02:32.860> some<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
that what I did was I took some of the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.180 
that what I did was I took some of the
hair<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.330> wig<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:35.260> kind<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.650> faked<00:02:35.920> some

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
hair the wig and I kind of faked some

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.430 
hair the wig and I kind of faked some
baby<00:02:36.430> hairs<00:02:36.760> along<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.300> hairline<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.990> for

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
baby hairs along the hairline and for

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.620 
baby hairs along the hairline and for
the<00:02:38.530> most<00:02:38.740> part<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.190> tried<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.550> cover<00:02:39.790> most<00:02:40.330> of

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
the most part I tried to cover most of

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.140 
the most part I tried to cover most of
the<00:02:40.690> hairline<00:02:41.200> but<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.130> do<00:02:42.250> think<00:02:42.700> for<00:02:42.730> me<00:02:43.120> a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
the hairline but I do think for me a

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.720 
the hairline but I do think for me a
more<00:02:43.570> realistic<00:02:44.080> look<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:45.100> should<00:02:45.280> pull<00:02:45.490> some

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
more realistic look you should pull some

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.660 
more realistic look you should pull some
of<00:02:45.850> your<00:02:46.060> hair<00:02:46.330> out<00:02:46.360> or<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.830> can<00:02:47.860> braid<00:02:48.370> your

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
of your hair out or you can braid your

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.660 
of your hair out or you can braid your
hair<00:02:48.930> if<00:02:49.930> your<00:02:50.110> hair<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.500> loose<00:02:50.740> braid<00:02:51.430> your

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
hair if your hair is loose braid your

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.880 
hair if your hair is loose braid your
hair<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.150> put<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.870> little<00:02:53.140> bit<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.290> like<00:02:53.410> oil<00:02:53.650> or

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
hair and put a little bit of like oil or

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.130 
hair and put a little bit of like oil or
something<00:02:54.070> on<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.670> then<00:02:55.570> braid<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:55.960> really

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
something on it and then braid it really

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.870 
something on it and then braid it really
really<00:02:56.320> tight<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.740> then<00:02:56.920> loosen<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.850> I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
really tight and then loosen it and I

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.550 
really tight and then loosen it and I
think<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.150> can<00:02:58.300> blend<00:02:58.570> better<00:02:58.870> like<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.170> I

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
think you can blend better like that I

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.750 
think you can blend better like that I
wouldn't<00:02:59.830> necessarily<00:02:59.950> do<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.520> bone

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
wouldn't necessarily do like bone

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.710 
wouldn't necessarily do like bone
straight<00:03:01.150> hair

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
straight hair

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.810 
straight hair
I<00:03:01.750> would<00:03:02.200> braid<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.650> or<00:03:02.770> something<00:03:03.190> first<00:03:03.460> and

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
I would braid it or something first and

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.670 
I would braid it or something first and
kind<00:03:04.330> of<00:03:04.420> have<00:03:04.600> that<00:03:04.630> braid<00:03:04.960> out<00:03:05.140> look<00:03:05.440> and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
kind of have that braid out look and

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.020 
kind of have that braid out look and
then<00:03:06.010> kind<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.430> blend<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.380> um<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.850> yeah<00:03:10.000> I

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
then kind of blend it in um but yeah I

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.850 
then kind of blend it in um but yeah I
really<00:03:10.120> really<00:03:10.690> like<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.260> it's<00:03:11.500> just

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
really really like it it's just

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.860 
really really like it it's just
something<00:03:12.280> for<00:03:12.430> me<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.670> play<00:03:12.910> with<00:03:12.940> I'm
