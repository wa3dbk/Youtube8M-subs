00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.840 
actually have a tie for third place and
the<00:04:21.609> winners<00:04:21.880> are<00:04:22.090> Creek<00:04:22.720> back<00:04:23.640> he<00:04:24.640> gets

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
the winners are Creek back he gets

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.970 
the winners are Creek back he gets
himself<00:04:25.060> or<00:04:25.540> he<00:04:25.750> gets<00:04:25.900> his<00:04:26.080> mama<00:04:26.290> present<00:04:26.770> that

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
himself or he gets his mama present that

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.879 
himself or he gets his mama present that
actually<00:04:27.550> he<00:04:27.700> lagers<00:04:28.090> himself<00:04:28.620> but<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.680> think

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
actually he lagers himself but I think

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.340 
actually he lagers himself but I think
it's<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.070> good<00:04:30.190> idea<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.700> keeps<00:04:30.880> him<00:04:31.090> busy<00:04:31.350> and

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
it's a good idea it keeps him busy and

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.050 
it's a good idea it keeps him busy and
she<00:04:32.710> makes<00:04:32.860> him<00:04:32.980> shovel<00:04:33.340> manure<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:36.060> tie

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
she makes him shovel manure and the tie

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:44.520 
she makes him shovel manure and the tie
for<00:04:37.120> that<00:04:37.570> was<00:04:38.610> Jay<00:04:39.610> versus<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.450> mess<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:43.530> samurai
