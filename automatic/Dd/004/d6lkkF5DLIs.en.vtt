00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.009
 to vote a 2 1 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.459
 Leuna on 15 October 2010 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.500
 The Trea 1 has just been successfully launched with this tailwind 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.239
 At the site were immediately the ambitious plans for the sister 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.099
 Plant tackled 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.029
 meanwhile, other communities in central Germany have for the NPT 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.859
 Service decided 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.469
 Also, industry and commerce reported their need for environmentally sound safer 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.700
 and legally compliant waste disposal 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.030
 Now, the disposal Scott at Citi TAP 390 thousand tons of waste 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.620
 double 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.640
 as that's how the creation grew 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.230
 so let the shell and finally the elevator gate 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.910
 7500 cubic meters of concrete were built in the first year alone, time is running out 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.040
 because nobody knows winter again 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.700
 but this shows from the mild side 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.930
 and hardly brings the builders into trouble the shell is finished the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.280
 Partition wall between the two 40 meter high garbage bunker and already removed 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.500
 now follows the installation of the technical equipment 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.510
 the boiler is used 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.510
 equipped the turbine house 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.570
 are being built 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.570
 provides year for the fresh air over Leuna 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.540
 now the steelworkers have to say that 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.390
 Altogether now 3000 tons of steel will be a safe Trier 2 again 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.840
 Give backbone 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.840
 Stahlwille be welded 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.090
 Thousands of meters are thus created during the 19 months of construction 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.890
 safely disguised and well insulated what the new plant also outwardly 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.460
 more and more their established role model Trier 1 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:21.559
 in the boiler house the fire will soon blaze up in the turbine house next door 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:23.819
 Steam for energy production 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.120
 because it is not just part of the ultimate goal of a modern circular economy 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.709
 To recover raw materials but also to replace fossil fuels 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.409
 Finally, together with the sister Trier 1 25000 megawatt hours 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.349
 Electrician who produces from pot 4 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.569
 controlled by a state-of-the-art control technology there so the co2 balance 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.250
 relieved at an annual milestone of milking of 390,000 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:54.449
 Tons of waste are at least 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:59.669
 the concept also goes on Trial operation is started three months ahead of schedule 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.280
 already in the beginning weeks 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.800
 around 90 percent of the planned movie is thermally treated by angels 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.829
 the cross 1 finally did it 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.679
 also she started with time lead 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:14.219
 the new plant is now following in their footsteps band of "all good things 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.279
 are 2
