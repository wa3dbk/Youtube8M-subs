[Music]

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.570 

the<00:00:25.540> program<00:00:25.900> I<00:00:25.990> got<00:00:26.140> from<00:00:26.320> you<00:00:26.500> you<00:00:26.710> had<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:27.160> set

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
the program I got from you you had a set

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.580 
the program I got from you you had a set
list<00:00:27.760> of<00:00:27.970> power<00:00:28.270> exercises<00:00:28.840> you<00:00:29.080> recommended

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
list of power exercises you recommended

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.440 
list of power exercises you recommended
and<00:00:29.740> then<00:00:30.340> you<00:00:30.460> included<00:00:30.850> the<00:00:30.940> non<00:00:31.150> linear

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
and then you included the non linear

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.180 
and then you included the non linear
periodization<00:00:31.780> so<00:00:32.230> if<00:00:32.320> I<00:00:32.410> had<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.560> plateau<00:00:32.830> on

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
periodization so if I had a plateau on

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.130 
periodization so if I had a plateau on
say<00:00:33.340> incline<00:00:33.700> bench<00:00:33.910> well<00:00:34.600> next<00:00:34.989> time<00:00:35.080> I

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
say incline bench well next time I

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.049 
say incline bench well next time I
started<00:00:35.530> my<00:00:35.739> period<00:00:36.220> ization<00:00:36.489> I<00:00:36.760> started<00:00:37.000> the

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
started my period ization I started the

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.790 
started my period ization I started the
 bench<00:00:37.390> right<00:00:37.870> because<00:00:38.200> my<00:00:38.230> flatmates

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
 bench right because my flatmates

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.049 
 bench right because my flatmates
had<00:00:38.890> a<00:00:38.920> lot<00:00:39.100> of<00:00:39.130> reader<00:00:39.370> growth<00:00:39.520> and<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.820> next

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
had a lot of reader growth and the next

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.400 
had a lot of reader growth and the next
time<00:00:40.150> I<00:00:40.270> would<00:00:40.420> do<00:00:40.480> dumbbells<00:00:40.840> because<00:00:40.960> and

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
time I would do dumbbells because and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.650 
time I would do dumbbells because and
then<00:00:42.010> each<00:00:42.190> time<00:00:42.220> I'll<00:00:42.520> define<00:00:42.790> why<00:00:43.030> return<00:00:43.270> to

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
then each time I'll define why return to

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.299 
then each time I'll define why return to
another<00:00:43.840> exercise<00:00:44.350> I<00:00:44.559> had<00:00:44.739> increased<00:00:45.190> my

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
another exercise I had increased my

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.310 
another exercise I had increased my
strength<00:00:45.520> on<00:00:45.640> that<00:00:45.820> so<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.390> would<00:00:46.840> never<00:00:47.140> really

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
strength on that so I would never really

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.500 
strength on that so I would never really
hit<00:00:47.559> a<00:00:47.590> plateau<00:00:47.830> with<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:49.030> course<00:00:49.180> yeah

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510

I'll do you know supported incline

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.990 
I'll do you know supported incline
dumbbell<00:02:05.140> rows<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:06.040> know<00:02:06.130> those<00:02:06.670> sorts<00:02:06.940> of

dumbbell rows you know those sorts of

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.359 
dumbbell rows you know those sorts of
exercises<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:07.900> kind<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.140> takes<00:02:08.349> you<00:02:09.009> know<00:02:09.099> D

exercises so it kind of takes you know D
load<00:02:09.550> your<00:02:09.729> spine<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.030> little<00:02:10.330> bit<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.899> take

load your spine a little bit and take
some<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.349> pressure<00:02:11.500> off<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:12.069> makes<00:02:12.310> you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
some of the pressure off and makes you

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.080 
some of the pressure off and makes you
more<00:02:12.489> effective

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
more effective

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.750 
more effective
like<00:02:13.269> that<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.599> trained<00:02:14.050> smarter<00:02:14.500> yeah<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> mean

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
like that is trained smarter yeah I mean

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.190 
like that is trained smarter yeah I mean
you<00:02:15.910> know<00:02:16.030> it's<00:02:16.209> it's<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.690> know<00:02:16.720> t-bar

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you know it's it's you know t-bar

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.140 
you know it's it's you know t-bar
supportive<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.040> our<00:02:18.069> OHS<00:02:18.370> might<00:02:18.700> not<00:02:18.849> be<00:02:19.000> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
supportive to our OHS might not be the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.710 
supportive to our OHS might not be the
hard<00:02:19.629> core<00:02:19.900> exercise<00:02:20.470> or<00:02:20.830> or<00:02:21.569> typically<00:02:22.569> what

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
hard core exercise or or typically what

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.180 
hard core exercise or or typically what
you<00:02:22.810> think<00:02:22.989> about<00:02:23.080> as<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.290> power<00:02:23.560> exercise<00:02:24.160> I

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
you think about as a power exercise I

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.040 
you think about as a power exercise I
have<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.430> mass<00:02:24.790> building<00:02:25.090> exercise<00:02:25.629> but<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:25.930> mean

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
have a mass building exercise but I mean

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.110 
have a mass building exercise but I mean
really<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.980> you're<00:02:27.220> applying<00:02:27.489> force<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
really if you're applying force the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.300 
really if you're applying force the
muscle<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.569> you're<00:02:29.349> stimulating<00:02:29.620> breakdown

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
muscle and you're stimulating breakdown

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.619 
muscle and you're stimulating breakdown
to<00:02:30.459> me<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:30.700> gonna<00:02:30.819> make<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.090> grow<00:02:31.330> well<00:02:31.540> it

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
to me it's gonna make it grow well it

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.119 
to me it's gonna make it grow well it
takes<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.959> swing<00:02:32.200> out<00:02:32.349> of<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.590> particular

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
takes the swing out of that particular

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.369 
takes the swing out of that particular
exercise<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.970> I've<00:02:34.330> found<00:02:34.629> if<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:34.959> did<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.200> for

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
exercise so I've found if I did that for

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.020 
exercise so I've found if I did that for
a<00:02:35.410> few<00:02:35.440> can<00:02:35.769> I<00:02:35.830> return<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.250> t-bar<00:02:36.519> rows<00:02:36.730> a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
a few can I return the t-bar rows a

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.820 
a few can I return the t-bar rows a
strength<00:02:37.450> has<00:02:37.629> a<00:02:37.660> long<00:02:37.900> board<00:02:38.200> if<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.620> hasn't

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
strength has a long board if it hasn't

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.490 
strength has a long board if it hasn't
increased<00:02:38.950> right<00:02:39.730> yeah<00:02:40.480> yeah<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.170> mean<00:02:41.379> it's

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
increased right yeah yeah I mean it's

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.920 
increased right yeah yeah I mean it's
very<00:02:41.530> very<00:02:41.950> large<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.250> carry<00:02:42.459> over<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.030> yeah<00:02:43.870> I

work on my upper body hypertrophy day

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.900 
work on my upper body hypertrophy day
and<00:03:01.049> sounds<00:03:02.049> come<00:03:02.200> we<00:03:02.319> were<00:03:02.410> doing<00:03:02.849> every<00:03:03.849> day

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
and sounds come we were doing every day

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.509 
and sounds come we were doing every day
right<00:03:04.420> yeah<00:03:04.569> yeah<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.230> but<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.220> reason<00:03:06.250> I've

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
right yeah yeah so but the reason I've

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.800 
right yeah yeah so but the reason I've
done<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.879> because<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.180> find<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.569> after

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
done that is because I find that after

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.979 
done that is because I find that after
rows<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.709> after<00:03:09.010> chest<00:03:09.489> presses<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:10.750> know<00:03:10.840> my

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
rows and after chest presses you know my

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.559 
rows and after chest presses you know my
shoulders<00:03:11.230> are<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:11.709> fatigued<00:03:12.160> it's<00:03:13.000> tough<00:03:13.390> to

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
shoulders are so fatigued it's tough to

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.059 
shoulders are so fatigued it's tough to
really<00:03:13.810> enhance<00:03:13.959> up<00:03:14.379> to<00:03:14.500> do<00:03:14.620> dumbbell

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
really enhance up to do dumbbell

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.619 
really enhance up to do dumbbell
shoulder<00:03:15.340> person's<00:03:15.849> or<00:03:15.970> something<00:03:16.239> like<00:03:16.390> that

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
shoulder person's or something like that

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.199 
shoulder person's or something like that
yeah<00:03:17.049> so<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:17.920> do<00:03:18.310> heavy<00:03:18.549> dumbbells<00:03:18.940> little

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
yeah so I do heavy dumbbells little

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.090 
yeah so I do heavy dumbbells little
presses<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:20.319> know<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:20.440> usually<00:03:20.769> just<00:03:20.920> do

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
presses so you know I usually just do

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.920 
presses so you know I usually just do
you<00:03:21.340> know<00:03:21.430> higher<00:03:21.670> rep<00:03:21.910> levels<00:03:22.389> like<00:03:22.630> we<00:03:22.750> did

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
you know higher rep levels like we did

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.590 
you know higher rep levels like we did
today<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.760> then<00:03:25.000> I'll<00:03:25.090> save<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.450> heavy

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
today and and then I'll save the heavy

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.509 
today and and then I'll save the heavy
pressing<00:03:26.109> for<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.799> David<00:03:27.069> I'm<00:03:27.130> going<00:03:27.250> lighter

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
pressing for the David I'm going lighter

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.000 
pressing for the David I'm going lighter
on<00:03:27.700> everything<00:03:28.000> else<00:03:29.819> for<00:03:30.819> chest<00:03:31.090> and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
on everything else for chest and

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.250 
on everything else for chest and
more<00:03:33.519> quickly<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.090> I'm<00:03:34.510> going<00:03:34.780> heavier<00:03:35.110> on

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
more quickly and I'm going heavier on

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.440 
more quickly and I'm going heavier on
shoulders<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.069> it's<00:03:36.670> kind<00:03:36.940> of<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.090> little<00:03:37.299> bit

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
shoulders so it's kind of a little bit

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.059 
shoulders so it's kind of a little bit
different<00:03:37.510> but<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:38.440> something<00:03:38.620> I've<00:03:38.799> I've

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
different but it's something I've I've

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.580 
different but it's something I've I've
changed<00:03:39.489> recently<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:40.170> at<00:03:41.170> least<00:03:41.349> four

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
changed recently and at least four

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.930 
changed recently and at least four
contests<00:03:41.980> perhaps<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.340> feel<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.580> little<00:03:42.730> bit

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
contests perhaps you feel a little bit

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.789 
contests perhaps you feel a little bit
better<00:03:43.090> because<00:03:43.330> shoulder<00:03:44.080> presses<00:03:44.409> from<00:03:44.560> me

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
better because shoulder presses from me

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:45.869 
better because shoulder presses from me
you're<00:03:44.980> one<00:03:45.129> of<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.280> first<00:03:45.459> things<00:03:45.640> that<00:03:45.760> goes

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
you're one of the first things that goes

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.210 
you're one of the first things that goes
my<00:03:46.870> shoulder<00:03:47.170> pressing<00:03:47.560> strengths<00:03:47.860> needs<00:03:48.010> to

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
my shoulder pressing strengths needs to

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.339 
my shoulder pressing strengths needs to
go<00:03:48.430> before<00:03:49.060> anything<00:03:49.450> else<00:03:49.599> moving<00:03:49.840> contest

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
go before anything else moving contest

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.910 
go before anything else moving contest
prep<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.790> so<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.599> noticed<00:03:53.200> something<00:03:53.349> take<00:03:53.890> a

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
prep and so I noticed something take a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.660 
prep and so I noticed something take a
little<00:03:54.099> bit<00:03:54.220> longer

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
little bit longer

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.069 
little bit longer
by<00:03:55.150> switching<00:03:55.750> those<00:03:57.510> now<00:03:58.510> do<00:03:58.569> you<00:03:58.720> find<00:03:58.930> that

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
by switching those now do you find that

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.009 
by switching those now do you find that
when<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.319> have<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.590> time<00:04:00.030> sometimes<00:04:01.030> maybe

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
when you have the time sometimes maybe

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.449 
when you have the time sometimes maybe
the<00:04:02.200> last<00:04:02.349> time<00:04:02.530> for<00:04:02.769> at<00:04:02.829> least<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:03.040> contest

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
the last time for at least a contest

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.830 
the last time for at least a contest
prep<00:04:03.670> when<00:04:03.849> I<00:04:03.879> was<00:04:04.030> going<00:04:04.269> on<00:04:04.329> a<00:04:04.390> Saturday<00:04:04.810> for

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
prep when I was going on a Saturday for

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.509 
prep when I was going on a Saturday for
say<00:04:05.110> arms<00:04:05.349> and<00:04:05.500> shoulders<00:04:05.829> I<00:04:06.040> would<00:04:06.430> actually

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
say arms and shoulders I would actually

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.400 
say arms and shoulders I would actually
split<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.030> workout<00:04:07.299> up<00:04:07.450> I<00:04:07.690> was<00:04:08.049> going<00:04:08.230> in<00:04:08.349> the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
morning and do shoulders come back at

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.550 
morning and do shoulders come back at
the<00:04:10.180> 92<00:04:10.540> alarms<00:04:10.840> ricardio

the 92 alarms ricardio

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.289 
the 92 alarms ricardio
do<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:12.069> like<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.430> split<00:04:12.700> your<00:04:12.819> workouts<00:04:13.150> off

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299

I actually I love the idea I think it's

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.250 
I actually I love the idea I think it's
great<00:04:18.850> idea<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.239> mean<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.720> way<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:19.870> way<00:04:20.229> I

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
of suited with my workout a little

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.760 
of suited with my workout a little
further<00:04:39.729> south<00:04:40.210> oh<00:04:40.510> yeah<00:04:40.810> yeah<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.349> that<00:04:41.560> that

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
further south oh yeah yeah so that that

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.700 
further south oh yeah yeah so that that
way<00:04:41.889> you<00:04:41.950> know<00:04:43.050> when<00:04:44.050> your<00:04:44.169> contents<00:04:44.560> pepper

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
way you know when your contents pepper

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.080 
way you know when your contents pepper
you're<00:04:44.919> kind<00:04:45.099> of<00:04:45.190> you<00:04:45.280> run<00:04:45.550> out<00:04:45.669> of<00:04:45.700> carbs

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
you're kind of you run out of carbs

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.490 
you're kind of you run out of carbs
eventually<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:46.630> have<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.870> be<00:04:46.990> trying<00:04:47.229> to<00:04:47.320> get

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
eventually you have to be trying to get

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.230 
eventually you have to be trying to get
a<00:04:47.530> certain<00:04:47.979> percentage<00:04:48.010> into<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.700> experiment

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
a certain percentage into the experiment

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.290 
a certain percentage into the experiment
so<00:04:50.110> yeah<00:04:50.710> I<00:04:51.039> actually<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.729> think<00:04:52.060> training

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
so yeah I actually I think training

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.760 
so yeah I actually I think training
twice<00:04:52.539> a<00:04:52.599> day<00:04:52.750> is<00:04:52.810> a<00:04:52.900> great<00:04:53.080> idea<00:04:53.410> because<00:04:53.560> you

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
twice a day is a great idea because you

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.129 
twice a day is a great idea because you
know<00:04:53.860> you<00:04:54.700> get<00:04:54.880> done<00:04:55.090> with<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.300> body<00:04:55.510> part<00:04:55.810> now

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
know you get done with a body part now

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.450 
know you get done with a body part now
you've<00:04:56.320> got<00:04:56.470> a<00:04:56.500> chance<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:56.800> recover<00:04:57.160> a<00:04:57.250> little

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
you've got a chance to recover a little

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.520 
you've got a chance to recover a little
bit<00:04:57.639> now<00:04:58.240> not<00:04:58.450> necessarily<00:04:58.990> physically<00:04:59.349> looks

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
bit now not necessarily physically looks

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.870 
bit now not necessarily physically looks
more<00:04:59.800> emotional<00:05:00.250> mental

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
more emotional mental

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.310 
more emotional mental
get<00:05:01.120> your<00:05:01.270> mind<00:05:01.450> right<00:05:01.630> keep<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:01.990> ready<00:05:02.140> for
