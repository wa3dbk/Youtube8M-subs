00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
immediately wave loading I've kind of

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.259 
immediately wave loading I've kind of
talked<00:00:11.160> about<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.490> before<00:00:11.849> how<00:00:12.210> to

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
talked about this before how to

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.020 
talked about this before how to
immediately<00:00:12.870> increase<00:00:13.049> either<00:00:14.009> size<00:00:14.700> or

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
immediately increase either size or

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.900 
immediately increase either size or
strength<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:16.170> by<00:00:16.410> changing<00:00:17.070> your<00:00:17.400> reps<00:00:17.609> it

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
strength just by changing your reps it

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.599 
strength just by changing your reps it
sounds<00:00:18.390> too<00:00:18.570> simple<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:19.020> be<00:00:19.140> true<00:00:19.189> but<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.400> see<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
sounds too simple to be true but I see a

that<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.259> build<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.280> amount<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.520> work<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
that we build and the amount of work and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.660 
that we build and the amount of work and
loads<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.630> lifts<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.460> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
loads and lifts that we can do so it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.429 
loads and lifts that we can do so it
makes<00:01:42.000> sense<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:43.110> we're<00:01:43.320> more

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
makes sense that if we're more

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.800 
makes sense that if we're more
potentiated<00:01:44.280> we're<00:01:44.460> more<00:01:44.640> primed<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.659> can

potentiated we're more primed we can

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.990 
potentiated we're more primed we can
activate<00:01:46.380> more<00:01:46.680> total<00:01:47.369> muscle<00:01:47.670> fibers<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
activate more total muscle fibers a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
activate more total muscle fibers a
larger<00:01:48.420> percent<00:01:48.780> our<00:01:49.140> performance<00:01:49.799> will<00:01:49.950> not

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
larger percent our performance will not

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.819 
larger percent our performance will not
only<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.520> better<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:51.780> will<00:01:51.960> build<00:01:52.380> more

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
only be better but will build more

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.319 
only be better but will build more
muscle<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> result<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:53.970> performance

muscle as a result of that performance

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.480 
muscle as a result of that performance
and<00:01:54.659> increase<00:01:55.259> our<00:01:55.439> strength<00:01:55.590> now<00:01:56.430> we

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
and increase our strength now we

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.030 
and increase our strength now we
understand<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.689> how<00:01:58.530> does<00:01:58.590> doing

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
understand that so how does doing

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.340 
understand that so how does doing
something<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.549> simple<00:01:59.880> as<00:02:00.149> five<00:02:00.600> reps<00:02:00.869> then

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
something as simple as five reps then

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.050 
something as simple as five reps then
three<00:02:01.680> reps<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:02.490> rep<00:02:02.670> how<00:02:02.850> does

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
three reps then one rep how does

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.450 
three reps then one rep how does
increase<00:02:03.479> your<00:02:03.689> strength<00:02:04.200> well<00:02:04.979> has<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.219> do

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
increase your strength well has to do

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.490 
increase your strength well has to do
with<00:02:05.579> something<00:02:05.880> called<00:02:06.030> post<00:02:06.600> activation

contraction<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.099> means<00:02:17.280> lifting<00:02:17.430> so

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
contraction that just means lifting so

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.600 
contraction that just means lifting so
after<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.660> lift<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.500> get<00:02:19.709> more<00:02:19.950> potentiation

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
after you lift you get more potentiation

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.369 
after you lift you get more potentiation
from<00:02:20.940> doing<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.269> that's<00:02:21.569> what<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.019> means<00:02:22.170> in

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379

a<00:02:22.470> nutshell<00:02:22.680> right<00:02:23.330> potentiation<00:02:24.330> I've<00:02:25.140> said

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
a nutshell right potentiation I've said

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.290 
a nutshell right potentiation I've said
this<00:02:25.590> before<00:02:25.739> priming<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.640> nervous<00:02:27.000> system

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
this before priming the nervous system

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.720 
this before priming the nervous system
the<00:02:27.660> ability<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.110> recruit<00:02:28.440> more<00:02:29.040> total<00:02:29.519> muscle

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the ability to recruit more total muscle

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.449 
the ability to recruit more total muscle
fibers<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:30.900> what<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> way<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.040> said<00:02:32.280> wave

five<00:02:51.450> reps<00:02:51.720> pause<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.470> know<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.829> three

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
five reps pause you know to three

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.009 
five reps pause you know to three
minutes<00:02:53.370> then<00:02:53.790> for<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.209> second<00:02:54.569> set<00:02:54.750> three

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
minutes then for the second set three

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.589 
minutes then for the second set three
reps<00:02:55.260> pause<00:02:55.709> once<00:02:56.130> again<00:02:56.430> third<00:02:56.970> set<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.480> do

reps pause once again third set you do
one<00:02:57.810> rep<00:02:58.019> cool<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.130> repeat<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.579> so<00:02:59.790> you

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
one rep cool then you repeat it so you

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.250 
one rep cool then you repeat it so you
take<00:03:00.060> once<00:03:00.269> again<00:03:00.480> three<00:03:00.660> minutes<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.140> do

five reps pause then three reps pause
one<00:03:04.230> rep<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.769> change<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.459> weights<00:03:05.700> after

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
one rep you change the weights after

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.930 
one rep you change the weights after
every<00:03:06.930> single<00:03:07.110> set<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:08.190> what<00:03:08.340> occurs<00:03:08.730> after

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
every single set but what occurs after

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.569 
every single set but what occurs after
doing<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.900> first<00:03:10.349> wave<00:03:10.709> so<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.160> give<00:03:11.489> an

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
doing the first wave so I give an

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.580 
doing the first wave so I give an
example<00:03:11.849> right<00:03:12.150> here<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.049> is<00:03:13.200> an<00:03:13.319> example

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
example right here so this is an example

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.250 
example right here so this is an example
of<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.980> strength<00:03:14.459> wave<00:03:14.790> wave<00:03:15.360> loading<00:03:15.780> done

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.900 
of a strength wave wave loading done
twice<00:03:16.650> here's<00:03:17.400> what's<00:03:17.609> going<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.850> happen

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
twice here's what's going to happen

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.059 
twice here's what's going to happen
you're<00:03:18.389> going<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.569> notice<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.200> second<00:03:19.829> set

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
you're going to notice in the second set

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.430 
you're going to notice in the second set
you<00:03:20.819> can<00:03:20.970> lift<00:03:21.120> more<00:03:21.299> weight<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:21.750> that's

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
you can lift more weight and that's

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.960 
you can lift more weight and that's
because<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:22.950> post<00:03:23.190> activation

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
because of the post activation

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.000 
because of the post activation
potentiation<00:03:24.569> so<00:03:25.260> here's<00:03:25.500> what<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.709> do<00:03:25.829> let's

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
potentiation so here's what you do let's

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.140 
potentiation so here's what you do let's
give<00:03:26.160> an<00:03:26.250> example<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.670> don't<00:03:26.760> know<00:03:26.880> what<00:03:27.060> this

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
give an example I don't know what this

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.759 
give an example I don't know what this
is<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.450> just<00:03:27.630> put<00:03:27.750> up<00:03:27.780> some<00:03:27.870> random<00:03:28.290> numbers<00:03:28.620> I

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
is I just put up some random numbers I

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.069 
is I just put up some random numbers I
think<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.370> copied<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:29.819> from<00:03:30.000> Waterbury<00:03:30.510> let's

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
think I copied this from Waterbury let's

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.870 
think I copied this from Waterbury let's
say<00:03:31.170> it's<00:03:31.290> deadlifts<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.459> first<00:03:32.670> wave

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
say it's deadlifts so on the first wave

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.309 
say it's deadlifts so on the first wave
they're<00:03:33.389> going<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.600> do<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.780> first<00:03:34.019> set<00:03:34.170> you

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
they're going to do the first set you

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.170 
they're going to do the first set you
shooting<00:03:34.769> for<00:03:34.799> five<00:03:35.040> reps<00:03:35.250> cool<00:03:35.549> you<00:03:35.670> got<00:03:35.790> 300

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
shooting for five reps cool you got 300

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.930 
shooting for five reps cool you got 300
pounds<00:03:36.269> salt<00:03:36.690> second<00:03:37.590> set<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:37.889> do<00:03:38.010> 320<00:03:38.790> pounds

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
pounds salt second set you do 320 pounds

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.569 
pounds salt second set you do 320 pounds
for<00:03:39.269> three<00:03:39.389> reps<00:03:39.630> third<00:03:40.410> set<00:03:40.709> we<00:03:40.859> got<00:03:40.950> 340<00:03:41.459> for

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
a whole bunch of sets you're second wave

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.080 
a whole bunch of sets you're second wave
usually<00:03:49.980> as<00:03:50.069> long<00:03:50.250> as<00:03:50.370> your<00:03:50.489> prong<00:03:50.700> as<00:03:50.880> long<00:03:51.000> as

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
you're second wave will be better let's

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.789 
you're second wave will be better let's
take<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> look<00:03:57.329> set<00:03:57.810> one<00:03:58.019> usually<00:03:58.290> the

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
take a look set one usually the

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.770 
take a look set one usually the
estimated<00:03:59.340> depends<00:03:59.790> Wow

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
estimated depends Wow

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.539 
estimated depends Wow
it<00:04:00.900> really<00:04:01.319> depends<00:04:01.650> on<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.829> individual<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.519> I

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
it really depends on the individual so I

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.920 
it really depends on the individual so I
don't<00:04:02.730> want<00:04:02.849> to<00:04:02.910> promise<00:04:03.120> things<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.720> won't

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
don't want to promise things that won't

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.319 
don't want to promise things that won't
occur<00:04:04.109> but<00:04:04.859> between<00:04:05.099> one<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.549> two<00:04:05.730> percent<00:04:05.880> an

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
occur but between one to two percent an

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.270 
occur but between one to two percent an
increase<00:04:07.049> in<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.260> second<00:04:07.620> wave<00:04:07.709> is<00:04:07.769> normal

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
increase in the second wave is normal

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.979 
increase in the second wave is normal
this<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.549> what<00:04:08.700> I've<00:04:08.880> experienced<00:04:09.419> and<00:04:09.540> most

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989

already we move on now so we do wave two

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.629 
already we move on now so we do wave two
right<00:04:17.039> step<00:04:17.340> one
