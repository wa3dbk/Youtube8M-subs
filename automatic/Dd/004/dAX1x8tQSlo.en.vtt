00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
recent ability of shuriken toss and it

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.430 
recent ability of shuriken toss and it
definitely<00:04:41.730> is<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.030> contender<00:04:42.510> as<00:04:42.660> my<00:04:42.840> level<00:04:43.140> 90

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440
