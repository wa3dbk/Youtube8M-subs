00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.380
 very well 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.719
 hello everyone and welcome to retro 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.250
 trainer well after this pokemon 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.570
 direct that has occurred today we have 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.800
 discovered enough news about 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 of the new generation video games 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.759
 because good x ti pokemon and if well already 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.439
 we have commented the main thing in the video 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.000
 previous the truth is that the page 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.130
 official pokemon updated all this 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.050
 information and we have it more at hand and the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.520
 full Spanish so good I leave you 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.050
 the link in the page description 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.030
 of pokemon where are all new 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.140
 data and step by step we will comment on 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.809
 depth everything that has been 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 announced during this direct pokemon 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.500
 first of all we go with an application 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.059
 that will come to us for bringing 3ds the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.920
 pokemon bank an application 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.630
 exclusive for pokémon games and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.700
 that will serve as additional houses 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.649
 to be able to show up to 3,000 pokemon 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.300
 in the cloud with which they will not occupy 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.920
 then our Pokémon games and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.539
 we can resort to them as soon as 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.670
 we are in a simple and fast way 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.559
 to be a service that should be 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.180
 maintained since it is in the cloud 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.670
 this application will be paid in a way 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.930
 annual is to say that we will not pay for it 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 once but every year will be paid 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.619
 although we still do not know the price but 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.869
 I suppose it will not be too much 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.270
 elevated and it is said that it will be about 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.649
 four euros a year and assumes that we 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.969
 will serve to start the editions of 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.960
 generation in addition with the bank of 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.880
 pokemon also comes another 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.979
 application that is called the pocket 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.270
 Translator that will serve us to send 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.920
 to our pokémon of the editions 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.649
 old fifth generation that is 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.750
 white black white two blacks to the bank 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.610
 of pokemon and from there to the sixth 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.170
 generation so in this way it 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.700
 confirms that we can have all the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.920
 other old pokemon in the new 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.200
 generation of 3ds without needing two 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.520
 consoles has also been confirmed that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.590
 we can store little with different 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.789
 games is to say that it will not be necessary 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.709
 records only what I am going to 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.179
 pokemon and therefore we can send 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.130
 several photos in the case that we have 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.259
 some a little blank others a little 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.270
 more black or even in three thousand 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.679
 different cartridges on the movement 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.329
 of pokemon between the bank and our 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.770
 games seems to be able to move 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.509
 several pokemon at once thing that 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.129
 facilitates the exchange and saves us a 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.110
 eternal time that we have wasted of 

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:08.610
 the past generations besides the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 application has a search engine to 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.450
 to be able to find the pokemon for you 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.040
 when again to names and so on about 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.230
 Portkey why this application 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.209
 It will be completely free and as you do not 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.280
 important when you hit 60 you had to good 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.959
 x and pokemon and they will give us a time of 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.830
 pokemon bank test a kind 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.230
 more to be able 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.030
 the service convinces us to feel it 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.890
 through the eshop that supposes that it will last 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.450
 until January we will be the truth is that 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.520
 this application there comes from pearls already 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.840
 I always stay in the PC space and 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.550
 therefore on some forms of 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.170
 be able to make several types and have them 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.760
 ordered in addition to having easy to 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.740
 security to send them to our 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.210
 games remember also that we have to 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.560
 have the pokemon bank to be able to 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.900
 make the transfer for him because 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.850
 translators so with this demo that 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.020
 we will arrive until January we have time 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.390
 for people who want to buy us the 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.160
 pokemon bag to pass these few where 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.020
 fifth generation to the new and have 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.240
 all our equipment from the previous 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.190
 generations in these generations 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.630
 well let's discuss the other aspect 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.670
 important announced during this era 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.230
 very direct and is that apparently the little 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.030
 initial of this generation we do not 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.800
 will give the cypress teacher but one of 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.840
 our rival friends while 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.520
 Professor to surprise everyone will give us 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.300
 one of the three singing initials is 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.790
 say come back 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.110
 Hernandez or scooter in addition along 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.550
 this live has revealed the mega 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.160
 form of the evolved forms of 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.500
 these is to say I am embarrassed and I 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.000
 Spending is after reading the data from 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.950
 three metaphors on the pokemon page 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.720
 We have more information about these 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.610
 so we go with mega monthly for 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.500
 start that we know will keep the 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.880
 poison plant type and will have 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.410
 skill of that vessel as we know from 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.210
 other generations reduces the damage 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.010
 received by movement of the game type and 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.420
 I filled both types very effective when 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.280
 transversal so it's a good 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.630
 skill everything and I want south of thicket 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.150
 of the fifth generation is very good 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.550
 competitively and we also know that 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.320
 both the defense and the special action 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.270
 of the adventure are increased 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.150
 after this mega evolution and that therefore 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.830
 it will be much better tank against attacks and 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.610
 special attacks 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.409
 let's continue with a little more than everything 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.090
 veteran of the saga loves rate that in 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.860
 this relationship can transform meazza 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.780
 and such that it also retains its fire type 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.459
 flying although the truth is that this time 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.019
 Dragon seems more than ever and 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.209
 we commented on the pokemon video of 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.500
 origin that seemed to be that saiz would count 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.299
 with the new evolution because it looked 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.069
 like the performance of the stone there in 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.540
 the trailer and at last today has been 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.220
 confirmed we know that you have the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.380
 drought skill just like draw donated 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.389
 mein teil and stability as we already know 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.530
 makes only the horde already appear 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.150
 which increases the power of 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.010
 game type moves in addition to 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.840
 make the solar ray just need a 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.340
 turn to be shot we also know 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.630
 that this way of performing has a 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.910
 much higher transition than 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.229
 it would be original so if we will have 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.120
 Watch out for rocks with traps 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.470
 rocks we are faced with a little to give 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.830
 the delights of the fans at the level 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.990
 competitive 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.730
 and finally mega blas 3 like 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.130
 our two this also retains its 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.540
 type that is water but this time wins 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.280
 a new skill that is legal 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.780
 trigger that apparently increases the 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.000
 power of movements related to 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.070
 the pulses like book pulse or pulse or 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.120
 murillo we do not know exactly what 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.910
 increment we are talking exactly 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.830
 but hopefully at least the 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.240
 double since otherwise your skill will be 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.310
 pretty loose compared to that of 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.810
 haidar and even with seeing south by 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.820
 so remember that in this generation 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.710
 we can have one of the three 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.630
 singing missions in addition to another of 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.370
 Carlos and finally high event chic 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.020
 so our adventure will start with 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.460
 the pretty powerful pokemon and where 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.570
 be sure everyone will have good 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.770
 shapes 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.120
 during this direct lso has 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.880
 revealed that the coach was wearing a 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.200
 kind of fish called mega what is the 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.940
 key so pokemon can 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.890
 perform the mere evolution and so 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.480
 it seems a link is necessary 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.370
 strong between the trainer and the pokemon 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.290
 so that the mega can react and 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.720
 Pokémon can evolve and therefore 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.250
 I imagine that this means that a 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.050
 indispensable requirement for the mega 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.880
 Evolution is that we focus have 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.140
 high enough that it will not 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.320
 so they will not want to evolve or 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.850
 turn 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.800
 and well finally comment one last 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.690
 thing that those who do not have the 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.940
 3ds but the nintendo 2 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.770
 neither does it convince them too much 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.180
 will appreciate and is that it has been announced that 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.860
 the special edition of pokemon x 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.170
 followed by the pont of japan here since 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.330
 the blue that we all say was very 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.100
 special will reach Europe and North America 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.990
 so much a blue color that now that there was 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.520
 as in red with reference colors 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.440
 of pokemon xy by certain editions 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.210
 new so for all those who 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.620
 still do not have a 3ds or have it done 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.870
 with this special mode or have a 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.010
 remember that on September 17 the 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.020
 launch good knit team that 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.280
 manny can you do with this console and 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.410
 start preparing for the new 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.970
 pokemon generation that every time you turn 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.590
 more and more be the best generation of 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.480
 all the times and what else can we 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.190
 enjoy all together formally that
