an old trick yeah but it's the first
time<00:02:43.690> I've<00:02:43.900> had<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.080> job<00:02:44.170> where<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.620> got<00:02:44.860> such<00:02:45.190> a

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
time I've had a job where I got such a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.040 
time I've had a job where I got such a
big<00:02:45.490> angle<00:02:45.910> difference<00:02:46.390> in<00:02:46.570> between<00:02:46.720> the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
big angle difference in between the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.850 
big angle difference in between the
buildings<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.850> just<00:02:48.930> making<00:02:49.930> use<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.410> that

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
buildings and just making use of that

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:06.990 
buildings and just making use of that
saved<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.510> much<00:02:52.720> time<00:03:04.440> just<00:03:05.440> lays<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.520> class<00:03:06.790> is

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
saved so much time just lays in class is

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.760 
saved so much time just lays in class is
the<00:03:07.030> way<00:03:07.240> you<00:03:07.300> want

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
the way you want

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.840 
the way you want
particularly<00:03:10.920> toilets<00:03:11.920> so<00:03:12.340> it's<00:03:12.430> quite<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.670> big

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
particularly toilets so it's quite a big

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.540 
particularly toilets so it's quite a big
plan<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.390> could<00:03:13.540> spend<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.870> lot<00:03:14.050> of<00:03:14.080> time

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
plan and you could spend a lot of time

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.830 
plan and you could spend a lot of time
getting<00:03:15.550> your<00:03:15.730> zoom<00:03:16.000> in<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.360> right<00:03:16.540> point

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
getting your zoom in to the right point

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.390 
getting your zoom in to the right point
whereas<00:03:17.230> if<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.470> save<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.890> as<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.040> view<00:03:18.310> of

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
whereas if you save that as a view of

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.280 
whereas if you save that as a view of
like<00:03:18.550> if<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.790> save<00:03:19.150> what<00:03:19.810> we're<00:03:19.960> looking<00:03:20.200> at

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
like if you save what we're looking at

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.160 
like if you save what we're looking at
right<00:03:20.350> now<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.860> a<00:03:20.890> view<00:03:21.190> yeah<00:03:23.700> yeah<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:26.050> know

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
right now is a view yeah yeah and I know

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.220 
right now is a view yeah yeah and I know
having<00:03:27.040> used<00:03:27.280> AutoCAD<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.600> it's<00:03:28.960> so

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
having used AutoCAD that it's so

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.640 
having used AutoCAD that it's so
difficult<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.950> do<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.840> setup<00:03:31.840> yeah<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:32.470> is

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
difficult to do and setup yeah this is

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.530 
difficult to do and setup yeah this is
such<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:32.860> just<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.250> point-and-click<00:03:33.910> job<00:03:34.390> and

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
such a just a point-and-click job and

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.370 
such a just a point-and-click job and
that's<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.840> it's<00:03:34.930> done

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380
