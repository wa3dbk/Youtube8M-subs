let's talk about human progress and game
when<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.360> say<00:00:12.599> human<00:00:12.900> progress<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.710> specifically

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
when I say human progress I specifically

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.550 
when I say human progress I specifically
mean<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.880> advanced<00:00:15.120> science<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.839> technology

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
mean the advanced science and technology

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.189 
mean the advanced science and technology
and<00:00:16.890> since<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.550> 21st<00:00:18.090> century<00:00:18.210> gaming<00:00:19.050> is

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
and since in the 21st century gaming is

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.830 
and since in the 21st century gaming is
completely<00:00:19.740> connected<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.310> technology

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840

which<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:33.289> quite<00:01:33.560> cool<00:01:33.950> them<00:01:34.159> in<00:01:34.869> company<00:01:35.869> with

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
which is quite cool them in company with

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.620 
which is quite cool them in company with
a<00:01:36.200> new<00:01:36.350> Rome<00:01:36.590> Rome<00:01:37.580> one<00:01:37.789> which<00:01:38.180> came<00:01:38.450> out

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
a new Rome Rome one which came out

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.020 
a new Rome Rome one which came out
exactly<00:01:39.200> nine<00:01:39.470> years<00:01:39.710> ago<00:01:39.860> was<00:01:40.549> 10<00:01:40.789> times

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
exactly nine years ago was 10 times

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.760 
exactly nine years ago was 10 times
smaller<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:41.720> that's<00:01:42.259> quite<00:01:42.530> interesting

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
smaller and that's quite interesting

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.649 
smaller and that's quite interesting
because<00:01:43.369> it's<00:01:43.700> somewhat<00:01:44.180> accurately

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
because it's somewhat accurately

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.749 
because it's somewhat accurately
predicted<00:01:45.289> by<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.530> law<00:01:45.740> called<00:01:46.069> Moore's<00:01:46.399> Law

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
predicted by a law called Moore's Law

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.969 
predicted by a law called Moore's Law
Moore's<00:01:47.390> law<00:01:47.690> roughly<00:01:48.020> states<00:01:48.440> then<00:01:48.740> less

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
Moore's law roughly states then less

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.249 
Moore's law roughly states then less
than<00:01:49.159> every<00:01:49.460> two<00:01:49.670> years<00:01:50.140> computational<00:01:51.140> speed

and memory capacity doubles meaning that

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.080
