00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
about you and when I got under your care

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.440 
about you and when I got under your care

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
things changed a lot for me because of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.510 
things changed a lot for me because of
the<00:01:38.960> way<00:01:39.080> that<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.500> treated<00:01:39.740> your<00:01:39.979> patients

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
the way that you treated your patients

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.219 
the way that you treated your patients
what<00:01:40.909> why<00:01:41.060> don't<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.240> try<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:41.630> do<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.990> to

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
what why don't you try and do is to

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.560 
what why don't you try and do is to
paint<00:01:42.439> a<00:01:42.590> picture<00:01:42.830> for<00:01:43.009> people<00:01:43.490> of<00:01:43.700> what<00:01:44.450> it

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
paint a picture for people of what it

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.510 
paint a picture for people of what it
was<00:01:44.750> like<00:01:45.549> before<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:47.270> after<00:01:48.520> protease

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
was like before and after protease

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.649 
was like before and after protease
inhibitors<00:01:50.200> were<00:01:51.200> invented<00:01:51.850> 10<00:01:52.850> 12<00:01:53.150> years<00:01:53.210> ago

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
inhibitors were invented 10 12 years ago

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.870 
inhibitors were invented 10 12 years ago
because<00:01:54.049> people<00:01:54.409> don't<00:01:54.500> get<00:01:54.710> that<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.189> much<00:01:55.369> in

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
because people don't get that so much in

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.510 
because people don't get that so much in
your<00:01:56.090> life<00:01:56.360> has<00:01:56.750> spanned<00:01:57.140> before<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.250> after

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
your life has spanned before and after

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.030 
your life has spanned before and after
the<00:01:58.640> invention<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:59.090> those<00:01:59.270> medications<00:02:00.040> well

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
the invention of those medications well

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.100 
the invention of those medications well
I<00:02:01.070> think<00:02:01.250> also<00:02:01.670> at<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.240> time<00:02:02.299> it<00:02:02.840> was<00:02:02.930> only

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
I think also at that time it was only

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.200 
I think also at that time it was only
like<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.500> CT<00:02:04.009> was<00:02:04.280> about<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.670> only<00:02:04.729> drug<00:02:05.180> that

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
like a CT was about the only drug that

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.109 
like a CT was about the only drug that
was<00:02:05.509> basically<00:02:05.720> out<00:02:06.200> there<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:07.729> was<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.909> lot

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
was basically out there and it was a lot

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.850 
was basically out there and it was a lot
of<00:02:08.149> guessing<00:02:08.479> because<00:02:08.899> they<00:02:09.319> didn't<00:02:09.739> really

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
of guessing because they didn't really

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.649 
of guessing because they didn't really
have<00:02:10.159> the<00:02:10.189> necessary<00:02:10.519> research<00:02:11.360> and

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
have the necessary research and

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.110 
have the necessary research and
background<00:02:12.170> studies<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.519> lot<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:13.849> times

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
background studies so a lot of times

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.330 
background studies so a lot of times
people<00:02:14.299> will<00:02:14.480> be<00:02:14.659> an<00:02:14.779> overdose<00:02:15.409> so<00:02:16.189> people

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
people will be an overdose so people

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.849 
people will be an overdose so people
being<00:02:16.730> under<00:02:17.029> dose<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:17.870> with<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.230> lot<00:02:18.499> I<00:02:18.680> guess

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
being under dose so with a lot I guess

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:19.800 
being under dose so with a lot I guess
work<00:02:19.129> a<00:02:19.219> lot<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.519> trash

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
work a lot of trash

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.050 
work a lot of trash
these<00:02:19.989> happen<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.349> lot<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.590> people<00:02:20.709> die<00:02:21.060> some

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
these happen a lot of people die some

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.400 
these happen a lot of people die some
people<00:02:22.270> were<00:02:22.330> scared<00:02:22.569> to<00:02:22.660> take<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.959> medicine

patient<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:53.019> i<00:03:53.049> think<00:03:53.260> it's<00:03:53.620> sort<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.370> like

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
patient so i think it's sort of like

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.979 
patient so i think it's sort of like
kind<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.880> like<00:03:54.940> one<00:03:55.239> hand<00:03:55.510> helps<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.959> other
