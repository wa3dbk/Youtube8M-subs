00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
as the more movies come out I think

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.600 
as the more movies come out I think
transformers<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.620> think<00:05:36.800> they<00:05:36.890> signed<00:05:37.310> up<00:05:37.580> for

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
transformers I think they signed up for

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.870
