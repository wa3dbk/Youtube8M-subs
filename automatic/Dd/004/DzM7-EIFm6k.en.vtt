fabric that's over top of it our

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.980 
fabric that's over top of it our
technology<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.790> latest<00:02:54.090> one<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:54.690> a

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
technology is the latest one so it's a

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.430 
technology is the latest one so it's a
really<00:02:55.709> soft<00:02:56.220> silicone<00:02:57.080> that's<00:02:58.080> actually

really soft silicone that's actually
bonded<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.010> leather<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.490> it's<00:02:59.640> a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
bonded to the leather so it's a

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.090 
bonded to the leather so it's a
one-piece<00:03:00.150> that's<00:03:00.450> not<00:03:00.660> gonna<00:03:00.900> irritate<00:03:01.650> you
