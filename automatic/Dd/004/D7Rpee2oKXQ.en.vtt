 We introduce winding nail block 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:30.189
 Rolled claw blocks are used at the base of railway cars 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:30.189
 What is special that was to bear the industrial spring with absolute reliability 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:44.290
 Using the force to set it to the nail in the state where the wings are extended and try to return 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.290
 It is a mechanism that lifts the both ends of the curl 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:58.390
 Next we will use a model to explain how to use the claw block 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.390
 Easy operation that anyone can do with the claw block 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.369

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.109
 Hook the hook when the river is large 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:13.700
 Hmm 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:14.620
 The curling nail block is shorter than the length of the nail 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.110
 Hmm 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:23.360
 Take advantage of the return force of the straightened blade for this short amount 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.909
 To correct the winding claw 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:33.600
 me 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:33.600
 Hold it with your finger and hook it on the other side so that the hook you made earlier does not come off 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.079
 It is complete with a cover so as not to affect everyday life 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:59.080
 It does not happen change as soon as it is set in the claws of the people 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:01.710
 The pain is resolved in a short time and the shape of the nails gradually opens up 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.100
 Pain in the toenails 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.650
 Do not bother anymore 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.650
