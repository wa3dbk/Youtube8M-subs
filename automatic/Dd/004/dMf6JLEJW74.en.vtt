00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
be taking a look at something really

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.789 
be taking a look at something really
awesome<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> new<00:00:12.960> hostile<00:00:13.530> mob

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
awesome and that is a new hostile mob

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.770 
awesome and that is a new hostile mob
farm<00:00:14.009> design<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.610> like<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.210> call<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> mob

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
farm design I like to call it the mob

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.960 
farm design I like to call it the mob
sweeper<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:16.920> I'm<00:00:17.100> sure<00:00:17.130> most<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.940> have

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
sweeper and as I'm sure most of you have

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.179 
sweeper and as I'm sure most of you have
guessed<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.720> uses<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.439> new<00:00:19.590> slime<00:00:19.920> block

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
guessed it uses the new slime block

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.950 
guessed it uses the new slime block
mechanics<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.850> were<00:00:20.970> introduced<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.660> one<00:00:21.869> of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
mechanics that were introduced in one of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.840 
mechanics that were introduced in one of
the<00:00:22.080> latest<00:00:22.410> snapshots<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.130> make<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> fairly

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the latest snapshots to make a fairly

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.120 
the latest snapshots to make a fairly
cool<00:00:24.150> design<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.779> pushes<00:00:25.529> all<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> mobs

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
cool design that pushes all of the mobs

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.210 
cool design that pushes all of the mobs
off<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> blocks<00:00:27.500> now<00:00:28.500> I'm<00:00:28.650> not<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.099> be

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
off the blocks now I'm not going to be

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.919 
off the blocks now I'm not going to be
doing<00:00:29.369> too<00:00:29.699> much<00:00:29.730> chatting<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.539> episode

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
doing too much chatting in this episode

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
doing too much chatting in this episode
because<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.590> design<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:31.949> fairly

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
because the design is fairly

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.120 
because the design is fairly
self-explanatory<00:00:33.290> instead<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> am<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.950> going

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
self-explanatory instead I am just going

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.010 
self-explanatory instead I am just going
to<00:00:35.250> get<00:00:35.399> straight<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:35.940> hit<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.660> escape

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
to get straight to it hit this escape

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.160 
to get straight to it hit this escape
button<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.680> go<00:00:38.460> into<00:00:38.760> hard<00:00:39.300> mode<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.809> we

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
button and go into hard mode and we

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.959 
button and go into hard mode and we
should<00:00:40.440> see<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.739> monsters<00:00:41.520> will<00:00:41.730> begin

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
should see that monsters will begin

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.299 
should see that monsters will begin
spawning<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.200> am<00:00:43.410> going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.739> go<00:00:43.890> down<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
spawning so I am going to go down to the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.520 
spawning so I am going to go down to the
bottom<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.329> should<00:00:45.570> begin<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.320> them

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
bottom and we should begin to see them

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.590 
bottom and we should begin to see them
pouring<00:00:46.920> out<00:00:47.070> okay<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.969> are<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> first<00:00:48.450> few

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
pouring out okay here are the first few

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.569 
pouring out okay here are the first few
it<00:00:48.989> always<00:00:49.170> starts<00:00:49.680> off<00:00:49.770> slowly<00:00:50.070> when<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> go

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
it always starts off slowly when you go

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.400 
it always starts off slowly when you go
from<00:00:50.700> peaceful<00:00:51.120> mode<00:00:51.270> into<00:00:51.480> hard<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:52.170> now<00:00:52.350> we

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
from peaceful mode into hard but now we

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.170 
from peaceful mode into hard but now we
should<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.340> back<00:00:53.370> there<00:00:53.969> will<00:00:54.149> be

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
should see out the back there will be

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.720 
should see out the back there will be
tons<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.989> tons<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.530> mobs<00:00:55.949> flowing<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:56.489> there

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
tons and tons of mobs flowing out there

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
tons and tons of mobs flowing out there
we<00:00:56.820> go<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.719> beginning<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.230> warm<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.859> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
we go it is beginning to warm up and you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.500 
we go it is beginning to warm up and you
can<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> their<00:01:00.059> drops<00:01:00.300> are

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
can see that all of their drops are

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.569 
can see that all of their drops are
going<00:01:01.170> into<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.559> hoppers<00:01:01.890> which<00:01:02.309> will

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
going into the hoppers which will

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.490 
going into the hoppers which will
eventually<00:01:02.940> feed<00:01:03.449> into<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> chest<00:01:04.049> here

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
eventually feed into the chest here

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
eventually feed into the chest here
comes<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.949> big<00:01:05.100> bundle<00:01:05.339> that's<00:01:05.970> what<00:01:06.240> I'm

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
comes a big bundle that's what I'm

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
comes a big bundle that's what I'm
talking<00:01:06.750> about<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.470> take<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.680> look<00:01:07.830> in

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
talking about so if we take a look in

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.530 
talking about so if we take a look in
this<00:01:08.040> chest<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.510> of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
this chest here you can see that all of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
this chest here you can see that all of
the<00:01:09.810> drops<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.740> building<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.369> almost

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the drops really are building up almost

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.000 
the drops really are building up almost
everything<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.689> spawn<00:01:13.200> inside<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.770> mob

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
everything can spawn inside this mob

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.640 
everything can spawn inside this mob
spawner<00:01:14.369> including<00:01:15.210> Enderman<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.170> might<00:01:16.439> not

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
spawner including Enderman you might not

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.469 
spawner including Enderman you might not
see<00:01:16.950> any<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.250> them<00:01:17.490> falling<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.150> can

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
see any of them falling but they can

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
see any of them falling but they can
spawn<00:01:18.840> because<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.040> only<00:01:20.220> three<00:01:20.610> blocks

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
spawn because this is only three blocks

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
spawn because this is only three blocks
tall<00:01:23.360> over<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.780> I've<00:01:24.990> got<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.500> module<00:01:25.890> of

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
tall over here I've got one module of

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.010 
tall over here I've got one module of
the<00:01:26.100> farm<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> am<00:01:27.299> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.600> try<00:01:27.840> my

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the farm and now I am going to try my

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.050 
the farm and now I am going to try my
best<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.530> explain<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.490> how<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.909> all

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
best to explain to you how this all

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.580 
best to explain to you how this all
works<00:01:30.360> I'm<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:30.780> particularly<00:01:31.110> good<00:01:31.290> at

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
works I'm not particularly good at

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.560 
works I'm not particularly good at
explaining<00:01:31.979> things<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.939> am<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> be

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
explaining things but I am going to be

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
explaining things but I am going to be
trying<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:33.960> best<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.530> quite<00:01:34.890> simply<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.369> can

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
trying my best so quite simply you can

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.490 
trying my best so quite simply you can
see<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.420> ourselves<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:37.049> set<00:01:37.290> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
see we have got ourselves a set of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.319 
see we have got ourselves a set of
Caterpillar<00:01:38.070> Pistons<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> what<00:01:38.820> these<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.180> is

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
Caterpillar Pistons and what these do is

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.480 
Caterpillar Pistons and what these do is
they<00:01:39.420> pull<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.320> wall<00:01:40.560> back<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.040> forth<00:01:41.280> along

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
they pull this wall back and forth along

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.819 
they pull this wall back and forth along
the<00:01:41.640> platform<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.659> any<00:01:42.960> mobs<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.320> spawn<00:01:43.649> on

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the platform so any mobs that spawn on

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.590 
the platform so any mobs that spawn on
it<00:01:43.950> will<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.430> gradually<00:01:44.909> pushed<00:01:45.149> off<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> edge

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it will be gradually pushed off the edge

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.690 
it will be gradually pushed off the edge
now<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.170> little<00:01:46.439> bug<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.430> noticed

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
now one little bug that I have noticed

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.609 
now one little bug that I have noticed
about<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.329> design<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.140> bit

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
about this design and it is a bit

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.950 
about this design and it is a bit
peculiar<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.119> walk<00:01:51.390> towards<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
peculiar is that if you walk towards the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.649 
peculiar is that if you walk towards the
wall<00:01:52.399> occasionally<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.060> go<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.420> through

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
wall occasionally you can go on through

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.539 
wall occasionally you can go on through
it<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.200> seen<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> few<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> mobs

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
it and I have seen a few of the mobs

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.340 
it and I have seen a few of the mobs
doing<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.750> don't<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.049> know<00:01:58.200> how

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
doing this and I don't really know how

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.870 
doing this and I don't really know how
to<00:01:58.380> fix<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.130> does<00:01:59.369> lower<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
to fix it but it does lower the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.469 
to fix it but it does lower the
efficiency<00:02:00.450> ever<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.290> slightly<00:02:02.090> now<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.270> far

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
efficiency ever so slightly now as far

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.469 
efficiency ever so slightly now as far
as<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.930> big<00:02:04.259> ugly<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.219> uncompact<00:02:06.030> circle

control the timings of these Pistons it

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.250 
control the timings of these Pistons it
uses<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> lot<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.910> very<00:02:12.239> specific<00:02:12.420> timings

uses a lot of very specific timings
we've

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
we've

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.949 
we've
monostable<00:02:14.220> circuits<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:14.939> everything<00:02:15.659> over

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
monostable circuits and everything over

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.839 
monostable circuits and everything over
here<00:02:15.989> I'll<00:02:16.439> quickly<00:02:16.739> show<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.099> an<00:02:17.310> example<00:02:17.430> of

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
here I'll quickly show you an example of

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:18.619 
here I'll quickly show you an example of
how<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.150> works

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
how it works

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.479 
how it works
so<00:02:18.989> for<00:02:19.290> these<00:02:19.409> slime<00:02:19.709> blocks<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.189> move<00:02:20.340> in

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
so for these slime blocks to move in

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.729 
so for these slime blocks to move in
this<00:02:20.730> direction<00:02:20.970> we<00:02:21.780> need<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.959> send<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.500> one

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
this direction we need to send a one

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.380 
this direction we need to send a one
tick<00:02:22.920> post<00:02:23.159> through<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.579> piston<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:24.209> and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
tick post through this piston here and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.030 
tick post through this piston here and
then<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.079> need<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.260> send<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.620> pulse<00:02:25.799> through

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
then we need to send a pulse through

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.399 
then we need to send a pulse through
this<00:02:26.159> piston<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:27.090> will<00:02:27.239> drag<00:02:27.569> this<00:02:27.900> piston

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
this piston that will drag this piston

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.319 
this piston that will drag this piston
forwards<00:02:28.829> so<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:29.549> can<00:02:29.730> then<00:02:29.849> repeat<00:02:30.209> the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
forwards so that we can then repeat the

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.420 
forwards so that we can then repeat the
process<00:02:30.359> once<00:02:30.959> again<00:02:31.109> the<00:02:31.859> reason<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.310> we

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
process once again the reason that we

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.160 
process once again the reason that we
have<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.849> hopper<00:02:33.180> time<00:02:33.390> out<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.810> back<00:02:33.989> is

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
have this hopper time out the back is

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.589 
have this hopper time out the back is
that<00:02:34.769> is<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.250> we<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.609> keep<00:02:35.879> it<00:02:36.060> traveling<00:02:36.480> in

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
that is so we can keep it traveling in

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.210 
that is so we can keep it traveling in
the<00:02:36.930> same<00:02:37.109> direction<00:02:37.319> for<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.799> certain<00:02:38.099> length

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the same direction for a certain length

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.490 
the same direction for a certain length
of<00:02:38.400> time<00:02:38.459> then<00:02:39.090> when<00:02:39.359> it<00:02:39.450> reaches<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> end<00:02:40.079> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
of time then when it reaches the end the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.199 
of time then when it reaches the end the
hopper<00:02:40.799> time<00:02:40.980> will<00:02:41.220> switch<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.939> will<00:02:42.060> go

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
hopper time will switch and it will go

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.000 
hopper time will switch and it will go
in<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> opposite<00:02:42.959> direction<00:02:43.109> otherwise<00:02:43.709> it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
in the opposite direction otherwise it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.800 
in the opposite direction otherwise it
will<00:02:44.069> just<00:02:44.129> stay<00:02:44.430> at<00:02:44.549> one<00:02:44.730> end<00:02:44.879> and<00:02:45.060> never<00:02:45.540> move

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
will just stay at one end and never move

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.720 
will just stay at one end and never move
which<00:02:46.109> would<00:02:46.319> be<00:02:46.470> fairly<00:02:46.920> useless<00:02:47.310> wouldn't

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
which would be fairly useless wouldn't

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.860 
on and also a new concept is always nice
to<00:03:14.519> see<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:14.939> if<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.239> do<00:03:15.389> want<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.629> take<00:03:15.810> a

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
to see so if you do want to take a

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.479 
to see so if you do want to take a
closer<00:03:16.139> look<00:03:16.260> at<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.709> Redstone<00:03:17.129> behind<00:03:17.340> it

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
closer look at the Redstone behind it

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.280 
closer look at the Redstone behind it
then<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.060> course<00:03:18.329> I<00:03:18.510> will<00:03:18.690> put<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.989> world

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
then of course I will put a world

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.289 
then of course I will put a world
download<00:03:19.500> down<00:03:19.889> in<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.160> description<00:03:20.669> and<00:03:20.819> if

you really really want a tutorial then
of<00:03:24.239> course<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.840> will<00:03:25.049> crack<00:03:25.260> on<00:03:25.470> with<00:03:25.500> one<00:03:25.769> if

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
of course I will crack on with one if

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.189 
of course I will crack on with one if
there<00:03:26.160> are<00:03:26.280> enough<00:03:26.459> requests<00:03:27.090> but<00:03:27.599> anyway<00:03:27.959> if

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
there are enough requests but anyway if

this<00:03:34.919> has<00:03:35.010> been<00:03:35.069> mumbo<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:35.760> I'm<00:03:36.180> out<00:03:36.359> I'll<00:03:36.599> see

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
this has been mumbo and I'm out I'll see

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:53.020 
this has been mumbo and I'm out I'll see
you<00:03:36.989> later

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.880 

all<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.270> this<00:03:54.390> circuitry<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.349> see<00:03:55.560> over

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
all of this circuitry that you see over

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.800 
all of this circuitry that you see over
here<00:03:55.920> is<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.489> do<00:03:56.610> with<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.940> timing<00:03:57.180> circuits

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
here is to do with the timing circuits

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.559 
here is to do with the timing circuits
and<00:03:57.930> these<00:03:58.319> are<00:03:58.620> very<00:03:59.040> specific<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.450> is

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
and these are very specific and that is

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.270 
and these are very specific and that is
because<00:04:00.900> they<00:04:01.110> are<00:04:01.140> integral<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.069> way

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
because they are integral to the way

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.370 
because they are integral to the way
that<00:04:02.489> these<00:04:02.580> Pistons<00:04:03.060> move<00:04:03.270> I<00:04:03.510> have<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.050> little

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
that these Pistons move I have a little

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.110 
that these Pistons move I have a little
bit<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.709> demonstration<00:04:05.280> here<00:04:05.580> as<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.910> how<00:04:05.940> we

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
bit of a demonstration here as to how we

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.240 
bit of a demonstration here as to how we
move<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:06.630> slime<00:04:06.900> block<00:04:07.140> wall<00:04:07.319> across<00:04:07.590> so

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
move this slime block wall across so

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.760 
move this slime block wall across so
first<00:04:08.670> of<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.090> one<00:04:09.630> tick<00:04:09.900> post<00:04:10.140> travels<00:04:10.590> through

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
first of a one tick post travels through

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.559 
first of a one tick post travels through
this<00:04:10.890> piston<00:04:11.280> which<00:04:11.670> spits<00:04:12.030> out<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.330> blocks

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
this piston which spits out the blocks

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.380 
this piston which spits out the blocks
and<00:04:12.810> then<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.709> post<00:04:14.280> goes<00:04:14.610> through<00:04:14.910> this<00:04:15.120> block

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
and then a post goes through this block

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.599 
and then a post goes through this block
and<00:04:15.600> pulls<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.320> pistol<00:04:16.680> on<00:04:16.919> meaning<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.489> we

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
and pulls the pistol on meaning that we

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.860 
and pulls the pistol on meaning that we
get<00:04:17.790> ourselves<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.389> little<00:04:18.570> bit<00:04:18.750> of<00:04:18.810> a

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
get ourselves a little bit of a

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.569 
get ourselves a little bit of a
caterpillar<00:04:19.079> piston<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.889> this<00:04:20.340> obviously

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
caterpillar piston and this obviously

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.670 
caterpillar piston and this obviously
works<00:04:21.060> in<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.359> opposite<00:04:21.690> direction<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.470> just

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
works in the opposite direction you just

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.050 
works in the opposite direction you just
put<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.979> one<00:04:23.160> tick<00:04:23.370> post<00:04:23.610> through<00:04:23.880> this

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
put the one tick post through this

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:34.550 
put the one tick post through this
piston<00:04:24.479> oh<00:04:27.800> what<00:04:31.100> that<00:04:32.100> was<00:04:32.250> strange
