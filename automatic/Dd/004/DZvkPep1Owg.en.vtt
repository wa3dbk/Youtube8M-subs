know when you have kids

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.950 
know when you have kids
I<00:03:41.550> think<00:03:42.550> a<00:03:42.640> good<00:03:42.760> thing<00:03:42.970> for<00:03:43.150> Jason<00:03:43.540> was<00:03:43.720> that

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
I think a good thing for Jason was that

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.080 
I think a good thing for Jason was that
his<00:03:44.860> wife<00:03:45.100> was<00:03:45.280> able<00:03:45.490> to<00:03:45.550> come<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.880> all<00:03:45.940> the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
his wife was able to come to all the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.670 
his wife was able to come to all the
appointments<00:03:46.300> right<00:03:46.660> away<00:03:46.960> and<00:03:47.260> he<00:03:47.560> had

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
appointments right away and he had

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.410 
appointments right away and he had
really<00:03:47.830> good<00:03:48.010> discussions<00:03:48.580> with<00:03:49.270> the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
really good discussions with the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.360 
really good discussions with the
physicians<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.920> think<00:03:51.070> that's<00:03:51.190> made<00:03:51.340> a

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
physicians and I think that's made a

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.200 
physicians and I think that's made a
huge<00:03:51.430> difference

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
huge difference

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.450 
huge difference
you<00:03:52.270> know<00:03:52.390> we<00:03:52.660> dealt<00:03:53.530> with<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.800> right<00:03:53.920> away<00:03:54.040> we

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
you know we dealt with it right away we

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.220 
you know we dealt with it right away we
made<00:03:54.640> sure<00:03:54.670> that<00:03:55.210> you<00:03:55.780> know<00:03:55.870> everyone<00:03:56.170> was

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
made sure that you know everyone was

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.560 
made sure that you know everyone was
informed<00:03:56.710> right<00:03:56.830> from<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.100> beginning<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.760> I

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
informed right from the beginning and I

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.540 
informed right from the beginning and I
think<00:03:58.600> it's<00:03:58.900> a<00:03:58.960> process<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.680> I<00:04:00.190> think<00:04:00.220> that's

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
think it's a process and I think that's

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.730 
think it's a process and I think that's
why<00:04:00.850> it<00:04:01.390> was<00:04:01.480> important<00:04:01.990> for<00:04:02.110> us<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.410> make<00:04:02.560> sure

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
why it was important for us to make sure

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.020 
why it was important for us to make sure
that<00:04:02.860> we<00:04:02.980> got<00:04:03.070> him<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.310> best<00:04:03.340> care<00:04:03.790> right<00:04:04.000> away

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
that we got him the best care right away

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.090 
that we got him the best care right away
made<00:04:04.900> sure<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.200> diagnosis<00:04:05.800> was<00:04:05.950> confirmed

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
made sure the diagnosis was confirmed

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.700 
made sure the diagnosis was confirmed
before<00:04:07.030> we<00:04:07.420> obviously<00:04:07.570> you<00:04:08.200> know<00:04:08.320> put<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.620> out

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
before we obviously you know put it out

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.680 
before we obviously you know put it out
in<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.040> public<00:04:09.250> because<00:04:09.910> you<00:04:10.600> know

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
in the public because you know

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.060 
in the public because you know
misinformation<00:04:11.200> is<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.680> worst<00:04:11.860> thing<00:04:11.980> you

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
misinformation is the worst thing you

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.820 
misinformation is the worst thing you
can<00:04:12.190> do<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:13.420> I<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:13.930> think<00:04:14.110> it's<00:04:14.230> Jason<00:04:14.560> said

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
can do so I and I think it's Jason said

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.949 
can do so I and I think it's Jason said
the<00:04:14.980> fact<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.400> we're<00:04:16.239> able<00:04:16.360> to<00:04:16.600> be<00:04:16.750> here

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
the fact that we're able to be here

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.340 
the fact that we're able to be here
today<00:04:17.250> he<00:04:18.250> looks<00:04:18.549> well<00:04:18.790> he'll<00:04:19.120> play<00:04:19.450> for<00:04:20.200> more

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
today he looks well he'll play for more

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.990 
today he looks well he'll play for more
importantly<00:04:20.830> he's<00:04:21.070> moving<00:04:21.400> forward

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
importantly he's moving forward

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.430 
importantly he's moving forward
and<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:22.390> think<00:04:22.570> that's<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.840> most<00:04:22.930> important

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
and I think that's the most important

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.760 
and I think that's the most important
thing<00:04:23.500> for<00:04:23.980> him<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.730> for<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:25.000> team<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.770> they

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
thing for him and for the team that they

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.120 
thing for him and for the team that they
in<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.690> release<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.930> there<00:04:29.080> seems<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.470> be<00:04:29.740> a

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
in the release that there seems to be a

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.550 
in the release that there seems to be a
fairly<00:04:30.940> positive<00:04:31.150> up<00:04:31.570> with<00:04:31.900> this<00:04:32.080> from<00:04:32.440> the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
fairly positive up with this from the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.710 
fairly positive up with this from the
consults<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:33.250> had<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.700> think<00:04:34.330> there's<00:04:34.600> no

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
consults that you had I think there's no

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.990 
consults that you had I think there's no
question<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:35.380> mean<00:04:35.560> I<00:04:35.650> think<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:36.040> medical

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
question I mean I think the medical

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.640 
question I mean I think the medical
science<00:04:37.240> with<00:04:37.750> this<00:04:37.900> particular<00:04:38.170> type<00:04:38.620> of

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
science with this particular type of

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.910 
science with this particular type of
leukemia<00:04:38.980> has<00:04:39.400> come<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.640> long<00:04:39.730> way<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:41.830> know

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
leukemia has come a long way you know

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.380 
leukemia has come a long way you know
I'm<00:04:42.070> sure<00:04:42.100> Jason<00:04:42.640> will<00:04:42.730> speak<00:04:42.970> to<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.180> fact

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
I'm sure Jason will speak to the fact

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.570 
I'm sure Jason will speak to the fact
that<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.690> actual<00:04:43.960> medication<00:04:44.620> is<00:04:44.890> actually

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
that the actual medication is actually

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.760 
that the actual medication is actually
called<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.910> Magic<00:04:46.330> Bullet<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:46.870> we've<00:04:47.530> kind

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
called the Magic Bullet and we've kind

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.950 
called the Magic Bullet and we've kind
of<00:04:47.800> joked<00:04:48.070> a<00:04:48.220> bit<00:04:48.340> about<00:04:48.550> that<00:04:48.820> because<00:04:49.090> it<00:04:49.840> was

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
of joked a bit about that because it was

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.810 
of joked a bit about that because it was
all<00:04:50.140> about<00:04:50.320> getting<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:50.800> magic<00:04:51.310> bullet<00:04:51.460> and

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
all about getting that magic bullet and

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.660 
all about getting that magic bullet and
I<00:04:52.090> think<00:04:52.450> that<00:04:52.720> it<00:04:52.900> there's<00:04:53.290> no<00:04:53.410> question<00:04:53.980> that

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
I think that it there's no question that

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.580 
I think that it there's no question that
in<00:04:55.660> this<00:04:55.810> particular<00:04:56.080> condition<00:04:57.000> it's<00:04:58.000> quite

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
in this particular condition it's quite

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.170 
in this particular condition it's quite
remarkable<00:04:59.590> that<00:04:59.980> you<00:05:00.310> know<00:05:00.430> a<00:05:00.460> pill<00:05:00.820> taken

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
remarkable that you know a pill taken

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.850 
remarkable that you know a pill taken
once<00:05:01.390> a<00:05:01.540> day<00:05:01.570> can<00:05:01.960> really<00:05:02.200> control<00:05:02.710> this

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
once a day can really control this

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.120 
once a day can really control this
condition<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.810> allow<00:05:05.260> person<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.740> carry<00:05:05.980> on

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
condition and allow person to carry on

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.030 
condition and allow person to carry on
their<00:05:06.340> normal<00:05:06.610> life<00:05:08.070> characterize<00:05:09.070> the

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
their normal life characterize the

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.070 
their normal life characterize the
so<00:05:10.220> here<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.580> go<00:05:10.700> along<00:05:10.880> with<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:11.120> mean<00:05:11.450> a<00:05:11.630> normal

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
so here to go along with I mean a normal

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.260 
so here to go along with I mean a normal
person<00:05:12.740> is<00:05:12.890> not<00:05:13.070> playing<00:05:13.400> at<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.610> high<00:05:13.730> level<00:05:13.790> of

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
person is not playing at a high level of

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.540 
person is not playing at a high level of
athletic<00:05:14.780> activity<00:05:15.290> how<00:05:15.740> likely<00:05:16.010> is<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.340> that

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
athletic activity how likely is it that

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.680 
athletic activity how likely is it that
he's<00:05:16.640> going<00:05:16.760> to<00:05:16.820> be<00:05:16.910> able<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.090> take<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.420> pill

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
he's going to be able to take the pill

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.980 
he's going to be able to take the pill
and<00:05:17.990> be<00:05:18.470> able<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.710> continue<00:05:19.070> to<00:05:19.100> be<00:05:19.340> playing

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
and be able to continue to be playing

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.230 
and be able to continue to be playing
playing<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.110> sport<00:05:21.620> at<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:21.950> level<00:05:22.210> well<00:05:23.210> I

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
playing the sport at that level well I

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.240 
playing the sport at that level well I
think<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:24.140> interesting<00:05:24.770> thing<00:05:24.830> with<00:05:25.100> the

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
think the interesting thing with the

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.680 
think the interesting thing with the
particular<00:05:25.490> conditions<00:05:26.060> a<00:05:26.150> lot<00:05:26.270> of<00:05:26.420> people

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
particular conditions a lot of people

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.120 
particular conditions a lot of people
are<00:05:26.750> diagnosed<00:05:27.350> you<00:05:27.770> know<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.010> if<00:05:28.100> it's

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
are diagnosed you know and if it's

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.280 
are diagnosed you know and if it's
diagnosed<00:05:28.790> early<00:05:29.120> they<00:05:29.570> may<00:05:29.720> not<00:05:29.810> have<00:05:30.050> a<00:05:30.080> lot

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
diagnosed early they may not have a lot

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.080 
diagnosed early they may not have a lot
of<00:05:30.380> symptoms<00:05:30.650> I<00:05:31.010> mean<00:05:31.250> it's<00:05:31.430> very<00:05:31.490> commonly

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
of symptoms I mean it's very commonly

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.960 
of symptoms I mean it's very commonly
picked<00:05:32.450> up<00:05:32.690> on<00:05:33.170> a<00:05:33.230> routine<00:05:33.920> blood<00:05:34.400> work<00:05:34.670> or<00:05:34.910> a

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
picked up on a routine blood work or a

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.660 
picked up on a routine blood work or a
routine<00:05:35.420> examination<00:05:36.190> and<00:05:37.190> I<00:05:37.310> think<00:05:37.490> that's

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
routine examination and I think that's

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.100 
routine examination and I think that's
the<00:05:37.820> great<00:05:38.000> thing<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:38.540> know<00:05:38.630> obviously<00:05:39.020> in

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
the great thing you know obviously in

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.170 
the great thing you know obviously in
Jason's<00:05:39.500> case<00:05:39.740> as<00:05:39.950> well<00:05:40.160> is<00:05:40.370> that<00:05:40.430> you<00:05:40.850> know

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
Jason's case as well is that you know

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.960 
Jason's case as well is that you know
that's<00:05:41.360> why<00:05:41.600> teams<00:05:42.380> do<00:05:42.680> you<00:05:43.010> know<00:05:43.340> pre-season

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
that's why teams do you know pre-season

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.030 
that's why teams do you know pre-season
medicals<00:05:44.390> on<00:05:44.600> all<00:05:44.750> aspects<00:05:45.260> I<00:05:45.440> mean<00:05:45.590> it's<00:05:45.800> to

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
medicals on all aspects I mean it's to

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.890 
medicals on all aspects I mean it's to
you<00:05:46.700> know<00:05:46.790> make<00:05:47.000> sure<00:05:47.030> that<00:05:47.240> we're<00:05:47.630> doing<00:05:47.660> the

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
you know make sure that we're doing the

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.360 
you know make sure that we're doing the
best<00:05:47.990> for<00:05:48.320> the<00:05:48.410> player<00:05:48.650> as<00:05:48.800> far<00:05:49.010> as<00:05:49.100> their<00:05:49.250> own

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
best for the player as far as their own

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.640 
best for the player as far as their own
health
