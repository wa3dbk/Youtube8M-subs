00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
in the air yeah and they believe a nice

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.790 
in the air yeah and they believe a nice
fiery<00:02:04.150> trail<00:02:04.479> as<00:02:04.690> they<00:02:04.720> went<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.590> then<00:02:05.740> we

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
fiery trail as they went and then we

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.230 
fiery trail as they went and then we
could<00:02:05.950> Electrify<00:02:06.310> his<00:02:06.580> shotgun<00:02:06.790> as<00:02:07.090> well

could Electrify his shotgun as well
which<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.110> didn't<00:02:08.350> really<00:02:08.470> see<00:02:09.250> much

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
which I didn't really see much

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.680 
which I didn't really see much
difference<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.880> just<00:02:09.970> seemed<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.450> up<00:02:10.570> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
difference it just seemed to up the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.180 
difference it just seemed to up the
power<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:11.050> little<00:02:11.290> bit<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.709> strength<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.100> it

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
power a little bit the strength of it

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.000 
power a little bit the strength of it
sure<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.150> was<00:02:13.239> all<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.480> really<00:02:13.690> did<00:02:14.010> but

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
sure but that was all it really did but

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.530 
sure but that was all it really did but
one<00:02:15.130> thing<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.430> was<00:02:15.610> nice<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.209> noticed

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
one thing that was nice that I noticed

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.870 
one thing that was nice that I noticed
as<00:02:16.660> well<00:02:16.780> as<00:02:16.959> as<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.470> set<00:02:18.250> fire<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.459> one<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.790> these

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
as well as as I set fire to one of these

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.240 
as well as as I set fire to one of these
zombies<00:02:19.480> he<00:02:19.690> landed<00:02:19.989> in<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.200> grass<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
zombies he landed in the grass and the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.710 
zombies he landed in the grass and the
entire<00:02:21.580> lawn<00:02:21.880> in<00:02:22.030> front<00:02:22.239> of<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.420> house

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
entire lawn in front of this house

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.170 
entire lawn in front of this house
caught<00:02:23.170> fire<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.860> killed<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.640> couple<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.000> like

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
caught fire and killed a couple of like

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.300 
caught fire and killed a couple of like
idling<00:02:25.930> sort<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.380> slower<00:02:26.709> zombies<00:02:27.130> as<00:02:27.280> well

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
idling sort of slower zombies as well

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.590 
idling sort of slower zombies as well
yeah<00:02:27.760> there<00:02:27.970> were<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> lot<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.270> little<00:02:28.420> nice

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
yeah there were a lot of little nice

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.000 
yeah there were a lot of little nice
effects<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.200> yeah<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.650> think<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
effects like that yeah I think the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
effects like that yeah I think the
divine<00:02:30.310> environment<00:02:30.730> could<00:02:30.820> have<00:02:30.910> been<00:02:31.000> a

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
divine environment could have been a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.030 
divine environment could have been a
little<00:02:31.360> bit<00:02:31.450> more<00:02:31.480> destructible<00:02:32.230> but<00:02:32.800> again

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
little bit more destructible but again

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.890 
little bit more destructible but again
it's<00:02:33.220> free<00:02:33.430> alpha<00:02:33.730> or<00:02:33.940> alpha<00:02:34.239> yeah<00:02:34.690> Los

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
it's free alpha or alpha yeah Los

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.900 
it's free alpha or alpha yeah Los
Angeles<00:02:35.050> there's<00:02:35.530> San<00:02:35.920> Francisco<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.550> one

the west coast it's not London I don't
know<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:41.920> might<00:02:42.070> be<00:02:42.100> lettuce<00:02:42.660> it's<00:02:43.660> usually

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
know it might be lettuce it's usually

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.110 
know it might be lettuce it's usually
love<00:02:44.080> it's<00:02:44.290> usually<00:02:44.410> one<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.640> they<00:02:45.760> yeah<00:02:46.090> they

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
love it's usually one but they yeah they

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.460 
love it's usually one but they yeah they
have<00:02:46.360> one<00:02:46.540> challenge<00:02:46.750> towards<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.230> end<00:02:47.350> as

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
have one challenge towards the end as

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.890 
have one challenge towards the end as
well<00:02:47.620> which<00:02:47.830> was<00:02:47.950> we<00:02:48.070> had<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.340> defend<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:49.030> movie

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
well which was we had to defend a movie

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.360 
well which was we had to defend a movie
theater<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.440> believe<00:02:50.769> yeah<00:02:51.130> I<00:02:51.160> mean

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
theater I believe yeah I mean

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.259 
theater I believe yeah I mean
essentially<00:02:51.610> we<00:02:51.760> were<00:02:51.850> just<00:02:51.940> standing<00:02:52.090> there

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
essentially we were just standing there

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.550 
essentially we were just standing there
and<00:02:52.390> they<00:02:52.540> had<00:02:52.660> waves<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:53.019> zombies<00:02:53.049> coming

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
and they had waves of zombies coming

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.560 
and they had waves of zombies coming
faster<00:02:53.950> which<00:02:54.160> again<00:02:54.519> another<00:02:54.790> left<00:02:55.330> had<00:02:55.450> any

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
faster which again another left had any

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.509 
faster which again another left had any

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
kind of feel of like come on team get

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.949 
kind of feel of like come on team get
together<00:02:57.670> let's<00:02:58.030> get<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.299> done<00:02:58.540> yeah

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
together let's get this done yeah

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.660 
together let's get this done yeah
although<00:02:59.260> there<00:02:59.680> whether<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.160> team<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.489> there

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
although there whether the team is there

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.280 
although there whether the team is there
or<00:03:00.790> not<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.420> challenge<00:03:01.750> went<00:03:01.900> ahead<00:03:01.989> and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
or not the the challenge went ahead and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.890 
or not the the challenge went ahead and
I<00:03:02.350> think<00:03:02.560> like<00:03:02.650> three<00:03:02.830> people<00:03:03.070> defended<00:03:03.549> it

I think like three people defended it

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.729 
I think like three people defended it
successful<00:03:04.900> like<00:03:04.989> two<00:03:05.140> people<00:03:05.350> defended

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
successful like two people defended

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.100 
successful like two people defended
successfully<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:06.780> but<00:03:07.780> yeah<00:03:07.870> there<00:03:08.019> were<00:03:08.080> a
