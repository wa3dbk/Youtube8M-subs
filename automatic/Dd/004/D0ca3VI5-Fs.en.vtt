is<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.230> Lego<00:00:28.529> replica<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:30.420> course

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
is the Lego replica it's of course

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.840 
is the Lego replica it's of course
one-to-one<00:00:31.320> scale<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:32.040> even<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.489> -<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.700> got

one-to-one scale it's even got - we got

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.660 
one-to-one scale it's even got - we got
the<00:00:32.940> ballistics<00:00:33.920> CPU<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.370> reduce

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the ballistics CPU on it to reduce

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.229 
the ballistics CPU on it to reduce
weapons<00:00:36.360> sway<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> DSR<00:00:38.250> sniper<00:00:38.610> rifle<00:00:39.030> in

go-to sniper dealing at the most damage

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.520 
go-to sniper dealing at the most damage
in<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.969> game<00:00:48.000> when<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.660> comes<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.989> snipers

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530

in the game when it comes to snipers
here<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.460> both<00:00:50.760> sides<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.420> I'll<00:00:51.870> put<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
here it is both sides and I'll put it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.260 
here it is both sides and I'll put it
down<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.399> get<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> full<00:00:53.879> view<00:00:54.239> of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
down here so we can get the full view of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.950 
down here so we can get the full view of
it<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.379> Lego<00:00:55.710> DSR<00:00:56.340> took<00:00:56.879> nearly<00:00:57.120> 2,000

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it so this Lego DSR took nearly 2,000

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.869 
it so this Lego DSR took nearly 2,000
Lego<00:00:58.140> bricks<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.609> he's<00:00:59.670> got

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
Lego bricks there you can see he's got

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.080 
Lego bricks there you can see he's got
the<00:01:00.030> rail<00:01:00.270> system<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.350> scope<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.949> well<00:01:02.090> was

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the rail system the scope as well was

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.090 
the rail system the scope as well was
built<00:01:03.329> using<00:01:03.539> some<00:01:03.809> clear<00:01:04.080> pieces<00:01:04.530> even<00:01:04.860> some

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
built using some clear pieces even some

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.630 
built using some clear pieces even some
Lego<00:01:05.780> elastic<00:01:06.780> bands<00:01:07.159> there's<00:01:08.159> an<00:01:08.310> overall

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
Lego elastic bands there's an overall

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.700 
Lego elastic bands there's an overall
look<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> barrel<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
look of it it's got the barrel and the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.039 
look of it it's got the barrel and the
ballistic<00:01:10.979> CPU<00:01:11.460> was<00:01:12.060> built<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.540> some<00:01:12.720> green

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
ballistic CPU was built with some green

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.070 
ballistic CPU was built with some green
neon<00:01:13.890> pieces<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.390> were<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> take<00:01:15.840> this

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
neon pieces so if you were to take this

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.700 
neon pieces so if you were to take this
bad<00:01:16.799> boy<00:01:16.830> out<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.750> public<00:01:19.170> go<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.560> on

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
a roof with this that would not be a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
a roof with this that would not be a
very<00:01:22.439> good<00:01:22.590> idea<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.220> magazine<00:01:23.700> goes<00:01:23.729> behind

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the trigger for an overall shorter

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.999 
the trigger for an overall shorter
length<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:28.200> got<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> magazine
