and such oh this is the piston that fits
into<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.329> master<00:00:33.660> cylinder<00:00:34.250> that's<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
into the master cylinder that's what the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.139 
into the master cylinder that's what the
pin<00:00:36.270> actuates<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.410> another<00:00:38.040> thing<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.969> these

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
pin actuates to another thing and these

though this also comes in its the giant
rubber<00:01:05.689> condom<00:01:06.689> thing<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> brake<00:01:08.220> lever

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
rubber condom thing for the brake lever

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
rubber condom thing for the brake lever
and<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.880> kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.510> break<00:01:09.689> therefore

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and all that kind of not break therefore

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.490 
and all that kind of not break therefore
the<00:01:11.000> actuated<00:01:12.000> lever<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.140> master

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the actuated lever on the master

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.679 
the actuated lever on the master
cylinder<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.119> this<00:01:15.119> will<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.330> nice<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.570> have

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
cylinder so this will be nice to have

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.210 
cylinder so this will be nice to have
one<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.140> stretched<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:16.890> covered

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
one that's not stretched out all covered

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.219 
one that's not stretched out all covered
in<00:01:17.310> brake<00:01:17.490> fluid<00:01:22.640> next<00:01:23.810> sort<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.900> thing<00:01:25.080> after

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
in brake fluid next sort of thing after

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.260 
in brake fluid next sort of thing after
I<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.710> put<00:01:26.009> together<00:01:26.130> will<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.850> read

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
I get this put together will be to read

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
I get this put together will be to read
up<00:01:28.729> something<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.180> clean<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.590> inside<00:01:31.619> of

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
up something to clean out the inside of

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.609 
up something to clean out the inside of
master<00:01:32.850> soldier<00:01:33.210> because<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.229> don't<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
master soldier because I don't have a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.520 
master soldier because I don't have a
homing<00:01:35.100> device<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:36.210> put<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.420> my<00:01:36.540> drill<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
homing device to put on my drill and I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.990 
homing device to put on my drill and I
don't<00:01:37.590> want<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.890> remove<00:01:38.100> any<00:01:38.340> metal<00:01:38.549> from<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
don't want to remove any metal from it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.569 
don't want to remove any metal from it
I'm<00:01:39.960> afraid<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.740> affect<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> seal<00:01:41.520> of

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
I'm afraid that will affect the seal of

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.109 
I'm afraid that will affect the seal of
the<00:01:42.200> gaskets<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> mean<00:01:43.939> but<00:01:44.939> there's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
the gaskets and I can I mean but there's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.880 
the gaskets and I can I mean but there's
just<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.540> know<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.810> old<00:01:46.259> brake<00:01:46.560> fluid<00:01:46.860> a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
just you know just old brake fluid a

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.490 
just you know just old brake fluid a
little<00:01:47.100> bit<00:01:47.189> of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
little bit of

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.220 
little bit of
stepping<00:01:48.130> in<00:01:48.250> there<00:01:48.370> so<00:01:48.580> I'm<00:01:48.730> thinking<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:49.510> my

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
stepping in there so I'm thinking and my

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.160 
stepping in there so I'm thinking and my
swamp<00:01:50.710> shaved<00:01:51.700> down<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.360> toothbrush<00:01:52.930> or

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
swamp shaved down a toothbrush or

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.510 
swamp shaved down a toothbrush or
something<00:01:53.650> can<00:01:53.980> I<00:01:54.010> get<00:01:54.220> those<00:01:54.340> edges<00:01:54.550> down<00:01:54.910> and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
something can I get those edges down and

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.000 
something can I get those edges down and
see<00:01:57.520> if<00:01:57.580> that<00:01:57.760> won't<00:01:57.970> do<00:01:58.150> it<00:01:58.300> for<00:01:58.330> me<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.800> other

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
see if that won't do it for me and other

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.770 
see if that won't do it for me and other
than<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.190> I<00:02:00.550> don't<00:02:00.910> really<00:02:01.060> I'll<00:02:01.479> figure<00:02:01.660> it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
than that I don't really I'll figure it

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.550 
than that I don't really I'll figure it
out<00:02:01.930> so<00:02:02.290> I'll<00:02:02.380> let<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.620> guys<00:02:02.800> know<00:02:02.830> where<00:02:03.130> I
