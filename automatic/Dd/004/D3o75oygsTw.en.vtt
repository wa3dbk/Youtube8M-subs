00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
so paddy distributed them this way and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.910 
so paddy distributed them this way and
will<00:01:26.580> place<00:01:26.850> them<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> incubator<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:28.680> such

will place them in the incubator in such

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.319 
will place them in the incubator in such
a<00:01:28.979> way<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.430> remember<00:01:29.850> which<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
a way that we remember which one the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.760 
a way that we remember which one the
oldest<00:01:30.659> ones<00:01:30.869> are<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.530> they're<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
oldest ones are because they're the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.280 
oldest ones are because they're the
least<00:01:31.950> likely<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.090> hatch<00:01:33.299> -<00:01:33.570> oh<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.960> older

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
least likely to the hatch - oh the older

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.039 
least likely to the hatch - oh the older
they<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.180> we've<00:01:36.329> got<00:01:36.540> an<00:01:36.720> empty

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
they are and then we've got an empty

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.620 
they are and then we've got an empty
space<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.009> last<00:01:38.700> little<00:01:38.909> container<00:01:39.360> over

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.960 
all right placing the turkey eggs in the
incubator

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
incubator

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.370 
incubator
I'll<00:02:13.970> move<00:02:14.209> around<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.750> can<00:02:14.870> see<00:02:15.020> inside

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
I'll move around so you can see inside

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.699 
I'll move around so you can see inside
there<00:02:18.010> eggs<00:02:19.010> going<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:21.230> again<00:02:21.500> we're

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
there eggs going in and again we're

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:31.740 
there eggs going in and again we're
using<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:23.660> second<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:25.840> middle<00:02:26.840> tray

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.180 

and<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.440> bottoms<00:02:32.800> right<00:02:34.530> now<00:02:35.530> we're<00:02:36.010> going<00:02:36.100> to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
and the bottoms right now we're going to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.810 
and the bottoms right now we're going to
add<00:02:36.340> water<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.210> water<00:02:37.720> reservoir<00:02:38.820> that

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
add water to the water reservoir that

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.050 
add water to the water reservoir that
helps<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.300> keep<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.720> humidity<00:02:41.250> up<00:02:42.250> around<00:02:42.580> 58

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
helps to keep the humidity up around 58

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.690 
helps to keep the humidity up around 58
percent<00:02:43.540> or<00:02:43.660> better<00:02:43.780> we<00:02:44.050> have<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.290> keep<00:02:44.410> that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
percent or better we have to keep that

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.610 
percent or better we have to keep that
to<00:02:45.700> check<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.060> pretty<00:02:46.750> regularly<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.320> keep<00:02:47.470> it

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
to check it pretty regularly and keep it

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.720 
to check it pretty regularly and keep it
full<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:49.510> minitor<00:02:49.870> humidity<00:02:50.710> excuse<00:02:51.550> me<00:02:51.670> an

full you minitor humidity excuse me an
incubator<00:02:52.150> temperature<00:02:52.720> will<00:02:53.760> modulate

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
incubator temperature will modulate

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.340 
incubator temperature will modulate
itself<00:02:55.450> for<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.810> 100<00:02:56.350> degrees<00:02:56.710> and<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.690> there

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
itself for the 100 degrees and so there

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.449 
itself for the 100 degrees and so there
they<00:02:59.530> are<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.920> turkeys<00:03:00.220> are<00:03:00.400> in

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.520 

and<00:03:04.150> finally<00:03:04.569> here's<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.049> little<00:03:05.200> shot<00:03:05.500> of

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
and finally here's just a little shot of

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.880 
and finally here's just a little shot of
the<00:03:05.739> control<00:03:06.129> area<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:08.079> label<00:03:08.470> we<00:03:08.650> bought

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
the control area and the label we bought

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.000 
the control area and the label we bought
this<00:03:09.360> incubator<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.510> few<00:03:10.659> years<00:03:10.870> ago<00:03:11.079> from<00:03:11.860> an

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
this incubator a few years ago from an

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.819 
this incubator a few years ago from an
individual<00:03:12.579> who<00:03:12.970> was<00:03:13.299> no<00:03:13.810> longer<00:03:14.079> using<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.709> or

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
individual who was no longer using it or

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.380 
individual who was no longer using it or
had<00:03:15.010> scaled<00:03:15.400> up<00:03:15.640> or<00:03:15.849> something

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
had scaled up or something

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.849 
had scaled up or something
got<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.140> pretty<00:03:17.319> good<00:03:17.530> deal<00:03:17.739> on<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.950> but<00:03:18.659> it<00:03:19.859> has

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
got a pretty good deal on it but it has

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.050 
got a pretty good deal on it but it has
an<00:03:21.040> automatic<00:03:21.189> Turner

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
an automatic Turner

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.640 
an automatic Turner
so<00:03:22.359> that<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.170> set<00:03:23.470> every<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:24.459> often<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:25.650> rotates

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
so that is set every so often it rotates

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.599 
so that is set every so often it rotates
the<00:03:26.920> angle<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.909> the<00:03:28.030> eggs<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:29.739> simulate<00:03:30.220> how

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
the angle of the eggs to simulate how

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.300 
the angle of the eggs to simulate how
the<00:03:31.299> mom<00:03:31.540> would<00:03:31.900> move<00:03:32.379> them<00:03:32.530> around<00:03:32.680> when<00:03:33.129> she

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
the mom would move them around when she

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.360 
the mom would move them around when she
changes<00:03:33.700> positions<00:03:34.209> so<00:03:34.889> turkey<00:03:35.889> eggs<00:03:36.069> are<00:03:36.250> in

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
changes positions so turkey eggs are in

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.190 
changes positions so turkey eggs are in
one<00:03:37.030> week<00:03:37.209> from<00:03:37.359> today<00:03:37.540> we'll<00:03:37.870> put<00:03:38.079> some

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
one week from today we'll put some

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.949 
one week from today we'll put some
chicken<00:03:38.379> eggs<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:38.829> there<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.569> 28<00:03:40.569> days<00:03:40.780> from

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
chicken eggs in there and 28 days from

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.340 
chicken eggs in there and 28 days from
today<00:03:41.170> we<00:03:41.560> should<00:03:41.620> have<00:03:42.090> baby<00:03:43.090> turkeys<00:03:44.340> thanks
