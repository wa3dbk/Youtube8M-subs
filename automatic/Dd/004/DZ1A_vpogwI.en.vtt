the<00:04:48.479> Lumiere<00:04:49.050> perfection<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.800> pec

the Lumiere perfection of the pec

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.310 
the Lumiere perfection of the pec
perfection<00:04:50.639> lumiere<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.599> got<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.810> sample<00:04:52.110> of

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
perfection lumiere so I got a sample of

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.170 
perfection lumiere so I got a sample of
that<00:04:52.380> but<00:04:52.919> it<00:04:53.190> was<00:04:53.340> really<00:04:53.669> kind<00:04:53.820> of<00:04:53.970> hard<00:04:54.150> to

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
that but it was really kind of hard to

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.020 
that but it was really kind of hard to
color<00:04:54.449> match<00:04:54.720> me<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:56.130> was<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.490> closest

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
color match me so this was the closest

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.839 
color match me so this was the closest
to<00:04:57.330> what<00:04:57.479> I<00:04:57.539> could<00:04:57.660> find<00:04:57.930> um<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.520> they

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
to what I could find um and they

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.850 
to what I could find um and they
actually<00:05:00.270> had<00:05:00.389> a<00:05:00.419> wide<00:05:00.750> selection<00:05:01.139> of<00:05:01.590> color

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
actually had a wide selection of color

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.890 
actually had a wide selection of color
so<00:05:02.159> it's<00:05:02.310> kind<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.639> hoping<00:05:03.419> you<00:05:03.599> know<00:05:03.720> I<00:05:03.750> was

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.450 
so it's kind of hoping you know I was
like<00:05:04.020> wow<00:05:04.199> that's<00:05:04.470> weird<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.889> they<00:05:05.280> don't
