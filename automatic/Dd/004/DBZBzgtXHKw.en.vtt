times trying to make this video but the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.970 
times trying to make this video but the
first<00:00:47.879> time<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.149> didn't<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.570> flashlight

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the audio was really crap so I believe

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.410 
the audio was really crap so I believe
this<00:00:56.430> was<00:00:56.640> basically<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.270> official<00:00:57.870> entrance

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
once they bought the ticket they could

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.960 
once they bought the ticket they could
come<00:01:05.820> down<00:01:05.970> here

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
yeah there's upstairs but the phaser

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:23.660 
yeah there's upstairs but the phaser
won't<00:01:11.400> let<00:01:11.580> me<00:01:11.700> film<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> stairs

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.380 

basically<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.870> have<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.200> stairs<00:01:29.390> for

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
basically here we have the stairs for

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.520 
basically here we have the stairs for
some<00:01:30.630> reason<00:01:31.130> they<00:01:32.130> left<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.580> card<00:01:32.909> here<00:01:33.530> so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
some reason they left one card here so

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.750 
some reason they left one card here so
you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.830> still<00:01:35.070> look<00:01:35.190> at<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:37.280> which<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.430> not<00:01:38.610> so

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
you can still look at it which is not so

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.920 
you can still look at it which is not so
bad<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.970> guess<00:01:39.950> they<00:01:40.950> fix<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.490> place<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.150> don't

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
bad I guess they fix it in place I don't

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.960 
bad I guess they fix it in place I don't
know<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.290> still<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.970> sightseeing

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.640 
know if this is still a sightseeing
tourist<00:01:45.360> spot<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> guess<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.380> bad

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
tourist spot but I guess it's not so bad

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.740 
tourist spot but I guess it's not so bad
looking<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.130> think<00:01:53.400> I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.400 

so<00:01:58.290> practically<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.570> can<00:02:00.570> decide<00:02:00.960> where<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> want

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
so practically I can decide where I want

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.310 
so practically I can decide where I want
to<00:02:01.500> captain<00:02:01.890> idea<00:02:02.300> if<00:02:03.300> I<00:02:03.360> wanna<00:02:03.570> camber<00:02:03.960> here

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.120 

now<00:02:11.009> let's<00:02:11.220> check<00:02:11.430> what's<00:02:12.240> inside<00:02:13.040> there's<00:02:14.040> a

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
now let's check what's inside there's a

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.570 
now let's check what's inside there's a
fuse<00:02:14.400> box

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.220 

I'd<00:02:19.150> like<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.510> know<00:02:19.660> how<00:02:19.780> old<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.140> place

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
I'd like to know how old this place

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.390 
I'd like to know how old this place
actually<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:20.980> have<00:02:21.130> no<00:02:21.310> actually<00:02:21.670> no<00:02:21.910> idea

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
actually is I have no actually no idea

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.870 
actually is I have no actually no idea
to<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.520> honest<00:02:24.760> with<00:02:24.940> you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to be honest with you

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.030 
to be honest with you
it<00:02:27.270> looks<00:02:27.510> pretty<00:02:27.660> old

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.270 

there's<00:02:31.610> some<00:02:31.849> trash<00:02:32.349> but<00:02:33.349> not<00:02:33.560> as<00:02:33.680> bad<00:02:33.920> as<00:02:34.099> one

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
there's some trash but not as bad as one

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.920 
there's some trash but not as bad as one
might<00:02:34.459> think

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.809 

windows<00:02:37.650> are<00:02:37.799> broke<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.129> not<00:02:38.370> all<00:02:38.519> of<00:02:38.549> them

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
windows are broke and not all of them

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.190 
windows are broke and not all of them
though<00:02:39.390> maybe<00:02:40.110> just<00:02:40.260> some<00:02:40.760> which<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.909> think

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
though maybe just some which I think

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.300 
though maybe just some which I think
it's<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.260> good<00:02:43.439> sign<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.739> it's<00:02:44.129> not

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
it's a good sign that it's not

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.179 
it's a good sign that it's not
necessarily<00:02:45.500> vandalism<00:02:46.819> but<00:02:47.819> just<00:02:48.060> over<00:02:48.329> time

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:49.189 
necessarily vandalism but just over time

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.470 
necessarily vandalism but just over time
it's<00:02:50.189> a<00:02:50.280> pretty<00:02:50.459> big<00:02:50.730> hole<00:02:50.939> on<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.239> other<00:02:51.329> side

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
it's a pretty big hole on the other side

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.790 
it's a pretty big hole on the other side
here

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
here

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.830 
here
I<00:02:52.860> know<00:02:53.520> some<00:02:53.820> kind<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.060> mudslide<00:02:54.630> or

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
I know some kind of mudslide or

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:09.600 
I know some kind of mudslide or
