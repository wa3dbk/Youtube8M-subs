00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
layout so we've got a big circuit in

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.910 
layout so we've got a big circuit in
here<00:00:33.449> and<00:00:33.600> following<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> tail<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.769> North

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
here and following the tail the North

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.470 
here and following the tail the North
Coast<00:00:35.100> limited<00:00:35.930> see<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.830> head<00:00:38.309> into<00:00:38.580> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
Coast limited see we head into the

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
so yeah basically just a very long loop

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.530 
so yeah basically just a very long loop
I'm<00:00:47.129> very<00:00:47.339> proud<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.699> train<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.360> took<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
long time to to get into its current

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
loop is running on DC only while both of

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.910 
loop is running on DC only while both of
those<00:01:17.910> zoom<00:01:18.210> by<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.020> siding<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:19.740> back

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.520 
in fitted with figures took a long time
to<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.910> but<00:01:33.209> it<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.360> worth<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.690> this<00:01:34.349> is

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to do that but it was worth it this is

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.139 
to do that but it was worth it this is
my<00:01:34.619> California<00:01:34.920> Zephyr<00:01:35.190> rushing<00:01:35.729> past<00:01:35.940> here

western Pacific f3s

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.900 
western Pacific f3s
three<00:01:38.880> domes<00:01:40.160> dinah<00:01:41.160> sleeper<00:01:41.700> and

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
three domes dinah sleeper and

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.600 
three domes dinah sleeper and
observation

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.310 

now<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.150> can<00:01:45.330> see<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.660> lighting<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:46.200> those

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
now you can see the lighting and those

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800 
now you can see the lighting and those
cars<00:01:46.590> they're<00:01:47.180> just<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> little

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
cars they're just about it's a little

00:01:48.810 --> 00:02:12.559 
cars they're just about it's a little
bit<00:01:48.900> faint

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.530 

so<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.349> entire<00:02:13.650> inside<00:02:14.310> loop<00:02:14.579> is<00:02:15.360> all

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
so this entire inside loop is all

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.009 
so this entire inside loop is all
running<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:16.879> digital<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.659> chips<00:02:18.870> are<00:02:18.989> a

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
running on digital the chips are a

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.179 
running on digital the chips are a
little<00:02:19.140> pricey<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.650> can't<00:02:19.890> always<00:02:20.040> afford

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
little pricey so I can't always afford

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.330 
little pricey so I can't always afford
to<00:02:20.959> convert<00:02:21.959> all<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.200> my<00:02:22.409> trains<00:02:22.709> or<00:02:22.980> at<00:02:23.159> once

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
to convert all of my trains or at once

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.349 
to convert all of my trains or at once
but<00:02:23.879> it's<00:02:24.180> an<00:02:24.269> ongoing<00:02:24.390> project<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:30.060> train

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
but it's an ongoing project this train

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.869 
but it's an ongoing project this train
would<00:02:30.569> also<00:02:30.720> occasionally<00:02:31.470> be<00:02:31.650> hauled<00:02:31.920> by

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879
