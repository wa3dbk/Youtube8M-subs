well<00:01:51.790> no<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.090> makes<00:01:52.510> it<00:01:52.750> straightforward

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
well no it makes it straightforward

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.039

how<00:01:58.330> I've<00:01:58.479> Cena<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:59.020> think<00:01:59.710> there's<00:01:59.890> been<00:01:59.950> many

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
how I've Cena I think there's been many

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.740 
how I've Cena I think there's been many
occasions<00:02:00.820> like<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.090> said<00:02:01.240> when<00:02:01.360> he<00:02:01.420> hasn't

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
occasions like it said when he hasn't

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.030 
occasions like it said when he hasn't
had<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.840> had<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.869> rewards<00:02:05.409> for<00:02:05.650> that<00:02:05.860> but

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
had the had the rewards for that but

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.639 
had the had the rewards for that but
certainly<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.780> doesn't<00:02:07.780> doesn't<00:02:08.200> help<00:02:08.440> him

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
certainly that doesn't doesn't help him

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.080 
certainly that doesn't doesn't help him
but<00:02:08.860> more<00:02:09.009> importantly<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:09.610> doesn't<00:02:09.819> help<00:02:09.910> the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
but more importantly it doesn't help the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.320 
game so one anything that is detrimental
towards<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.800> is<00:02:26.950> something<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.760> don't

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
towards that is something that I don't

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.229 
towards that is something that I don't
take<00:02:28.750> too<00:02:28.959> lightly<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.650> well<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.610> if<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:30.970> is

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
take too lightly so well and if that is

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.630 
take too lightly so well and if that is
something<00:02:31.390> nothing<00:02:31.630> affects<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.410> then<00:02:32.640> that

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
something nothing affects it then that

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.030 
something nothing affects it then that
was<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:33.910> was<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.269> clear<00:02:34.480> message<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.140> war<00:02:35.410> but

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
was that was a clear message so war but

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.120 
was that was a clear message so war but
I<00:02:36.070> said<00:02:36.370> we'll<00:02:37.269> deal<00:02:37.510> with<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.690> ton<00:02:37.870> hoshin<00:02:38.320> and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
I said we'll deal with a ton hoshin and

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.020 
I said we'll deal with a ton hoshin and
we'll<00:02:39.280> be<00:02:39.370> fine<00:02:44.400> no<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.430> don't<00:02:45.670> want<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.850> really

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
we'll be fine no I don't want to really

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.790 
we'll be fine no I don't want to really
want<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.300> go<00:02:46.390> into<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.600> too<00:02:47.080> much<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.590> think

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
want to go into that too much I think

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.949 
want to go into that too much I think
it's<00:02:47.980> it's<00:02:48.640> something<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.750> know<00:02:49.840> he

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
it's it's something that you know he

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.170 
it's it's something that you know he
obviously<00:02:50.200> feels<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:52.120> know<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:55.150> I

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
obviously feels you know that but but I

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.100 
obviously feels you know that but but I
haven't<00:02:55.329> really<00:02:55.570> thought<00:02:55.720> too<00:02:55.900> much<00:02:55.930> about

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
haven't really thought too much about

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.650 
haven't really thought too much about
that<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.650> be<00:02:56.709> fair<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.130> think<00:02:57.340> there's<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
that to be fair I think there's the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.720 
that to be fair I think there's the
South<00:02:58.840> American<00:02:59.230> players<00:02:59.470> over<00:02:59.709> here<00:02:59.890> of<00:02:59.980> I've

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
South American players over here of I've

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.789 
South American players over here of I've
always<00:03:00.910> worked<00:03:01.180> well<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:02.170> know<00:03:02.320> there's<00:03:02.500> some

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
always worked well you know there's some

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.009 
always worked well you know there's some
of<00:03:02.920> them<00:03:03.040> like<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.640> see<00:03:03.850> we<00:03:04.030> because<00:03:04.630> Paul<00:03:04.870> Yi

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
of them like you see we because Paul Yi

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.900 
of them like you see we because Paul Yi
they've<00:03:05.170> gone<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:05.980> become<00:03:06.130> very<00:03:06.310> very<00:03:06.730> good

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
they've gone on to become very very good

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.259 
they've gone on to become very very good
manager<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:08.579> think<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.790> good<00:03:09.910> treat<00:03:10.150> it

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
manager so I think the good treat it

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.670 
manager so I think the good treat it
well<00:03:10.829> but<00:03:11.829> I<00:03:11.860> understand<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.940> point<00:03:13.120> that

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
well but I understand the point that

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.900 
well but I understand the point that
sometimes<00:03:14.680> issues<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.430> will<00:03:15.519> get<00:03:15.640> laughed

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
sometimes issues that will get laughed

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.080 
sometimes issues that will get laughed
off<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.810> it's<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.079> British<00:03:17.380> player<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.910> always

off of it's a British player it's always

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.330 
off of it's a British player it's always
do<00:03:19.360> more<00:03:19.570> cynical<00:03:19.900> if<00:03:20.260> it's<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.650> it's<00:03:21.280> a
