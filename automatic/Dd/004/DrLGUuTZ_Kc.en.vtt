 321 riffo looks personal youtube firmness 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.690
 who smokes this period already another video 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.880
 here on the channel and talk now you 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.190
 our fourth episode of the pack series 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.289
 of textures and galera is as follows 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.840
 some news for you about this 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.059
 series of textures in the channel both texture 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.710
 of subscribers and pack of textures all 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.679
 well it 's the following folks unfortunately 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.359
 The texture of the enrolled students is over 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.010
 I will not do this series anymore because of the fact 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.809
 of many subscribers send textures 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.089
 that are not theirs are from others 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.339
 people on youtube to the office 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.159
 Attention of a club at times changed 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.350
 a sword changes a soup and says it is 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.389
 It changes everything well, changes something else. 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.859
 The texture is not his, at least, people I 

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:56.179
 I want to tell you, it will not have 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.039
 a series of texts written by the 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.049
 fact of having much plagiarism of having 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.089
 copy of the textures is getting 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.710
 very saturated and quite annoying thing, right? 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.780
 but it is the following people the pec series of 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.160
 textures will continue only texts 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.170
 subscribers who will no longer be 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.120
 all the textures that are in the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.950
 My email you sent me I still 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.230
 I'm showing this frequency series. 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.480
 and pack of textures every pec came back 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.340
 showing six to eight more texts or 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.350
 less is logical is not showing all 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.910
 the friday firing pv 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.650

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.130
 at the end of the video will have a baby 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.480
 with the textures that will be the sin then 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.430
 I think it's going to be a better way with 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.930
 a slightly cool way too 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.160

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.110
