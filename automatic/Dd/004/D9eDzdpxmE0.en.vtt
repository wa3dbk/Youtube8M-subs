okay<00:00:01.140> so<00:00:01.709> we<00:00:02.280> know<00:00:02.520> that<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.330> null<00:00:03.659> space<00:00:04.140> of

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
okay so we know that the null space of

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.070 
okay so we know that the null space of
so<00:00:05.460> if<00:00:05.640> we<00:00:05.790> have<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.089> homogeneous<00:00:06.690> system

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
so if we have this homogeneous system

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.550 
so if we have this homogeneous system
for<00:00:07.290> example<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:09.380> x<00:00:10.380> equals<00:00:11.160> zero<00:00:11.870> where<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.080> is

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.560 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.760 

some<00:00:16.560> M<00:00:16.800> by<00:00:17.039> n<00:00:17.220> matrix<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.410> this<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
some M by n matrix and this is just the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.340 
some M by n matrix and this is just the
matrix<00:00:20.250> form<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.119> normal<00:00:21.750> linear<00:00:21.869> system

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.390 
matrix form of the normal linear system
that<00:00:22.470> you're<00:00:22.590> used<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.160> case<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that you're used to in this case a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.370 
that you're used to in this case a
homogeneous<00:00:24.090> system<00:00:24.420> because<00:00:24.930> everything<00:00:25.289> on

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
homogeneous system because everything on

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.040 
homogeneous system because everything on
the<00:00:25.470> right-hand<00:00:25.859> side<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.130> 0<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.789> X<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.630> as

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the right-hand side is 0 and X is as

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.820 
the right-hand side is 0 and X is as
again<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.710> vector<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.260> M<00:00:31.260> by<00:00:31.500> n<00:00:31.650> n

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
again it's a vector so it is a M by n n

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.990 
again it's a vector so it is a M by n n
by<00:00:31.949> 1<00:00:31.980> vector<00:00:33.230> that<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.770> solution<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.670> this

recall what a basis is a basis is a set

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.290 
recall what a basis is a basis is a set

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.090 
corresponding to those columns let's say
it's<00:04:20.420> the<00:04:20.540> third<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.900> fifth<00:04:21.049> column<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:21.739> x3

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
it's the third and fifth column so x3

then we can read off the solution for
