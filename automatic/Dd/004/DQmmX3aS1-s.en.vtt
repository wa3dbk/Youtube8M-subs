00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.280
 no 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.490
 raise to 4 50% to work intensive mans during 23 years 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.000
 it took us to have already been 303 job develop the process abbas 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.760
 do not realize the match with the good 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.530
 for the moment that of the car 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 year after we planned to up to 1000 cars 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.940
 of the 12c Iran 2011 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.950
 for 100 m but we will continue to launch cars tie knots 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.600
 every ten to twelve months 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.350
 versions and new cars to go up in volume up to 4500 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.680
 2015 cars 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.060
 we have already communicated that 500 550 cars 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.120
 so the 1100 years drew for europe 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.570
 aam 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.150
 70% will go to England in Germany and that seems to market 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.100
 main 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.140
 but not far behind that is France and yet launched two 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.270
 parties in France 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.840
 in Paris and in my opinion 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.840
 and again a car that sells but we take reservations 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.920
 today the English market already dead couple and had for production 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.870
 2011 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.350
 so we start to launch the car this Thursday in paris 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.050
 ea the primaries the action of clairoix are very positive 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 in our database we already have 2800 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.850
 who have announced that they could be between sebastian nature but it takes 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.530
 understand that it's not a successor 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.560
 it is the end 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.140
 the moon to force to know today 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.860
 two million five hundred and twenty years of francs but as stromae years in 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.110
 the euro is not really the same segment in terms of price and this 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.880
 performance 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.050
 when one is rather in a segment of cars mistakes 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.750
 this is the thesis for sca 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.749
 with the competitor of eads 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:00.849
 ferrari 458 and alitalia amandine and role gaia for this left turn this is a 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:02.440
 porsche gt1 gt2 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.510
 while we are in the segment 180 two hundred and twenty thousand euros 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.659
 for this packaging segment these percent years 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.420
 % technology and with the least salt 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.479
 in carbon 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.519
 the only car in this segment with a carbon chassis 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:21.149
 with a motor and that is developed especially by the a40 owns car 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:23.809
 with split performance in China 600 horsepower 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.299
 and with once this year 300 kilograms 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.349
 so the ratio performance times is by far the best of the seven runs 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.739
 Friday to communicate the maximum cups clearly above 320 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.059
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.789
 and alam an acceleration from 0 to 200 below 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:40.869
 it's good 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.179
 which is really the territory of supercars on Thursday so our world in 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:45.239
 carbon saddle 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.609
 she who has a form of production four hours yesterday the promotion of 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.410
 bramans for the carbon material in the automobile to appease their between 75 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:54.599
 and 80 kilograms 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.909
 that represents that same job advantage dollars pretty much 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.299
 for 180 kilograms compared to an aluminum chassis that is huge 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.379
 and can also be explained% and weight 7 may 300 kilograms of the car but all 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.899
 the components of the car 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.319
 which are developed by interval it means the totality 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.269
 and apprentices roxanne maisie de poids 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.799
 marc angrand when we decided to come back to the market 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.259
 the last time with France was dense than the 80s 13 98 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.519
 the decision was really to make a car 100% my card 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.839
 allam scene charles h all builders 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:30.849
 but today the chassis the engine the box 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.269
 for the same system of the condition before the car the electronics of the 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.620
 car each button each component 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.639
 and 100% my last end of the French 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.499
 compared to others max is exciting and I say to asserac communicating 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:45.260
 same launch every ten to twelve months 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.969
 from next spring 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:48.230
 what we communicated 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.889
 handball I hope 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.689
 we limit ourselves to two places 100% electric car central 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:55.910
 but we have not yet specified 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.560
 so segments indeed with handball cars expand our range 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.009
 so anyway in bright red what by communicating its limits to nothing 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.949
 6 the positioning of the brand 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.899
 could also be developed with new technologies 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.999
 to harvard and vanessa very close and if it helps us 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:16.120
 maybe we'll see that in the future but today we do not know 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.769
 if we see step forward we'll see this in the years to come
