00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.529
 from the first time I read the book of meat hemingway the old man and the sea and 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.630
 asking to treat my own sea monster councilor 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.799
 I tried it once it was removed 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.710
 I get up at dawn to fish outside the sacred passage 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.710
 this time I have a blessing and a new secret weapon 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.720
 the tribe gave me a special bell 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.260
 and is that according to them they cancha and magically to the curious sharks 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.259
 min 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.340
 I do not know if it's because of Monday's prayer for the oscars bell for good luck 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.340
 that shortly after something bite and hook 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.090
 there are resistances 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 mumbai 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.660
 finally hundred the brocal power of this predator sliding down my 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.600
 hands 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 but the shark who continued 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 one by one 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.640
 I am in a small and unstable pirogue and the shark can 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.640
 easily because he stands out he did not act alone 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.660
 Or what is the same 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.010
 fines 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.310
 kilometer 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.120
 I have to do is to be late 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.130
 it's right under the pop was going together until now it's going it's going it's going it's going it's going 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.300
 goes 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.240
 he submerged 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.690
 I will try to do it slowly 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.070
 according to this text on your site 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.240
 I think the feeling 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 because the truth is that rossi 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.270
 the group cares for the shark to try to attract to the surface 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.450

 13 hours ago 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.069
 reduced 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.169
 a world 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.539
 according to the smn 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:14.489
 can be 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.749
 to make it 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.749
 the track more is not something to like incessantly 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.909
 a nod after the collapse 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.909
 after a long flight the shark finally tires 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.049
 while trying to upload it with a regulatory framework 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.379
 waiting almost 40 years I have traveled all over the world looking for this 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.599
 incredible moment 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.280

 the ground at the edge of your mouth 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.929
 the tongue 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:55.669
 it was crushed and it came out 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.469
 easily your voice is one of the most dangerous 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.839
 is a gray reef shark about 36 kilograms the perfect size 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.419
 If it were bigger, the canoe could not supply it 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.490
 We are returning the shark from this small canoe 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.490
 it was a pretty wild task but it worked 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.459
 amazing

 It's inexplicable 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.909
 I 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.769
 that was my best fishing with a refund 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.359
 but I think maybe the most important thing is that the profits that the tribe 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.790
 helped polish in iniesta villa have united me more deeply with the life of the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.849
 altea of ​​what I never imagined 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.849

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.379
 valuable as hitmen of the simple fishing are already extracted 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.019
 he showed me a world that vanishes and allowed me to enter the life of this 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.459

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.639
 of my childhood for this reason why 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.900
 with fishing technique by hand 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.590

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.710
 their lives depend on the sea 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.830
 and everything that comes from him 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.199
