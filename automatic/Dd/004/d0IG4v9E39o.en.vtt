00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
if you've got a load liner in you can

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.170 
if you've got a load liner in you can
often<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.770> squeeze<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.640> load<00:00:20.789> liner<00:00:21.060> out

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
often just squeeze the load liner out

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.330 
often just squeeze the load liner out
pull<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.560> get<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.160> there

with a spanner

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.240 
with a spanner
but<00:00:24.539> luckily<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.289> us<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:25.830> got<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> load

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
but luckily for us we have got a load

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.660 
but luckily for us we have got a load
liner<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.849> one<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.010> undo<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.369> top

liner on this one so you undo the top

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:43.400 
liner on this one so you undo the top
screw<00:00:31.340> that's<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> first<00:00:32.730> bolt<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:42.290> from<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
these are the brackets that the bolts

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.080 
these are the brackets that the bolts
were<00:00:49.110> bolting<00:00:49.469> into<00:00:49.649> okay<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:50.760> we've<00:00:50.879> got<00:00:51.000> to

they actually line up fine

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.660 
they actually line up fine
and<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.960> connectors<00:01:26.500> come<00:01:26.740> pre-wired<00:01:27.189> the

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
and the connectors come pre-wired the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.520 
and the connectors come pre-wired the
eight-way<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.810> only<00:01:29.020> thing<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:29.289> need<00:01:29.380> to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
eight-way the only thing you need to

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.499 
eight-way the only thing you need to
make<00:01:29.680> sure<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:30.579> need<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.820> swap<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.180> bulbs

make sure you need to swap the bulbs

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.100 
make sure you need to swap the bulbs
over<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.090> orange<00:01:34.390> indicator<00:01:34.840> bulb

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
over is that the orange indicator bulb

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.510 
over is that the orange indicator bulb
we<00:01:35.289> supply<00:01:35.680> one<00:01:35.950> because<00:01:36.220> it's<00:01:36.369> slightly

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
we supply one because it's slightly

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.580 
we supply one because it's slightly
different<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.210> one<00:01:37.390> in<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.539> original<00:01:38.020> but

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
different to the one in the original but

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.010 
different to the one in the original but
everything<00:01:38.860> else<00:01:39.039> should<00:01:39.250> swap<00:01:39.549> over<00:01:40.020> okay

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
everything else should swap over okay

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.350 
everything else should swap over okay
and<00:01:41.289> then<00:01:41.770> obviously<00:01:42.159> then<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:42.579> reverse<00:01:43.030> is

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
and then obviously then the reverse is

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.910 
and then obviously then the reverse is
exactly<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.960> same<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:46.509> Reverse<00:01:46.770> plug<00:01:47.770> the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
exactly the same in Reverse plug the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.190 
exactly the same in Reverse plug the
connector<00:01:48.460> in<00:01:50.819> okay<00:01:51.819> make<00:01:52.780> sure<00:01:52.990> that

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
connector in okay make sure that

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.380 
connector in okay make sure that
connector<00:01:53.920> doesn't<00:01:54.220> get<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.490> way<00:01:54.579> when

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
connector doesn't get in the way when

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.130 
connector doesn't get in the way when
you<00:01:55.509> put<00:01:55.539> it<00:01:55.869> back<00:01:55.899> in<00:01:56.670> push<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:57.880> back<00:01:58.090> in<00:01:58.330> and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
you put it back in push that back in and

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.230 
you put it back in push that back in and
you're<00:01:59.319> looking<00:01:59.590> on<00:01:59.709> the<00:01:59.830> inside<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:01.090> you've

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
you're looking on the inside that you've

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.149 
you're looking on the inside that you've
lined<00:02:01.479> up<00:02:01.720> with<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.020> brackets<00:02:02.880> okay<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.569> then
