labor code lock on minecraft I'm going

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.450 
labor code lock on minecraft I'm going
to<00:00:13.769> show<00:00:13.980> now<00:00:15.199> here<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.379> basically<00:00:16.619> all<00:00:17.160> the

to show now here is basically all the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.510 
to show now here is basically all the
space<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.760> need<00:00:18.470> I've<00:00:19.470> already<00:00:19.710> build<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.369> up

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
space you need I've already build it up

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.880 
space you need I've already build it up
but<00:00:20.850> I'm<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.600> tear<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.900> apart<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.410> show

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
but I'm going to tear it apart and show

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.410 
but I'm going to tear it apart and show
you<00:00:23.340> exactly<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.390> make<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.930> color<00:00:26.420> so

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
you exactly how to make you color so

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:58.810 
you exactly how to make you color so
wait<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> minute

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.720 

okay<00:00:59.820> now<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.450> gonna<00:01:00.720> put<00:01:01.020> three<00:01:01.730> blocks

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
okay now you're gonna put three blocks

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.820 
okay now you're gonna put three blocks
after<00:01:03.690> each<00:01:04.110> other<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.450> on<00:01:06.450> those<00:01:06.780> free<00:01:07.110> you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
after each other and on those free you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.910 
after each other and on those free you
put<00:01:08.480> a<00:01:09.480> letter<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:11.090> like<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:15.620> just<00:01:16.620> later

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
put a letter just like this just later

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.740 
put a letter just like this just later
letters<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:19.729> this<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.970> probably<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.479> part

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
letters and this is probably the part

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.210 
letters and this is probably the part
where<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.260> decide<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:23.040> code<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.790> luggage

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
where you decide the code of the luggage

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:33.770 
where you decide the code of the luggage
if<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.600> just<00:01:30.140> place<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> torch<00:01:31.560> there<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:33.630> can

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
if we just place a torch there you can

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.630 
if we just place a torch there you can
see<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.080> now<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:36.170> off<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:38.190> code<00:01:38.430> will

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
see it now that it's off the code will

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.350 
see it now that it's off the code will
work<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.470> when<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.800> it<00:01:41.190> won't<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> now

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
work and when it's on it won't so now

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.870 
work and when it's on it won't so now
the<00:01:45.360> code<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.040> put<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.520> other

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the code is right and if I put one other

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.780 
the code is right and if I put one other
here<00:01:48.979> take<00:01:49.979> out<00:01:50.190> this<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.580> this<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.759> is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
here take out this like this so this is

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.080 
here take out this like this so this is
you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.990> take<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.580> just<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:56.910> one

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
you can just take you can just have one

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.660 
you can just take you can just have one
there<00:01:57.360> or<00:01:57.630> wonder<00:01:58.080> or<00:01:58.320> wonder<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.009> doesn't

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
there or wonder or wonder it doesn't

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.690 
there or wonder or wonder it doesn't
matter<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.840> your<00:02:01.080> own<00:02:01.200> code<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> decided

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
matter it's your own code but I decided

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.000 
matter it's your own code but I decided
to<00:02:02.940> put<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.479> this

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.370 

now<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.510> put<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.780> block<00:02:09.110> here<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:11.380> place

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
now you put a block here and place

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.320 
now you put a block here and place
another<00:02:12.620> torch<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:15.580> what<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:16.700> can<00:02:16.880> do<00:02:17.060> is

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
another torch and what you can do is

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330 
another torch and what you can do is
you're<00:02:17.570> going<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.780> link<00:02:18.020> up<00:02:18.200> these<00:02:18.380> free<00:02:18.680> to

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
you're going to link up these free to

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.290 
you're going to link up these free to
this<00:02:19.550> block<00:02:20.620> like<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:24.820> now<00:02:25.820> the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
this block like this and now the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.570 
this block like this and now the
important<00:02:26.780> comes<00:02:26.960> if<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.440> code<00:02:27.710> is<00:02:27.920> not<00:02:28.340> right

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
important comes if the code is not right

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.890 
important comes if the code is not right
this<00:02:28.970> will<00:02:29.180> not<00:02:29.660> like<00:02:29.930> light<00:02:30.530> up<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:32.570> will

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
this will not like light up so it will

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
this will not like light up so it will
be<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:34.190> wrong<00:02:34.430> code<00:02:38.020> but<00:02:39.020> now<00:02:39.200> it's<00:02:39.410> on<00:02:39.620> and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
be the wrong code but now it's on and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.470 
be the wrong code but now it's on and
we're<00:02:40.520> going<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.320> do<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.560> next<00:02:42.740> step<00:02:43.420> now<00:02:44.420> you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
we're going to do the next step now you

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.990 
we're going to do the next step now you
can<00:02:44.780> place<00:02:45.020> another<00:02:45.590> block<00:02:45.890> here<00:02:46.190> with<00:02:46.970> a

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
can place another block here with a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.280 
can place another block here with a
button<00:02:47.360> on<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.690> this<00:02:48.440> will<00:02:48.650> be<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:49.070> opening

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
button on and this will be the opening

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.640 
button on and this will be the opening
thing<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:54.790> one<00:02:55.790> block<00:02:56.060> behind<00:02:56.240> will<00:02:57.200> can<00:02:57.410> make

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
thing so one block behind will can make

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.780 
thing so one block behind will can make
a<00:02:58.810> freeway<00:02:59.810> gate<00:03:01.630> just<00:03:02.630> like<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.920> we're

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
a freeway gate just like this and we're

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.900 
a freeway gate just like this and we're
going<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.030> link<00:03:05.240> up<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.660> button<00:03:06.700> with<00:03:07.700> that

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
going to link up this button with that

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.800 
going to link up this button with that
torch<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:09.459> this<00:03:10.459> torch<00:03:11.440> with<00:03:12.440> that<00:03:12.709> word

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
torch and this torch with that word

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.699 
torch and this torch with that word
and<00:03:15.520> now<00:03:16.520> I<00:03:16.550> say<00:03:16.760> if<00:03:16.940> i<00:03:17.060> press<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.390> button<00:03:17.709> that

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
and now I say if i press the button that

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.870 
and now I say if i press the button that
towards<00:03:19.069> real<00:03:19.250> light<00:03:19.430> for<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.700> second<00:03:20.950> but<00:03:21.950> if<00:03:22.640> I

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
towards real light for a second but if I

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.720 
towards real light for a second but if I
the<00:03:23.239> code<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.630> round<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:25.220> torch<00:03:25.550> won't<00:03:25.880> light

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
the code is round that torch won't light

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.160 
the code is round that torch won't light
so<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.140> thing<00:03:30.500> who<00:03:30.920> decides<00:03:31.459> if<00:03:31.640> the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
so this is the thing who decides if the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.600 
so this is the thing who decides if the
code<00:03:33.170> is<00:03:33.319> right<00:03:33.530> or<00:03:33.709> not<00:03:35.050> if<00:03:36.050> we<00:03:36.980> now<00:03:37.220> place<00:03:37.580> a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
code is right or not if we now place a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.460 
code is right or not if we now place a
door<00:03:38.000> right<00:03:38.269> here<00:03:39.190> impress<00:03:40.190> oh<00:03:40.840> crap<00:03:41.840> placed

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
door right here impress oh crap placed

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:58.640 
door right here impress oh crap placed
it<00:03:42.620> wrong<00:03:45.670> sorry<00:03:46.670> for<00:03:46.970> that
