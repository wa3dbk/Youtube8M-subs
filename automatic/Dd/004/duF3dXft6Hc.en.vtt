hybrid<00:01:18.390> David<00:01:18.600> David<00:01:18.840> using<00:01:19.110> before<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.350> he's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
hybrid David David using before and he's

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.289 
hybrid David David using before and he's
also<00:01:19.920> very<00:01:20.130> good<00:01:20.520> cheese<00:01:20.700> he's<00:01:20.880> similar<00:01:21.090> to

also very good cheese he's similar to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
also very good cheese he's similar to
Morales<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.259> he's<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> bit<00:01:22.560> stronger<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.950> bit

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
Morales but he's a bit stronger a bit

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.350 
Morales but he's a bit stronger a bit
taller<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.729> think<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.000> preferred<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
taller and I think I preferred to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.630 
taller and I think I preferred to
Morales<00:01:24.869> actually<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> probably<00:01:26.430> would

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
Morales actually so I probably would

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.910 
Morales actually so I probably would
give<00:01:26.850> Morales<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> choice<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
give Morales with the choice for the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.440 
give Morales with the choice for the
final<00:01:29.400> cam<00:01:29.549> he's<00:01:29.759> done<00:01:29.970> there's<00:01:30.180> well<00:01:30.360> in

you<00:02:51.240> might<00:02:51.390> want<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.630> strengthen<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.080> CBM<00:02:52.560> so

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
you might want to strengthen the CBM so

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.530 
you might want to strengthen the CBM so
instead<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.490> using<00:02:53.550> Schneiderlin<00:02:54.240> I'd

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
instead of using Schneiderlin I'd

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.300 
instead of using Schneiderlin I'd
probably<00:02:54.810> use<00:02:55.020> leave<00:02:55.230> us<00:02:55.440> thurs<00:02:55.710> my<00:02:56.040> aunt

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
probably use leave us thurs my aunt

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.860 
probably use leave us thurs my aunt
listen<00:02:56.790> probably<00:02:57.060> what<00:02:57.150> my<00:02:57.240> alternating<00:02:57.780> with

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
listen probably what my alternating with

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.990 
listen probably what my alternating with
me<00:02:57.960> if<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.170> wasn't<00:02:58.350> using<00:02:58.740> players<00:02:58.920> add<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.760> mix

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
me if I wasn't using players add to mix

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.120 
me if I wasn't using players add to mix
them<00:03:00.120> up<00:03:00.210> to<00:03:00.360> try<00:03:00.600> them<00:03:00.720> out<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.050> this<00:03:01.950> would

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
them up to try them out and this would

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.980 
them up to try them out and this would
be<00:03:02.160> what<00:03:02.550> I'd<00:03:02.670> probably<00:03:02.880> be<00:03:03.090> left<00:03:03.390> with<00:03:03.690> I'd

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
be what I'd probably be left with I'd

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.650 
be what I'd probably be left with I'd
probably<00:03:04.290> put<00:03:04.530> deploy<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:04.980> there<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.610> then<00:03:06.360> I

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
probably put deploy in there and then I

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.240 
probably put deploy in there and then I
think<00:03:07.140> that's<00:03:07.290> what<00:03:07.500> goes<00:03:07.800> forwards<00:03:08.160> my

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
think that's what goes forwards my

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.390 
think that's what goes forwards my
strongest<00:03:08.670> for<00:03:08.940> 12<00:03:09.450> 12<00:03:10.070> non-round<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.220> think

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
strongest for 12 12 non-round I think

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.860 
strongest for 12 12 non-round I think
this<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.550> what<00:03:11.790> my<00:03:11.910> favorite<00:03:12.120> team<00:03:12.540> was

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
this is what my favorite team was

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.200 
this is what my favorite team was
because<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.560> tried<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.070> out<00:03:14.340> with<00:03:15.060> these

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
because I tried this out with these

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.640 
because I tried this out with these
places<00:03:15.420> where<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.080> well<00:03:16.230> just<00:03:16.410> come<00:03:16.560> and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
places where this is well just come and

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.200 
places where this is well just come and
see<00:03:16.800> how<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:16.950> would<00:03:17.070> be<00:03:17.130> move<00:03:17.730> my<00:03:17.880> favorite

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
see how it would be move my favorite

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.700 
see how it would be move my favorite
players<00:03:18.420> from<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.870> I'll<00:03:18.990> take<00:03:19.290> these<00:03:19.440> are

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
players from it and I'll take these are

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.740 
players from it and I'll take these are
my<00:03:19.860> favorite<00:03:19.980> players<00:03:20.370> are<00:03:20.550> used<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.360> I'd<00:03:21.570> say

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
my favorite players are used and I'd say

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.080 
my favorite players are used and I'd say
this<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.200> team<00:03:22.410> I'd<00:03:22.560> go<00:03:22.770> with<00:03:22.950> guys<00:03:23.160> with

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090

with<00:03:26.040> some<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> other<00:03:26.460> players<00:03:26.820> but<00:03:27.120> I'd

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
with some of the other players but I'd

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.180 
with some of the other players but I'd
go<00:03:27.480> with<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:27.990> if<00:03:28.080> as<00:03:28.200> if<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.650> was<00:03:28.800> only<00:03:28.950> making

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
go with it so if as if I was only making

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.920 
go with it so if as if I was only making
one<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.520> these<00:03:29.670> things<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.540> thing<00:03:30.720> did<00:03:30.900> you

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
one of these things the thing did you

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.960 
one of these things the thing did you
think<00:03:31.200> right<00:03:31.350> lads<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:32.280> can<00:03:32.459> make<00:03:32.550> all<00:03:32.820> these

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
think right lads you can make all these

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.500 
think right lads you can make all these
three<00:03:33.330> teams<00:03:33.570> from<00:03:34.380> about<00:03:34.760> 18<00:03:35.760> players<00:03:36.390> I

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
three teams from about 18 players I

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.030 
three teams from about 18 players I
think<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.750> could<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:36.930> think<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.380> can<00:03:37.590> fit<00:03:37.830> all

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
think you could I think you can fit all

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.860 
think you could I think you can fit all
the<00:03:38.250> players<00:03:38.459> using<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:39.030> on<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.630> bench

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
the players using this on the bench

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.260 
the players using this on the bench
searched<00:03:40.430> but<00:03:41.430> I've<00:03:41.580> got<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.730> filter<00:03:42.030> out<00:03:42.120> the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
searched but I've got to filter out the

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.260 
searched but I've got to filter out the
numbers<00:03:42.990> but<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.410> think<00:03:43.770> if<00:03:44.160> I'm<00:03:44.790> working<00:03:45.180> it

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
numbers but I think if I'm working it

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.000 
numbers but I think if I'm working it
right<00:03:45.450> well<00:03:45.810> we've<00:03:45.959> got<00:03:45.990> some<00:03:46.140> time<00:03:46.440> I'm

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
right well we've got some time I'm

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.770 
right well we've got some time I'm
talking<00:03:47.490> I<00:03:47.670> think<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.030> can<00:03:48.180> sit<00:03:48.360> them<00:03:48.480> all<00:03:48.600> on

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
talking I think you can sit them all on

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.360 
talking I think you can sit them all on
so<00:03:49.440> they're<00:03:49.620> all<00:03:49.740> going<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:49.980> cut<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.250> they're

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
so they're all going to cut it they're

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.180 
so they're all going to cut it they're
all<00:03:50.400> under<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.970> cage<00:03:51.300> pretty<00:03:51.930> much<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.980> can

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
all under a cage pretty much you can

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.460 
all under a cage pretty much you can
make<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.459> team's<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:54.030> lot<00:03:54.989> of<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.110> plate<00:03:55.320> to

make the team's a lot of the plate to
discard<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:56.340> be<00:03:56.459> honest<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.060> can<00:03:57.300> make<00:03:57.450> a

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
discard to be honest so you can make a

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.259 
discard to be honest so you can make a
lot<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.810> easily<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:59.250> can<00:03:59.489> mix<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.850> up<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.150> can
