detail about Beck's I know that that's
kind<00:02:00.399> of<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.700> polyurethane<00:02:01.030> I'm<00:02:01.539> Pete<00:02:01.720> off<00:02:01.929> yes

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
kind of to polyurethane I'm Pete off yes

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.529 
kind of to polyurethane I'm Pete off yes
yeah<00:02:02.740> true<00:02:03.069> it's<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.729> polyurethane<00:02:04.119> midsole

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
yeah true it's a polyurethane midsole

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.270 
yeah true it's a polyurethane midsole
which<00:02:05.170> is<00:02:05.319> different<00:02:05.500> from<00:02:05.679> most<00:02:05.920> into

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
which is different from most into

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.270 
which is different from most into
typical<00:02:07.000> midst<00:02:07.179> of<00:02:07.299> which<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:07.630> an<00:02:08.410> EV<00:02:08.799> a<00:02:08.830> I

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.039 
typical midst of which is an EV a I
could<00:02:09.789> go<00:02:09.910> into<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.149> technical<00:02:10.600> terms<00:02:10.840> of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
could go into the technical terms of

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.210 
could go into the technical terms of
what<00:02:11.200> they<00:02:11.319> are<00:02:11.470> but<00:02:11.590> I'd<00:02:11.709> probably<00:02:11.860> bore

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
what they are but I'd probably bore

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.910 
what they are but I'd probably bore
everybody<00:02:12.720> pretty<00:02:13.720> much<00:02:13.920> polyurethane

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
everybody pretty much polyurethane

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.320 
everybody pretty much polyurethane
midsole<00:02:15.430> gives<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.940> an<00:02:16.030> excellent

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
midsole gives you an excellent

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.360 
midsole gives you an excellent
cushioning<00:02:16.660> with<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.350> longer<00:02:17.709> life<00:02:18.040> and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
cushioning with a longer life and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.160 
cushioning with a longer life and
excellent<00:02:18.790> stability<00:02:19.000> as<00:02:19.420> opposed<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.870> e<00:02:19.900> VA

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
excellent stability as opposed to e VA

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.050 
excellent stability as opposed to e VA
which<00:02:20.470> eventually<00:02:20.769> wears<00:02:21.190> down<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.730> bottoms

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
which eventually wears down and bottoms

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.420 
which eventually wears down and bottoms
out<00:02:22.180> after<00:02:22.569> a<00:02:22.599> period<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:24.099> it's<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.280> perfect

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
out after a period so it's a perfect

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.310

blend of form and function to give you

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.410 
blend of form and function to give you
the<00:02:26.410> right<00:02:26.560> cushioning<00:02:27.070> stability<00:02:28.060> and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the right cushioning stability and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.070 
the right cushioning stability and
performance

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080

and send vasc spac in to be resold after

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.140 
and send vasc spac in to be resold after
10-15<00:02:47.290> years<00:02:47.710> but<00:02:48.010> we<00:02:48.130> also<00:02:48.280> people<00:02:48.700> who<00:02:48.850> you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
10-15 years but we also people who you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.520 
10-15 years but we also people who you
know<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.270> prayed<00:02:49.630> all<00:02:49.780> constantly<00:02:50.260> all<00:02:50.440> the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
know I prayed all constantly all the

times depends on how you use it for the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.180 
times depends on how you use it for the
women's<00:02:53.140> version<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.650> can<00:02:53.770> see<00:02:53.950> we<00:02:54.070> have<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
women's version you can see we have the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.070 
women's version you can see we have the
colorways<00:02:54.640> here<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.360> pretty<00:02:55.510> much<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.720> same

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
colorways here it's pretty much the same

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.150 
colorways here it's pretty much the same
thing<00:02:56.350> we<00:02:56.470> just<00:02:56.500> go<00:02:56.770> with<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.010> lighter

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
thing we just go with the lighter

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.820 
thing we just go with the lighter
version<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:58.090> know<00:02:58.180> add<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.420> little<00:02:58.630> more<00:02:58.900> more

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
version you know add a little more more

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.400 
version you know add a little more more
feminine<00:03:00.310> hits<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.820> it<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:03.580> it's<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:05.140> fit<00:03:05.380> of

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
feminine hits to it so it's the fit of

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.010 
feminine hits to it so it's the fit of
these<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.820> women's<00:03:07.120> version<00:03:07.240> is<00:03:07.510> specific<00:03:07.990> to

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
these the women's version is specific to

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.170 
these the women's version is specific to
win<00:03:08.230> up<00:03:08.740> to<00:03:08.800> women's<00:03:09.220> specific<00:03:09.400> fit<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.150> a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
win up to women's specific fit and a

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.820 
win up to women's specific fit and a
men's<00:03:10.390> specific<00:03:10.930> fit<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.260> take<00:03:11.440> into<00:03:11.590> account

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
men's specific fit to take into account

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.880 
men's specific fit to take into account
the<00:03:11.950> differences

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
the differences

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.170 
the differences
what<00:03:14.890> kind<00:03:15.069> of<00:03:15.099> goes<00:03:15.250> into<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.760> research

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
what kind of goes into the research

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.740 
what kind of goes into the research
behind<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:17.110> fifth<00:03:17.410> like<00:03:17.830> we<00:03:18.760> are<00:03:19.360> part<00:03:19.599> of<00:03:19.660> a

we use the one piece leather in the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.430 
we use the one piece leather in the
forefoot<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.340> quarter<00:03:45.819> it<00:03:46.390> really<00:03:46.810> conforms

forefoot and quarter it really conforms
to<00:03:47.530> your<00:03:47.650> foot<00:03:47.739> after<00:03:48.100> minimal<00:03:48.910> wear<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.450> you

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
to your foot after minimal wear so you

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.300

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
shorter and because it's one piece it

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.300 
shorter and because it's one piece it
just<00:03:54.130> stretches<00:03:54.760> fits<00:03:55.569> tight<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.769> do<00:03:57.220> you
