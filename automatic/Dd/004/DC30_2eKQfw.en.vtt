00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
heading a national research project into

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.120 
heading a national research project into
the<00:02:40.180> effects<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.780> electromagnetic<00:02:41.290> radiation

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
the effects of electromagnetic radiation

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.050 
the effects of electromagnetic radiation
on<00:02:42.640> our<00:02:43.060> brains<00:02:43.500> he<00:02:44.500> admits<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.400> radiation

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
on our brains he admits the radiation

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.680 
on our brains he admits the radiation
does<00:02:46.390> get<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:48.150> electromagnetic<00:02:49.150> radiation

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
does get in so electromagnetic radiation

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.740 
does get in so electromagnetic radiation
is<00:02:50.080> actually<00:02:50.880> passing<00:02:51.880> over<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.209> top<00:02:52.420> and

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
is actually passing over the top and

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.620 
is actually passing over the top and
into<00:02:53.050> my<00:02:53.140> head<00:02:53.320> now<00:02:53.550> exactly<00:02:54.550> that's<00:02:54.790> right<00:02:55.030> so

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
into my head now exactly that's right so

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.150 
into my head now exactly that's right so
the<00:02:55.750> electromagnetic<00:02:56.290> radiation<00:02:56.890> from<00:02:57.070> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
the electromagnetic radiation from the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.090 
the electromagnetic radiation from the
phone<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.700> penetrating<00:02:58.420> into<00:02:58.660> your<00:02:58.930> head<00:02:59.110> not

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
phone is penetrating into your head not

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.070 
phone is penetrating into your head not
a<00:03:00.130> lot<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.550> of<00:03:00.640> course<00:03:00.850> but<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.959> this

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
a lot of it of course but but this

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.570 
a lot of it of course but but this
certainly<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.560> some<00:03:02.770> absorption<00:03:03.100> by<00:03:03.519> the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
certainly is some absorption by the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.940 
certainly is some absorption by the
brain<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.150> by<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:05.019> tissues<00:03:05.380> around<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.739> head

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
brain and by the tissues around the head

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.090 
brain and by the tissues around the head
but<00:03:06.400> critically<00:03:07.269> crossed<00:03:07.959> assures<00:03:08.440> me<00:03:08.530> the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
but critically crossed assures me the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.850 
but critically crossed assures me the
radiation<00:03:09.519> is<00:03:09.820> so<00:03:10.030> low<00:03:10.300> I'm<00:03:10.660> perfectly<00:03:11.560> safe

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
radiation is so low I'm perfectly safe

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.600 
radiation is so low I'm perfectly safe
and<00:03:12.420> most<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.780> scientific<00:03:14.260> community

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
and most of the scientific community

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.449 
and most of the scientific community
agrees<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.290> mobile<00:03:17.590> phone<00:03:17.800> does<00:03:18.040> make<00:03:18.340> the

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
agrees so the mobile phone does make the

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.729 
agrees so the mobile phone does make the
brain<00:03:18.670> heat<00:03:18.880> up<00:03:19.030> slightly<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.510> does<00:03:19.780> about

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
brain heat up slightly it does about

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.100 
brain heat up slightly it does about
point<00:03:21.310> one<00:03:21.519> of<00:03:21.640> a<00:03:21.730> degree<00:03:22.030> centigrade<00:03:22.269> that's

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
point one of a degree centigrade that's

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.770 
point one of a degree centigrade that's
absolutely<00:03:23.620> right<00:03:23.860> but<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.970> kind<00:03:25.330> of<00:03:25.450> level

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
absolutely right but that kind of level

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.509 
absolutely right but that kind of level
is<00:03:26.110> not<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.830> kind<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.070> level<00:03:27.340> which<00:03:27.489> is

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
is not the kind of level which is

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.300 
is not the kind of level which is
normally<00:03:28.120> needed<00:03:28.540> in<00:03:29.320> order<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.739> cause<00:03:30.040> some

sort<00:03:30.519> of<00:03:30.580> damage<00:03:30.940> people<00:03:31.300> usually<00:03:31.510> think<00:03:31.810> so

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
sort of damage people usually think so

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.229 
sort of damage people usually think so
long<00:03:32.500> as<00:03:32.620> as<00:03:33.250> long<00:03:33.430> as<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.670> brain<00:03:33.910> does<00:03:34.120> an

we've<00:03:36.760> got<00:03:36.970> nothing<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.390> worry<00:03:37.540> about<00:03:37.690> so

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
we've got nothing to worry about so

we've got nothing to worry about so
they've<00:03:38.380> got<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.620> wrong<00:03:38.739> Vinnie<00:03:39.459> coronas<00:03:39.820> got

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
they've got it wrong Vinnie coronas got

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.550 
they've got it wrong Vinnie coronas got
a<00:03:40.000> rock<00:03:40.209> Charlie<00:03:40.570> to<00:03:40.600> yours<00:03:40.870> going<00:03:41.019> on<00:03:41.230> that's

a rock Charlie to yours going on that's

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.280 
a rock Charlie to yours going on that's
right<00:03:41.830> that's<00:03:42.580> my<00:03:42.820> opinion<00:03:43.060> yes<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:44.019> can<00:03:44.140> go

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
right that's my opinion yes you can go

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.390 
right that's my opinion yes you can go
got<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.530> wrong

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
got it wrong

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
of Charlie Toews patients I think this

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.960 
of Charlie Toews patients I think this
is<00:03:56.610> what<00:03:57.150> has<00:03:57.270> killed<00:03:57.569> me<00:03:57.750> or<00:03:58.170> will<00:03:58.470> kill<00:03:58.709> me<00:03:58.970> do

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
is what has killed me or will kill me do

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
able to get rid of the tumor but right

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.690 
able to get rid of the tumor but right
now<00:04:30.690> it's<00:04:31.530> stable<00:04:33.350> sadly<00:04:34.350> Brett<00:04:35.070> knows<00:04:35.370> it's

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
now it's stable sadly Brett knows it's

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.000 
now it's stable sadly Brett knows it's
only<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.030> matter<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.270> time<00:04:36.390> before<00:04:37.350> it<00:04:37.650> starts

seven<00:04:47.010> years<00:04:48.380> had<00:04:49.380> my<00:04:49.530> very<00:04:49.800> very<00:04:49.860> best<00:04:50.160> in

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
seven years had my very very best in

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.420 
seven years had my very very best in
there<00:04:53.190> okay<00:04:53.610> look<00:04:53.820> good<00:04:54.060> good<00:04:54.860> once<00:04:55.860> brain

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
there okay look good good once brain

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.330 
there okay look good good once brain
tumors<00:04:56.910> were<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.180> relatively<00:04:57.720> rare<00:04:58.200> cancer<00:04:58.770> but

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
tumors were a relatively rare cancer but

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.850 
tumors were a relatively rare cancer but
not<00:04:59.550> anymore<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.270> Charlie<00:05:01.110> Toews<00:05:01.440> biggest

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
not anymore and Charlie Toews biggest

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.159 
not anymore and Charlie Toews biggest
worry<00:05:02.160> is<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.880> their<00:05:03.240> dramatic<00:05:03.450> increase

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
worry is that their dramatic increase

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.430 
worry is that their dramatic increase
has<00:05:04.740> coincided<00:05:05.190> with<00:05:05.820> a<00:05:06.150> boom<00:05:06.479> in<00:05:06.780> mobile

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
has coincided with a boom in mobile

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
has coincided with a boom in mobile
ownership<00:05:08.000> there<00:05:09.000> is<00:05:09.120> now<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.270> true

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
ownership there is now a true

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.469 
ownership there is now a true
exponential<00:05:11.460> rise<00:05:11.640> in<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.030> instance<00:05:12.390> of

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
exponential rise in the instance of

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.909 
exponential rise in the instance of
brain<00:05:12.690> cancer<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:13.640> so<00:05:14.640> we<00:05:14.850> have<00:05:15.000> got<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:15.570> be

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
brain cancer and so we have got to be

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.590 
brain cancer and so we have got to be
responsible<00:05:16.919> about<00:05:17.130> all<00:05:17.669> the<00:05:18.000> potential
