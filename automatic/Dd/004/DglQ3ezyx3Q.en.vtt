00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.090 
run and the ever challenging mountain
runs<00:03:01.070> we<00:03:01.610> have<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.910> go<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.440> up<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.650> mountains

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
runs we have to go to up the mountains

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.370 
runs we have to go to up the mountains
like<00:03:04.400> twice<00:03:04.730> or<00:03:04.970> two<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.540> three<00:03:05.690> times<00:03:05.720> and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
like twice or two to three times and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.310 
like twice or two to three times and
then<00:03:07.100> once<00:03:07.550> once<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.030> go<00:03:08.180> up<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.630> have<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.080> go

down<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.040> going<00:03:10.940> up<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:11.270> just<00:03:11.450> half<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.630> battle

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
down so going up is just half the battle

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.100 
down so going up is just half the battle
going<00:03:12.920> down<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.550> another<00:03:13.790> challenge<00:03:14.300> that<00:03:14.720> you

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
going down is another challenge that you

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.770 
going down is another challenge that you
have<00:03:15.320> to<00:03:15.560> really<00:03:15.890> take<00:03:16.340> cares<00:03:16.640> as<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:17.570> know<00:03:17.660> it

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
since it's 24k it becomes really long as

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.590

that<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:01.300> makes<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:02.380> its<00:04:03.010> really<00:04:03.250> light

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.480 

the<00:04:09.959> Salomon<00:04:10.319> X<00:04:10.470> trail<00:04:10.740> is<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:10.920> green<00:04:11.220> run

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
the Salomon X trail is a green run

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.640 
the Salomon X trail is a green run
meaning<00:04:12.450> we<00:04:12.930> are<00:04:12.959> not<00:04:13.170> giving<00:04:13.500> any

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
meaning we are not giving any

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.830 
meaning we are not giving any
disposables<00:04:14.489> around<00:04:14.970> around<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.599> course

disposables around around the course

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.680 
disposables around around the course
what<00:04:16.799> does<00:04:17.010> that<00:04:17.040> mean<00:04:17.459> all<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.389> hydration

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
what does that mean all the hydration

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.760 
what does that mean all the hydration
stations<00:04:19.350> are<00:04:19.769> basically<00:04:20.400> just<00:04:20.910> drugs<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:22.410> all

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
stations are basically just drugs so all

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.230 
stations are basically just drugs so all
participants<00:04:23.490> must<00:04:23.820> bring<00:04:24.030> their<00:04:24.180> own

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
participants must bring their own

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.470 
participants must bring their own
hydration<00:04:24.600> packs<00:04:25.020> hydration<00:04:25.560> bottles<00:04:26.480> or

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
hydration packs hydration bottles or

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.600 
hydration packs hydration bottles or
hydration<00:04:27.840> belts<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.590> then<00:04:29.280> they<00:04:29.430> have

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
hydration belts and then they have

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.180 
hydration belts and then they have
refilling<00:04:30.150> stations<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:31.350> eliminates<00:04:31.560> all

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
refilling stations this eliminates all

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.909 
refilling stations this eliminates all
waste<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.150> actually<00:04:33.840> this<00:04:34.320> preserves<00:04:34.710> our

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
waste and actually this preserves our

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.129 
waste and actually this preserves our
trail<00:04:35.250> because<00:04:35.760> we<00:04:36.240> want<00:04:36.389> to<00:04:36.450> practice<00:04:36.810> clean

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
trail because we want to practice clean

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:45.390 
trail because we want to practice clean
