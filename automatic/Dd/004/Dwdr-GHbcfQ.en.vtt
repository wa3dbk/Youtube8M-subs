00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.740
 the top two layer 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.470
 well you looking for a cubes to sin the green color like this 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.700
 this orange block for example 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.990
 what you are naturally after the tea can keep from that block in a panic to the 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.070
 top with the green and the world cup all round and you turn after the wrist and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.690
 the side 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.330
 so that these colors 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.710
 on income 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.600
 the sure of the block with the middle 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.450
 marije munter and watched 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.729
 and some cases it will be this bed orange block 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.350
 but the left-wing media 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.960
 to the white 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.159
 can divide between 30 and the orange 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.160
 for the attic 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.170
 linschoten written down 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.719
 in other cases this traces go well with a block 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.140
 to the right 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.260
 down 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.620
 between 30 and the online newspaper 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.620
 these are two different guesses who should make this 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.460
 if the block with links must be like here 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.530
 do you see the derby 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.980
 by rtvrijnmond 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.520
 are each 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.290
 b 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.770

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.769
 after a handy ball 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.919
 without a good color for example this oldfield village 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.079
 in this process

 and as you see 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.639
 the group a block 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.679
 they are the nicest place 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.019
 and a little further 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.259

 14 more blocks 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.029
