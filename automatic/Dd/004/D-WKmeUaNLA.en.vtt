people<00:02:45.230> care<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.130> much<00:02:46.310> about<00:02:46.609> this<00:02:46.880> kind<00:02:47.090> of

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
people care so much about this kind of

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.699 
people care so much about this kind of
stuff<00:02:47.269> well<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.630> think<00:02:47.750> we<00:02:47.989> can<00:02:48.109> all<00:02:48.319> agree<00:02:48.470> that

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
stuff well I think we can all agree that

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.460 
stuff well I think we can all agree that
our<00:02:49.069> food<00:02:49.549> system<00:02:49.609> has<00:02:50.000> been<00:02:50.269> hijacked<00:02:50.840> by<00:02:51.019> big

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
our food system has been hijacked by big

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.960 
our food system has been hijacked by big
AG<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.069> big<00:02:52.250> food

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
AG and big food

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.600 
AG and big food
so<00:02:53.270> a<00:02:53.690> lot<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:53.930> mom-and-pop<00:02:54.620> shops<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.400> used

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
so a lot of mom-and-pop shops that used

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.370 
so a lot of mom-and-pop shops that used
to<00:02:55.700> exist<00:02:56.120> don't<00:02:56.450> exist<00:02:56.840> anymore<00:02:57.110> at<00:02:57.350> least

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
to exist don't exist anymore at least

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.170 
to exist don't exist anymore at least
for<00:02:57.680> our<00:02:57.710> generation<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:58.880> think<00:02:59.090> that

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
for our generation and I think that

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.120 
for our generation and I think that
people<00:02:59.330> are<00:02:59.510> just<00:02:59.720> dying<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.260> know<00:03:00.710> where

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
people are just dying to know where

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.920 
people are just dying to know where
their<00:03:01.250> food<00:03:01.280> comes<00:03:01.700> from<00:03:01.880> it's<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.240> basic<00:03:02.690> right

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
their food comes from it's a basic right

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.780 
their food comes from it's a basic right
so<00:03:03.590> how<00:03:03.710> can<00:03:03.830> people<00:03:03.950> sort<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.370> put<00:03:04.520> this<00:03:04.610> into

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
so how can people sort of put this into

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.160 
so how can people sort of put this into
action<00:03:05.000> how<00:03:05.270> can<00:03:05.450> they<00:03:05.540> take<00:03:05.750> part<00:03:06.020> of<00:03:06.080> what

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
action how can they take part of what

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.510 
action how can they take part of what
you're<00:03:06.260> talking<00:03:06.530> about<00:03:06.590> I<00:03:06.920> think<00:03:07.040> it's<00:03:07.340> really

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
you're talking about I think it's really

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.000
