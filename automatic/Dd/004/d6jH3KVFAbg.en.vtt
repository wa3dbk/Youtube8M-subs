streak snapped by Villanova was that low

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.700 
streak snapped by Villanova was that low
lower<00:01:31.180> than<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.570> high<00:01:31.750> was<00:01:32.020> high<00:01:32.259> after<00:01:32.470> you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710

won the title oh yeah I mean whenever

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.770 
won the title oh yeah I mean whenever
you<00:01:35.380> win<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:35.770> much<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:39.580> humbles<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.270> it's

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
you win so much it humbles you and it's

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.840 
you win so much it humbles you and it's
our<00:01:41.140> place<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:42.160> learned<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.490> lot<00:01:42.640> from<00:01:42.700> that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
our place and we learned a lot from that

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.070 
our place and we learned a lot from that
game<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.240> I<00:01:43.300> think<00:01:43.509> that's<00:01:43.690> why<00:01:43.810> we<00:01:43.930> were<00:01:44.020> able

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
game and I think that's why we were able

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.109 
game and I think that's why we were able
to<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:44.890> know<00:01:44.979> go<00:01:45.130> on<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.460> tournament<00:01:45.940> and
