what<00:04:38.170> I'll<00:04:38.290> do<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.650> I'll<00:04:38.800> plot<00:04:39.130> out<00:04:39.430> all<00:04:39.730> of<00:04:40.000> my

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
what I'll do is I'll plot out all of my

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.230 
what I'll do is I'll plot out all of my
meats<00:04:40.480> so<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.110> have<00:04:41.410> a<00:04:41.440> full<00:04:41.890> view<00:04:42.340> of<00:04:42.580> my<00:04:42.730> season

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
meats so I have a full view of my season

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.020 
meats so I have a full view of my season
and<00:04:43.390> then<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:43.960> plot<00:04:44.440> in<00:04:44.650> where<00:04:44.920> I<00:04:44.950> want<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.460> wait

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
and then I plot in where I want to wait

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.510 
and then I plot in where I want to wait
train<00:04:46.390> around<00:04:46.930> those<00:04:47.200> meats<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:47.770> everything

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
else is a throwing day so that's what

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.990 
else is a throwing day so that's what
you<00:04:50.560> should<00:04:50.770> do<00:04:50.920> too<00:04:51.100> if<00:04:51.310> you're<00:04:51.490> concerned
