Crew<00:01:47.070> forming<00:01:47.579> cream<00:01:47.790> which<00:01:47.970> everyone<00:01:48.420> has<00:01:48.600> so

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
Crew forming cream which everyone has so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.990 
Crew forming cream which everyone has so
I<00:01:49.020> thought<00:01:49.229> it'd<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.530> good<00:01:49.710> base<00:01:49.950> for

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
I thought it'd be a good base for

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.810 
I thought it'd be a good base for
comparison<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.950> guys<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> gum

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
comparison so as you guys know the gum

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.609 
comparison so as you guys know the gum
foaming<00:01:54.240> cream<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.540> very<00:01:54.869> much<00:01:55.140> kind<00:01:55.560> of

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
foaming cream is very much kind of

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.990 
foaming cream is very much kind of
sticky<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.399> gooey<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:59.460> smells<00:01:59.700> kind<00:01:59.939> of

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
sticky and gooey and the smells kind of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.850 
sticky and gooey and the smells kind of
okay<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.659> has<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> kind<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.259> aftershave<00:02:01.649> II

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
okay it has a kind of aftershave II

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.289 
okay it has a kind of aftershave II
smell<00:02:02.390> but<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:04.490> find<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.670> forming<00:02:06.030> cream

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
smell but I I find the forming cream

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.930 
smell but I I find the forming cream
gets<00:02:06.570> very<00:02:06.780> very<00:02:07.020> oily<00:02:07.170> quickly<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.860> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
gets very very oily quickly and that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
gets very very oily quickly and that
the<00:02:09.090> thing<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.360> didn't<00:02:09.750> encounter<00:02:10.590> when<00:02:10.740> I

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the thing I didn't encounter when I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.260 
the thing I didn't encounter when I
started<00:02:11.160> using<00:02:11.340> Parker

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
started using Parker

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.540 
started using Parker
so<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.930> actually<00:02:13.320> applied<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:14.040> on<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.250> night<00:02:14.520> out

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
so I actually applied it on a night out

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.630 
so I actually applied it on a night out
the<00:02:14.850> other<00:02:15.030> night<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.650> by<00:02:16.650> around<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.400> think

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
the other night and by around I think

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880 
the other night and by around I think
four<00:02:17.910> hours<00:02:18.330> into<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.690> night<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.110> was<00:02:19.680> just

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
four hours into the night I was just

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.990 
four hours into the night I was just
kind<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.130> playing<00:02:20.310> with<00:02:20.400> my<00:02:20.520> hair<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.700> I

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
kind of playing with my hair and I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.880 
kind of playing with my hair and I
realized<00:02:21.300> well<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.750> hasn't<00:02:21.990> kind<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.440> built<00:02:22.680> up

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
realized well it hasn't kind of built up

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.380 
realized well it hasn't kind of built up
it<00:02:23.130> hasn't<00:02:23.460> got<00:02:23.580> oily<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.000> kind<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.240> should

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
it hasn't got oily it kind of should

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.420 
it hasn't got oily it kind of should
stay<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.780> same<00:02:24.960> maybe<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.040> because<00:02:26.220> I

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
stay the same maybe it is because I

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.310 
stay the same maybe it is because I
didn't<00:02:26.820> actually<00:02:26.940> put<00:02:27.360> too<00:02:27.510> much<00:02:27.630> product<00:02:27.960> and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
didn't actually put too much product and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.740 
didn't actually put too much product and
I<00:02:28.470> think<00:02:28.500> that's<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.010> kind<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.750> important

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
I think that's the kind of important

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.570 
I think that's the kind of important
thing<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.140> come<00:02:31.440> tonight<00:02:32.070> when<00:02:32.460> you're

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
thing to come tonight when you're

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.040 
thing to come tonight when you're
actually<00:02:32.670> doing<00:02:33.000> here<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.510> not<00:02:33.660> put<00:02:33.930> too

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
actually doing here is to not put too

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.310 
actually doing here is to not put too
much<00:02:34.170> product<00:02:34.380> but<00:02:35.390> either<00:02:36.390> way<00:02:36.720> even<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:37.140> I

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
much product but either way even if I

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.230 
much product but either way even if I
haven't<00:02:37.650> put<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.040> lot<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.340> deforming<00:02:38.880> cream<00:02:39.060> in

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
haven't put a lot of deforming cream in

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.990 
haven't put a lot of deforming cream in
my<00:02:39.420> hair<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.900> do<00:02:40.470> find<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.160> after<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.610> few<00:02:41.970> hours

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
my hair I do find that after a few hours

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.690 
my hair I do find that after a few hours
it<00:02:42.510> does<00:02:42.690> get<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.050> bit<00:02:43.170> oily<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.980> because<00:02:44.670> I

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
it does get a bit oily and because I

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.630 
it does get a bit oily and because I
have<00:02:44.910> such<00:02:44.990> thick<00:02:45.990> air<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.560> doesn't<00:02:46.800> just<00:02:47.520> mean

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
have such thick air it doesn't just mean

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.840 
have such thick air it doesn't just mean
applying<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.360> using<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.410> much<00:02:49.620> all<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.700> all

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
applying have using that much all in all

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.050 
applying have using that much all in all
because<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:52.250> don't<00:02:53.250> want<00:02:53.400> too<00:02:53.520> much<00:02:53.640> build-up

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
because I don't want too much build-up

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.250 
because I don't want too much build-up
so<00:02:54.410> what<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> just<00:02:55.710> did<00:02:55.920> was<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.460> kind<00:02:56.760> of

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
so what I just did was I kind of

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.750 
so what I just did was I kind of
massaged<00:02:58.260> into<00:02:58.590> my<00:02:58.770> head<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.340> then<00:02:59.460> took<00:02:59.700> it

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
massaged into my head and then took it

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.550 
massaged into my head and then took it
onto<00:03:00.540> my<00:03:00.660> hair<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.110> kind<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.380> pushed<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.490> into

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
onto my hair and kind of pushed it into

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.560 
onto my hair and kind of pushed it into
kind<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.770> roots<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.610> could<00:03:06.360> build

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
kind of the roots so I can could build

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.560 
kind of the roots so I can could build
up<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.900> style<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.560> then<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.300> just<00:03:09.300> kind<00:03:09.540> of

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
up the style and then I just kind of

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.590 
up the style and then I just kind of
raked<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.050> in<00:03:10.140> like<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:14.270> you<00:03:15.270> can<00:03:15.450> see

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
raked it in like that so you can see

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.020 
raked it in like that so you can see
what<00:03:15.720> I'm<00:03:15.810> doing<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.230> so<00:03:17.130> as<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.700> can<00:03:17.820> see<00:03:17.880> it

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
what I'm doing that so as you can see it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.850 
what I'm doing that so as you can see it
has<00:03:18.120> such<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> matte<00:03:18.750> finish<00:03:18.959> it's<00:03:19.380> not<00:03:19.560> shiny

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
has such a matte finish it's not shiny

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.880 
has such a matte finish it's not shiny
at<00:03:20.070> all<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.120> holds<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.380> think

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
at all and it just holds so I think

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.470 
at all and it just holds so I think
that's<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.220> main<00:03:23.370> thing<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.330> holds

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
that's the main thing and it holds

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.210 
that's the main thing and it holds
without<00:03:24.810> getting<00:03:25.080> oily<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.560> sticky<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:25.980> I

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
without getting oily and sticky so I

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.340 
without getting oily and sticky so I
think<00:03:26.400> that's<00:03:27.300> where<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.630> would<00:03:27.900> say<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.230> was

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
think that's where I would say it was

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.440 
think that's where I would say it was
it's<00:03:28.680> gonna<00:03:28.950> win<00:03:29.220> over<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.790> forming<00:03:30.209> cream

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
it's gonna win over the forming cream

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.880 
it's gonna win over the forming cream
but<00:03:30.600> that's<00:03:30.750> what<00:03:30.959> I've<00:03:31.080> thought<00:03:31.320> about<00:03:31.560> this

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
but that's what I've thought about this

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.979 
but that's what I've thought about this
product<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.910> will<00:03:32.970> definitely<00:03:33.209> give<00:03:33.570> give

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
product and I will definitely give give
