you one drill today that makes the slice
more<00:00:33.570> biting<00:00:33.870> because<00:00:35.210> backhand<00:00:36.210> slice<00:00:36.390> is

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
more biting because backhand slice is

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.299 
more biting because backhand slice is
one<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> most<00:00:37.230> common<00:00:37.860> shots<00:00:38.130> in

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
one of the most common shots in

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
recreational tennis and most slices that

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.180 
recreational tennis and most slices that
I<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.879> from<00:00:42.210> rec<00:00:42.480> players<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:43.080> too<00:00:43.949> floaty

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
I see from rec players are too floaty

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.700 
I see from rec players are too floaty
they're<00:00:44.760> too<00:00:44.910> safe<00:00:45.150> and<00:00:45.440> there's<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.530> very

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
they're too safe and there's a very

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.020 
they're too safe and there's a very
simple<00:00:46.949> drill<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.400> will<00:00:47.580> give<00:00:47.790> you<00:00:47.879> this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
slice into the net just with the tip of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.460 
slice into the net just with the tip of
your<00:01:26.580> racket

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
your racket

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.760 
your racket
that's<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.649> this<00:01:33.560> yeah

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that's like this yeah

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.190 
that's like this yeah
just<00:01:35.040> keep<00:01:35.220> slicing<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.689> don't<00:01:36.960> want<00:01:37.080> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
just keep slicing so you don't want to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.660 
just keep slicing so you don't want to
go<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.560> go<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.920> don't<00:01:38.130> want<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.340> go<00:01:38.460> too<00:01:38.520> much

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
go here go you don't want to go too much

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.060 
go here go you don't want to go too much

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
like this you just want to go right keep

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.690 
like this you just want to go right keep
slicing<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.700> slice<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:43.580> yeah

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.310 

okay<00:01:47.700> now<00:01:47.969> try<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.420> exaggerate<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> little

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
okay now try just exaggerate a little

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.889 
okay now try just exaggerate a little
bit<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.710> accelerators<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:51.359> accelerate

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
bit and accelerators just accelerate

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.260 
bit and accelerators just accelerate
like<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.549> let's<00:01:53.549> give<00:01:53.729> me<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> quick<00:01:54.119> cut<00:01:56.270> try

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
like this let's give me a quick cut try

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.090 
like this let's give me a quick cut try
to<00:01:57.329> keep<00:01:57.659> your<00:01:57.780> racket<00:01:58.170> face<00:01:58.200> all<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.920> time

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
to keep your racket face all the time

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the same so you don't want to cut like

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.359 
the same so you don't want to cut like

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
to don't want to change this angle just

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.249 
to don't want to change this angle just
want<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.979> keep<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.479> when<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.659> chose<00:02:06.929> one

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
path you just keep going through that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.229 
path you just keep going through that
Pat<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.780> only<00:02:10.259> when<00:02:10.410> you're<00:02:10.590> finished

Pat and only when you're finished
cutting<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.420> net<00:02:12.720> then<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.110> will<00:02:13.290> let<00:02:14.250> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
cutting the net then you will let the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.780 
cutting the net then you will let the
racket<00:02:14.730> go<00:02:14.879> into<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.299> follow-through

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
racket go into the follow-through

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.920 
racket go into the follow-through

okay<00:02:44.190> here<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.400> go<00:02:44.489> Angela<00:02:47.390> what's<00:02:48.390> important

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
okay here we go Angela what's important

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.160 
okay here we go Angela what's important
is<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:50.120> right<00:02:51.120> now<00:02:51.329> that<00:02:51.600> we<00:02:51.780> were<00:02:51.930> moving

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
is that right now that we were moving

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.410 
is that right now that we were moving
the<00:02:52.350> camera<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.950> preparing<00:02:53.400> for<00:02:53.549> this<00:02:53.730> they

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
the camera and preparing for this they

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.110 
the camera and preparing for this they
actually<00:02:54.810> lost<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.260> feel<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.530> little<00:02:55.829> bit<00:02:56.090> so<00:02:57.090> I

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
actually lost the feel a little bit so I

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.860 
actually lost the feel a little bit so I
will<00:02:57.450> have<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.780> bring<00:02:58.709> them<00:02:58.980> back<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.489> net

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
will have to bring them back to the net

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.559 
will have to bring them back to the net
so<00:03:00.870> eat<00:03:01.019> still<00:03:01.260> has<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.849> slice<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.359> more

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
so eat still has it as the slice is more

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.629 
so eat still has it as the slice is more
biting<00:03:04.639> yes<00:03:05.639> that's<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.090> perfect<00:03:06.329> one<00:03:06.630> and

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
biting yes that's the perfect one and

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.099 
biting yes that's the perfect one and

so that's a quick tip on how to improve
your<00:05:47.330> slice<00:05:47.720> of<00:05:48.550> course<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:49.730> doesn't<00:05:49.910> work<00:05:50.450> in

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
your slice of course it doesn't work in

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.710 
your slice of course it doesn't work in
five<00:05:50.990> repetitions<00:05:51.320> but<00:05:52.000> this<00:05:53.000> these<00:05:53.510> guys

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
five repetitions but this these guys

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.420 
five repetitions but this these guys
improve<00:05:54.200> their<00:05:54.440> slice<00:05:54.680> maybe<00:05:55.010> in<00:05:55.190> five

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
improve their slice maybe in five

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.270 
improve their slice maybe in five
minutes<00:05:55.820> of<00:05:55.970> doing<00:05:56.960> maybe<00:05:57.260> three<00:05:57.560> times<00:05:57.770> the

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
minutes of doing maybe three times the

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.310 
minutes of doing maybe three times the
field<00:05:58.670> drill<00:05:58.910> so<00:05:59.150> they<00:05:59.300> feel<00:05:59.630> the<00:05:59.780> slice<00:06:00.050> at

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
field drill so they feel the slice at

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.030 
field drill so they feel the slice at
the<00:06:01.010> net<00:06:01.190> and<00:06:01.370> then<00:06:02.300> just<00:06:02.600> feed<00:06:02.810> 10<00:06:03.290> 15<00:06:03.740> 20

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
the net and then just feed 10 15 20

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.330 
the net and then just feed 10 15 20
balls<00:06:04.220> you<00:06:05.180> repeat<00:06:05.480> that<00:06:05.660> week<00:06:06.080> to<00:06:06.320> three<00:06:06.470> few

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
balls you repeat that week to three few

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.060 
balls you repeat that week to three few
months<00:06:07.640> and<00:06:07.790> the<00:06:08.210> slides<00:06:08.510> will<00:06:08.750> be<00:06:09.070> more

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
months and the slides will be more

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.600 
months and the slides will be more
resembling<00:06:10.610> Roger<00:06:10.820> Federer<00:06:11.300> slice
