00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.340
 time not rushing to exit the city 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.590
 By the way about this fungus is located 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.670
 near the centers and you can walk 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.430
 before the goods go 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.680
 and the time of saint paul has been changed 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.140

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.780
 clothes and no reception 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.760
 they work on the principle of less than 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.740
 Chikin personnel need to do with 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.210
 using a special terminal which 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.250
 lying to the room key card 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.070
 however there is a duty concierge 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.170
 who is always ready to help and on the very 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.080
 In fact, all this does not spoil the feeling of the hotel 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.360
 and the price-quality ratio of this new 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.810

 the hallways are a bit crowded 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.079
 but the rooms are relatively light 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.840
 spacious marble bathrooms in each of 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.459
