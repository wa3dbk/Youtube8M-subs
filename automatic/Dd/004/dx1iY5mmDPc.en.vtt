weeks ago the ones I showed in the video

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.700 
weeks ago the ones I showed in the video
and<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> smaller<00:00:12.179> ones<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.780> between<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
and the smaller ones in between are the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.709 
and the smaller ones in between are the
ones<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.099> did<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.400> video<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.759> these<00:00:15.360> here<00:00:15.690> I

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719

just<00:00:16.260> planted<00:00:16.529> today<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.190> row<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:18.230> I

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
just planted today this row here and I

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.840 
just planted today this row here and I
thought<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.470> would<00:00:19.650> be<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.770> good<00:00:19.949> time<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> do

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.450 
celery and cut the bottom off the root
part<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.079> stuck<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.680> water<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.010> about<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.280> week

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
part I stuck in water for about a week

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.979 
part I stuck in water for about a week
you'll<00:00:41.640> notice<00:00:41.879> right<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.660> cut

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you'll notice right here this is the cut

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
you'll notice right here this is the cut
part<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.399> has<00:00:44.550> been<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
part and then this has been in the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.910 
part and then this has been in the
ground<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:45.870> about<00:00:46.050> six<00:00:46.440> days<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
ground here for about six days and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.319 
ground here for about six days and
you'll<00:00:47.039> notice<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.370> new<00:00:47.640> growth<00:00:47.910> right<00:00:48.120> here

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
you'll notice this new growth right here

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.479 
you'll notice this new growth right here
so<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> same<00:00:49.680> thing<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.129> celery

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
so you can do the same thing with celery

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.119 
so you can do the same thing with celery
that<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.809> green<00:00:52.020> onions<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.440> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
five months now this is my ugh knee

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.850 
five months now this is my ugh knee
berry<00:01:30.390> which<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.750> also<00:01:30.900> called<00:01:31.170> Chilean<00:01:31.590> guava

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
berry which is also called Chilean guava

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.890 
berry which is also called Chilean guava
and<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:33.119> planted<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.750> from<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.290> real<00:01:34.640> small

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
and I planted this from a real small

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.080 
and I planted this from a real small
cutting<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.400> now<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.579> starting<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.939> push

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
cutting and now it's starting to push

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.670 
cutting and now it's starting to push
out<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.509> bit<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.990> when<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.439> starts

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
out a little bit and when it starts

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.870 
out a little bit and when it starts
warming<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.009> really<00:01:41.220> well<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.640> this

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
warming up really well I think this

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.100 
warming up really well I think this
thing<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:42.570> start<00:01:42.840> taking

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
thing is going to really start taking

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
thing is going to really start taking
off<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:44.009> you've<00:01:44.159> never<00:01:44.280> grown<00:01:44.640> Chilean

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
off but if you've never grown Chilean

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.789 
off but if you've never grown Chilean
guava<00:01:45.240> look<00:01:45.479> them<00:01:45.659> up<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> internet<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
guava look them up on the internet and

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.590 
guava look them up on the internet and
now<00:01:46.950> quick<00:01:47.220> update<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.880> peas<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> couple

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
now quick update on the peas a couple

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.690 
now quick update on the peas a couple
people<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.869> asked<00:01:49.229> about<00:01:49.380> those<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.159> we're

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
people that asked about those and we're

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.069 
people that asked about those and we're
starting<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.030> really<00:01:51.210> well<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.479> mean<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.930> been

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
starting to really well I mean it's been

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.819 
starting to really well I mean it's been
cold<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> lot<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.750> cold<00:01:54.750> damp<00:01:55.170> nights<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
cold here a lot of cold damp nights and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.740 
cold here a lot of cold damp nights and
now<00:01:56.369> they're<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.700> starting<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.000> take<00:01:57.240> off<00:01:57.420> so

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
now they're just starting to take off so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.999 
now they're just starting to take off so
I'm<00:01:57.869> hoping<00:01:58.140> within<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> next<00:01:58.590> week<00:01:58.770> we're

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
I'm hoping within the next week we're

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.200 
I'm hoping within the next week we're
supposed<00:01:59.219> start<00:01:59.399> warming<00:01:59.670> up<00:01:59.759> really<00:02:00.000> well

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
supposed start warming up really well

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.030 
supposed start warming up really well
and<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.570> think<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.049> whole<00:02:01.170> garden<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.619> just

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
and I think the whole garden is just

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.010 
and I think the whole garden is just
going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> start<00:02:02.520> taking<00:02:02.729> off<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.240> there<00:02:03.899> are

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
going to start taking off but there are

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.859 
going to start taking off but there are
the<00:02:04.110> peace<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.649> far<00:02:04.920> doing<00:02:05.340> pretty<00:02:05.610> well<00:02:05.869> when

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the peace so far doing pretty well when

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.050 
the peace so far doing pretty well when
one<00:02:07.079> last<00:02:07.290> thing<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.619> don't<00:02:07.829> know<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.129> think<00:02:09.000> I

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
looks like it'll survive a nuclear

looks like it'll survive a nuclear
