governor drain the old oil and the
possible<00:00:25.090> metal<00:00:25.360> bits<00:00:25.509> that<00:00:25.599> we<00:00:25.719> got<00:00:25.840> in<00:00:25.960> there

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
possible metal bits that we got in there

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.310 
possible metal bits that we got in there
when<00:00:26.890> we<00:00:27.040> were<00:00:27.130> drilling<00:00:27.369> the<00:00:27.960> pulse<00:00:28.960> fitting

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
when we were drilling the pulse fitting

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.990 
when we were drilling the pulse fitting
for<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.500> fuel<00:00:29.710> pump<00:00:29.950> I'm<00:00:30.669> also<00:00:30.820> gonna

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
for the fuel pump I'm also gonna

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.569 
for the fuel pump I'm also gonna
investigate<00:00:31.360> bashing<00:00:32.079> this<00:00:32.230> through<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
investigate bashing this through the

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.630 
investigate bashing this through the
governor<00:00:33.910> control<00:00:34.270> arm<00:00:35.489> some<00:00:36.489> of<00:00:36.579> the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
governor control arm some of the

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.299 
governor control arm some of the
different<00:00:37.149> methods<00:00:37.210> available<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:39.010> pull<00:00:39.219> the

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
different methods available to pull the

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.279 
different methods available to pull the
governor<00:00:39.610> out<00:00:39.640> include<00:00:40.510> going<00:00:40.719> in<00:00:40.960> through

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
governor out include going in through

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.500 
governor out include going in through
the<00:00:41.469> crankcase<00:00:41.829> cover<00:00:41.890> and<00:00:42.399> just<00:00:42.579> manhandling

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
the crankcase cover and just manhandling

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.410 
the crankcase cover and just manhandling
the<00:00:43.829> gear<00:00:44.829> and<00:00:45.190> and<00:00:45.460> clip<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:46.030> trying<00:00:46.329> to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
the gear and and clip and trying to

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.479 
the gear and and clip and trying to
fight<00:00:46.600> it<00:00:46.719> out<00:00:46.809> but<00:00:47.800> one<00:00:48.039> of<00:00:48.069> the<00:00:48.190> easier

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
fight it out but one of the easier

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.860 
fight it out but one of the easier
methods<00:00:48.819> is<00:00:48.940> just<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.239> punch<00:00:49.510> it<00:00:49.690> out<00:00:49.780> from<00:00:50.649> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
methods is just to punch it out from the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.569 
methods is just to punch it out from the
from<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.960> flywheel<00:00:53.170> side<00:00:53.620> now<00:00:54.159> that's<00:00:54.489> just

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
from the flywheel side now that's just

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.889 
from the flywheel side now that's just
involved<00:00:54.940> using<00:00:55.059> a<00:00:55.239> hammer<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.569> a<00:00:55.600> punch<00:00:55.629> it

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
involved using a hammer and a punch it

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.509 
involved using a hammer and a punch it
apparently<00:00:56.229> comes<00:00:56.440> out<00:00:56.589> pretty<00:00:56.829> easy<00:00:57.159> so

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
apparently comes out pretty easy so

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.309 
apparently comes out pretty easy so
seems<00:00:58.239> like<00:00:58.300> it<00:00:58.479> might<00:00:58.629> be<00:00:58.929> a<00:00:58.960> little<00:00:59.109> bit

00:00:59.309 --> 00:00:59.319 
seems like it might be a little bit

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.290 
seems like it might be a little bit
extra<00:00:59.499> work<00:00:59.589> to<00:00:59.829> take<00:00:59.979> all<00:01:00.159> the<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.850> flywheel

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
extra work to take all the the flywheel

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.579 
extra work to take all the the flywheel
off<00:01:01.479> and<00:01:01.659> all<00:01:01.749> that<00:01:01.780> but<00:01:02.050> it's<00:01:02.319> a<00:01:02.409> fairly

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
off and all that but it's a fairly

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:03.779 
off and all that but it's a fairly
simple<00:01:02.800> task<00:01:03.069> and<00:01:03.339> that's<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.579> way<00:01:03.670> we're

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
simple task and that's the way we're

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.100 
simple task and that's the way we're
gonna<00:01:03.850> do<00:01:04.059> it<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:04.449> we<00:01:05.019> will<00:01:05.170> start<00:01:05.470> that<00:01:05.710> by

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
gonna do it so we will start that by

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:16.040 
gonna do it so we will start that by
using<00:01:08.110> our<00:01:08.290> 8<00:01:08.530> mil<00:01:08.710> wrench<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.400> take<00:01:15.700> the

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
using our 8 mil wrench and and take the

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:26.120 
using our 8 mil wrench and and take the
cover<00:01:17.050> off

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.280 

okay<00:01:27.130> now<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.850> shroud<00:01:28.480> is<00:01:28.690> actually<00:01:28.990> attached

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
okay now the shroud is actually attached

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.570 
okay now the shroud is actually attached
by<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:32.080> electrical<00:01:32.530> clip<00:01:32.740> for<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.040> kill

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
by the electrical clip for the kill

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:47.360 
by the electrical clip for the kill
switch<00:01:33.850> here<00:01:43.410> pull<00:01:44.410> those<00:01:44.560> connectors<00:01:44.980> off

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
wheel now these generally don't just

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.390 
wheel now these generally don't just
pull<00:02:39.700> off<00:02:39.910> sometimes<00:02:40.720> they<00:02:40.840> do<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:41.260> these<00:02:42.130> sit

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
pull off sometimes they do but these sit

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.340 
pull off sometimes they do but these sit
on<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.550> taper<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.240> they<00:02:43.660> are<00:02:43.810> essentially

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
on a taper that they are essentially

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.750 
on a taper that they are essentially
wedged<00:02:44.590> against<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.280> tightened<00:02:45.580> against

when<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.150> nut<00:02:46.390> goes<00:02:46.570> on<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.020> so<00:02:47.530> what<00:02:47.650> you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
when that nut goes on it so what you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.500 
when that nut goes on it so what you
need<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:47.890> do<00:02:48.720> actually<00:02:50.910> get<00:02:51.910> your<00:02:52.060> nut<00:02:52.239> back

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
need to do actually get your nut back

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.280 
need to do actually get your nut back
and<00:02:52.870> put<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.770> nut<00:02:54.720> onto<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.989> crankshaft

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
and put the nut onto the crankshaft

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.170 
and put the nut onto the crankshaft
throw<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.830> on<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> good<00:02:57.130> ways<00:02:57.310> but<00:02:57.640> not<00:02:57.790> all<00:02:58.030> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
throw it on a good ways but not all the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.090 
throw it on a good ways but not all the
way<00:02:58.209> so<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.870> knot<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.320> part<00:02:59.980> that's

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
way so that the knot is the part that's

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.460 
way so that the knot is the part that's
sticking<00:03:00.370> out<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.670> most<00:03:00.850> not<00:03:01.180> not<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.230> actual

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
sticking out the most not not the actual

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.820 
sticking out the most not not the actual
crankshaft<00:03:03.070> what<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:03.970> want<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.180> do<00:03:04.330> is<00:03:04.840> take<00:03:05.290> a

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
crankshaft what you want to do is take a

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.150 
crankshaft what you want to do is take a
large<00:03:06.340> slot<00:03:06.640> screwdriver<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.620> hammer<00:03:08.650> and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
large slot screwdriver and a hammer and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.910 
large slot screwdriver and a hammer and
simply<00:03:10.150> give<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.510> some<00:03:10.720> outward<00:03:11.110> pressure<00:03:11.350> so

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
simply give it some outward pressure so

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.640 
simply give it some outward pressure so
all<00:03:12.220> I'm<00:03:12.340> doing<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.670> not<00:03:12.820> much<00:03:13.200> just<00:03:14.200> just

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
all I'm doing is not much just just

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.970 
all I'm doing is not much just just
lightly<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:16.360> lightly<00:03:16.830> levering<00:03:17.830> the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
lightly just lightly levering the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.910 
lightly just lightly levering the
flywheel<00:03:18.400> away<00:03:18.820> from<00:03:19.290> from<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.410> from<00:03:20.830> the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
flywheel away from from the from the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:32.539 
flywheel away from from the from the
motor<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.340> then<00:03:21.400> I'm<00:03:21.550> just<00:03:21.640> going<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.850> tap

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.890 

alright<00:03:33.549> so<00:03:33.790> we've<00:03:33.970> removed<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.450> flywheel

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
alright so we've removed the flywheel

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.810 
alright so we've removed the flywheel
and<00:03:35.110> we've<00:03:35.620> exposed<00:03:35.980> what's<00:03:36.310> behind<00:03:36.489> it

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
and we've exposed what's behind it

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.430 
and we've exposed what's behind it
essentially<00:03:37.360> have<00:03:37.480> your<00:03:37.600> crankshaft<00:03:37.930> and

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
essentially have your crankshaft and

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.479 
essentially have your crankshaft and
your<00:03:39.420> your<00:03:40.420> key<00:03:40.720> here<00:03:41.200> you<00:03:42.040> don't<00:03:42.220> want<00:03:42.430> to

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
your your key here you don't want to

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.620 
your your key here you don't want to
lose<00:03:42.580> that<00:03:42.790> doesn't<00:03:43.090> seem<00:03:43.239> like<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:43.450> one

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
lose that doesn't seem like this one

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.850 
lose that doesn't seem like this one
easy<00:03:43.870> pops<00:03:44.080> out<00:03:44.230> so<00:03:44.320> I<00:03:44.410> think<00:03:44.500> don't<00:03:44.739> think

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
easy pops out so I think don't think

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.949 
easy pops out so I think don't think
it's<00:03:45.040> gonna<00:03:45.160> be<00:03:45.220> an<00:03:45.340> issue<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:46.090> then<00:03:46.330> here<00:03:46.780> is

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
it's gonna be an issue and then here is

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.690 
it's gonna be an issue and then here is
what<00:03:47.260> we're<00:03:47.380> after<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.860> this<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.340> shaft

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
what we're after and this is the shaft

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.300 
what we're after and this is the shaft
that<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.180> governor<00:03:49.480> gear<00:03:49.959> rides<00:03:50.260> on<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:51.190> I've

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
that the governor gear rides on so I've

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.560 
that the governor gear rides on so I've
just<00:03:51.430> got<00:03:51.579> a<00:03:51.610> little<00:03:51.850> punch<00:03:57.420> pretty<00:03:58.420> easy

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
just got a little punch pretty easy

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.810 
just got a little punch pretty easy
that's<00:03:59.110> done<00:04:01.860> all<00:04:02.860> right<00:04:02.920> so<00:04:03.250> I've<00:04:03.340> taken<00:04:03.579> a

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
that's done all right so I've taken a

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.550 
that's done all right so I've taken a
quarter<00:04:04.209> by<00:04:04.329> twenty<00:04:05.400> tap<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.940> I've<00:04:07.600> just

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
quarter by twenty tap and I've just

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.729 
quarter by twenty tap and I've just
simply<00:04:09.040> give<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.280> some<00:04:09.430> quick<00:04:09.670> threads<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.739> my

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
simply give it some quick threads and my

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.590 
simply give it some quick threads and my
quarter<00:04:12.130> by<00:04:12.220> twenty<00:04:12.519> goes<00:04:12.700> in<00:04:12.880> there<00:04:13.060> just

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
quarter by twenty goes in there just

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.199 
quarter by twenty goes in there just
beautifully<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:15.310> put<00:04:15.549> a<00:04:15.579> couple<00:04:15.730> wraps<00:04:16.060> of

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
beautifully just put a couple wraps of

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.690 
beautifully just put a couple wraps of
teflon<00:04:16.239> tape

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.040 

just<00:04:23.700> tighten<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.120> up<00:04:26.300> not<00:04:27.300> too<00:04:27.480> tight<00:04:27.750> just

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
just tighten it up not too tight just

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.930 
just tighten it up not too tight just
snug<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:29.280> want<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.490> make<00:04:29.580> sure<00:04:29.700> you're<00:04:29.850> not

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
snug you want to make sure you're not

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.340 
snug you want to make sure you're not
using<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.270> fitting<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:30.600> sticking<00:04:31.050> out<00:04:31.170> too

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
using a fitting that sticking out too

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.690 
using a fitting that sticking out too
much<00:04:31.470> it's<00:04:31.650> going<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.800> interfere<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.310> fly<00:04:32.490> well

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
much it's going to interfere to fly well

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.360 
much it's going to interfere to fly well
so<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.300> know<00:04:33.390> do<00:04:33.660> check<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:36.920> all<00:04:37.920> right<00:04:38.100> the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
so you know do check that all right the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.510 
so you know do check that all right the
next<00:04:38.520> step<00:04:38.730> is<00:04:39.210> going<00:04:39.420> to<00:04:39.540> be<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:40.340> drain<00:04:41.340> your

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
next step is going to be to drain your

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.150 
next step is going to be to drain your
oil<00:04:41.580> now<00:04:42.570> we<00:04:42.990> do<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.230> by<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.500> oil<00:04:43.800> drain

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
oil now we do that by the oil drain

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.250 
oil now we do that by the oil drain
screw<00:04:44.370> here<00:04:45.000> just<00:04:45.630> take<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.930> right<00:04:46.020> out<00:04:46.080> of

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
screw here just take it right out of

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.560 
screw here just take it right out of
there<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.620> let<00:04:47.130> it<00:04:47.160> dribble<00:04:47.520> down<00:04:47.700> after

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
there and let it dribble down after

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.910 
there and let it dribble down after
that's<00:04:48.690> done<00:04:48.960> we'll<00:04:49.200> get<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.440> crankcase

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
that's done we'll get the crankcase

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.670 
that's done we'll get the crankcase
cover<00:04:49.950> all<00:04:50.430> open<00:04:51.030> remove<00:04:51.960> all<00:04:52.110> our<00:04:52.140> metal<00:04:52.500> bits

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
cover all open remove all our metal bits

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.410 
cover all open remove all our metal bits
see<00:04:53.460> if<00:04:53.550> we<00:04:53.640> can<00:04:53.760> deal<00:04:53.880> with<00:04:53.910> that<00:04:54.090> governor

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
see if we can deal with that governor

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.580 
see if we can deal with that governor
arm<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:54.990> get<00:04:55.200> it<00:04:55.290> back<00:04:55.440> together<00:04:57.380> all<00:04:58.380> right

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
arm and get it back together all right

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.530 
arm and get it back together all right
so<00:04:59.280> our<00:04:59.310> oil<00:04:59.580> is<00:04:59.760> draining<00:05:00.030> away<00:05:00.300> there

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
so our oil is draining away there

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.540 
so our oil is draining away there
there's<00:05:00.990> only<00:05:01.020> 16<00:05:01.500> ounces<00:05:01.860> in<00:05:02.010> there<00:05:02.130> so<00:05:02.340> it

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
there's only 16 ounces in there so it

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.280 
there's only 16 ounces in there so it
won't<00:05:02.670> take<00:05:02.820> long<00:05:03.090> for<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.360> come<00:05:03.420> out<00:05:03.660> I'm

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
won't take long for it to come out I'm

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.530 
won't take long for it to come out I'm
just<00:05:04.380> gonna<00:05:04.590> leave<00:05:04.830> that<00:05:04.890> go<00:05:05.460> and<00:05:05.730> work<00:05:06.240> on<00:05:06.420> the

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
just gonna leave that go and work on the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.460 
just gonna leave that go and work on the
next<00:05:06.570> step<00:05:06.960> so<00:05:07.400> what<00:05:08.400> I'm<00:05:08.550> gonna<00:05:08.670> do<00:05:08.850> now<00:05:09.470> is

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
next step so what I'm gonna do now is

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.260 
next step so what I'm gonna do now is
remove<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:11.780> low<00:05:12.780> oil<00:05:13.310> sensor<00:05:14.310> arrangement

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
remove the low oil sensor arrangement

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.240 
remove the low oil sensor arrangement
and<00:05:15.450> that<00:05:16.230> region<00:05:16.470> also<00:05:16.740> comes<00:05:17.040> with<00:05:17.100> this

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
and that region also comes with this

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.070 
and that region also comes with this

shroud<00:05:19.410> now<00:05:20.370> for<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:20.790> actual<00:05:21.350> oil<00:05:22.850> sensor

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
shroud now for the actual oil sensor

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:31.040 
shroud now for the actual oil sensor
just<00:05:26.360> pull<00:05:27.360> out<00:05:27.800> now<00:05:29.480> for<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:30.540> oil<00:05:30.690> sensor

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
just pull out now for the oil sensor

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.420 
just pull out now for the oil sensor
itself<00:05:31.380> it<00:05:32.070> is<00:05:33.020> it<00:05:34.020> is<00:05:34.230> a<00:05:34.590> bolt<00:05:35.010> that's<00:05:35.250> bolted

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
itself it is it is a bolt that's bolted

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.890 
itself it is it is a bolt that's bolted
into<00:05:35.670> the<00:05:35.760> block<00:05:35.970> from<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.270> other<00:05:36.420> side<00:05:36.660> and

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
into the block from the other side and

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.090 
into the block from the other side and
then<00:05:36.990> tightened<00:05:37.380> up<00:05:37.440> on<00:05:37.620> this<00:05:37.710> side<00:05:37.890> with<00:05:38.070> a

then tightened up on this side with a

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.000 
then tightened up on this side with a
nut<00:05:38.370> so<00:05:38.910> it's<00:05:39.240> sealed<00:05:39.570> in<00:05:39.810> itself<00:05:40.200> so<00:05:40.890> I'm

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
nut so it's sealed in itself so I'm

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.120 
nut so it's sealed in itself so I'm
gonna<00:05:41.220> do<00:05:41.370> is<00:05:41.460> just<00:05:41.520> clip<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:42.030> wire<00:05:42.210> off<00:05:42.450> it

move this shroud in its entirety

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.800 
move this shroud in its entirety
now<00:05:50.040> you<00:05:51.000> don't<00:05:51.150> want<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.360> just<00:05:51.450> remove<00:05:51.660> the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
now you don't want to just remove the

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.100 
now you don't want to just remove the
shot<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:52.170> leave<00:05:52.290> it<00:05:53.360> this<00:05:54.360> shroud<00:05:54.720> is<00:05:54.960> an

shot and leave it this shroud is an

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.390 
shot and leave it this shroud is an
important<00:05:55.440> job<00:05:55.530> of<00:05:55.590> directing<00:05:56.100> that<00:05:56.280> airflow

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
important job of directing that airflow

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.220 
important job of directing that airflow
this<00:05:59.400> piece<00:05:59.640> is<00:05:59.940> actually<00:06:00.150> spot<00:06:00.690> welded<00:06:01.080> on

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
this piece is actually spot welded on

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:10.340 
this piece is actually spot welded on
there<00:06:02.360> interesting

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.629 

it's<00:06:11.350> gonna<00:06:11.440> rotate<00:06:11.710> it<00:06:12.040> back<00:06:12.190> and<00:06:12.400> forth

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
it's gonna rotate it back and forth

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.999 
it's gonna rotate it back and forth
until<00:06:12.820> it<00:06:12.970> comes<00:06:13.240> off<00:06:13.470> you<00:06:14.470> could<00:06:14.650> use<00:06:14.770> that<00:06:14.889> as

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
until it comes off you could use that as

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.960 
until it comes off you could use that as
a<00:06:15.040> point<00:06:15.280> of<00:06:15.960> straps
