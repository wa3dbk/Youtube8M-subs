00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.299
 my name is detlef dörner from the 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.230
 hanse agro we are here at the beginning of may 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.870
 invest hilly country of schleswig 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.840
 Holstein in a wheat was what I was 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.809
 these wheat here briefly at a glance 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.680
 Looks typically the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.880
 ask how to judge this wise 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.800
 especially if you are with the growth 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.449
 regulation make a decision 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.310
 would like to 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.050
 This is usually done 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.570
 by asking the ec judge that 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.300
 Let's try this one now 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:39.090
 a plant of straight with spade earth 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.440
 short off strike like a neat 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.239
 drove out of all this 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.719
 plant and if we go here to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.980
 example and then go so far the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.780
 take off old foliage and already here 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.219
 I do not have to feel knot 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.710
 outside can lead here is the first 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.270
 knots at this point and a second one 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.019
 I can not feel right yet 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.680
 is it more 31 90 32 you want the whole 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.330
 to judge more accurately 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:17.400
 , take the plant to another 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:19.140
 drove out but two stronger yet 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.560
 I also think about this commerce 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.509
 demonstrating cuts up here 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:33.060
 that and then tried it carefully 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:34.110
 cut vertically up to the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.070
 Base 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.480
 if a customs staff we can now 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.250
 measure and probably I show for now 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.820
 the honor of having your order here 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.280
 there that is still the way to us 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.280
 what her own time will he measure from there 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.180
 to the base then we see this 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.430
 here that there are three centimeters are the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.070
 So now just 3 cm lifted here 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.020
 that means it's a very good one 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.350
 stadium is now a cut 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.470
 for example, wtc mode or 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.530
 with noon top as the first cut or 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.280
 possibly also a second reduction 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.080
 to carry out a cpc measure 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.520
 I would like to know now when the wheat 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.959
 can be achieved at the next stadium 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.910
 I also go and can sometimes 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.720
 look as scroll with the on 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.280
 see you coming 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.190
 I already have the oldest leaf here 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.790
 taken off and now go back and forth 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.140
 role 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:39.030
 the remaining leaves carefully 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:42.930
 which is in the beginning a bit difficult and 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.940
 she must try something to turn her 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.600
 just not as good succeeds 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:54.870
 always so is the film 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:56.580
 then we'll find something to bring in here 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.200
 a sheet that was not that yet 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.590
 latest 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:06.780
 that can be seen here yes what is there 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.140
 that the next leaf is what you get 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.709
 have to look at this here what I am here 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.709
 still lose weight 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.209
 now here is the form the last one 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.239
 sheet 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:26.569
 that means we have the parish sheet here 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:29.180
 if we have the second leaf so f1 there 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.120
 and here the third remains 11 - two 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.129
 why is unrolled that means we 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.840
 get two more leaves up 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.510
 the banner sheet is so far out there 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.180
 each one stays with wheat needed about 90 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.310
 degree temperature so the total day 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.719
 mean values ​​added up to one 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.900
 unfold complete space 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:50.299
 So we need a total of 180 degrees 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.849
 until the Characteristics is pushed so far 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.310
 So take plenty of tips at ten 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.040
 in the evening Alan as a great medium at 8 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.470
 Clock sca always corresponds to the daily mean 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.780
 So that on, we sum the up to 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.090
 18 days with ten degrees or ten 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.859
 days with 18 degrees to the bike 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.689
 Reaching here would be called if we were 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.209
 as medium of 10 degrees for the next 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.019
 So we need 18 days to get up 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.239
 to the 20th 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:18.430
 that's betrayal and one more betrayal 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.430
 reduction or another case
