if people saw Cheerios as a treatment or

if people saw Cheerios as a treatment or
preventative<00:01:03.870> measure<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.470> high

preventative measure for high
cholesterol<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.489> personally<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.659> have

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
cholesterol I personally actually have

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.289 
cholesterol I personally actually have
naturally<00:01:07.470> high<00:01:07.650> cholesterol<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.909> eat

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
naturally high cholesterol so I do eat

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.350 
naturally high cholesterol so I do eat
out<00:01:09.570> products<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.770> include<00:01:11.090> Cheerios<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
out products and I include Cheerios I

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.500 
out products and I include Cheerios I
don't<00:01:12.540> rely<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.810> Cheerios

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
don't rely on Cheerios

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.940 
don't rely on Cheerios
exclusively<00:01:15.510> to<00:01:15.690> lower<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:16.080> cholesterol<00:01:16.110> it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
exclusively to lower my cholesterol it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.800 
exclusively to lower my cholesterol it
just<00:01:17.190> it<00:01:17.430> doesn't<00:01:17.670> happen<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.180> way<00:01:18.330> well<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
just it doesn't happen that way well I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.750 
just it doesn't happen that way well I
guess<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.500> consider<00:01:20.370> that<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.640> can

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
guess if you consider that you can

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.170 
guess if you consider that you can
either<00:01:20.880> eat<00:01:21.120> eggs<00:01:21.510> or<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.230> can<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.560> cheerios

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
either eat eggs or you can have cheerios

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.580 
either eat eggs or you can have cheerios
cheerios<00:01:24.180> makes<00:01:24.480> the<00:01:24.660> most<00:01:24.810> sense<00:01:24.930> because

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
cheerios makes the most sense because

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.250 
cheerios makes the most sense because
there's<00:01:26.160> less<00:01:26.730> of<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:27.660> negatives<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
there's less of all the negatives in it

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.650 
there's less of all the negatives in it
most<00:01:28.680> people<00:01:29.100> felt<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> FDA<00:01:29.880> charges<00:01:30.480> were<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
most people felt the FDA charges were a

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.780 
most people felt the FDA charges were a
little<00:01:30.930> off<00:01:31.170> base<00:01:31.440> I've<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.400> help<00:01:32.670> your

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
little off base I've really help your

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.850 
little off base I've really help your
cholesterol<00:01:33.060> go<00:01:33.450> down<00:01:33.690> although<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> always

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
cholesterol go down although I always

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.960 
cholesterol go down although I always
kind<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.400> thought<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.610> was<00:01:35.850> because

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
kind of thought that was because

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.520 
kind of thought that was because
hopefully<00:01:36.510> you<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:36.990> wouldn't<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.380> eating

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
hopefully you then wouldn't be eating

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.660 
hopefully you then wouldn't be eating
things<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.160> make<00:01:38.190> your<00:01:38.400> cholesterol

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
things that would make your cholesterol

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.040 
things that would make your cholesterol
go<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.270> no<00:01:40.220> not<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> drug<00:01:41.610> or<00:01:42.000> treatment<00:01:42.600> at<00:01:42.930> all

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
go up no not a drug or treatment at all

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.800 
go up no not a drug or treatment at all
I<00:01:43.410> see<00:01:43.830> it<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.160> potential<00:01:45.060> benefit<00:01:45.660> of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
I see it as a potential benefit of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.020 
I see it as a potential benefit of
eating<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.200> food<00:01:46.440> I<00:01:46.650> don't<00:01:46.890> look<00:01:47.670> at<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.880> as

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
eating the food I don't look at it as

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.570 
eating the food I don't look at it as

it's<00:02:02.970> absolutely<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.479> opposite<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> drug

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
it's absolutely the opposite of a drug

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
anything but a drug so I would buy it

anything but a drug so I would buy it
all<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.530> more<00:02:13.560> for<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.340> reason<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:15.240> don't<00:02:15.630> see

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
all the more for that reason I don't see

all the more for that reason I don't see

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
any reason I mean I'm 51 years old I've

any reason I mean I'm 51 years old I've

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
had cheerios at least for 49 years that

had cheerios at least for 49 years that
I<00:02:20.280> know<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.780> feel<00:02:22.019> relatively<00:02:22.530> healthy

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
I know of and I feel relatively healthy

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.740 
I know of and I feel relatively healthy
so<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.370> don't<00:02:23.610> think<00:02:23.760> they<00:02:24.000> would<00:02:24.120> work<00:02:24.360> against

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
so I don't think they would work against

so I don't think they would work against
