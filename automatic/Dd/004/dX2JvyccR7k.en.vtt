they<00:01:55.770> typically<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> seven<00:01:57.270> thousand

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
they typically do like a seven thousand

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.319 
they typically do like a seven thousand
five<00:01:58.290> thousand<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.040> three<00:01:59.490> thousand<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
five thousand and three thousand for the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.520 
five thousand and three thousand for the
rear<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.719> that's<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
rear and that's kind of like the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.830 
rear and that's kind of like the
starting<00:02:02.340> ground<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.909> most<00:02:03.119> most<00:02:03.600> eight

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
starting ground for most most eight

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.440 
starting ground for most most eight
scale<00:02:04.290> buggies<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:04.920> I've<00:02:05.549> decided<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.210> you

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
scale buggies but I've decided to you

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.779 
scale buggies but I've decided to you
know<00:02:06.600> do<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.770> Romans<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.369> set<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.729> up

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
know do as the Romans and set it up

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.170 
know do as the Romans and set it up
exactly<00:02:09.030> stock<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.310> techno<00:02:11.310> specifications

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
exactly stock to techno specifications

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.970 
exactly stock to techno specifications
so<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.420> did<00:02:12.629> all<00:02:12.780> three<00:02:13.290> diff<00:02:13.530> sin

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
so I did all three diff sin

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.250 
so I did all three diff sin
five<00:02:14.190> thousand<00:02:14.610> weight<00:02:14.700> oil<00:02:14.879> which<00:02:15.569> typically

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
five thousand weight oil which typically

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.229 
five thousand weight oil which typically
I<00:02:16.379> like<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.650> mark<00:02:17.129> my<00:02:17.489> differentials

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
I like to mark my differentials

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.899 
I like to mark my differentials
especially<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.840> front<00:02:19.049> and<00:02:19.200> rear<00:02:19.610> with<00:02:20.610> you

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
especially the front and rear with you

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.369 
especially the front and rear with you
know<00:02:21.030> whether<00:02:21.480> or<00:02:21.569> not<00:02:21.690> their<00:02:21.870> front<00:02:22.110> or<00:02:22.200> rear

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
know whether or not their front or rear

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.930 
know whether or not their front or rear
so<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.620> don't<00:02:22.799> mix<00:02:23.069> them<00:02:23.280> up<00:02:23.459> during<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
so I don't mix them up during the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.509 
so I don't mix them up during the
process<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.739> didn't<00:02:26.129> have<00:02:26.340> to

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
process but with this I didn't have to

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.339 
process but with this I didn't have to
mark<00:02:26.700> them<00:02:26.819> because<00:02:27.150> they're<00:02:27.330> all<00:02:27.540> 5000

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
mark them because they're all 5000

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.860 
mark them because they're all 5000
weight<00:02:28.440> oil<00:02:28.909> now<00:02:29.909> other<00:02:30.269> things<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.780> I've

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
weight oil now other things that I've

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.500 
weight oil now other things that I've
noticed<00:02:31.019> throughout<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.849> build<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
noticed throughout the the build the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.539 
noticed throughout the the build the
differentials<00:02:34.080> are<00:02:34.349> just<00:02:35.010> absolutely

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
differentials are just absolutely

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.240 
differentials are just absolutely
amazing<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.629> have<00:02:36.959> some<00:02:37.200> very<00:02:37.860> detailed

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
amazing and I have some very detailed

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.119 
amazing and I have some very detailed

the RC network all of the link in the
video<00:02:42.750> description<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.530> can<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.739> take<00:02:43.769> a

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
video description so you can can take a

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.190 
video description so you can can take a
look<00:02:44.129> but<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.909> mean<00:02:45.180> these<00:02:45.329> differentials<00:02:46.019> are

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
look but I mean these differentials are

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.270 
look but I mean these differentials are
absolutely<00:02:47.129> amazing<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.879> mean<00:02:48.239> no<00:02:48.959> expense<00:02:49.950> is

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
absolutely amazing I mean no expense is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.030 
absolutely amazing I mean no expense is
spared<00:02:50.959> for<00:02:51.959> building<00:02:52.349> these<00:02:52.500> things<00:02:52.739> and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
spared for building these things and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.860 
spared for building these things and
they've<00:02:53.519> done<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.700> really<00:02:53.790> good<00:02:54.209> job<00:02:54.269> of

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
they've done a really good job of

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.530 
they've done a really good job of
putting<00:02:55.349> in<00:02:56.010> very<00:02:56.340> good<00:02:56.670> materials<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.450> they

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
putting in very good materials and they

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.860 
putting in very good materials and they
just<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:57.900> they<00:02:58.140> spend<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.549> freely<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.569> I've

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
just so they spend so so freely and I've

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.530 
just so they spend so so freely and I've
got<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.170> say<00:03:01.379> that<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.799> know<00:03:01.920> God<00:03:02.730> even<00:03:03.390> with

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
got to say that you know God even with

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.569 
got to say that you know God even with
no<00:03:03.750> oil<00:03:03.780> on<00:03:04.290> them<00:03:04.470> they<00:03:04.859> were<00:03:04.920> just<00:03:05.010> spinning

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
no oil on them they were just spinning

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.319 
no oil on them they were just spinning
so<00:03:06.209> amazingly<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.260> anyways<00:03:08.099> very<00:03:08.670> very<00:03:09.120> nice

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
so amazingly so anyways very very nice

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.860 
so amazingly so anyways very very nice
differentials<00:03:10.079> from<00:03:10.500> techno<00:03:10.890> RC<00:03:11.720> now<00:03:12.720> in<00:03:12.810> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
differentials from techno RC now in the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.210 
differentials from techno RC now in the
rear<00:03:13.019> clip<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.349> was<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.650> first<00:03:13.859> clip<00:03:14.069> that

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
rear clip this was the first clip that

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.630 
rear clip this was the first clip that
you<00:03:14.310> build<00:03:14.579> in<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.569> build<00:03:16.379> series<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.010> you

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
you build in the build series and you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.640 
you build in the build series and you
know<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:18.000> course<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.389> have<00:03:18.599> that<00:03:18.630> very<00:03:19.200> tall

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
know of course you have that very tall

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.339 
know of course you have that very tall
rear<00:03:20.220> Tower<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:21.269> accommodate<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.900> longer

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
rear Tower to accommodate the longer

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
travel shocks on the 0.3 version very

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.330 
travel shocks on the 0.3 version very
tall<00:03:26.250> these<00:03:26.430> are<00:03:26.639> CNC<00:03:27.060> aluminum<00:03:28.190> kind<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.250> has

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
tall these are CNC aluminum kind of has

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.809 
tall these are CNC aluminum kind of has
that<00:03:29.370> stealth<00:03:29.910> gray<00:03:30.870> anodized<00:03:31.410> or<00:03:31.819> gunmetal

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
that stealth gray anodized or gunmetal

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.909 
that stealth gray anodized or gunmetal
gray<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.510> believe<00:03:34.169> that's<00:03:34.319> what<00:03:34.590> they<00:03:34.709> call

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
gray I believe that's what they call

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.920 
gray I believe that's what they call
them<00:03:35.099> now<00:03:35.280> all<00:03:35.819> of<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.150> points<00:03:36.510> for<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.750> hinge

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
them now all of the points for the hinge

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.809 
them now all of the points for the hinge
pins<00:03:37.169> are<00:03:37.319> all<00:03:37.530> upgraded<00:03:37.829> items<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:38.549> you<00:03:38.639> get

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
pins are all upgraded items so you get

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.589 
pins are all upgraded items so you get
all<00:03:39.829> CNC<00:03:40.829> machined<00:03:41.340> hinge<00:03:41.849> pin<00:03:42.060> holders<00:03:42.419> on

all CNC machined hinge pin holders on

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.050 
all CNC machined hinge pin holders on
all<00:03:42.840> four<00:03:43.169> points<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.799> contact<00:03:44.459> both<00:03:44.639> front

all four points of contact both front
and<00:03:45.180> rear<00:03:45.299> which<00:03:46.139> is<00:03:46.290> very<00:03:46.500> nice<00:03:46.730> turnbuckles

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
and rear which is very nice turnbuckles

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.949 
and rear which is very nice turnbuckles
I<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.569> know<00:03:48.690> there's<00:03:48.870> standard<00:03:49.290> techno

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
I you know there's standard techno

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.069 
I you know there's standard techno
turnbuckles

turnbuckles

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.039 
turnbuckles
same<00:03:52.410> ones<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.769> I<00:03:52.799> found<00:03:53.130> on<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.510> SCT<00:03:54.510> 410

same ones that I found on the SCT 410

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.599 
same ones that I found on the SCT 410
these<00:03:55.260> are<00:03:55.380> four<00:03:55.650> millimeter<00:03:56.040> turnbuckles

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
these are four millimeter turnbuckles

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.650 
these are four millimeter turnbuckles
with<00:03:57.000> very<00:03:57.359> very<00:03:57.720> large<00:03:59.060> kind<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.120> rod<00:04:00.359> ends

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
with very very large kind of rod ends

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.259 
with very very large kind of rod ends
here<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.169> not<00:04:02.040> my<00:04:02.220> favorite<00:04:02.669> turnbuckle<00:04:03.180> to

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
here and not my favorite turnbuckle to

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.030 
here and not my favorite turnbuckle to
build<00:04:03.450> they're<00:04:03.660> very<00:04:03.870> kind<00:04:04.169> of<00:04:04.260> cumbersome

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
build they're very kind of cumbersome

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.000

and<00:04:05.370> kind<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.239> tough<00:04:06.419> to<00:04:06.599> get<00:04:06.750> built<00:04:07.019> but<00:04:07.739> in

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
and kind of tough to get built but in

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.710 
and kind of tough to get built but in
the<00:04:08.220> end<00:04:08.340> I'm<00:04:08.790> sure<00:04:09.239> they're<00:04:09.419> going<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.599> be

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
the end I'm sure they're going to be

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.580 
the end I'm sure they're going to be
perfectly<00:04:10.260> fine

this<00:04:46.620> thing<00:04:46.770> outdoors<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:47.760> think<00:04:47.910> those

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
this thing outdoors so I think those

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.930 
this thing outdoors so I think those
will<00:04:48.390> help<00:04:48.540> just<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:49.050> little<00:04:49.290> bit<00:04:49.670> as<00:04:50.670> far<00:04:50.850> as

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
will help just a little bit as far as

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.670 
will help just a little bit as far as
the<00:04:51.030> front<00:04:51.210> clip<00:04:51.420> here<00:04:51.660> one<00:04:52.170> thing<00:04:52.290> I<00:04:52.350> noticed

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
the front clip here one thing I noticed

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.900 
the front clip here one thing I noticed
that<00:04:52.980> was<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:53.130> little<00:04:53.340> bit<00:04:53.520> different<00:04:53.760> on<00:04:53.790> the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
that was a little bit different on the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.480 
that was a little bit different on the
front<00:04:54.120> clip<00:04:54.270> is<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.780> angle<00:04:55.440> of<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.980> outdrive

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
front clip is the angle of the outdrive

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.280 
front clip is the angle of the outdrive
coming<00:04:56.850> out<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.390> differential<00:04:57.840> this<00:04:58.110> one

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
coming out of the differential this one

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.100 
coming out of the differential this one
swept<00:04:58.680> up<00:04:58.920> just<00:04:59.310> slightly<00:04:59.610> more<00:04:59.970> so<00:05:00.660> than<00:05:00.960> the

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
swept up just slightly more so than the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.110 
swept up just slightly more so than the
rear<00:05:01.290> rear<00:05:01.919> is<00:05:02.040> almost<00:05:02.340> parallel<00:05:02.640> with<00:05:03.030> the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
rear rear is almost parallel with the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.030 
rear rear is almost parallel with the
ground<00:05:03.300> so<00:05:03.780> a<00:05:03.990> little<00:05:04.440> bit<00:05:04.560> of<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.710> difference

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
ground so a little bit of a difference

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.350 
ground so a little bit of a difference
there<00:05:05.100> it's<00:05:05.340> kind<00:05:05.490> of<00:05:05.520> hard<00:05:05.700> to<00:05:05.730> see<00:05:05.940> here<00:05:06.180> with

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
there it's kind of hard to see here with

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.390 
there it's kind of hard to see here with
the<00:05:06.510> steering<00:05:06.870> rack<00:05:06.990> installed<00:05:07.440> I've<00:05:08.130> kind<00:05:08.370> of

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
the steering rack installed I've kind of

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.610 
the steering rack installed I've kind of
built<00:05:08.640> a<00:05:08.940> little<00:05:09.419> more<00:05:09.600> than<00:05:09.750> half<00:05:10.020> of<00:05:10.290> the

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
built a little more than half of the

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.980 
built a little more than half of the
bags<00:05:10.919> worth<00:05:11.430> of<00:05:11.760> parts<00:05:12.180> on<00:05:12.360> this<00:05:12.480> thing<00:05:12.540> and

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
bags worth of parts on this thing and

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.010 
bags worth of parts on this thing and
you<00:05:13.860> know<00:05:13.980> you<00:05:14.490> know<00:05:14.610> as<00:05:14.820> far<00:05:15.000> as<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.150> parts<00:05:15.900> on

you know you know as far as the parts on

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.200 
you know you know as far as the parts on
the<00:05:16.110> front<00:05:16.380> very<00:05:17.100> similar<00:05:17.460> to<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.669> rear<00:05:17.880> you

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
the front very similar to the rear you

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.760 
the front very similar to the rear you
do<00:05:18.360> have<00:05:18.540> a<00:05:18.570> smaller<00:05:19.080> or<00:05:19.700> stock<00:05:20.700> size<00:05:21.560> sway<00:05:22.560> bar

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
do have a smaller or stock size sway bar

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.520 
do have a smaller or stock size sway bar
here<00:05:23.070> where<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.730> rear<00:05:24.030> actually<00:05:24.990> swept<00:05:25.350> all

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
here where the rear actually swept all

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.100 
here where the rear actually swept all
the<00:05:25.950> way<00:05:26.070> around<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.970> all<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.750> way<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.870> the

the way around and all the way to the

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.360 
the way around and all the way to the
front<00:05:28.350> I<00:05:28.500> mean<00:05:28.530> you<00:05:28.680> can<00:05:28.800> kind<00:05:29.010> of<00:05:29.040> see<00:05:29.220> it's

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
front I mean you can kind of see it's

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.850 
front I mean you can kind of see it's
almost<00:05:29.550> like<00:05:29.790> a<00:05:29.990> six-inch<00:05:30.990> or<00:05:31.200> almost<00:05:31.470> seven

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
almost like a six-inch or almost seven

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
inch wide sway bar for the rear just to

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.550 
inch wide sway bar for the rear just to
get<00:05:35.190> it<00:05:35.340> more<00:05:35.729> onto<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.240> end<00:05:36.479> points<00:05:37.110> of<00:05:37.260> the

how they kind of mark the sway bars here

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.880 
how they kind of mark the sway bars here
with<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.419> weight<00:06:06.840> that<00:06:07.290> they<00:06:07.440> are<00:06:07.590> oh<00:06:07.620> I<00:06:07.770> think

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
with the weight that they are oh I think

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.219 
with the weight that they are oh I think
this<00:06:08.130> one<00:06:08.310> says<00:06:08.490> two<00:06:08.760> point<00:06:09.030> four<00:06:09.390> millimeters

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
this one says two point four millimeters

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.120 
this one says two point four millimeters
so<00:06:10.850> might<00:06:11.850> be<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.090> thickness<00:06:12.570> as<00:06:12.720> well<00:06:13.130> but

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
so might be the thickness as well but

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.250 
so might be the thickness as well but
all<00:06:14.340> in<00:06:14.460> all<00:06:14.580> really<00:06:15.240> really<00:06:15.690> nice<00:06:15.900> here<00:06:16.169> you

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
very very nice and I think I have a

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.649 
very very nice and I think I have a
little<00:06:52.889> bit<00:06:53.099> of<00:06:53.750> misalignment<00:06:54.750> here<00:06:55.259> of<00:06:55.470> that

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:56.659 
little bit of misalignment here of that

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:58.730 
little bit of misalignment here of that
top<00:06:57.659> plate<00:06:57.810> that<00:06:57.990> I<00:06:58.050> don't<00:06:58.199> have<00:06:58.259> to<00:06:58.379> take<00:06:58.680> a

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
top plate that I don't have to take a

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.360 
top plate that I don't have to take a
look<00:06:59.009> at<00:06:59.099> that

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
look at that

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.010 
look at that
maybe<00:06:59.550> it's<00:06:59.729> upside<00:07:00.000> down<00:07:00.030> I'll<00:07:00.599> have<00:07:00.900> to

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
maybe it's upside down I'll have to

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.230 
maybe it's upside down I'll have to
check<00:07:01.229> it<00:07:01.349> out<00:07:01.470> anyways<00:07:02.009> that'll<00:07:02.699> be<00:07:02.819> for<00:07:03.060> her

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
check it out anyways that'll be for her

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.149 
check it out anyways that'll be for her
a<00:07:03.449> future<00:07:03.930> update<00:07:04.229> maybe<00:07:04.650> I<00:07:04.770> did<00:07:04.949> do<00:07:05.099> that

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:05.159 
a future update maybe I did do that

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.879 
a future update maybe I did do that
backwards<00:07:05.599> I'll<00:07:06.599> have<00:07:06.750> to<00:07:06.840> find<00:07:07.020> out<00:07:07.139> anyways

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:07.889 
backwards I'll have to find out anyways

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:09.980 
backwards I'll have to find out anyways
a<00:07:07.919> body<00:07:08.520> mount<00:07:08.759> here<00:07:09.060> body<00:07:09.449> mount<00:07:09.690> in<00:07:09.750> the<00:07:09.810> rear

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
a body mount here body mount in the rear

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.800 
a body mount here body mount in the rear
that's<00:07:10.199> for<00:07:10.470> the<00:07:10.620> included<00:07:11.340> buggy<00:07:11.819> body<00:07:12.240> and

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
that's for the included buggy body and

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.499 
that's for the included buggy body and
that's<00:07:13.770> basically<00:07:14.220> it<00:07:14.460> so<00:07:14.970> I<00:07:15.180> thought<00:07:15.419> this

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:15.509 
that's basically it so I thought this

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:18.379 
that's basically it so I thought this
was<00:07:15.690> a<00:07:15.780> good<00:07:15.930> stopping<00:07:16.409> point<00:07:16.800> here<00:07:17.159> on<00:07:17.370> I<00:07:17.940> just

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:18.389 
was a good stopping point here on I just

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.790 
was a good stopping point here on I just
unpackaged<00:07:19.110> the<00:07:19.759> upgraded<00:07:21.319> hard<00:07:22.319> anodized

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800

barri<00:07:25.560> to<00:07:25.740> mount<00:07:25.919> that<00:07:25.949> up<00:07:26.220> and<00:07:26.460> I<00:07:26.490> think<00:07:27.120> at

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
barri to mount that up and I think at

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.040 
barri to mount that up and I think at
that<00:07:27.330> point<00:07:27.479> if<00:07:28.020> I<00:07:29.150> didn't<00:07:30.150> stop<00:07:30.389> now<00:07:30.599> I<00:07:30.630> wasn't

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050 
that point if I didn't stop now I wasn't

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.529 
that point if I didn't stop now I wasn't
gonna<00:07:31.380> stop<00:07:31.710> until<00:07:31.979> the<00:07:32.219> end<00:07:32.400> so<00:07:32.789> I<00:07:33.090> wanted<00:07:33.479> to

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 
gonna stop until the end so I wanted to
