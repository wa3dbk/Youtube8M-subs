 sour cream with fresh fruit with 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.340
 beans because they do not come out delicious and 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.890
 the first thing we have is easy 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.000
 to do is peel the pope here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.949
 I already have water so it does not rust 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.320
 we take a grater and we're going to start 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.739
 grate the largest building or 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.400
 this way we're going to grate all the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.640
 potato this recipe is approximately for 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.690
 four people so he's going to give us 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.310
 much is economical is quick to do and 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.729
 You'll see how they like it because it's 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.650
 very crispy a potato at the time of 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.780
 frying it should look good with people and 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.540
 that has very easily I will give them 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.340
 a tip a tip on how to do it 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.070
 then when you imagine that 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.800
 let's go all the potato 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.710
 what we are going to do is put the potato in 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.030
 a colander 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.150
 in this way 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.630
 yes and I'm going to take a bowl so that 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.259
 do not run, let's go to the water area 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.860
 to be able to wash it is very important 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.680
 this process perfectly wash the potato 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.229
 because that way we're going to withdraw all the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.610
 starch and that's going to allow it to be done 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.050
 a crunchy potato at the time of frying 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.170
 so we're doing very well 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:08.320
 for how long until the water does not 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.880
 come out completely translucent then 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.190
 we work we wash the papaya is 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.980
 translucent and the water is also 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.930
 transparent so it's already perfect 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.840
 we shake very well that they have nothing of 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.420
 water we can press a bit with 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.209
 our hand 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.760
 The truth is that hands are good 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:36.060
 useful utensil 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.680
 is used in the kitchen more I think 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.370
 useful when it comes to questions 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.340
 working not in the kitchen so good 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.819
 we already have the well dried potato pressed what 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.159
 last one that can not be left any water 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.980
 in fact you can dry it with a 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.340
 little bit of paper then I withdraw the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.640
 excess 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:04.550
 ready I put the potato in the bowl 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.550
 If I'm going to clean my hands a little 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.590
 there is what we are going to do now is 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.370
 add the egg is an egg we are going to 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.040
 Beat a little before you do not know how rich 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.130
 that these pancakes are left and they are good 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.220
 easy and you're doing we're going to put the 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.340
 flour 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.320
 is the chive is to give it a 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.950
 little bit of color and a little bit of flavor 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.710
 If you do not have chives, you can 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.480
 cambrai onion that also remains 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.830
 delicious so you can put it 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.450
 red pepper jalapeÃ±o chili 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.670
 you can also put it and it would be 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.440
 delicious then let's put a little 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.140
 of salt 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.150
 freshly ground pepper and I already have a 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.590
 hot pan where are we going to make the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.030
 rich pancakes we are going to put oil 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.630
 we distribute very well so that we are not 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.800
 go to paste and then what I'm going to 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:10.610
 to make is to form the rich pancakes of 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:16.519
 potatoes and egg you already saw how easy it is 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:19.220
 do we are going to continue forming the and 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.079
 I hope he really does that he does not 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.890
 they take away so much time from the potato 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:28.670
 grated send before and have it in water 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:31.850
 easily then we form it very well 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:35.240
 and we wait for them to brown then nothing 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.320
 more is a matter of a few seconds for 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.320

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.200

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:55.729
