00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.999 
headphone jack is it's always covered
and<00:01:32.009> I'm<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.990> good<00:01:34.200> circular<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.950> if

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
and I'm so that it's good circular so if

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.850 
and I'm so that it's good circular so if
you're<00:01:35.190> talking<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.380> outside<00:01:37.380> talking

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
outside in the rain and it's going to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.270 
outside in the rain and it's going to
protect<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.540> from<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.990> maybe<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.770> raindrop

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280

protect it from a maybe like a raindrop
or<00:01:44.640> something<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.180> again<00:01:45.680> so<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:47.369> one<00:01:47.700> good

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509

and on the back this is one problem in a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.570 
and on the back this is one problem in a
kind<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.780> experience<00:02:48.380> when<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.070> take<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> photo

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
kind of experience when you take a photo

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.970 
kind of experience when you take a photo
with<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.880> camera<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.780> have<00:02:50.900> flash<00:02:51.140> on<00:02:51.470> it

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
with the camera and you have flash on it

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.750 
with the camera and you have flash on it
sometimes<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.640> does<00:02:52.820> reflect<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:54.280> flash<00:02:55.280> into

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
sometimes it does reflect the flash into

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.070 
sometimes it does reflect the flash into
the<00:02:55.880> photo<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.240> it<00:02:56.420> does<00:02:56.570> make<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.900> look<00:02:57.050> a

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
the photo so it does make it look a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.160 
the photo so it does make it look a
little<00:02:57.230> bit<00:02:57.470> weird<00:02:57.710> but<00:02:58.330> so<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.540> only<00:02:59.720> saw<00:02:59.960> get

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
little bit weird but so I only saw get

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.640 
little bit weird but so I only saw get
in<00:03:00.230> some<00:03:00.470> cases<00:03:00.740> that<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.340> saw<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.810> when<00:03:03.590> I

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
in some cases that I saw it and when I

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.280 
in some cases that I saw it and when I
wasn't<00:03:03.830> like<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.130> really<00:03:04.340> dark<00:03:04.670> place<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:05.290> tried

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
wasn't like a really dark place I tried

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.640 
wasn't like a really dark place I tried
taking<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.710> photo<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.610> occurred<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.330> I

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
taking the photo and it occurred so I

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.380 
taking the photo and it occurred so I
don't<00:03:09.650> know<00:03:09.740> and<00:03:10.430> that's<00:03:10.820> going<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.060> happen

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
don't know and that's going to happen

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.060 
don't know and that's going to happen
with<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:11.840> guys<00:03:12.050> or<00:03:12.260> maybe<00:03:12.410> they<00:03:12.620> change<00:03:12.860> to

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
with you guys or maybe they change to

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.890 
with you guys or maybe they change to
cut<00:03:13.250> out<00:03:13.400> this<00:03:13.820> will<00:03:14.030> offer<00:03:14.240> a<00:03:14.480> lot<00:03:14.780> of

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
cut out this will offer a lot of

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.980 
cut out this will offer a lot of
protection<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.620> bone<00:03:15.860> because<00:03:16.310> up<00:03:16.490> the

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
protection to the bone because up the

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.949 
protection to the bone because up the
silicone<00:03:17.990> kind<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.130> cover<00:03:19.510> rubberized<00:03:20.510> cover

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
silicone kind of cover rubberized cover

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.690 
silicone kind of cover rubberized cover
over<00:03:21.200> here<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.890> then<00:03:22.100> on<00:03:22.190> top<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.490> you

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
over here and then on top of that you

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.180 
over here and then on top of that you
have<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:22.880> hard<00:03:23.120> case<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:24.110> if<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.350> drop<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.830> you

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
have a hard case so if you drop it you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.180 
have a hard case so if you drop it you
don't<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.489> worry<00:03:25.700> about<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.180> getting

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
don't to worry about it getting

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.880 
don't to worry about it getting
scratched<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:29.180> that's<00:03:30.080> one<00:03:30.500> really<00:03:30.739> good

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
scratched so that's one really good

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.590 
scratched so that's one really good
feature<00:03:31.160> about<00:03:31.459> this<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.910> one<00:03:32.209> thing<00:03:32.510> I

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
feature about this and one thing I

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.479 
feature about this and one thing I
didn't<00:03:32.780> notice<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.440> can<00:03:33.620> see<00:03:33.800> in<00:03:34.160> the

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
didn't notice is that you can see in the

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.070 
didn't notice is that you can see in the
background<00:03:34.520> it<00:03:35.180> does<00:03:35.450> get<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.780> few

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
background it does get a few

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.620 
background it does get a few
fingerprints<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:36.890> that's<00:03:37.640> one<00:03:38.090> thing<00:03:38.330> that<00:03:38.390> I

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
fingerprints so that's one thing that I

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.600 
fingerprints so that's one thing that I
really<00:03:38.810> did<00:03:39.050> not<00:03:39.080> like<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:39.500> know<00:03:39.920> if<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:40.310> kind
