made<00:05:54.379> a<00:05:54.409> lot<00:05:54.649> sharper<00:05:54.949> and<00:05:55.550> I'm<00:05:55.669> surprised

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:56.149 
made a lot sharper and I'm surprised

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:57.309 
made a lot sharper and I'm surprised
that<00:05:56.389> she's<00:05:56.629> been<00:05:56.779> going<00:05:57.019> by<00:05:57.169> on<00:05:57.289> the

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
that she's been going by on the

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:58.659 
that she's been going by on the
left-hand<00:05:57.739> lane<00:05:57.919> Marshall<00:05:58.339> and<00:05:58.459> I<00:05:58.489> thought

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
left-hand lane Marshall and I thought

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.549 
left-hand lane Marshall and I thought
she'd<00:05:58.879> just<00:05:59.059> go<00:05:59.179> with<00:05:59.329> the<00:05:59.479> bullet<00:06:00.079> ball<00:06:00.259> she

00:06:00.549 --> 00:06:00.559 
she'd just go with the bullet ball she

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:01.809 
she'd just go with the bullet ball she
couldn't<00:06:00.769> happen<00:06:00.860> up<00:06:01.099> another<00:06:01.309> mile<00:06:01.550> and<00:06:01.579> I

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:01.819 
couldn't happen up another mile and I

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.329 
couldn't happen up another mile and I
make<00:06:02.179> it<00:06:02.300> set<00:06:02.509> up<00:06:02.659> well<00:06:03.079> I<00:06:03.110> think<00:06:03.259> you<00:06:03.709> know<00:06:03.829> we

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:04.339 
make it set up well I think you know we

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:06.519 
make it set up well I think you know we
saw<00:06:04.519> earlier<00:06:04.939> where<00:06:05.360> someone<00:06:05.959> went<00:06:06.169> light<00:06:06.379> on

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:06.529

one<00:06:06.709> lane<00:06:06.919> and<00:06:07.099> then<00:06:07.279> made<00:06:07.849> the<00:06:07.879> adjustment<00:06:08.389> on

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
one lane and then made the adjustment on
