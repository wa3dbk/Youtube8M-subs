00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi everyone amazed 100 case I hope that 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.790
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.390
 nickel 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.160
 today I am really very 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.620
 glad to be able to offer you a mini 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.420
 games related to the next dlc and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.120
 the winners will receive a card sharks 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.039
 so 2 3 million 500 thousand dollars on 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.320
 gta like online to be able precisely 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.270
 enjoy this next dlc 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.380
 so you'll see the goal of the game is 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.840
 quite simple 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.150
 so when rockstar announced the dlc they 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.250
 shared eight images we cut in 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.470
 two actually to do two parts the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.809
 part 1 with four images and the part 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.790
 2 with four pictures story to have 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.500
 two winners so two winners who 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.500
 will receive 3 million 500 thousand dollars 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.000
 on gta then so the purpose of the game as 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.129
 I say it is really very very 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.440
 simple so there will be two parts you 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.030
 can participate in both parts and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.860
 in fact in every part will 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.710
 guess the price of the four vehicles 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.030
 that there is in this in this part for 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.820
 look in the first part there 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.670
 will have to discover the price of the vÃ©ro 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.289
 coquettish blackfield ok just here next 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.750
 it will also find the price to 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.400
 my opinion that is going to be quite high of the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.260
 wonderful vinckier tea program 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.520
 justice look at it frankly she is 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.700
 really very very beautiful and she 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.590
 looks a little like osiris then 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.049
 third image will have to discover the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.570
 pre of the American fist that will be soon 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.540
 available to ammunition and for this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.369
 part 1 we will finish on the dinka vindy 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.939
 quator so the tmax we'll say between 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.939
 parentheses 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.369
 we will have to find the nearest price 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.590
 of these vehicles to be able to win 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.299
 this beautiful charter map so 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.950
 look in the east in the description 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.420
 I already marked you a little 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.439
 type comment for not that you have 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.049
 everything to mark that everything is fine 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.310
 prepared and clearly clear you copy paste 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.259
 what I put you in so 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.450
 descriptions in comments and you 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.979
 add your prices next to the name of the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.140
 vehicle you cross your fingers for 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.509
 win and then so soon as the dlc 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.880
 will bring out the people who will be the most 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.810
 close to vehicle prices will win 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.329
 the pulpit map 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.460
 so that was for part 1 and for 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.590
 the part ii will have to guess the price of the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.960
 remains of vehicles and weapons for 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.460
 the part of one will have the hammer arm or 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.039
 their right here will be 2 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 and its price we will also have the man beats 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.750
 dati toro so the boat that will be there I 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.220
 think pretty expensive then it will also take 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.800
 so guess the price of the marksman 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.930
 serious gun and so watch them 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.110
 engravings been quite expensive so take in 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.270
 count and then we will end up on sweat 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.130
 chino lavapies so there is justice there 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.440
 to watch is the little one 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.680
 vehicle there to the riders thinking and thinking 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.870
 the portion of the vehicle low dlc 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.640
 rider who came out in the industrial part 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.769
 in the possession of the dlc crime pays 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.230
 was not that expensive so 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.120
 think of it for this one so here 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.440
 how is the game going to be there will be 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.810
 in the description as I wanted 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.970
 already said a prefabricated comment on 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.650
 will say predefined the boulch ok school is 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.720
 so part 1 part 2 I'll put you 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.030
 the names of the vehicles and next to you but 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.610
 you will give me the price you 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.630
 think they'll be his vehicles 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.250
 sorry if it's not very clear I 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.870
 tried to explain that the best possible 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.040
 at the same time the game is not very 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.989
 complicated so I hope that all the 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.430
 world will have understood me I wanted it 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.890
 on these images I tell you good luck 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.940
 everyone is a little game when I saw 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.910
 in the comments that everyone 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.590
 was starting to say then that this was 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.360
 what's this name yet that the prog been vain 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.860
 would be pretty expensive everyone has 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.329
 started trying to guess a little the 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.670
 price I told myself why not launch 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.040
 a little game and allow two 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.799
 people to get well for this for 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.120
 this part 2 and that's so we come to 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.100
 the end of this video I really hope 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.630
 that this mini games will please you 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.890
 not let go a little blue thumb if it's 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.930
 the case it will make me really happy 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.340
 and do not forget to share the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.320
 video is the only small point for 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.670
 participate in this mini game at least in 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.799
 At the same time, it may allow your 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.660
 peeps to be aware of and power 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.670
 they also won 3 million 500 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.470
 thousand dollars to get well for 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.100
 part 2 of the dlc that will arrive 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.780
