00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.790
 and mines today we are here in micros for 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.620
 see my desk better said for 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.130
 see the new launcher we have from 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 minecraft yes good now with the new 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.949
 11.6 wide with new launcher that is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.750
 this one I have 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.670
 two because good and I also have the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.369
 ancient that was this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.019
 everyone will remember that it exists and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.910
 now we have the new one that is this one 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.460
 You can download it from the page 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.710
 moyano or mimic dot net and how 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.210
 works well this launcher I have to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.000
 to say that I love it is a true 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.680
 passed and they pay us very shares 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.480
 interesting and ccoo explain first if 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 at the beginning of the day let's finish lohan 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.200
 it's quite interesting we have here 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.760
 a console for people who 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 we develop all this we can see what 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.350
 that is loaded from minecraft an editor of 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.420
 profile that I will explain and this is how 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.829
 it is downloaded and it is here they are 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.329
 the notes are those that always put us 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.480
 the latest updates and all that 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.480
 OK 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.800
 how it works most surely 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.230
 interesting is that we have the profiles 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.350
 It's worth now I have a profile 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.150
 vanilla in brackets and to avoid it 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.550
 we leave here okay and I'll explain if 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.650
 now later and we're going to give it a new 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.010
 profile here we can choose the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.280
 profile for example you can call it 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.680
 for example álex proved to check the 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.780
 mods because I'm interested in this profile 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.720
 be for the box it is worth saying when I go to 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.280
 record a lot can use it worth what 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.470
 options we have here first we have the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.300
 of gámez director and we can change the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.130
 victory and minecraft this never before 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.560
 I had made a point of saying, by default, 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.910
 in the main point folder here and I do not 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.300
 I think I'm installing this folder I think 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.130
 that this point minecraft mods is worth osea 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.680
 lauro another folder called punto 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.120
 minecraft mods is worth then one is to choose 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.900
 the minecraft version from the 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.990
 paralysis 1.5 up to the uba until the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.420
 1.6 snapshot for how it did not come out in a 1.6 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.860
 justine the bitch ellis that will come out the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.260
 Monday or no points and there is no 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.350
 problem we also have the resolution 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.990
 of the game is to say I am I see it 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.070
 deactivate because they serve to make us 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.990
 that the game is not big is to say 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.450
 ready then for some youtuber case 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.459
 some direct we have like this can not be 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.380
 pretty useful to put a quality of the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.870
 game and that does not change or enlarge or 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.080
 reducing the screen is worth 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.640
 we have these here to change the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.250
 java directory gave them we do not have 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.200
 java installed and that does interest me 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.549
 this is to dedicate more branch to the game 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.980
 default voucher is dedicated in giga 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.080
 but since I am 16 then I can 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.269
 dedicate for example three gigabytes 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.489
 ok and this way then we dedicate gigas 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.709
 more in this case then I'm going to more 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.140
 modes and we will be see profile is worth and 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.790
 here we get the last one thing too 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.400
 quite useful is that it is saved in the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.220
 password is to say here in the of 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.709
 vanilla I do not get this and in the mods 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.470
 will ask me what you arm and users for 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.090
 first time is also worth a thing 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.099
 so useful before here tells us if the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.379
 login is offline or is the servers 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.780
 of moyano and the multiplayer that is to say 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.400
 If the skin is going to serve us, the lobby 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.069
 is going to fail this goes sometimes fall and all 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.730
 that I'm going to achieve I'm going to cover this 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.730
 so you do not see it 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.790
 ok and we give to play and it will be achieved 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.010
 start like this everything starts downloading 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.980
 here the files and he will tell us here that 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.620
 it says here 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.329
 you can close this launcher because the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.609
 'Juan started by saying this and will know 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.620
 and we are in the game it is worth as we see 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.720
 see everything completely new we have 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.329
 are about to mark new and I'm going to 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.810
 create a world quickly 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:49.209
 while I'm going to apta is because 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.620
 is supposed to be dressed in a new 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.710
 folder called 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.660
 minecraft mods and this is where this 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.730
 manga was just launched I dance 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.200
 we have the main concert life and 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.450
 american mods in this way that we can 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.040
 do for example if we have several 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.620
 series of this position of the series su 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.960
 rival a creative one but a few of mods 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.000
 and one more thing for creative then 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.890
 we have 33 profiles in each folder 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.780
 different one single mod 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.190
 a manila this way we can 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.140
 distribute the point folders better 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.570
 magic without having to change the and 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.060
 moving the vouchers as we can see in 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.880
 this delicate more ram and up if it goes 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.860
 link the east we can see that it puts jope 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.930
 leave the achievement of seeing topics already worth I will 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.860
 enlarge this as how to put 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.460
 above 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.960
 here puts them 27 puts 2000 30 mb is 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.790
 say that we have devoted much more branch 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.790
 from minecraft that can be useful for the 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.170
 pretty bad senator and that we have 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.880
 to get more minecraft branch or 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.010
 directly also for the people 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.660
 that has a great super powerful is 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.280
 playing with a lot in mochi that with a 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.650
 gigabyte goes wrong and want to put on 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.720
 example 4 or people who are recording and not 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.710
 wanted nothing of chili gets you 10 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.570
 but that also depends on our 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.040
 good computer that's the new launcher 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.390
 for minecraft I do not know if for the version 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.340
 official is going to change a bit but 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.500
 surely it will be like this or maybe 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.900
 add a little color but in general 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.980
 it's pretty good to decide the appearance 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.210
 it may be a bit bad you can 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.130
 improve but that in general is very 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.660
 well what of the profiles with created as 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.700
 I repeat another new profile and more what 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.010
 example series changes the directory of the 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.410
 game resolution the ram and it's pretty 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.900
 well I like this we also have to play 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.790
 the offline mode that is for the for not 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.750
 log in and get into online mode of 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.090
 this way we can get in 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.550
 servers and well this is the wide me 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.980
 I have the official, that is, for those who are 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.350
 no premium is not a boat or some 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.780
 hacker I do it hacked it but not 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.370
 I am a problem since I am I am premium and 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.890
 I do not want to get into this kind of thing 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.200
 of pirate so I'm really sorry if I do not 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.210
 you have this launcher or you have another one but 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.070
 well I hope that I institute and remember 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.700
