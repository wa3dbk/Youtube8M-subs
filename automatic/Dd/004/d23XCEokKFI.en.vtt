break<00:03:21.049> into<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.319> industry<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:22.069> I<00:03:22.130> think

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
break into the industry so I think

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.180 
break into the industry so I think
that's<00:03:22.459> also<00:03:22.670> great<00:03:22.970> because<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:23.420> value<00:03:23.900> all<00:03:24.350> of
