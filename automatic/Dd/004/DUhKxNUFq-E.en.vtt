of<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.470> sudden<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.920> for<00:02:20.610> me<00:02:20.760> I'm<00:02:21.560> obviously

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
of a sudden like for me I'm obviously

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.440 
of a sudden like for me I'm obviously
not<00:02:22.890> as<00:02:23.040> strong<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.430> rider<00:02:23.640> at<00:02:23.880> some<00:02:24.090> people

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
not as strong of a rider at some people

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.220 
not as strong of a rider at some people
and<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.560> tried<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.490> power<00:02:26.790> out<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.480> did

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
and so I just tried to power out and did

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.550 
and so I just tried to power out and did
work<00:02:28.470> for<00:02:28.709> me

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
work for me

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.590 
work for me
it<00:02:30.010> was<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.520> was<00:02:30.940> stuck<00:02:31.180> right<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> middle

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
it was I was stuck right in the middle

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.090 
it was I was stuck right in the middle
and<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.470> think

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
and I think

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.630 
and I think
for<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.850> lot<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.480> people<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.960> get<00:02:35.080> out<00:02:35.200> of

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
for a lot of people to get out of

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.550 
for a lot of people to get out of
and<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.150> just<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.840> was<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.080> big<00:02:37.290> reality

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
and it's just that was a big reality

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.220 
and it's just that was a big reality
check<00:02:38.040> for<00:02:38.220> me<00:02:38.280> because<00:02:38.670> I've<00:02:39.570> never<00:02:39.630> seen<00:02:39.900> an

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
check for me because I've never seen an

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.870 
check for me because I've never seen an
avalanche<00:02:40.530> before<00:02:41.040> I've<00:02:41.190> never<00:02:41.250> seen<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> real

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
avalanche before I've never seen a real

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.440 
avalanche before I've never seen a real
big<00:02:42.120> one

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
big one

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.210 
big one
I've<00:02:42.630> never<00:02:42.750> seen<00:02:42.960> small<00:02:43.380> ones<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.770> repeated

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
I've never seen small ones I repeated

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.660 
I've never seen small ones I repeated
there<00:02:44.780> but<00:02:45.780> just<00:02:46.650> seeing<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.220> feeling

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
there but just seeing that and feeling

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.140 
there but just seeing that and feeling
the<00:02:47.790> sheer<00:02:48.030> power<00:02:48.300> was<00:02:49.130> amazing<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.910> was<00:02:50.970> like

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
the sheer power was amazing it was like

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.060 
the sheer power was amazing it was like
floating<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.840> river<00:02:52.020> like<00:02:52.440> because<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:52.890> could

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
floating in a river like because I could

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.790 
floating in a river like because I could
feel<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.400> contours<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> mountain<00:02:54.800> but

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
feel the contours of the mountain but

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.380 
feel the contours of the mountain but
then<00:02:55.950> at<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.160> same<00:02:56.310> time<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.730> was<00:02:56.820> super<00:02:57.180> dense

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
then at the same time it was super dense

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.060 
then at the same time it was super dense
I<00:02:57.630> could<00:02:57.810> could<00:02:57.960> barely<00:02:58.170> move<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.770> tried<00:02:58.980> to

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
I could could barely move and I tried to

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.150 
I could could barely move and I tried to
swim<00:02:59.510> and<00:03:00.510> then<00:03:00.750> being<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.590> there<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.830> didn't

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
swim and then being in there I didn't

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.800 
swim and then being in there I didn't
know<00:03:02.250> where<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.430> was<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.120> then<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.360> hit<00:03:03.540> rocks

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
know where I was and then it hit rocks

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.050 
know where I was and then it hit rocks
and<00:03:04.560> just<00:03:04.800> exploded<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.640> felt<00:03:05.910> being

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
and just exploded and I felt being

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.120 
and just exploded and I felt being
airborne<00:03:06.540> for<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.810> couple<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.200> seconds<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:07.980> it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
airborne for a couple of seconds then it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.800 
airborne for a couple of seconds then it
just<00:03:08.310> slowed<00:03:08.760> down<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.120> little<00:03:09.360> bit<00:03:09.540> and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
just slowed down a little bit and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.800 
just slowed down a little bit and
stopped<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.680> was<00:03:10.709> motionless<00:03:11.550> just<00:03:11.940> cemented

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
stopped I was motionless just cemented

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.800 
stopped I was motionless just cemented
basically<00:03:13.500> cemented<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.150> with<00:03:15.150> my<00:03:15.330> arms<00:03:15.660> up

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
basically cemented in with my arms up

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.600 
basically cemented in with my arms up
above<00:03:15.959> my<00:03:16.230> head<00:03:16.380> liking<00:03:16.800> like<00:03:17.310> someone's

above my head liking like someone's
pointing<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.910> gun<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.239> me<00:03:18.270> I<00:03:18.690> panicked<00:03:19.650> at<00:03:19.770> first

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
pointing a gun at me I panicked at first

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.910 
pointing a gun at me I panicked at first
for<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.340> first<00:03:20.580> like<00:03:20.730> 30<00:03:21.180> seconds<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.230> then<00:03:22.560> I

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
stay calm as possible I was conscious

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.199 
stay calm as possible I was conscious
for<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.959> entire<00:03:34.920> movement<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.700> slide<00:03:35.940> and

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
for the entire movement of the slide and

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.050 
for the entire movement of the slide and
then<00:03:36.390> about<00:03:37.260> 3<00:03:37.650> minutes<00:03:37.890> into<00:03:38.340> being<00:03:38.580> buried<00:03:38.820> I

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
then about 3 minutes into being buried I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.620 
then about 3 minutes into being buried I
succeeded<00:03:39.830> from<00:03:40.830> my<00:03:41.250> god<00:03:41.459> was<00:03:41.670> felt<00:03:42.269> in<00:03:42.390> front

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
succeeded from my god was felt in front

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.140 
succeeded from my god was felt in front
of<00:03:42.690> my<00:03:42.780> mouth<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:44.250> was<00:03:44.549> breathing<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.030> that

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
of my mouth and I was breathing and that

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.580 
of my mouth and I was breathing and that
probably<00:03:45.450> kept<00:03:45.630> snow<00:03:45.900> out<00:03:46.049> of<00:03:46.170> my<00:03:46.260> mouth<00:03:46.410> but

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
probably kept snow out of my mouth but

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.680 
probably kept snow out of my mouth but
at<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.830> same<00:03:47.010> time<00:03:47.280> it's<00:03:47.940> limited<00:03:48.360> my<00:03:48.510> air

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
at the same time it's limited my air

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.110 
at the same time it's limited my air
supply<00:03:48.959> because<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.560> was<00:03:49.709> breathing<00:03:49.950> same<00:03:50.880> air

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
supply because I was breathing same air

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.839 
supply because I was breathing same air
over<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.690> over<00:03:51.959> and

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849

everyone who was around basically the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.680 
everyone who was around basically the
