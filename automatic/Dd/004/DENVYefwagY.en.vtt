00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.480
 there is a fourth pillar to which I have 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.500
 also mentioned in this in this mine 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:29.060
 book on which, however, the scientific basis 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:33.110
 they are not as solid as these 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.210
 first three pillars clear a base 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.120
 solid theoretical science no because yes 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.500
 knows that the tumor needs glucose 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.390
 the tumor is known 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.370
 stimulated tumor proliferation 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.140
 from the substances of inflammation we know 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.000
 that proliferation depends on 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.930
 growth factors but they are not there 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.489
 still studies that we have studies 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.409
 experimental on the man they have 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.570
 proved that actually eating 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.760
 in this way the tumor grows less but 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.989
 there are strong theoretical reasons for 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.210
 think 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.360
 here is this last pillar then to which 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.049
 I refer to the bases much less 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.780
 solid and is that there are some foods 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.890
 which are very rich in chickens 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.030
 polyamines are substances 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.590
 clinically very simple the most 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.280
 simple made from nh2 about 202 czech 2 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.119
 cp 2 n ca2 era is called putrescine 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.090
 there is a substance that is indispensable 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.560
 tumors for cell proliferation 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.560
 they are very good at these substances 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.469
 there are two main sources of support 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.140
 these substances in the diet 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:43.420
 one is the intestinal putrefaction of the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.189
 proteins in those with a diet we say 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.649
 omnivorous or carnivorous because in those who have 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.899
 a vegetarian diet microbes 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.829
 intestinal do not have enzymes for 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.990
 fabricate all these controversies 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.840
 I for not knowing how to read or write 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.090
 I say we are not going to give him not 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.639
 let's go give them to him too 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.020
 substances I told myself a source and the 

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:09.229
 intestinal protein rot 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.990
 the other important source is the many fruit 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.600
 fruits contain then in mine in 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.069
 especially citrus fruits in particular 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.930
 Solanaceae 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.530
 then aubergines and tropical fruit 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.849
 especially bananas 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.040
 then I say very well that it issued 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:30.499
 tumor eats fruit but maybe not 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.969
 exaggerate with these types of fruit though 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.769
 there are no human experiments 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.090
 because I can't support that 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.200
 actually this is fruit and they do 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.870
 bad but prudently I say but I have 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.310
 a tumor prefer to eat others 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.310
 types of fruit and vegetables
