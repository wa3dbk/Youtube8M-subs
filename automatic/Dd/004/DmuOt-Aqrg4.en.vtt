00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
now for our beats we've taken seezle

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.680 
now for our beats we've taken seezle
beats<00:00:11.130> which<00:00:11.429> are<00:00:11.610> always<00:00:11.790> tender<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.389> sweet

beats which are always tender and sweet

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.540 
beats which are always tender and sweet
and<00:00:13.160> we<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.460> put<00:00:15.000> them<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.420> cold<00:00:15.719> water<00:00:16.550> it

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and we have put them in cold water it

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.090 
and we have put them in cold water it
you<00:00:18.060> know<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.570> beats<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.109> they<00:00:19.470> take<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> lot<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
you know for beats it they take a lot of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.920 
you know for beats it they take a lot of
boiling<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.730> could<00:00:20.970> be<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> good<00:00:21.240> hour<00:00:21.449> for

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
boiling this could be a good hour for

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.740 
boiling this could be a good hour for
beast<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.380> size<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.279> tender<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:24.660> you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
beast this size to be tender what you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.679 
beast this size to be tender what you
want<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.320> put<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.710> cold<00:00:25.920> water<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
want to do is put it in cold water a

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.900 
want to do is put it in cold water a
dozen<00:00:27.689> beats<00:00:27.930> at<00:00:28.230> least<00:00:28.500> cook<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.800> dozen<00:00:29.189> for

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
dozen beats at least cook a dozen for

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.669 
dozen beats at least cook a dozen for
all<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.240> work<00:00:30.480> right<00:00:30.779> put<00:00:31.230> them<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.500> cold

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
all that work right put them in cold

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.680 
all that work right put them in cold
water<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.730> could<00:00:32.850> probably<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:33.540> a

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
water you could probably have about a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.200 
water you could probably have about a
quart<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.170> water<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.860> teaspoon<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.880> salt

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
quart of water and a teaspoon of salt

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.119 
quart of water and a teaspoon of salt
it'll<00:00:37.170> increase<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.680> boiling<00:00:37.980> temperature

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
it'll increase the boiling temperature

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.030 
it'll increase the boiling temperature
by<00:00:38.399> one<00:00:38.430> degree<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.059> then<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.559> comes<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
by one degree and then one comes to a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.069 
by one degree and then one comes to a
boil<00:00:41.250> put<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.820> some<00:00:42.090> vinegar<00:00:42.510> because<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
boil put in some vinegar because the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.680 
boil put in some vinegar because the
vinegar<00:00:43.410> actually<00:00:43.770> will<00:00:43.920> help<00:00:44.190> keep<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.510> red

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
vinegar actually will help keep the red

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.340 
vinegar actually will help keep the red
color<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.140> don't<00:00:46.950> peel<00:00:47.309> them<00:00:47.520> first<00:00:48.170> put<00:00:49.170> them

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
color and don't peel them first put them

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.760 
color and don't peel them first put them
in<00:00:49.440> untouched<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.180> all<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.570> beet<00:00:52.500> juice

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
in untouched so that all that beet juice

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.430 
in untouched so that all that beet juice
doesn't<00:00:53.399> go<00:00:53.670> until<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.360> water<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.170> make<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
doesn't go until the water and make a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.400 
doesn't go until the water and make a
big<00:00:55.680> mess<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.969> will<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> beat<00:00:57.899> you

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
big mess and you will have a beat you

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.410 
big mess and you will have a beat you
can<00:00:58.559> see<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.920> steaming<00:00:59.160> hot<00:00:59.489> that's<00:01:00.149> cooked

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
can see it's steaming hot that's cooked

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.619 
can see it's steaming hot that's cooked
all<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> way<00:01:00.780> through<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.270> somebody

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
all the way through and that's somebody

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.479 
all the way through and that's somebody
falls<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:05.250> give<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> little

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
falls right off but to give a little

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.670 
falls right off but to give a little
texture<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:07.820> firm<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.479> cooked<00:01:10.409> all<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
texture so it's firm but cooked all the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
texture so it's firm but cooked all the
way<00:01:10.710> through<00:01:10.799> that's<00:01:11.130> important<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
way through that's important with that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.510 
way through that's important with that
and<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> pleasant<00:01:14.040> task<00:01:14.220> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.359 
and then you have the pleasant task of
peeling<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.939> beets<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.900> they're<00:01:16.140> hot<00:01:16.380> there's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
peeling the beets so they're hot there's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.530 
peeling the beets so they're hot there's
nothing<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.000> about<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.299> you're<00:01:18.390> going

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
beets and wondering about beets is they

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.940 
beets and wondering about beets is they
have<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> slight<00:01:34.079> earthy<00:01:34.500> tasty<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:36.710> closer<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
have a slight earthy tasty the closer to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.850 
have a slight earthy tasty the closer to
the<00:01:38.100> source<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.670> they<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.850> harvest

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
the source that they are harvest

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.990 
the source that they are harvest
harvested<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.369> better<00:01:41.579> they're<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
harvested the better they're going to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.560 
harvested the better they're going to
taste<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.600> their<00:01:43.470> storage<00:01:43.799> beads<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
taste if their storage beads they get I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.719 
taste if their storage beads they get I
guess<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> little<00:01:46.290> earthier<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.280> store

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
guess a little earthier as they store

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.870 
guess a little earthier as they store
now<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.840> I've<00:01:48.930> peeled<00:01:49.290> all<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.250> beets<00:01:50.460> we
