consecutive occasions that gives you a

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
consecutive occasions that gives you a
pretty<00:01:24.869> good<00:01:24.930> indication<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.560> how

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
pretty good indication of just how

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.310 
pretty good indication of just how
seriously<00:01:26.700> Federer<00:01:27.210> takes<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.840> tournament

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
seriously Federer takes this tournament

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.590 
seriously Federer takes this tournament
and<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.680> course<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.040> think<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> fact<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.880> he

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and of course I think the fact that he

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.929 
and of course I think the fact that he
handles<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.530> schedule<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.310> well<00:01:32.520> means<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
handles the schedule so well means that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.550 
handles the schedule so well means that
he<00:01:33.000> always<00:01:33.240> plays<00:01:33.450> his<00:01:33.479> best<00:01:33.659> tennis<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
he always plays his best tennis at the

we saw it running in bars are winning in

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.310 
we saw it running in bars are winning in
Paris<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.180> saying<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.659> songs<00:01:42.990> had<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> good

Paris but saying it songs had a good

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
Paris but saying it songs had a good
indoor<00:01:43.590> season<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:44.009> well<00:01:44.159> winning<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.790> myths

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.210 
indoor season as well winning in myths
and<00:01:45.390> Vienna<00:01:45.780> certainly<00:01:46.290> his<00:01:46.439> best<00:01:46.680> conditions

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and Vienna certainly his best conditions

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.310 
and Vienna certainly his best conditions
and<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.180> he<00:01:48.570> certainly<00:01:48.869> enjoyed<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and I think he certainly enjoyed the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.170 
and I think he certainly enjoyed the
conditions<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.490> week<00:01:50.759> he's<00:01:50.909> been<00:01:51.090> able

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
conditions here this week he's been able

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.120 
conditions here this week he's been able
to<00:01:51.360> exploit<00:01:51.750> them<00:01:51.930> his<00:01:52.110> second<00:01:52.500> serve<00:01:52.710> there's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
to exploit them his second serve there's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.710 
to exploit them his second serve there's
been<00:01:53.280> outstanding<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.390> course<00:01:54.600> behind

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
been outstanding and of course behind

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.060 
been outstanding and of course behind
his<00:01:54.899> first<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:55.380> he<00:01:55.439> has<00:01:55.530> been<00:01:55.680> exceptional

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
his first so if he has been exceptional

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160 
his first so if he has been exceptional
in<00:01:56.340> his<00:01:56.460> match<00:01:56.640> against<00:01:56.939> British<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.659> ninety

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
in his match against British one ninety

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.690 
in his match against British one ninety
two<00:01:58.200> percent<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.799> points<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> first

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
two percent of the points when the first

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.550 
two percent of the points when the first
serve<00:01:59.969> found<00:02:00.270> its<00:02:00.450> mark<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.960> he's<00:02:01.049> defended

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
serve found its mark and he's defended

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.440 
serve found its mark and he's defended
his<00:02:01.680> second<00:02:02.009> serve<00:02:02.130> exceptionally<00:02:03.000> well<00:02:03.180> his

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
his second serve exceptionally well his

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.300 
his second serve exceptionally well his
kicker<00:02:03.780> gets<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.439> lot<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.619> bite<00:02:04.920> out<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.159> this

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
kicker gets a lot of bite out of this

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.740 
kicker gets a lot of bite out of this
particular<00:02:05.610> surface<00:02:05.969> yeah<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> think<00:02:06.540> that's

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
particular surface yeah I think that's

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.029 
particular surface yeah I think that's
the<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:06.990> change<00:02:07.290> isn't<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.649> from<00:02:07.799> twelve

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the one change isn't it from twelve

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.680 
the one change isn't it from twelve
months<00:02:08.280> ago<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.610> ball<00:02:08.759> stays<00:02:09.000> relatively<00:02:09.390> low

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
months ago the ball stays relatively low

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.630 
months ago the ball stays relatively low
here<00:02:09.929> there's<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> lot<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.259> grit<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> paint

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
here there's a lot of grit in the paint

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.100 
here there's a lot of grit in the paint
on<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.970> court<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> players<00:02:12.690> are<00:02:12.900> saying

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
on the court and the players are saying

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.670 
on the court and the players are saying
that<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.290> kicks

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that the kicks

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.009 
that the kicks
in<00:02:13.920> particular<00:02:14.069> it's<00:02:14.819> just<00:02:14.909> kicking<00:02:15.840> like<00:02:15.959> a

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
in particular it's just kicking like a

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.509 
in particular it's just kicking like a
mule<00:02:16.319> really<00:02:16.709> off<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:17.010> court<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.459> that

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
mule really off the court and that

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.920 
mule really off the court and that
certainly<00:02:17.939> helped<00:02:18.239> Tsonga<00:02:18.599> throughout<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
certainly helped Tsonga throughout the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.690 
certainly helped Tsonga throughout the
course<00:02:19.109> of<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.260> week<00:02:19.379> but<00:02:19.530> federer<00:02:19.829> to<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.280> lot

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
course of the week but federer to a lot

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.309 
course of the week but federer to a lot
of<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.819> players<00:02:21.030> mixing<00:02:21.569> in<00:02:21.689> is<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> nice<00:02:22.049> first

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
of the players mixing in is a nice first

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.020 
of the players mixing in is a nice first
serve<00:02:22.500> only<00:02:22.680> yes<00:02:23.010> there<00:02:23.219> certainly<00:02:23.250> are<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.000> I

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
serve only yes there certainly are but I

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.119 
serve only yes there certainly are but I
think<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.599> one<00:02:25.049> thing<00:02:25.079> that<00:02:25.319> Federer<00:02:25.799> has<00:02:25.859> in

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
think the one thing that Federer has in

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.949 
think the one thing that Federer has in
his<00:02:26.250> locker<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.640> hurts<00:02:26.849> songer<00:02:27.599> each<00:02:27.750> and

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
his locker that hurts songer each and

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.240 
his locker that hurts songer each and
every<00:02:28.109> time<00:02:28.290> they<00:02:28.500> play<00:02:28.739> is<00:02:28.890> able<00:02:29.159> to

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
every time they play is able to

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.339 
every time they play is able to
neutralize<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.939> first<00:02:30.480> serve<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.230> was

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
neutralize that first serve that I was

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.209 
neutralize that first serve that I was
talking<00:02:31.620> about<00:02:31.650> they're<00:02:31.889> so<00:02:32.040> effective

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
talking about they're so effective

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.920 
talking about they're so effective
against<00:02:32.579> the<00:02:32.670> other<00:02:32.790> players<00:02:33.090> he's<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:33.900> good

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
against the other players he's so good

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.420 
against the other players he's so good
at<00:02:34.109> bunting<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.620> back<00:02:34.799> deep<00:02:34.980> especially<00:02:35.280> of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
at bunting it back deep especially of

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.550 
at bunting it back deep especially of
the<00:02:35.549> backhand<00:02:36.060> side<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:37.170> almost<00:02:37.379> like

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
the backhand side so it's almost like

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.349 
the backhand side so it's almost like
something<00:02:37.920> has<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.219> serve<00:02:38.430> lights<00:02:38.700> are<00:02:38.879> kind

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
something has to serve lights are kind

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.399 
something has to serve lights are kind
of<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:39.510> what<00:02:39.719> he<00:02:39.780> did<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.049> one<00:02:40.200> more<00:02:40.290> than

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
of like what he did it one more than

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.050 
of like what he did it one more than
kind<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.739> like<00:02:40.859> what<00:02:41.010> he<00:02:41.069> did<00:02:41.129> at<00:02:41.400> montreal

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
kind of like what he did at montreal

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.979 
kind of like what he did at montreal
when<00:02:42.209> he<00:02:42.239> beat<00:02:42.420> him<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.629> those<00:02:42.750> back-to-back

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
when he beat him in those back-to-back

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.720 
when he beat him in those back-to-back
matches<00:02:43.409> and<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.859> course<00:02:44.040> those<00:02:44.250> courts<00:02:44.549> there

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
matches and of course those courts there

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.159 
matches and of course those courts there
at<00:02:44.849> Wimbledon<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.239> in<00:02:45.450> Montreal<00:02:45.840> were<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.109> a

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.169 
at Wimbledon and in Montreal were just a

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:47.449 
at Wimbledon and in Montreal were just a
little<00:02:46.319> quicker<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.889> I<00:02:46.919> think<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.220> suit

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
little quicker and I think that suit

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.159 
little quicker and I think that suit
