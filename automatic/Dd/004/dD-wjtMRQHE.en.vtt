00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.210
 It's little fits anywhere 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.470
 after a guitar and if I think 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.510

 which hardly needs to be published 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.220
 that's what happens 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.489

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.229
 that afternoon on the march 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.569

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.479
 no dismay 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:52.609
 chemistry 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.609

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:59.799

 It does not work for me 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.099
 access to certain expertise 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.759
 if you must be big 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:44.999
 he had this because he eliminates 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.199
 in this process 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.199
 He gets in a golden bikini. 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.699
 he said that pt is not anymore 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.439
 the immediate band the traveling show 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.439
 connected there 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.249
 who has this lipstick with the image that passes is more critical 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.900
 each collection 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.359
 carts do not give 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.040
 a different approach 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.520
 the other is the rose pear tree 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.860
 and we have to increase 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.860
