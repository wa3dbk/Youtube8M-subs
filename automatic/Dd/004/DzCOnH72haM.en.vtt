00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
store already cut thin and that really

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.330 
store already cut thin and that really
makes<00:00:58.899> a<00:00:59.020> lot<00:00:59.200> easier<00:00:59.230> so<00:00:59.770> you<00:00:59.860> don't<00:01:00.040> have<00:01:00.130> to

you know freeze the meat and do the
cutting<00:01:02.649> yourself<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.489> that<00:01:03.670> takes<00:01:03.969> a<00:01:04.149> lot<00:01:04.329> of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
cutting yourself so that takes a lot of

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.969 
cutting yourself so that takes a lot of
the<00:01:04.509> time<00:01:04.809> out<00:01:05.019> of<00:01:05.049> it<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:06.159> also<00:01:06.490> have<00:01:07.000> around

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the time out of it and also have around

the time out of it and also have around
state<00:01:08.979> thin<00:01:09.399> slice<00:01:09.789> and<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:11.439> I<00:01:11.619> do<00:01:11.679> is<00:01:12.189> I<00:01:12.670> make

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
state thin slice and what I do is I make

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.660 
state thin slice and what I do is I make
sure<00:01:13.060> these<00:01:13.270> are<00:01:13.569> cut<00:01:13.979> against<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.039> grain<00:01:15.130> a

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
sure these are cut against the grain a

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.059 
sure these are cut against the grain a
lot<00:01:15.939> of<00:01:16.060> times<00:01:16.240> in<00:01:16.539> the<00:01:16.689> recipes<00:01:17.229> you'll<00:01:17.740> see

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:18.069 
lot of times in the recipes you'll see

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:20.160 
lot of times in the recipes you'll see
that<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.670> jerky<00:01:19.060> should<00:01:19.329> meet<00:01:19.659> you<00:01:19.810> be<00:01:19.929> cut

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
that the jerky should meet you be cut

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.410 
that the jerky should meet you be cut
with<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.409> grain<00:01:20.619> but<00:01:21.490> with<00:01:21.639> a<00:01:21.670> dehydrator

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
with the grain but with a dehydrator

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.019 
with the grain but with a dehydrator
like<00:01:22.689> this<00:01:22.929> one<00:01:23.219> it's<00:01:24.219> better<00:01:24.549> in<00:01:24.850> my<00:01:24.999> opinion

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:25.029 
like this one it's better in my opinion

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:27.569 
like this one it's better in my opinion
to<00:01:25.600> use<00:01:26.020> it<00:01:26.200> against<00:01:26.709> the<00:01:26.829> grain<00:01:27.069> because<00:01:27.310> of

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
to use it against the grain because of

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.279 
to use it against the grain because of
terrible<00:01:27.969> to<00:01:28.029> meet<00:01:28.209> tears<00:01:28.509> off<00:01:28.749> easier<00:01:29.139> and

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
terrible to meet tears off easier and

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.190 
terrible to meet tears off easier and
once<00:01:29.499> it's<00:01:29.709> dry<00:01:29.979> and<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.659> what<00:01:31.869> I'll<00:01:31.959> do<00:01:32.170> is

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
once it's dry and so what I'll do is

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.849 
once it's dry and so what I'll do is
I'll<00:01:32.590> take<00:01:32.889> these<00:01:33.399> pieces<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.539> meat<00:01:34.779> and<00:01:35.020> cook
