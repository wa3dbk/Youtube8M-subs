00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
teeth - thunderjet style chassis just to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.570 
teeth - thunderjet style chassis just to
give<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.139> idea<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.490> very

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
nice first thing I did of course when I

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.019 
nice first thing I did of course when I
got<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.240> was<00:00:24.390> took<00:00:24.600> off<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.279> skeezy<00:00:26.279> skinny

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
got it was took off the skeezy skinny

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.349 
got it was took off the skeezy skinny
tires<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.810> put<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.990> set<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.760> slip<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.000> slip

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
tires and put a set of slip on slip

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.139 
tires and put a set of slip on slip
silicones<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.160> helped<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.700> lot

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
silicones on it and that helped a lot

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.370 
silicones on it and that helped a lot
and<00:00:33.680> it's<00:00:34.680> actually<00:00:35.190> very<00:00:35.370> nice<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.930> now<00:00:37.230> I'm

you know when we talk about the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.660 
you know when we talk about the
thunderjets<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.870> newest<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.860> 45<00:00:53.340> years

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
thunderjets the newest one it's 45 years

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.869 
thunderjets the newest one it's 45 years
old<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.469> back<00:00:55.469> 15<00:00:56.010> years<00:00:56.280> ago<00:00:56.460> when<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
old and back 15 years ago when the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.660 
old and back 15 years ago when the
Chinese<00:00:57.390> started<00:00:57.719> making<00:00:58.350> their<00:00:58.949> version<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
Chinese started making their version of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.709 
Chinese started making their version of
them.we<00:01:01.070> we<00:01:02.070> expected<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.390> they're

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
them.we we expected a lot and they're

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
them.we we expected a lot and they're
nice<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.409> they<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.400> they're

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
nice but they just you know they're

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.840 
nice but they just you know they're
noisy<00:01:06.030> they're<00:01:06.810> fast<00:01:07.049> they<00:01:07.619> jump<00:01:08.520> off<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
noisy they're fast they jump off the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.030 
noisy they're fast they jump off the
track<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.330> Li<00:01:09.689> there<00:01:09.900> they're<00:01:10.409> fun<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.890> their

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
track is Li there they're fun in their

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.429 
track is Li there they're fun in their
own<00:01:11.220> way<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> same<00:01:12.540> why<00:01:13.020> I

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
own way but it's just not the same why I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.690 
own way but it's just not the same why I
think<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> gears<00:01:16.700> these

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
think it's because of the gears these

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.320 
think it's because of the gears these
are<00:01:17.909> nice<00:01:18.229> gears<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.670> think<00:01:20.909> about<00:01:21.180> if

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
are nice gears and and to think about if

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.670 
are nice gears and and to think about if
a<00:01:21.390> slot<00:01:21.630> car<00:01:21.869> would<00:01:21.990> all<00:01:22.110> admit<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
a slot car would all admit with the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.320 
a slot car would all admit with the
motor<00:01:22.860> turning<00:01:23.220> all<00:01:23.490> those<00:01:23.700> gears<00:01:24.030> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
motor turning all those gears is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.530 
motor turning all those gears is
inefficient<00:01:25.200> by<00:01:25.920> its<00:01:26.130> nature<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.360> why

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
inefficient by its nature but that's why

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.390 
inefficient by its nature but that's why
we<00:01:27.750> love<00:01:27.780> them<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.530> were<00:01:28.710> kids<00:01:28.950> because

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
we love them when we were kids because

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.130 
we love them when we were kids because
we<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.729> watching<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.270> gears<00:01:30.509> go<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:30.960> my

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
we like watching the gears go that's my

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.969 
we like watching the gears go that's my
theory<00:01:31.439> anyway

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
theory anyway

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.730 
theory anyway
and<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.820> Chinese<00:01:33.420> ones<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.049> plastic<00:01:34.530> gears

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
and the Chinese ones that plastic gears

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.830 
and the Chinese ones that plastic gears
they<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.189> don't<00:01:35.400> cut<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.540> is

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
they just don't cut it so here it is

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.580 
they just don't cut it so here it is
here's<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> teeth<00:01:37.439> -<00:01:37.650> chassis<00:01:38.420> it's<00:01:39.420> got<00:01:39.750> very

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
here's the teeth - chassis it's got very

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.899 
here's the teeth - chassis it's got very
nice<00:01:40.890> gears<00:01:42.229> even<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.520> look<00:01:44.700> up<00:01:44.880> close

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
nice gears even the if you look up close

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.490 
nice gears even the if you look up close
there<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.659> see<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> crown<00:01:46.229> gear

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
there you see the crown gear

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.499 
there you see the crown gear
everything's<00:01:47.369> very<00:01:47.520> nicely<00:01:47.880> made<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
everything's very nicely made the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.469 
everything's very nicely made the
chassis<00:01:48.990> itself<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.710> molding<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.310> very<00:01:50.610> crisp

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.959 

very<00:01:54.479> very<00:01:54.990> fits<00:01:55.500> fits<00:01:56.070> very<00:01:56.369> well<00:01:56.700> together

very very fits fits very well together
as<00:01:57.540> black<00:01:58.290> plastic<00:01:58.619> wheels<00:01:59.159> sort<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
as black plastic wheels sort of like the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.420 
as black plastic wheels sort of like the
original<00:02:00.360> style<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.560> copper<00:02:01.979> work<00:02:02.189> is

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
original style the copper work is

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.249 
original style the copper work is
actually<00:02:02.880> very<00:02:03.090> nice<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.750> look<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.079> there

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
again don't mind me well that cuts it

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.360 
again don't mind me well that cuts it
the<00:02:33.970> main<00:02:34.180> problem<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.989> found<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.709> far<00:02:36.040> is

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
the main problem that I found so far is

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.720 
the main problem that I found so far is
the<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.599> pickups<00:02:38.049> really<00:02:38.409> suck<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:39.370> hook<00:02:39.579> in

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
the the pickups really suck the hook in

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.580 
the the pickups really suck the hook in
the<00:02:39.849> back<00:02:40.030> doesn't<00:02:40.359> fit<00:02:40.690> in<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.989> slot<00:02:41.109> very

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
the back doesn't fit in the slot very

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.140 
the back doesn't fit in the slot very
well<00:02:41.920> that's<00:02:42.220> like<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.640> second<00:02:43.030> or<00:02:43.090> third

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
well that's like the second or third

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.670 
well that's like the second or third
time<00:02:43.540> they've<00:02:43.810> popped<00:02:44.079> off<00:02:44.379> I<00:02:44.620> tried

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
time they've popped off I tried

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.530 
time they've popped off I tried
reshaping<00:02:45.340> them<00:02:45.640> already<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.269> you<00:02:46.390> know<00:02:46.510> I

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
reshaping them already and you know I

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.319 
reshaping them already and you know I
may<00:02:46.810> pick<00:02:47.079> up<00:02:47.109> out<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.650> piece<00:02:47.859> of<00:02:48.069> tin<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:49.090> I'm

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
may pick up out of a piece of tin so I'm

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.390 
may pick up out of a piece of tin so I'm
pretty<00:02:49.510> good<00:02:49.840> at<00:02:50.019> fixing<00:02:50.230> them<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:50.889> that's

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
pretty good at fixing them so that's

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.369 
pretty good at fixing them so that's
about<00:02:51.579> the<00:02:51.879> main<00:02:52.060> thing<00:02:52.329> I<00:02:52.480> found<00:02:52.720> wrong<00:02:53.109> with

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
about the main thing I found wrong with

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.069 
about the main thing I found wrong with
it<00:02:53.590> was<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.430> pickups<00:02:54.849> are<00:02:55.060> terrible<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.930> got

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
it was the pickups are terrible you got

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.289 
it was the pickups are terrible you got
to<00:02:56.230> get<00:02:56.349> some<00:02:56.560> new<00:02:56.590> ones<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.310> then<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.150> looks

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
to get some new ones and then it looks

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.910 
to get some new ones and then it looks
like<00:02:58.359> that<00:02:58.659> would<00:02:58.810> fix<00:02:59.079> it<00:02:59.200> but<00:02:59.379> it<00:02:59.500> runs<00:02:59.709> very

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
like that would fix it but it runs very

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.399 
like that would fix it but it runs very
smooth<00:03:00.370> here<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.150> will<00:03:01.359> pop<00:03:01.569> it<00:03:01.720> apart<00:03:02.049> since<00:03:02.290> we

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
smooth here I will pop it apart since we

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.849 
smooth here I will pop it apart since we
got<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:03.299> blown<00:03:04.299> apart<00:03:04.690> already<00:03:04.989> I<00:03:05.349> already<00:03:05.409> put

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
got it blown apart already I already put

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.949 
got it blown apart already I already put
one<00:03:05.889> new<00:03:06.220> spring<00:03:06.579> on<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.970> that's<00:03:10.269> I'm<00:03:10.599> not

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
one new spring on it but that's I'm not

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.199 
one new spring on it but that's I'm not
really<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.379> valid<00:03:11.620> complaint<00:03:12.129> we<00:03:12.549> expect<00:03:13.030> the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
really a valid complaint we expect the

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.220 
really a valid complaint we expect the
tires<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.840> be<00:03:13.989> like<00:03:15.480> not<00:03:16.480> adequate<00:03:17.079> we're

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
tires to be like not adequate we're

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.390 
tires to be like not adequate we're
going<00:03:17.349> to<00:03:17.410> put<00:03:17.590> tires<00:03:17.829> on<00:03:18.129> it

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
going to put tires on it

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.949 
going to put tires on it
we're<00:03:18.699> gonna<00:03:18.849> have<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.060> put<00:03:19.239> our<00:03:19.359> own<00:03:19.389> brand<00:03:19.810> of

we're gonna have to put our own brand of

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.220 
we're gonna have to put our own brand of
pickups<00:03:20.349> on<00:03:20.530> there<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:21.069> look<00:03:21.250> inside<00:03:21.609> you<00:03:21.940> see

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
pickups on there you look inside you see

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.400 
pickups on there you look inside you see

it's got the the - good - magnets the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.770 
it's got the the - good - magnets the
dome<00:03:26.620> pickups<00:03:27.160> if<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:27.910> do<00:03:27.970> have<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.299> complaint

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
dome pickups if I do have a complaint

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.780 
dome pickups if I do have a complaint
it's<00:03:29.139> the<00:03:29.319> rivet<00:03:29.680> job<00:03:29.919> they're<00:03:30.250> very<00:03:30.459> stout

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
it's the rivet job they're very stout

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.460 
it's the rivet job they're very stout
rivets<00:03:31.299> as<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.599> could<00:03:31.780> have<00:03:31.840> really<00:03:32.019> seen<00:03:32.290> on

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
rivets as you could have really seen on

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.680 
rivets as you could have really seen on
the<00:03:32.590> other<00:03:32.620> side<00:03:33.129> but<00:03:34.090> they're<00:03:34.329> kind<00:03:34.569> of

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
the other side but they're kind of

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.659 
the other side but they're kind of
mashed<00:03:34.930> over<00:03:35.470> on<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.829> inside<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.370> know<00:03:36.430> they

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
mashed over on the inside I know they

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.369 
mashed over on the inside I know they
probably<00:03:36.910> had<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.299> work<00:03:37.569> hard<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.930> get<00:03:38.169> them

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
probably had to work hard to get them

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.589 
probably had to work hard to get them
even<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.859> good<00:03:39.190> but<00:03:39.940> I<00:03:39.970> could<00:03:40.299> see<00:03:40.480> where

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
even that good but I could see where

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.659 
even that good but I could see where
that<00:03:40.629> might<00:03:40.930> be<00:03:41.139> a<00:03:41.169> problem<00:03:41.680> down<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:42.099> line<00:03:42.310> I

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
that might be a problem down the line I

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.550 
that might be a problem down the line I
mean<00:03:43.209> but<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:43.449> chassis<00:03:43.690> is<00:03:43.930> molded<00:03:44.349> very

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
mean but the chassis is molded very

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.379 
mean but the chassis is molded very
crisp<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.310> think<00:03:45.549> them<00:03:45.730> rivets<00:03:46.060> are<00:03:46.180> big

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
crisp and I think them rivets are big

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.599 
crisp and I think them rivets are big
enough<00:03:46.660> they'll<00:03:46.900> do<00:03:47.109> their<00:03:47.319> job<00:03:47.609> the

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
enough they'll do their job the

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.599 
enough they'll do their job the
beautiful<00:03:49.120> part<00:03:49.419> here<00:03:49.810> is<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.829> top<00:03:51.040> plate<00:03:51.370> and

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
beautiful part here is the top plate and

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.119 
beautiful part here is the top plate and
whatever<00:03:52.299> kind<00:03:52.569> of<00:03:52.660> plastic<00:03:53.139> is<00:03:53.290> this<00:03:53.739> must<00:03:53.949> be

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
whatever kind of plastic is this must be

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.979 
whatever kind of plastic is this must be
some<00:03:54.340> kind<00:03:54.609> of<00:03:54.699> self<00:03:54.940> lubricating<00:03:55.150> stuff

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
some kind of self lubricating stuff

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.110 
some kind of self lubricating stuff
because<00:03:56.319> I<00:03:56.470> put<00:03:56.739> very<00:03:56.980> little<00:03:57.310> oil<00:03:57.430> on<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.970> and

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
because I put very little oil on it and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.420 
because I put very little oil on it and
as<00:03:58.239> you<00:03:58.269> saw<00:03:58.659> running<00:03:59.409> around<00:03:59.709> the<00:04:00.010> circle

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
as you saw running around the circle

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.339 
as you saw running around the circle
track<00:04:00.669> and<00:04:00.909> that<00:04:00.970> was<00:04:01.150> maybe<00:04:01.359> like<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.930> third

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
track and that was maybe like a third

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.920 
track and that was maybe like a third
throttle<00:04:03.159> so<00:04:03.370> this<00:04:04.090> promises<00:04:04.629> to<00:04:04.750> be<00:04:04.900> very

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
throttle so this promises to be very

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.729 
throttle so this promises to be very
fast<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.799> has<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.069> beautiful<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:08.230> can<00:04:08.409> see<00:04:08.620> it

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
fast it has a beautiful you can see it

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.309 
fast it has a beautiful you can see it
there<00:04:08.979> tri-lamb<00:04:09.669> armature<00:04:10.299> in<00:04:10.510> there<00:04:10.810> and

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
there tri-lamb armature in there and
