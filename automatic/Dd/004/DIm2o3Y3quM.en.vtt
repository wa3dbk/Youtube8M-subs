00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.640
 I do not know what you are going to say but 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.030
 I think there are words that should 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.000
 be edible as for example cupcake 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.289
 chocolate banana those who 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.390
 they can fill in from any 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.460
 frosting that we do here in our 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.169
 program such as the frosting of 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.330
 Cocoa cream from Diego Manrique is already 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.210
 well something out of this world they say 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.369
 the Americans the English in general and 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.460
 many others of course and that 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.890
 field and has a texture this better 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.080
 what does Carolina tell you? 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.820
 that those cupcakes are absolutely 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.910
 delicious precisely because they are 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.520
 fluffy are very soft they have a 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.280
 Dense chocolate flavor and a touch to 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.680
 special banana then you have to 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.990
 try them and suicide you have to try them and 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.970
 that 's where all of each heat and not of 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.410
 taught how it's done since we have 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.620
 all distributed a series of elements 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.740
 also very appetizing yes and to make 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.129
 our cupcakes are going to need a cup 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.439
 and a half of flour that are 185 grams 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.219
 One third cup of pure cocoa powder 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:13.700
 without sugar that are 35 grams a cup of 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:16.490
 sugar that are 200 grams teaspoon and 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.600
 3/4 baking powder room 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.010
 teaspoon baking soda 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.780
 1/4 teaspoon of salt 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.610
 and a big egg 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.860
 and half a cup of ripe bananas 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.960
 crushed 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.890
 three quarters of milk that are 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.230
 180 milliliters a quarter cup of 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.180
 light vegetable oil such as sunflower oil 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.150
 do not go to use the olive that are 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.670
 60 milliliters a teaspoon of 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.830
 Vanilla extract a quarter 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.670
 teaspoon ground cinnamon and let's 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.550
 need a mold for cupcakes and if 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.310
 so they get the pieces of paper that always 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.520
 we use to make it shape 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.410
 the cupcakes first thing as always 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.150
 We preheat the oven 200 degrees 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.570
 centigrade that are 400 degrees 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.520
 fahrenheit and the following good thing if 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.470
 you what I was going to apply that if 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.660
 you do not get these these molds 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.720
 paper milestones so what are we going to do 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.340
 is to grease and grease already accurate 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.980
 we greased and in moss flour we took it off 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.950
 the excess of flour and the base itself 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.010
 the cupcakes good to know 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.709
 okay 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.780
 Well first thing we're going to do is going to 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.000
 be mix 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.250
 the flour 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.750
 with cocoa and all these ingredients 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.560
 both are already perfectly heavy 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.560
 in yeast 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.670
 and the bicarbonate 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.340
 in the quarter teaspoon that is a 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.340
 salt of salt 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.910
 and the cinnamon thank you 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.380
 and we're going to mix it until it 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.120
 integrate completely 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.920
 well, this is already mixed and 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.190
 Now what we are going to do is sift 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.190
 the 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.579
 until we are perfect 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.270
 and now we're done with this that we 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.020
 remains 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.020
 a little bit 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.110
 and we finished also leaving 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.000
 as you see if he makes a super recipe 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.620
 easy and you do not even need 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.110
 complication if you want to beat 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.760
 with a perfect electric mixer but if 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.030
 We do not do it by hand as we are going to 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.760
 to do today 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.270
 this we leave here reserved and 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.390
 we go here 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.230
 to beat 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.230
 again 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.450
 the banana 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.940
 or banana that we have crushed and 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.770
 we have put a little lemon juice for 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.430
 that is not going to rust and that is not 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.430
 put us black 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.360
 the milk 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.020
 the recipe facilitates because on the one hand 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.800
 the liquids are already 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.800
 in oil 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.569
 and vanilla 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:35.030
 and now to give it with energy folding 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.960
 good and now let's add 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.960
 the sugar 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.309
 well, this is silvia mixed 

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:45.639
 Now what we are going to do is to 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:48.580
 incorporate him 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.150
 and all that and how dry we are going to do it 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.150
 in two parts 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.000
 do not 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.000
 and the mixture 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.720
 boyle now we add the end 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.730
 all right 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.949
 and we go on 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.180
 well this is ready 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.070
 around here there is a chocolate scent 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.560
 chocolate that we go that sure what 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.270
 they are going to have you in the same house and 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.550
 will start to take to the kitchen of 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.770
 people this is capable and I 'm going to 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.550
 fill up three quarters that 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.550
 yes it is important 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.720
 This is a mixture that is not like 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.610
 other cupcakes that go up a lot 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.200
 precisely because of the amount of humidity 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:53.270
 what does he have for the banana 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.400
 but igualito up a little that is 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.440
 what 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.699
 but do not wait for what you do to them 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.699
 bombs those up d 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.190
 to the other cupcakes that give planet 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.190
 exact 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:13.000
 very well and so we do with all 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:14.710
 we are finishing filling this this 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.090
 mix gives us approximately to do 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:21.360
 about 18 or 18 cupcakes if then this 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.340
 we are not going to take them to the oven 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.020
 about like 20 minutes or 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.669
 at least when you are already 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.650
 seeing more or less that they can be 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:33.099
 they puncture in the center if the 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.449
 stick this is that it is ready and if not 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:35.770
 good to wait 20 minutes as 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:38.040
 We always tell you that the oven every 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:43.820
 oven has its 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.820
 his style then 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:53.390
 monitoring the mass that does not disappear by 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:56.910
 the city road that I control 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:59.660
 good if I come here with cupcakes 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:03.570
 chocolate Bananas 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.640
 good silvia a a little advice that I give 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.770
 is that once you have already taken 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.040
 of the oven and leave them ten minutes 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.380
 inside the mold because of course 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.300
 having so much moisture of the 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.950
 banana all this are like more dense 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.170
 then you have to wait for it to 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.210
 continue to maintain the form of this 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.340
 way or it has stayed ten minutes 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.960
 in the mold once the 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.730
 ten minutes as they pass it to a 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.020
 grate and let it cool there 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.260
 quietly until they can be 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:34.950
 eat we will teach you 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:40.009
 how are they inside because what they 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:42.620
 we said that it has a fluffiness 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:45.949
 wonderful 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:49.370
 look how they are inside 

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:52.880
 this is going on show and 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:55.400
 I do not even know that this is what 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.199
 try it out they have to do it at home to 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.960
 let's go the applause does not fit in your 

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:02.210
 home that and that then the rating of in 

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.250
 house all the time over giving him the 

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.080
 last key irresistible touch that is 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.240
 in carolina thank you again like 

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.139
 always to you I will tell you that 

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.139
 continue with us
