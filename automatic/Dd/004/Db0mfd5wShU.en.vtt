00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
okay swing feel I have a lot of students

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.650 
okay swing feel I have a lot of students
that<00:00:04.740> they<00:00:05.040> hear<00:00:05.940> me<00:00:06.029> play<00:00:06.180> jazz<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.450> they

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
that they hear me play jazz and they

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.110 
that they hear me play jazz and they
automatically<00:00:07.140> want<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.500> jump<00:00:07.740> into<00:00:07.919> it<00:00:08.120> but

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
automatically want to jump into it but

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.570 
automatically want to jump into it but
it<00:00:09.420> comes<00:00:09.900> with<00:00:10.139> time<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.679> really<00:00:10.950> develop<00:00:11.130> it

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
it comes with time to really develop it

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.850 
it comes with time to really develop it
I<00:00:12.030> had<00:00:12.389> some<00:00:12.540> really<00:00:12.750> good<00:00:12.900> teachers<00:00:13.110> that

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
I had some really good teachers that

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.860 
I had some really good teachers that
have<00:00:13.950> helped<00:00:14.190> me<00:00:14.309> out<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.759> usually<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.750> starts

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
have helped me out and usually it starts

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.660 
have helped me out and usually it starts
with<00:00:16.230> just<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.560> ride<00:00:16.770> cymbal<00:00:17.070> I've<00:00:17.310> had<00:00:17.460> some

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
with just a ride cymbal I've had some

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.849 
with just a ride cymbal I've had some
lessons<00:00:18.359> with<00:00:18.480> Jason<00:00:18.810> Marsalis<00:00:19.289> Israel

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
lessons with Jason Marsalis Israel

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.010 
lessons with Jason Marsalis Israel
Bannerman<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.850> literally<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.840> first

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
Bannerman that literally the first

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.960 
Bannerman that literally the first
lesson<00:00:22.470> was<00:00:22.560> nothing<00:00:22.980> but<00:00:23.310> ride<00:00:23.580> cymbal

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
lesson was nothing but ride cymbal

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.550 
lesson was nothing but ride cymbal
nothing<00:00:24.240> else<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.630> then<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> room<00:00:25.410> other

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
nothing else and then in the room other

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.689 
nothing else and then in the room other
than<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.710> pair<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.949> sticks<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> ride<00:00:26.490> cymbal

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
than a pair of sticks on the ride cymbal

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.660 
than a pair of sticks on the ride cymbal
so<00:00:27.359> that's<00:00:27.510> how<00:00:27.660> important<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.670> playing

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
so that's how important it is to playing

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
so that's how important it is to playing
jazz<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.579> let's<00:00:32.579> start<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.000> okay

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
jazz is that let's start with it okay

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.840 
jazz is that let's start with it okay
the<00:00:33.960> basic<00:00:34.140> pattern<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:35.340> based<00:00:35.670> off<00:00:35.820> of

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the basic pattern is based off of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.940 
the basic pattern is based off of
quarter<00:00:36.239> notes<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.660> there's<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> skip<00:00:37.710> notes

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
quarter notes and there's a skip notes

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.500 
quarter notes and there's a skip notes
in<00:00:38.129> there<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> hands<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.270> start

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
in there with the hands so you start

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.760 
in there with the hands so you start
with<00:00:39.540> quarters<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:41.989> then<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.140> add<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.559> skip

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
with quarters one then you add a skip

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.290 
with quarters one then you add a skip
note

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.210 

it's<00:00:53.300> basically<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:54.050> swing<00:00:54.260> pattern<00:00:54.560> if<00:00:55.100> you

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
it's basically the swing pattern if you

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.640 
it's basically the swing pattern if you
really<00:00:55.550> want<00:00:55.700> to<00:00:55.790> work<00:00:55.940> on<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:56.500> improve<00:00:57.500> it

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
really want to work on it and improve it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.200 
really want to work on it and improve it
which<00:00:57.830> I<00:00:57.980> still<00:00:58.190> need<00:00:58.400> to<00:00:58.520> do<00:00:58.670> there's<00:00:59.000> always

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
which I still need to do there's always

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.910 
which I still need to do there's always
room<00:00:59.570> for<00:00:59.600> improvement<00:00:59.900> regardless<00:01:00.740> of<00:01:00.800> how

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
room for improvement regardless of how

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.880 
room for improvement regardless of how
long<00:01:01.070> you've<00:01:01.220> been<00:01:01.250> doing<00:01:01.670> something<00:01:02.890> next

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
long you've been doing something next

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.500 
long you've been doing something next
thing<00:01:04.010> I<00:01:04.130> would<00:01:04.190> do<00:01:04.400> is<00:01:04.520> add<00:01:04.730> the<00:01:05.000> hi-hat<00:01:05.180> on

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
thing I would do is add the hi-hat on

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:13.570 
thing I would do is add the hi-hat on
beats<00:01:05.720> two<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:05.930> four<00:01:06.050> so<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:06.500> have<00:01:06.620> one<00:01:12.580> good

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
beats two and four so you have one good

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.280 
beats two and four so you have one good
little<00:01:13.820> trick<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.180> do<00:01:14.330> it's<00:01:14.510> a<00:01:14.570> little<00:01:14.600> hard<00:01:15.140> at

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
little trick to do it's a little hard at

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.890 
little trick to do it's a little hard at
first<00:01:15.320> for<00:01:15.740> coordination<00:01:16.160> wise<00:01:16.460> is<00:01:16.900> put

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
first for coordination wise is put

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.990 
first for coordination wise is put
triplets<00:01:18.620> on<00:01:19.070> your<00:01:19.190> left<00:01:19.370> hand<00:01:19.610> on<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:19.880> snare

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
triplets on your left hand on the snare

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.550 
triplets on your left hand on the snare
drum<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.690> make<00:01:20.810> sure<00:01:20.960> everything<00:01:21.260> is<00:01:21.290> lining

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
drum to make sure everything is lining

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.200 
drum to make sure everything is lining
up<00:01:21.740> very<00:01:21.980> similar<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.550> Rock<00:01:22.730> patterns<00:01:23.120> we

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
up very similar to the Rock patterns we

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.770 
up very similar to the Rock patterns we
did<00:01:23.330> earlier<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:24.520> would<00:01:25.520> be<00:01:25.640> like<00:01:25.790> this<00:01:26.000> one

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
did earlier that would be like this one

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.140 
did earlier that would be like this one
triplet<00:01:27.080> two<00:01:27.619> triplet<00:01:27.650> three<00:01:28.280> triplet<00:01:28.580> four

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
triplet two triplet three triplet four

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:47.260 
triplet two triplet three triplet four
triplet<00:01:44.860> by<00:01:45.860> doing<00:01:46.220> that<00:01:46.430> I<00:01:46.640> can<00:01:46.700> visually<00:01:47.240> see

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
triplet by doing that I can visually see

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.480 
triplet by doing that I can visually see
everything<00:01:47.869> lining<00:01:48.320> up<00:01:48.440> my<00:01:48.680> body<00:01:48.860> can<00:01:49.130> feel<00:01:49.340> it

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
everything lining up my body can feel it

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.640 
everything lining up my body can feel it
lining<00:01:49.729> up<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.119> helps<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:51.080> I<00:01:51.110> use<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.530> as

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
lining up and it helps so I use that as

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.770 
lining up and it helps so I use that as
a<00:01:51.680> warm<00:01:51.950> up<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.280> lot<00:01:52.520> for<00:01:52.759> jazz<00:01:52.970> especially<00:01:53.570> so

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
a warm up a lot for jazz especially so

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.430 
a warm up a lot for jazz especially so
keep<00:01:54.020> going<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:59.690> what<00:01:59.840> I'd<00:01:59.930> like<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.050> do<00:02:00.260> is

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
keep going and what I'd like to do is

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.160 
keep going and what I'd like to do is
take<00:02:00.650> that<00:02:00.680> up<00:02:00.950> ten<00:02:01.370> beats<00:02:01.520> per<00:02:01.760> minute<00:02:02.170> after

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
take that up ten beats per minute after

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.080 
take that up ten beats per minute after
I<00:02:03.200> feel<00:02:03.380> comfortable<00:02:03.800> move<00:02:04.159> on<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:04.820> get<00:02:05.000> as

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
I feel comfortable move on and get as

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.760 
I feel comfortable move on and get as
fast<00:02:05.270> as<00:02:05.480> I<00:02:05.540> can<00:02:05.720> get<00:02:05.870> in<00:02:06.170> meanwhile<00:02:06.680> I'm

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
fast as I can get in meanwhile I'm

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.380 
fast as I can get in meanwhile I'm
working<00:02:06.830> on<00:02:07.100> my<00:02:07.220> left<00:02:07.400> hand<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.850> my<00:02:08.000> swing

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
working on my left hand and my swing

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.520 
working on my left hand and my swing
patterns<00:02:08.720> getting<00:02:08.989> cleaned<00:02:09.229> up<00:02:09.350> in<00:02:09.500> the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
patterns getting cleaned up in the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.050 
patterns getting cleaned up in the
process<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.390> that's<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.530> basics<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.070> the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
process and so that's the basics of the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.030 
process and so that's the basics of the
swing<00:02:14.330> fill<00:02:14.600> without<00:02:14.959> this<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.590> wouldn't<00:02:15.950> do
