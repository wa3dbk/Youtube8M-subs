rituals<00:01:31.670> but<00:01:31.939> but<00:01:32.689> somehow<00:01:32.899> when<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.530> concept

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
rituals but but somehow when the concept

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.580 
rituals but but somehow when the concept
gets<00:01:34.159> closer<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:34.999> closer<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.899> even<00:01:36.289> if

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
gets closer and closer and you even if

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.719 
gets closer and closer and you even if
you<00:01:36.710> are<00:01:37.750> dead<00:01:38.750> tired<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.679> something<00:01:40.130> happens

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
you are dead tired to something happens

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.910 
you are dead tired to something happens
and<00:01:40.819> you<00:01:40.909> you<00:01:41.270> get<00:01:41.450> some<00:01:41.689> energy<00:01:41.990> in<00:01:42.380> Japan

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
and you you get some energy in Japan

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.050 
and you you get some energy in Japan
actually<00:01:43.219> before<00:01:43.850> after<00:01:45.369> am<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:46.549> have<00:01:46.939> the

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
actually before after am you have the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.139 
actually before after am you have the
orchestra<00:01:47.509> around<00:01:47.929> for<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.409> SS<00:01:48.649> Terrence

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.190 
orchestra around for the SS Terrence
it's<00:01:50.149> kind<00:01:50.299> of<00:01:50.420> impossible<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:51.079> be

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
it's kind of impossible to be

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.730 
it's kind of impossible to be
interesting<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:53.119> think<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.990> Spurs<00:01:54.319> culture

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
interesting I think the Spurs culture

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.490 
interesting I think the Spurs culture
that<00:01:54.950> has<00:01:55.099> not<00:01:55.310> very<00:01:55.780> much<00:01:56.780> time<00:01:56.810> for<00:01:57.319> some

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
that has not very much time for some

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.059 
that has not very much time for some
what<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:57.649> still<00:01:58.009> try<00:01:58.549> to<00:01:58.579> relax<00:01:59.119> yeah<00:01:59.799> even<00:02:00.799> know

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
what I still try to relax yeah even know

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.080 
what I still try to relax yeah even know
it's<00:02:01.609> not<00:02:01.849> kind<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.239> it's<00:02:02.989> not<00:02:04.090> relaxation

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
it's not kind of it's not relaxation

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.850 
it's not kind of it's not relaxation
music<00:02:06.969> but<00:02:07.969> anyway<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.140> audience<00:02:09.470> was<00:02:09.619> very

especially before we've got I think it's

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.770
