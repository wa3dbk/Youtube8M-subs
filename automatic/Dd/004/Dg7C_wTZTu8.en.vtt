when i would take them out my whole hey

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.980 
when i would take them out my whole hey
hey<00:02:01.170> my<00:02:02.040> whole<00:02:02.250> head<00:02:02.579> was<00:02:02.610> teased<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.719> I

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
hey my whole head was teased and so I

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.600 
hey my whole head was teased and so I
would<00:02:04.350> have<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.710> put<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.100> loads<00:02:05.399> of

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
would have to put in loads of

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.749 
would have to put in loads of
conditioner<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.540> even<00:02:07.500> after<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.729> know

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
conditioner and even after that you know

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.699 
conditioner and even after that you know
I<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.599> much<00:02:09.720> tangles<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.410> its

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
I just have so much tangles and its

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.120 
I just have so much tangles and its
really<00:02:11.250> damaging<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.940> your

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
really damaging to your

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.190 
really damaging to your
hair<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:12.670> this<00:02:12.940> definitely<00:02:13.360> saves<00:02:13.840> my<00:02:14.020> hair

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
hair so this definitely saves my hair

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.090 
hair so this definitely saves my hair
from<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:15.280> all<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.060> teasing<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.630> this<00:02:17.500> shade

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
from the all the teasing and this shade

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.910 
from the all the teasing and this shade
is<00:02:18.130> darker<00:02:19.000> than<00:02:19.030> my<00:02:19.840> roots<00:02:20.080> if<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.500> can<00:02:20.680> tell

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
is darker than my roots if you can tell

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.480 
is darker than my roots if you can tell
but<00:02:21.190> my<00:02:21.760> hair<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.110> lightly<00:02:23.110> on<00:02:23.560> braids<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.130> so

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
but my hair is lightly on braids and so

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.090 
but my hair is lightly on braids and so
I<00:02:24.850> chose<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.600> color<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.260> if<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.650> color<00:02:26.860> fits

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
I chose a color and if the color fits

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.100 
I chose a color and if the color fits

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.810 
especially on the bottom sections
because<00:03:49.000> I<00:03:49.390> find<00:03:50.050> that<00:03:50.260> those<00:03:50.770> curls<00:03:51.250> tend<00:03:51.730> to

00:03:51.820 --> 00:04:04.300 
because I find that those curls tend to
fall<00:03:52.030> out<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.270> quickest

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.520 

I<00:04:04.370> forgot<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.330> mention<00:04:05.360> in<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.930> intro<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.470> I

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
I forgot to mention in the intro that I

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.380 
I forgot to mention in the intro that I
prefer<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:06.890> curl<00:04:07.250> my<00:04:07.280> extensions<00:04:07.880> ahead<00:04:08.270> of

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
prefer to curl my extensions ahead of

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.210 
prefer to curl my extensions ahead of
time<00:04:08.569> because<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.900> saves<00:04:09.260> me<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:09.830> much<00:04:09.890> more

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
time because it saves me so much more

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.880 
time because it saves me so much more
time<00:04:10.459> our<00:04:11.150> arms<00:04:11.420> get<00:04:11.599> tired<00:04:11.630> really<00:04:12.290> fast<00:04:12.410> and

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
time our arms get tired really fast and

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.830 
time our arms get tired really fast and
also<00:04:13.220> my<00:04:13.340> hair<00:04:13.370> curls<00:04:13.880> a<00:04:14.060> lot<00:04:14.300> faster<00:04:14.690> than

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
also my hair curls a lot faster than

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.990 
also my hair curls a lot faster than
extensions<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:16.040> if<00:04:16.160> I<00:04:16.220> curl<00:04:16.519> them<00:04:16.669> together

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
extensions so if I curl them together

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.909 
extensions so if I curl them together
only<00:04:17.359> my<00:04:17.480> hair<00:04:17.690> would<00:04:17.840> be<00:04:17.870> curled<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.650> not<00:04:18.799> the

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
only my hair would be curled and not the

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.470 
only my hair would be curled and not the
extensions<00:04:19.370> but<00:04:19.579> if<00:04:19.700> I<00:04:19.820> leave<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.150> in<00:04:20.269> too<00:04:20.299> long

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
extensions but if I leave it in too long

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.690 
extensions but if I leave it in too long
I<00:04:20.840> would<00:04:21.049> be<00:04:21.169> burning<00:04:21.530> my<00:04:21.620> own<00:04:21.769> hair

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.460 

I'm<00:04:28.700> just<00:04:28.970> going<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.330> continue<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:29.870> section

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
I'm just going to continue to section

00:04:30.470 --> 00:05:13.780 
I'm just going to continue to section
curl<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.310> clip<00:04:31.610> in<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.880> extensions

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.270 

now<00:05:14.780> at<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.050> top<00:05:15.230> sections<00:05:15.800> I'd<00:05:15.980> like<00:05:16.130> to

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
now at the top sections I'd like to

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.060 
now at the top sections I'd like to
tease<00:05:17.030> and<00:05:17.390> curl<00:05:17.810> a<00:05:17.840> certain<00:05:18.500> way<00:05:18.650> so<00:05:18.680> the

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
tease and curl a certain way so the

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.160 
tease and curl a certain way so the
video<00:05:19.190> is<00:05:19.340> pretty<00:05:19.580> self-explanatory<00:05:19.970> and<00:05:20.720> I'm

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
video is pretty self-explanatory and I'm

00:05:21.170 --> 00:06:17.880 
video is pretty self-explanatory and I'm
just<00:05:21.320> going<00:05:21.440> to<00:05:21.530> let<00:05:21.680> it<00:05:21.710> play<00:05:21.920> through

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.440 

so<00:06:18.890> for<00:06:19.100> the<00:06:19.190> front<00:06:19.490> sections<00:06:20.060> of<00:06:20.210> your<00:06:20.270> hair

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
so for the front sections of your hair

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.420 
so for the front sections of your hair
make<00:06:20.930> sure<00:06:21.140> that<00:06:21.290> your<00:06:21.410> curling<00:06:21.770> away<00:06:22.220> from

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
make sure that your curling away from

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:31.430 
make sure that your curling away from
your<00:06:22.580> face

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:55.150 

you

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.470 

now<00:06:56.160> going<00:06:56.370> back<00:06:56.520> with<00:06:56.790> the<00:06:56.880> comb<00:06:57.120> I'm<00:06:57.360> just

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.480 
now going back with the comb I'm just

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.840 
now going back with the comb I'm just
moving<00:06:57.750> out<00:06:58.139> on<00:06:58.500> the<00:06:58.530> front<00:06:59.220> sections<00:06:59.639> of<00:06:59.760> my

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
moving out on the front sections of my

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.580 
moving out on the front sections of my
hair<00:06:59.880> and<00:07:00.120> if<00:07:00.449> there's<00:07:00.660> any<00:07:00.900> of<00:07:01.139> the<00:07:01.260> two<00:07:01.530> you

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
hair and if there's any of the two you

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.930 
hair and if there's any of the two you
think<00:07:01.770> that's<00:07:01.919> showing<00:07:02.280> through<00:07:02.430> the<00:07:02.550> top<00:07:02.760> of

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
think that's showing through the top of

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.760 
think that's showing through the top of
my<00:07:03.060> hair<00:07:03.330> to<00:07:03.810> just<00:07:04.020> make<00:07:04.169> a<00:07:04.199> smooth<00:07:04.530> so<00:07:04.710> it

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
my hair to just make a smooth so it

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.610 
my hair to just make a smooth so it
doesn't<00:07:05.010> look<00:07:05.070> like<00:07:05.130> a<00:07:05.280> bird's<00:07:05.550> nest<00:07:09.410> so<00:07:10.410> this

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 
doesn't look like a bird's nest so this

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.170 
doesn't look like a bird's nest so this
is<00:07:10.650> the<00:07:10.800> finished<00:07:11.100> look<00:07:11.370> and<00:07:11.729> I<00:07:11.790> hope<00:07:11.940> that<00:07:11.970> you

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
is the finished look and I hope that you

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.830 
is the finished look and I hope that you
all<00:07:12.210> enjoyed<00:07:12.330> this<00:07:12.810> and<00:07:13.020> found<00:07:13.169> it<00:07:13.350> helpful
