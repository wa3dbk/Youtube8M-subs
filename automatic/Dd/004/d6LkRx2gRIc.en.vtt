00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.010
 so here today I present you 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.290
 various collage work on canvas 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.990
 so as you can see here I am 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.030
 am amused to use old photos 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.230
 like here old family photos 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.720
 when I find in the attic 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.420
 I simply photocopied and 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.400
 seedling with varnish glue here g10 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.680
 and lace from a fall to all 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.680
 can be glued back this is what is 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.440
 owl 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.809
 so that's it for the first so that's at 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:46.150
 50 cm by 50 cm is the second rather 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:48.329
 on red donations so similar 1gbe green 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.570
 hillside I handed over two acrylic 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:57.000
 always with lace to leave 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:01.629
 English speaking as beautiful as the canvas 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.310
 So here it is for the latter is 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:11.320
 a 50 cm out of 59 which he if these two the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.750
 last I'm coming really makes me 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.009
 I saw didier as diverse around 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:21.460
 pictures of tattoos like here I am 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.670
 went into books of you I'm having fun 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.380
 also with the bomb and I used the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.450
 technique of toothbrushes soaked in 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:35.770
 a white clip just price at all 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:38.979
 just here is another one that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.979
 I put on another stove are 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.620
 given a little bit of depth to 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.650
 first table so I sum you up 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.940

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.110

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.760
 also to put upside down 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:01.510
 you are no longer called the eye so here is 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.540
 here we have a table that is rather 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.490
 on the new loops of the time of 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.770
 much softer still 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.610

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.400
