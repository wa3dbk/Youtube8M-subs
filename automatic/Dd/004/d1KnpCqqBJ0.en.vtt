00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello how about all the gamers here 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.140
 femeti as always I hope you are 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.059
 super mega turbo jos and welcome to 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.590
 channel in this video I want to talk about 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.210
 how is the move with the new ones the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.660
 new ranking system that just 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.160
 put in halo 4 and good the truth is that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.320
 I did not give my point of view when they left 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.660
 do not even talk about the subject but good 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.519
 let's see the good beige on the map 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.369
 hey well how can you are 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.019
 appreciating and well let's talk according to 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.210
 the system was sold round see us according to 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.270
 a system of ranges from 0 to 50 was entered 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.649
 in what has been turning 4 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.020
 practically that's how you can say 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.700
 as the skill and its going that in the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.300
 List of game you lÃ©ger 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 you're level 20 30 or 40 or 50 is not that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.750
 skill level will end how much 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.629
 good you are in this playlist something 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.210
 what happened with halo 302 if I did not 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.219
 wrong and good created that had kilo 3 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.860
 suppose you enter the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.280
 clasificatorias that they were being 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.370
 suppose he is a lone wolf, not a wolf 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.860
 lonely you had to level up and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.450
 it was based on ability if you lost 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.700
 games then they took away some 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.740
 points or more practically we 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.240
 they went up or up or up and if you won 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.340
 game if I won if you won because I was going 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.840
 rising level and you reached 50 that 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.179
 was the highest skill range or 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.490
 obviously that is to say that it reached 50 it was 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.740
 quite an achievement and the most important thing is that 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.259
 it was in each playlist that he wants 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.829
 say that you can do 50 in wolf 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.200
 solitary and could be level 3 in team 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.340
 slayer or team duel then that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.780
 it was something that made the game 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.090
 did a little more entertaining and I was 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.110
 looking for my king the boom my radio weapon 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.000
 if I did not find it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.720
 it's something that made the game a little more 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.899
 competitive and a little more hook you 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.929
 hooked to a game more than you out 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.849
 that you just jump on your bike before we go 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.560
 to call it that way you do not have to be 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.659
 honest things as they are 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.670
 it does a little more in vicente is something 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.020
 as well as the call of duty that you have to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.179
 unlock the weapons and then the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.220
 camouflage of each weapon and you nail for 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.039
 the same does not get you to unlock the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.229
 camouflages and this one enters then 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.000
 It was what made the game turning on March 1 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.280
 little more fun a little more 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.400
 competitive but now together with hello 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.670
 of that guy was invisible call 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.349
 now I freeze 4 what happened that is the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.140
 range system did not get it out when 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.189
 the game comes out but they waited 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.019
 very much time the game that watson 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.879
 November if I 'm not wrong December 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.040
 january february march april may five 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.140
 good months we are in April not but 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.700
 we are almost in May 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.260
 obviously we are not going to introduce ourselves 5 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.049
 months in taking out the new system of 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.790
 ranks that's something very hopeless already 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.400
 that if I had taken it from a 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.650
 it would be something else 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.510
 and eye to ashes and faye mind is that I do not 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.359
 I see people saying that level 20 or 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.709
 well and so on or so that is because only 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.170
 you can go directly on the page 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.980
 of halloween by is way point true that 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.069
 it is illogical and ridiculous and absurd or 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.109
 whether if you put if you are going to put a 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.090
 skill range system that 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.329
 let's say I'm 130 but the wolf 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.560
 solitary I'm level 40 or 50 that looks 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:11.870
 but what kind of light does it serve or what is the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.370
 point to put a skill if when 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.409
 I went to play I will not know what 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.000
 range are the other types not because 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.120
 I was a kid I decided to enter a list 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.599
 Manches these pure baths 58 and 19 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.950
 that's not all the same 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.580
 The first is to be able to presume that 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.040
 level 50 in such a list of games 50 m 50 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.709
 in team swat 50 in team is nike pesos a 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.140
 that was the point that when you will play 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.370
 when you are looking for the pleasant part 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.049
 in that hidden guy waiting for you 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.450
 someone will pass to kill him or that is 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.400
 the point then if they do so for 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.390
 what the hell they put it or that is to me 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.300
 point of view the truth is that it is 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.310
 ridiculous the truth is that is is absurd 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.190
 and it does not make sense the truth that for me 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.709
 it does not make sense that's my point 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.379
 seen as how I want to give them 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.989
 understand that is my point of view I 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.629
 I respect the opinions of all 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.690
 people because every head is a world 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:11.150
 if you think differently if you think 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.180
 that the truth is right that people do not 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.070
 you can see it because that's your point 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.169
 seen the truth is that you have to respect 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.729
 new respect your point of view me from 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.010
 my point of view the truth is that no 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.419
 I agree with that or I'm not 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.090
 agree because it's still the same 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.610
 that is, it does not follow 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.650
 or is there no such factor Vicente 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.900
 turn 4 there is no that factor 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.270
 I want to be level 50 in all the lists 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.190
 of game this as it happens with a call of 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.590
 duty that I want to reach the maximum 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.990
 prestige to prestige 10 no that's what 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.970
 what happens with the turn that there is not that 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.180
 do not invent I want to do or you get to 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.789
 that 130 and there is nothing or there is no longer 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.950
 level 50 individual was much more 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.290
 difficult to climb in halo 3 because it was a 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.730
 Skill- based system 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.950
 richie helllo 4 that the origin of what 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.630
 four is much easier because it goes 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.880
 going up normal in change hello 3 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.130
 you had to get to level 50 then 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.900
 play experience to play social 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.420
 so they have experience and then the 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.220
 clasificatorias and was were were were 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.980
 much harder the games of the wolf 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.500
 solo and at level 40 42 also counts 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.360
 guns or they were well cannons and the 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.220
 the truth is that they are the guys ok but 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.540
 good are my views 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.160
