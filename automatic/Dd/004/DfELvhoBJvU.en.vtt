00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.410
 I am very surprised that this 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.900
 it really was practical but my aunt in 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:19.980
 any bag and you do not notice it does not weigh 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:21.900
 and I could carry everything I think that what 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.529
 does I'm using for the moment is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.869
 the calendar and I'm leaving almost of 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.400
 aside the notebook that I had I have it without 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.570
 made with the computer then I 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.769
 I was able to make changes wherever I wanted 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.600
 that is and for example comes a 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.640
 assistant checks the computer and knows 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.790
 what change about things that adhered 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.790
 until 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.850
 I got off the skateboard and started 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.900
 slap the sea some things and right now 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.670
 for example I am testing all the 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.050
 tools is much easier and with 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.940
 precision in the car I have a text 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.739
 long it's obviously easier to handle 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.900
 with your fingers just here to be 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.000
 with the pens or bring a palette of 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.830
 Watercolor colors without needing 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.660
 have water brushes etc 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.660
 sketched to the spa is perfect 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.100
 what of the 20 states we have simplified 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.990
 several things because for example it makes a 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.360
 month studying a workshop of notebooks 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.009
 of drawing and what I was doing is that 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.630
 the guys finished their jobs the 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.549
 photographed he asked for his thousand and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.670
 sent I did not like it very much because I can 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.290
 have the record of day to day and apart 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.880
 they also because we had their 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 houses we had the pictures and they 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.299
 they cut the touch of your blog or the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.649
 they sent their friends the maps 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.960
 time is serving quite a bit because I 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.899
 I'm usually very bad at remembering 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.000
 names and addresses and here simply 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.850
 I put the addresses and appear media 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.860
 also the days how to get there and that does not 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.780
 it helped a lot 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.150
 I like being able to go to the story that I 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.640
 they gave advice they helped me explain 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.860
 my money put my cats taught me 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.430
 how to download applications like buy 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.430
 the rebar 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.570
 has changed in the way of moving around 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.250
 the computer world with camera 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.720
 tripod etc 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.720
 the small bag
