00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
said it was very interesting that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.510 
said it was very interesting that
Richard<00:01:24.990> was<00:01:25.140> saying<00:01:25.380> something<00:01:25.650> against<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
Richard was saying something against the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.620 
Richard was saying something against the
auctions<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:28.020> chuck<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.500> chiming<00:01:29.010> in<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.630> so

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
auctions and chuck was chiming in and so

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.450 
auctions and chuck was chiming in and so
I<00:01:30.659> feel<00:01:31.110> why<00:01:31.320> should<00:01:31.560> say<00:01:31.650> something<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I feel why should say something for the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.450 
I feel why should say something for the
auction<00:01:32.640> houses<00:01:33.440> just<00:01:34.440> to<00:01:34.650> balance<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.340> out

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
auction houses just to balance it out

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.020 
auction houses just to balance it out
here<00:01:36.530> remember<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.770> something<00:01:38.610> sells<00:01:38.790> at

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
here remember if something sells at

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.380 
here remember if something sells at
auction<00:01:39.530> somebody<00:01:40.530> bought<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.000> that<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.330> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
auction somebody bought it that is a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.280 
auction somebody bought it that is a
fact<00:01:43.909> doesn't<00:01:44.909> matter<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.360> they<00:01:45.510> chandelier

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
fact doesn't matter if they chandelier

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.990 
fact doesn't matter if they chandelier
dit<00:01:46.500> doesn't<00:01:46.890> matter<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.100> they<00:01:47.190> advertise<00:01:47.760> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
dit doesn't matter if they advertise it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.570 
dit doesn't matter if they advertise it
I<00:01:48.150> don't<00:01:48.659> care<00:01:48.870> if<00:01:48.930> they<00:01:49.170> shined<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.130> shoe

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
I don't care if they shined it with shoe

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.990 
I don't care if they shined it with shoe
polish<00:01:51.380> somebody<00:01:52.380> bought<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.790> can

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
polish somebody bought it and we can

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.930 
polish somebody bought it and we can
actually<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.370> not<00:01:56.580> possible

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
actually see that that is not possible

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.800 
actually see that that is not possible
in<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.750> private<00:01:58.200> market<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.270> for<00:02:00.270> better<00:02:00.510> for

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
in the private market so for better for

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.200 
in the private market so for better for
worse<00:02:01.010> this<00:02:02.010> market<00:02:02.460> wouldn't<00:02:02.700> exist<00:02:02.970> without

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
worse this market wouldn't exist without

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.560 
worse this market wouldn't exist without
the<00:02:03.540> auction<00:02:03.930> houses<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.490> need<00:02:06.090> them<00:02:06.360> as

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the auction houses and we need them as

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.960 
the auction houses and we need them as
collectors<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.680> think<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.220> dealers<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.879> I

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
collectors I think as dealers and I

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.509 
collectors I think as dealers and I
think<00:02:09.349> artists<00:02:10.349> often<00:02:10.530> don't<00:02:10.950> understand

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
think artists often don't understand

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.330 
think artists often don't understand
