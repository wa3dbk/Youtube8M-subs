00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
have to do this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.120

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
it makes it easier when you're using the

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.390 
it makes it easier when you're using the
dust<00:00:51.340> box<00:00:52.650> anyway<00:00:53.650> there's<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.040> two<00:00:54.190> files

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
dust box anyway there's the two files

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.390 
dust box anyway there's the two files
that<00:00:54.580> we've<00:00:54.820> that<00:00:55.510> were<00:00:55.630> created<00:00:56.200> from<00:00:57.160> the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
that we've that were created from the

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.330 
that we've that were created from the
archive<00:00:58.239> file<00:00:58.960> and<00:00:59.860> we're<00:00:59.980> just<00:01:00.070> going<00:01:00.250> to

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
archive file and we're just going to

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.390 
archive file and we're just going to
match<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.910> location<00:01:01.210> of<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.440> C<00:01:02.650> Drive<00:01:02.830> for

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
match the location of the C Drive for

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.010 
match the location of the C Drive for
all<00:01:03.460> intents<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:03.880> purposes<00:01:03.970> as<00:01:04.600> far<00:01:04.780> as<00:01:04.870> the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
all intents and purposes as far as the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.960 
all intents and purposes as far as the
emulator<00:01:05.410> is<00:01:05.560> concerned<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.280> then<00:01:06.820> we're

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
emulator is concerned and then we're

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.540 
emulator is concerned and then we're
going<00:01:07.120> to<00:01:07.150> allocate<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.750> some<00:01:08.200> free<00:01:09.010> space<00:01:09.190> of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
going to allocate it some free space of

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:17.020 
going to allocate it some free space of
about<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:10.090> gigabyte<00:01:11.190> or<00:01:12.190> a<00:01:12.250> thousand<00:01:12.970> megabytes

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.890 

and<00:01:17.980> then<00:01:18.980> we'll<00:01:19.190> mount<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:20.030> D<00:01:20.270> drives<00:01:20.570> want

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
and then we'll mount the D drives want

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.350 
and then we'll mount the D drives want
contents<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.650> purposes<00:01:22.100> as<00:01:22.370> far<00:01:22.730> as<00:01:23.000> the

emulator<00:01:24.320> is<00:01:24.560> concerned<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:25.820> will<00:01:26.150> be<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
emulator is concerned this will be the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.560 
emulator is concerned this will be the
location<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.620> CD<00:01:28.900> and<00:01:31.300> this<00:01:32.300> will<00:01:32.450> be

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
location of the CD and this will be

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.540 
location of the CD and this will be
where<00:01:32.750> we<00:01:32.900> will<00:01:33.020> install<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.590> game<00:01:33.800> from<00:01:34.990> No

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
where we will install the game from No

where we will install the game from No
I've<00:01:37.550> written<00:01:37.790> CD<00:01:38.360> ROM<00:01:38.570> there<00:01:38.780> in<00:01:39.050> capitals

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
I've written CD ROM there in capitals

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.359 
I've written CD ROM there in capitals
this<00:01:40.369> is<00:01:40.520> unknown<00:01:41.240> oh<00:01:41.890> but<00:01:42.890> I<00:01:42.920> want<00:01:43.160> to<00:01:43.250> show

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
because a few people have said that this

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.320 
because a few people have said that this
instruction<00:01:49.220> doesn't<00:01:49.610> work<00:01:49.850> there<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:50.119> can

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
instruction doesn't work there you can

see<00:01:50.509> illegal<00:01:51.290> type<00:01:51.530> CD<00:01:51.890> ROM<00:01:52.160> now<00:01:52.340> what<00:01:52.520> you

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
see illegal type CD ROM now what you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.790 
see illegal type CD ROM now what you
have<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:53.000> do<00:01:53.360> is<00:01:53.780> make<00:01:54.140> sure<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:54.380> when<00:01:54.680> you

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
have to do is make sure that when you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.639 
have to do is make sure that when you
type<00:01:55.040> cd-rom<00:01:55.729> that<00:01:55.940> you<00:01:56.270> do<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.630> in<00:01:56.869> all

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
type cd-rom that you do it in all

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.580 
type cd-rom that you do it in all
lowercase<00:01:58.660> because<00:01:59.660> otherwise<00:01:59.899> it<00:02:00.200> spits<00:02:00.470> it

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
lowercase because otherwise it spits it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:11.490 
lowercase because otherwise it spits it
back<00:02:00.649> out<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.009> you

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.320 

right<00:02:12.070> but<00:02:12.490> make<00:02:12.670> sure<00:02:12.700> when<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:13.090> do<00:02:13.210> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
right but make sure when you do the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.020 
right but make sure when you do the
label<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:14.080> mean<00:02:14.230> dagger<00:02:14.530> Falls<00:02:14.860> D<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.760> in

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
label that mean dagger Falls D is in

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.190 
label that mean dagger Falls D is in
capitals<00:02:16.480> because<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.810> does<00:02:16.990> make<00:02:17.140> a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
capitals because that does make a

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.140 
capitals because that does make a
difference<00:02:17.590> as<00:02:17.770> well<00:02:17.950> now<00:02:18.640> we're<00:02:18.910> going<00:02:19.060> to

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
difference as well now we're going to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.490 
difference as well now we're going to
launch<00:02:19.990> go<00:02:20.920> into<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.580> D<00:02:22.090> Drive<00:02:22.270> by<00:02:22.900> typing<00:02:23.260> D

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
launch go into the D Drive by typing D

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.990 
launch go into the D Drive by typing D
call<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:24.570> launch<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.810> installation

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
call on and then launch the installation

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.120 
call on and then launch the installation
so<00:02:28.000> there<00:02:28.180> we<00:02:28.270> go

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.590 

yeah<00:02:31.730> agree<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.360> terms<00:02:34.360> install<00:02:35.360> again

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
yeah agree to the terms install again
