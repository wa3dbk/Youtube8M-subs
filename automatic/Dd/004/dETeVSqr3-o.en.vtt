400<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.710> I<00:01:58.670> usually<00:01:59.390> just<00:01:59.600> leave<00:01:59.840> it<00:01:59.960> on<00:01:59.990> the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
400 so I usually just leave it on the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.410 
400 so I usually just leave it on the
Hyatt<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.770> then<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:00.979> can<00:02:01.159> do<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.490> do<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.700> swipe<00:02:02.210> or

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
Hyatt and then I can do to do a swipe or

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.170

two<00:02:02.630> over<00:02:02.930> my<00:02:03.080> hair<00:02:03.350> instead<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.399> having<00:02:04.700> to

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180

your<00:03:07.390> hair<00:03:07.450> but<00:03:08.440> it's<00:03:08.920> what<00:03:09.280> works<00:03:09.490> for<00:03:09.670> me<00:03:09.820> so

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
your hair but it's what works for me so

your hair but it's what works for me so
I<00:03:10.810> guess<00:03:11.680> doesn't<00:03:12.310> really<00:03:12.550> matter<00:03:12.790> as<00:03:13.030> long<00:03:13.060> as

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
I guess doesn't really matter as long as

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.880 
I guess doesn't really matter as long as
you<00:03:13.480> have<00:03:13.660> something<00:03:14.020> that<00:03:14.170> works<00:03:14.290> for<00:03:14.530> you

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
you have something that works for you

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.330 
you have something that works for you

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
when I bought it it was a lot cheaper

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.580 
when I bought it it was a lot cheaper
than<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:27.140> Qi<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:29.330> was<00:03:29.660> one<00:03:29.960> of<00:03:29.990> two<00:03:30.110> things

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590

that<00:03:30.740> my<00:03:30.950> stylist<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:31.730> recommended<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.390> me

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
that my stylist I recommended to me

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.040 
that my stylist I recommended to me
that's<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.110> Qi<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:35.360> still<00:03:35.600> cheaper

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
that's of the Qi and it's still cheaper

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.980 
that's of the Qi and it's still cheaper
I<00:03:36.830> was<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.280> came<00:03:37.520> in<00:03:37.640> fun<00:03:37.850> designs<00:03:38.180> like<00:03:38.780> the

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
I was it came in fun designs like the

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.590 
I was it came in fun designs like the
leopard<00:03:39.140> print<00:03:39.590> or<00:03:39.800> pink<00:03:40.100> but<00:03:40.959> obviously

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
leopard print or pink but obviously

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.180 
leopard print or pink but obviously
function<00:03:44.600> matters<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:44.990> little<00:03:45.260> more<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.920> then

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
function matters a little more and then

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.570 
function matters a little more and then
what<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.910> looks<00:03:47.120> like<00:03:47.360> so<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:49.130> works<00:03:49.340> really

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
what it looks like so it works really

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.440 
what it looks like so it works really
well<00:03:50.650> it's<00:03:51.650> durable<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.640> hasn't<00:03:53.000> gone<00:03:53.090> out<00:03:53.270> at

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
well it's durable it hasn't gone out at

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.180 
well it's durable it hasn't gone out at
me<00:03:53.570> it's<00:03:53.840> one<00:03:54.020> of<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.200> things<00:03:54.470> that<00:03:54.890> when<00:03:55.160> I

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
me it's one of the things that when I

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.310 
me it's one of the things that when I
was<00:03:55.340> looking<00:03:55.520> at<00:03:55.760> reviews<00:03:56.120> years<00:03:56.540> ago<00:03:56.840> it

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
was looking at reviews years ago it

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.100 
was looking at reviews years ago it
seems<00:03:57.920> like<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.760> she<00:03:59.000> was<00:03:59.209> going<00:03:59.480> out<00:03:59.630> a

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
seems like that she was going out a

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.960 
seems like that she was going out a
little<00:04:00.440> more<00:04:00.650> often<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:01.190> not<00:04:01.340> happening<00:04:01.730> in

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
little more often and not happening in

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.690 
little more often and not happening in
the<00:04:02.000> life<00:04:02.270> that<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.870> high<00:04:03.050> does

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
the life that the high does

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.630 
the life that the high does
