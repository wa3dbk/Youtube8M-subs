00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.160
 five packs at 35000 open in this 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.899
 video where dippach to 15000 credit you 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.820
 have of course chosen the packs to 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.860
 35000 so we'll open them in 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.110
 this little video we will try to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.219
 pick up some blue or boost or big 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.320
 players to try at least 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.789
 repay a little bit this pack opening 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.590
 hoping we'll start from the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.840
 more beautiful ways 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.700
 melo for to start a money day 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.960
 yeah it's true that technically the 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.910
 35- bed packs there are a lot a lot 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.220
 many rare cards unfortunately 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.990
 for us it's true that most of 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.210
 horror cards it's going to be it's going to be 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.400
 wanderings consumed in duplicate 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.940
 way chedjou martin are to resell that 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.220
 directly 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.590
 so here's a video that's going to be a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.119
 little bit shorter than the ones 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.220
 previous because it is orderly 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.350
 which hosts a five packs to open 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.400
 here we are going to say that it's going to be a 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.670
 little more a little more 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.530
 hectic hoping to get heavy 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.610
 yeah we have two or three players 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 real players unfortunately set to 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.940
 part or casillas at not even it's worth 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.530
 it's worth a lot we'll watch this 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.060
 quickly 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.060
 meiway aside from casillas 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.860
 way 4000 credit so we do not recover 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.690
 we'll send it to the pile 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.700
 transfers and then I will resell it 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.990
 a little bit later 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.729
 bah listen for the moment that's right 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.220
 that players from the players of the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.479
 how real players there are there 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.430
 there is in blue there is ashamed to the ti 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.930
 but but but but but but but 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.340

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.719
 times europcar barral so 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.979

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.750
 caught just before I hurt I do not even 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.100
 be careful so you see brief 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.849
 again we grabbed a player from 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.890
 real but it's neither ramos nor crous reads nor 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.340

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.260
 no head 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.209
 of head I do not believe in all 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.709
 case in all cases we will continue there 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.989

 strongly alive physically and not 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.459
 strongly because given the chance I have 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.980
 lately it's true that it would be 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.540
