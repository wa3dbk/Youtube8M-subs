00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.830 
don't I don't I don't pick sides I guess
so<00:03:50.070> but<00:03:50.579> I<00:03:50.640> don't<00:03:50.760> know<00:03:50.940> like<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.269> said<00:03:51.480> before<00:03:51.660> I

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
so but I don't know like I said before I

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.360 
so but I don't know like I said before I
think<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.109> would<00:03:52.260> be<00:03:52.380> cool

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370

next-gen gaming you know one of the

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.229 
next-gen gaming you know one of the
things<00:03:55.829> that<00:03:56.130> battlefield<00:03:56.400> can't<00:03:56.820> do<00:03:57.030> on

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
things that battlefield can't do on

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.449 
things that battlefield can't do on
