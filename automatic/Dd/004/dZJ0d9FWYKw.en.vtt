00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
performed well on the day as a team I

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.980 
performed well on the day as a team I
think<00:04:22.070> we<00:04:22.340> did<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.520> very<00:04:22.639> good<00:04:23.180> job<00:04:23.240> we<00:04:23.780> got<00:04:23.960> a

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
think we did a very good job we got a

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.860 
think we did a very good job we got a
fantastic<00:04:24.230> result<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:26.030> think<00:04:26.419> we<00:04:26.690> had<00:04:26.780> a<00:04:26.840> very

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
fantastic result I think we had a very

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.500 
fantastic result I think we had a very
strong<00:04:27.290> weekend<00:04:27.710> in<00:04:27.860> Australia<00:04:28.280> already<00:04:28.580> but

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
strong weekend in Australia already but

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.020 
strong weekend in Australia already but
yeah<00:04:30.350> maybe<00:04:30.560> didn't<00:04:30.919> get<00:04:31.220> quite<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.610> result

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
yeah maybe didn't get quite the result

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.540 
yeah maybe didn't get quite the result
we<00:04:32.150> wanted<00:04:32.510> but<00:04:33.230> in<00:04:33.350> Malaysia<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:33.830> think<00:04:34.160> we

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
we wanted but in Malaysia I think we

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.760 
we wanted but in Malaysia I think we
were<00:04:34.669> surprised<00:04:35.120> again<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:36.020> know<00:04:36.169> be<00:04:36.740> a

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
were surprised again to you know be a

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.650 
were surprised again to you know be a
being<00:04:37.160> at<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.430> table<00:04:37.610> racing<00:04:38.000> at<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.150> top<00:04:38.419> and

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
being at the table racing at the top and

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.290 
being at the table racing at the top and
the<00:04:39.139> whole<00:04:39.169> race<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.710> think<00:04:39.740> yeah<00:04:40.669> we<00:04:41.060> worked

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
the whole race I think yeah we worked

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.330 
the whole race I think yeah we worked
excellently<00:04:42.200> well<00:04:42.470> with<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.800> with<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.100> tires

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
excellently well with the with the tires

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.180 
excellently well with the with the tires
etc<00:04:43.639> so<00:04:44.270> I<00:04:44.480> think<00:04:45.139> that's<00:04:45.440> what<00:04:45.650> people<00:04:45.680> forgot

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
etc so I think that's what people forgot

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.000 
etc so I think that's what people forgot
obviously<00:04:46.850> what<00:04:47.570> stuck<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:48.440> their<00:04:48.590> heads<00:04:48.770> is

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
obviously what stuck to their heads is

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.600 
obviously what stuck to their heads is
the<00:04:49.310> way<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:50.090> race<00:04:50.870> ended<00:04:51.260> but<00:04:52.250> I<00:04:52.310> think

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
the way the the race ended but I think

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.790 
the way the the race ended but I think
as<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:52.970> said<00:04:53.150> there's<00:04:53.360> not<00:04:53.510> much<00:04:53.690> much<00:04:54.440> more<00:04:54.680> to

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
as I said there's not much much more to

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.220 
as I said there's not much much more to
add<00:04:54.950> than<00:04:54.980> what<00:04:55.310> happened<00:04:55.669> I<00:04:56.240> thought<00:04:56.750> I<00:04:57.050> told

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
add than what happened I thought I told

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.680 
add than what happened I thought I told
the<00:04:57.530> team<00:04:57.710> straight<00:04:58.040> after<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.370> apologized<00:04:59.000> for

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
the team straight after I apologized for

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.720 
the team straight after I apologized for
putting<00:04:59.990> myself<00:05:00.169> above<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.770> team<00:05:00.980> which<00:05:01.250> I

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
putting myself above the team which I

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.960 
putting myself above the team which I
didn't<00:05:02.210> mean<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.510> do<00:05:02.630> but<00:05:03.530> yeah<00:05:04.400> there's<00:05:04.820> not

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
didn't mean to do but yeah there's not

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.510 
didn't mean to do but yeah there's not
much<00:05:05.150> really<00:05:05.360> more<00:05:05.770> not<00:05:06.770> much<00:05:06.950> more<00:05:07.160> to<00:05:07.340> say

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
much really more not much more to say

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.120 
much really more not much more to say
really<00:05:07.760> I<00:05:08.090> don't<00:05:08.930> apologize<00:05:09.140> for<00:05:09.470> winning<00:05:09.950> I

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
really I don't apologize for winning I

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.610 
really I don't apologize for winning I
think<00:05:10.430> that's<00:05:10.610> why<00:05:11.600> people<00:05:11.630> employed<00:05:12.320> me<00:05:12.530> in

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
think that's why people employed me in

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.860 
think that's why people employed me in
the<00:05:12.710> first<00:05:12.860> place<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.370> why<00:05:13.639> I'm<00:05:13.790> here<00:05:13.820> I<00:05:14.240> love

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
the first place and why I'm here I love

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.440 
the first place and why I'm here I love
racing<00:05:15.139> so<00:05:15.680> yeah<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.760> that's<00:05:16.910> that's<00:05:17.210> what<00:05:17.419> I

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
racing so yeah and that's that's what I

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.870 
racing so yeah and that's that's what I
did<00:05:17.720> obviously<00:05:18.620> we<00:05:18.800> learned<00:05:19.040> quite<00:05:19.669> a<00:05:19.729> bit

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
did obviously we learned quite a bit

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.320 
did obviously we learned quite a bit
from<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.300> first<00:05:20.510> two<00:05:20.690> races<00:05:21.940> China<00:05:22.940> will<00:05:23.180> be

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
from the first two races China will be

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.790 
from the first two races China will be
different<00:05:23.660> again<00:05:24.280> different<00:05:25.280> circuit

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
different again different circuit

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.800 
different again different circuit
different<00:05:27.800> climate<00:05:28.220> so<00:05:29.060> I<00:05:29.090> think<00:05:29.479> we're<00:05:29.630> still

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
different climate so I think we're still

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.630 
different climate so I think we're still
in<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:30.050> learning<00:05:30.350> process<00:05:30.500> obviously<00:05:31.400> the

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
in the learning process obviously the

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.610 
in the learning process obviously the
first<00:05:31.850> two<00:05:31.940> races<00:05:32.150> helped<00:05:32.630> a<00:05:32.690> lot<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.140> we<00:05:33.289> I

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
first two races helped a lot and we I

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.740 
first two races helped a lot and we I
think<00:05:33.830> it<00:05:34.460> was<00:05:34.610> very<00:05:34.669> obvious<00:05:35.210> for<00:05:35.240> everyone

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
think it was very obvious for everyone

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.990 
think it was very obvious for everyone
to<00:05:35.900> see<00:05:36.080> that<00:05:36.190> working<00:05:37.190> with<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.430> tyres<00:05:37.640> and

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
to see that working with the tyres and

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.940 
to see that working with the tyres and
trying<00:05:38.479> to<00:05:38.600> make<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:38.870> tyres<00:05:39.080> last<00:05:39.320> is<00:05:39.560> crucial

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
trying to make the tyres last is crucial

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.130 
trying to make the tyres last is crucial
it<00:05:40.669> determines<00:05:41.300> your<00:05:41.390> strategy<00:05:41.840> and<00:05:42.020> then

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
it determines your strategy and then

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.170 
it determines your strategy and then
therefore<00:05:42.650> determines<00:05:43.250> your<00:05:43.370> race<00:05:43.610> and<00:05:43.850> the

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
therefore determines your race and the

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.990 
therefore determines your race and the
result<00:05:44.539> so<00:05:45.289> I<00:05:45.830> think<00:05:46.070> we<00:05:46.280> still<00:05:46.460> got<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.669> lot<00:05:46.820> to

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
result so I think we still got a lot to

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.820 
result so I think we still got a lot to
learn<00:05:47.150> but<00:05:47.539> I<00:05:47.600> think<00:05:48.530> we<00:05:48.620> made<00:05:48.800> some

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
learn but I think we made some

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.800 
learn but I think we made some
improvements<00:05:49.070> we<00:05:49.700> try<00:05:49.910> to<00:05:49.970> you<00:05:50.419> know<00:05:50.450> tweak
