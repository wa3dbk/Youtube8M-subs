00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:09.120
 the new chapter of naruto shippuden 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.340
 425 has already left and of course 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.580
 you have already seen it on your page 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.830
 of anime preferably and as always 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.529
 in this section we analyze in the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.990
 chapter to find some little things 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.060
 curious that have happened in the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.849
 course of this same episode 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.699
 in which sometimes you do not realize 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.220
 for being enjoying the action here 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.680
 you have numbered seven of them 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.460
 comfortable pull the soda and enjoy the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.460
 next video 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.970
 One of the interesting things 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.309
 chapter is when you avoided mentioning that 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.500
 when implanting only one water 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.140
 power was so abrupt that it almost becomes 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.570
 crazy making reference to that by 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.780
 example a cat with both really 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.690
 He must have lost his head 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.119
 some did not know it but death had a 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.970
 seal implanted in the heart by killing 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.710
 which made him obey him and when 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.869
 he let himself get through because almost in the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.240
 dimension of the camu and it was precisely 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.240
 to be able to eliminate this stamp 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.689
 will kill explains and reveals that he was the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.270
 architect of everything that happened with rim 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.100
 that he controlled the ninjas of the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.530
 fog and I planned that they what 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.530
 but caracas killed and murdered 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.320
 rif was even more convenient for the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.659
 purpose I had 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.479
 in some scenes you can see that 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.090
 wood does not have hands of black color 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.910
 as it usually is but it has them 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.580
 white which is effectively a 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.830
 animation error then in the manga in 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.820
 every moment the hands and legs of 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.530
 wood are that black color 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.619
 specifically in this frame the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.650
 Naruto size looks too big 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.560
 in relation to the sakura body that is 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.630
 that the cheerleader made an adult a 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.020
 little giant more like a player 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.020
 American football for this chapter 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.310
 in the anime unlike in the manga 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.010
 it shows us handles that activating its 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.230
 health from the first phase in the manga 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.660
 goes directly to the stage where you already 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.510
 is covered but in this chapter 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.879
 of the anime you know what happens first for the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.770
 skeleton of the suzanne or what is 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.590
 quite interesting and very well animated 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.550
 finally king nayar in great burned 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:45.100
 Wake up has only 8 volume is like this 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.370
 it's the pitas you see in King Nayar and 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.460
 n'gal are only 8 however in the 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.370
 manga in this same scene king nayar 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.260
 ingham owns his 9 took is being a 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.260
 error again animation 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.720
 I will be very honest the chapter to 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.360
 despite all the curious things that 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.510
 I had quite liked the animation 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.299
 he was decent and the action was not necessary 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.640
 The truth is that seeing that Naruto is 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.610
 near its end and that the parts more 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.519
 epics are beginning to arrive always 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.610
 it's good sometimes the cheerleader house has 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.340
 certain very ugly mistakes that make us 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.650
 to annoy us fans for the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.629
 quality of the product it delivers without 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.650
 However, I think this chapter is 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.870
 salvageable 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.569
 I think this chapter is very good and it's 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.510
 of the few because again the 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.599
 filling will start after the next 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.790
 chapter after chapter 426 new 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.709
 account will begin with the fillings of 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.750
 all the characters that pierrot 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.000
 select to see your dreams of 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.480
 suicide my infinite agree so 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.060
 which is quite pretty stuffed up 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.420
 can finally see the final battle 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.310
 against kawai chucky and subsequently the 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.109
 disaster revolution for now that 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.520
 I felt all things to have more 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.620
 videos like this 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.550
 reporting a faster speed than 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.550
 the direction of minato 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.669
 hi my name is sarah and i want to send 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.520
 a huge greeting from here of the state 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.349
 from mexico to the touch channel aniston yo 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.599
 because it made me a big fan of this that is a 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.389
 act and I want to say the best in the 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:33.720
 arts and that your channel continues to prioritize 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.720
