not<00:01:04.589> even<00:01:04.890> worth<00:01:05.040> trying<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.229> see

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
not even worth trying but as you can see

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.030 
not even worth trying but as you can see
that's<00:01:08.430> grown<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.060> its<00:01:09.780> good<00:01:10.140> six<00:01:10.530> inches<00:01:10.710> in

the ground the back tire as well you may

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.429 
the ground the back tire as well you may
notice<00:01:15.530> looks<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.650> little<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> wrong<00:01:17.880> spot

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
notice looks a little in the wrong spot

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.230 
notice looks a little in the wrong spot
well<00:01:19.439> while<00:01:19.710> back<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.640> had<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> few<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
well while back we actually had a few of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.170 
well while back we actually had a few of
these<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.500> trying<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> tow<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.130> us<00:01:23.400> was

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
these and I was trying to tow it us was

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.649 
these and I was trying to tow it us was
that<00:01:24.210> truck<00:01:24.659> well<00:01:25.400> two<00:01:26.400> wheel<00:01:26.580> drive<00:01:26.610> made<00:01:27.509> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that truck well two wheel drive made it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.399 
that truck well two wheel drive made it
spin<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.960> lot<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.460> decided<00:01:30.360> okay<00:01:30.840> doubled

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
spin a lot then I decided okay doubled

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.130 
spin a lot then I decided okay doubled
up<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> rope<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.150> actually<00:01:33.600> what's<00:01:33.810> left

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
up the rope this is actually what's left

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.640 
up the rope this is actually what's left
of<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.350> rope<00:01:34.740> fairly<00:01:35.549> big<00:01:35.790> growth<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.390> know

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
of that rope fairly big growth you know

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.050 
of that rope fairly big growth you know
figure<00:01:37.650> doubling<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.490> would<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.670> strong

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
figure doubling that up would be strong

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.190 
figure doubling that up would be strong
enough<00:01:39.299> well<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.630> snapped<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.290> three<00:01:40.530> times<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
enough well I snapped it three times and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.649 
enough well I snapped it three times and
well<00:01:43.200> tired<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.860> car<00:01:44.070> moved<00:01:44.600> show<00:01:45.600> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
well tired of the car moved show you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.920 
well tired of the car moved show you
here<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.790> gotta<00:01:47.790> crawl<00:01:48.149> through<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> woods<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
here I gotta crawl through the woods to

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.179 
here I gotta crawl through the woods to
get<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:50.030> but<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.439> pretty

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
get to it but as you can see I pretty

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.760 
get to it but as you can see I pretty
much<00:01:53.310> pulled<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> rear<00:01:54.090> end<00:01:54.329> right<00:01:54.720> off<00:01:54.930> its

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
much pulled the rear end right off its

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.580 
much pulled the rear end right off its
you<00:01:56.729> know<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.119> don't<00:01:57.750> know<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.409> hanging

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
you know I don't know what it's hanging

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.340 
you know I don't know what it's hanging
on<00:01:58.860> by<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.310> probably<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.820> much<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.329> do<00:02:00.930> want<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
on by but probably not much I do want to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.840 
on by but probably not much I do want to
make<00:02:01.439> another<00:02:01.710> video<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.280> trying<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.670> pull

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
make another video of trying to pull

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.999 
make another video of trying to pull
this<00:02:03.000> thing<00:02:03.240> again<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:04.380> I'm<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> have

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
this thing again but I'm going to have

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.700 
this thing again but I'm going to have
to<00:02:05.130> find<00:02:05.310> somewhere<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.750> actually<00:02:07.259> solid

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
to find somewhere that is actually solid

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.919 
to find somewhere that is actually solid
enough<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:08.879> i<00:02:08.910> wrote<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.690> it'll

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
enough that when i wrote on it it'll

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.410 
enough that when i wrote on it it'll
actually<00:02:10.229> move<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.700> brick<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> car

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
actually move and not just brick the car

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.220 
actually move and not just brick the car
in<00:02:12.569> half

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
in half

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.259 
in half
and<00:02:13.470> then<00:02:13.620> we'll<00:02:13.739> have<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.250> big<00:02:14.400> pile<00:02:15.030> of

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
and then we'll have just a big pile of

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.569 
and then we'll have just a big pile of
scrap<00:02:15.510> metal
