was gonna be just luffy fighting i
didn't<00:00:30.390> even<00:00:30.480> think<00:00:30.599> we'd<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:31.189> 20<00:00:32.210> slicing

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
didn't even think we'd get 20 slicing

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.060 
didn't even think we'd get 20 slicing
off<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> dragon's<00:00:33.930> head<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.469> when<00:00:34.980> we

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
off the dragon's head and when we

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.209 
off the dragon's head and when we
finally<00:00:35.280> did<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.450> felt<00:00:37.050> way<00:00:37.440> less

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
finally did get to that it felt way less

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.209 
finally did get to that it felt way less
epic<00:00:38.460> than<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.090> did<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> manga<00:00:40.350> because

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
epic than it did in the manga because

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.060 
epic than it did in the manga because
one<00:00:41.700> made<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.360> awesome<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.989> manga<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
one made it so awesome the manga is that

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.389 
one made it so awesome the manga is that
Zorro<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:45.149> sounds<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.570> he<00:00:45.980> he<00:00:46.980> did<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.250> so

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
Zorro it sounds like he he did it so

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.700 
Zorro it sounds like he he did it so
effortlessly<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.780> was<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.050> quick<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.649> was

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
effortlessly and it was so quick it was

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
effortlessly and it was so quick it was
all<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:49.950> one<00:00:50.100> chapter<00:00:50.430> he<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.210> took<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
all in one chapter he just took the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.410 
all in one chapter he just took the
dragon<00:00:51.840> out<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.350> actually<00:00:53.190> went<00:00:53.520> back<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420

holy shit it sound like they were having
this<00:01:26.880> huge<00:01:27.060> battle<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.320> manga<00:01:29.780> pretty

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
this huge battle but in the manga pretty

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.780 
this huge battle but in the manga pretty
much<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> same<00:01:31.110> thing<00:01:31.170> happened<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.549> this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
much the same thing happened but in this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.719 
much the same thing happened but in this
episode<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.689> felt<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.549> everything<00:01:35.549> was

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
episode it felt like everything was

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.730 
episode it felt like everything was
taking<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.600> long<00:01:36.680> I<00:01:37.680> don't<00:01:38.400> know<00:01:38.490> why<00:01:39.740> probably

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
taking so long I don't know why probably

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.200 
taking so long I don't know why probably
because<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.130> pretty<00:01:41.579> much<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.030> one

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
because it was pretty much like one

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.330 
because it was pretty much like one
chapter<00:01:42.600> per<00:01:42.720> episode<00:01:42.810> usually<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.770> don't<00:01:44.130> know

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
chapter per episode usually I don't know

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
chapter per episode usually I don't know
maybe<00:01:44.490> they<00:01:44.909> go<00:01:45.030> through<00:01:45.240> two<00:01:45.479> chapters<00:01:45.990> but

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
maybe they go through two chapters but

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.590 
maybe they go through two chapters but
everything<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.009> felt<00:01:47.399> drawn<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
everything just felt drawn out and that

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.050 
everything just felt drawn out and that
took<00:01:48.869> away<00:01:49.140> from<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.560> impact<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.490> zorro

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
took away from the impact of zorro

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.149 
took away from the impact of zorro
cutting<00:01:51.570> off<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> dragon's<00:01:52.229> head<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.680> made

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
cutting off the dragon's head and made

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.490 
cutting off the dragon's head and made
it<00:01:53.280> look<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:54.390> may<00:01:54.570> put<00:01:54.960> more<00:01:55.140> effort

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
it look like they may put more effort

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.910 
it look like they may put more effort
into<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.829> than<00:01:55.890> they<00:01:56.009> did<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.369> manga<00:01:56.750> but

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
into it than they did in the manga but

everyone<00:03:41.460> and<00:03:41.840> CC<00:03:42.840> everyone<00:03:43.170> with<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.350> gas

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
everyone and CC everyone with the gas

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.350 
everyone and CC everyone with the gas
and<00:03:43.980> everyone's<00:03:44.490> asleep<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.030> he<00:03:45.090> just<00:03:45.240> like

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
and everyone's asleep and he just like

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.920 
and everyone's asleep and he just like
stands<00:03:45.630> there<00:03:45.930> then<00:03:46.560> he's<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:46.800> oh<00:03:47.690> it's<00:03:48.690> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
stands there then he's like oh it's the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.390 
stands there then he's like oh it's the
gas<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.590> then<00:03:49.740> he<00:03:49.860> runs<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.460> don't<00:03:51.420> know<00:03:52.400> it's

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
gas and then he runs I don't know it's

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.340 
gas and then he runs I don't know it's
it's<00:03:53.700> kind<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.180> something<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:54.960> was<00:03:55.110> drawn

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
it's kind of something that was drawn

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.740 
it's kind of something that was drawn
and<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.560> think<00:03:55.770> it<00:03:55.860> would<00:03:55.950> have<00:03:56.040> been<00:03:56.130> better

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
and I think it would have been better

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.060 
and I think it would have been better
that<00:03:57.750> scene<00:03:58.110> in<00:03:58.230> particular<00:03:58.380> was<00:03:58.830> a<00:03:58.860> little

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
that scene in particular was a little

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.560 
that scene in particular was a little
quicker<00:03:59.250> it'll<00:03:59.790> be<00:03:59.850> better<00:04:00.000> if<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.300> whole

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
quicker it'll be better if this whole

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.080 
quicker it'll be better if this whole
episode<00:04:00.750> was<00:04:01.230> kind<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:02.030> condensed<00:04:03.030> down

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
episode was kind of just condensed down

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.320 
episode was kind of just condensed down
a<00:04:03.540> little<00:04:03.690> further<00:04:04.580> because<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:06.090> this

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
a little further because the this

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.900 
a little further because the this
episode<00:04:06.720> didn't<00:04:06.960> even<00:04:07.110> end<00:04:07.320> right<00:04:07.770> away<00:04:08.040> with

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
episode didn't even end right away with

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.960 
episode didn't even end right away with
Zorro<00:04:09.300> cutting<00:04:09.690> off<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.900> dragon's<00:04:10.290> head<00:04:10.500> or

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
Zorro cutting off the dragon's head or

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.150 
Zorro cutting off the dragon's head or
with<00:04:11.970> like<00:04:12.270> but<00:04:13.140> right<00:04:13.410> before<00:04:13.590> he<00:04:13.800> does<00:04:13.980> that

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
with like but right before he does that

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.250 
with like but right before he does that

didn't<00:04:16.530> Doug<00:04:16.650> then<00:04:16.920> we<00:04:17.150> would<00:04:18.150> that's<00:04:18.510> that's

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
didn't Doug then we would that's that's

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.650 
didn't Doug then we would that's that's
even<00:04:19.260> more<00:04:19.290> progress<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:20.640> it<00:04:21.359> wouldn't<00:04:21.630> have

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
even more progress that it wouldn't have

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.100 
even more progress that it wouldn't have
made<00:04:21.870> you<00:04:22.470> know<00:04:22.620> at<00:04:23.130> least<00:04:23.190> they<00:04:23.430> got<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.790> far

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
made you know at least they got that far

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.420 
made you know at least they got that far
but<00:04:25.110> then<00:04:25.350> it's<00:04:25.650> not<00:04:25.800> like<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.100> end<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.370> the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
but then it's not like the end of the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.720 
but then it's not like the end of the
steps

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
steps

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.270

as good as it did in the manga maybe
that's<00:05:36.990> just<00:05:37.110> because<00:05:37.230> it's<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.530> second<00:05:37.860> time

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
that's just because it's the second time

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.820 
that's just because it's the second time
seeing<00:05:38.310> this<00:05:38.520> but<00:05:39.330> I<00:05:39.600> don't<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:40.560> don't<00:05:40.590> think

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
seeing this but I don't I don't think

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.760 
seeing this but I don't I don't think
that's<00:05:40.980> the<00:05:41.040> case<00:05:41.100> I<00:05:41.460> really<00:05:41.850> think<00:05:42.000> they

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
that's the case I really think they

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.470 
that's the case I really think they
extended<00:05:43.770> this<00:05:43.950> sequence<00:05:44.640> this<00:05:45.240> whole

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
extended this sequence this whole

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.260 
extended this sequence this whole
episode<00:05:45.660> of<00:05:46.170> a<00:05:46.350> bit<00:05:47.160> more<00:05:47.400> than<00:05:48.060> they<00:05:48.240> should

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
episode of a bit more than they should

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.780 
episode of a bit more than they should
