 black wireless controls that has 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.830
 rough or you is very similar to the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.140
 controls of the ps2 alone changes to 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.570
 good center also brings 3d so that 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.119

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.040
 it is very which is a very similar command 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.080
 to the wii but this one comes with a 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.510
 ball in the front which will make 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.580
 more fun the games of the ps3 and 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.800
 so that you are not wondering about 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.320
 the graphics here some images look 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.440
 this image clearly looks better in the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.770
 xbox 360 has a better color than in the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.020
 ps3 which here wins the xbox 360 in 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.960
 this other the brightness is much stronger 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.509
 in the xbox but in the ps3 you do not see much 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.610
 brightness so you can see the ps3 better 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.590
 which wins the ps3 and in this other 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.750
 clearly it looks better in likes 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.910
 for the details in the sky and the iron 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.340
 old in this other looks the same is good 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.950
 in this one it looks better in ps3 than 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.470
 in the xbox in this picture wins the ps3 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.629
 but the two consoles are very similar 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.879
 in the graphics so either of 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.010
 the two consoles that you think you buy 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.989
 would be fine in both catalog of 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.599
 games the xbox has games 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.670
 attractive but the two consoles count 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.799
 with recent games which the one 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.750
 you want to buy is good friends
