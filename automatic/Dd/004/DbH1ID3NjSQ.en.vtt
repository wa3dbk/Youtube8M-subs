00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
install it onto the head pipe first you

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.290 
install it onto the head pipe first you
want<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.140> take<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.070> top<00:02:25.370> hose<00:02:25.580> clamp<00:02:25.910> spread

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
want to take this top hose clamp spread

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.810 
want to take this top hose clamp spread
it<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.740> can<00:02:27.860> get<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.070> over<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> hip<00:02:28.610> there

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
it so you can get it over the hip there

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.610 
it so you can get it over the hip there
right<00:02:29.710> take<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.830> second<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:32.260> do<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.410> same

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
right take the second one do the same

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.360 
right take the second one do the same
thing

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.010 

simultaneously<00:02:37.370> feed<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.120> muffler<00:02:38.540> into<00:02:38.930> the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
simultaneously feed the muffler into the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.430 
simultaneously feed the muffler into the
head<00:02:39.170> pipe<00:02:40.570> so<00:02:41.570> after<00:02:41.810> me<00:02:41.930> installed<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.350> new

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
head pipe so after me installed the new

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.410 
head pipe so after me installed the new
muffler<00:02:42.620> into<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.100> heat<00:02:43.280> shield<00:02:43.330> then<00:02:44.330> you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
muffler into the heat shield then you

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.570 
muffler into the heat shield then you
spelled<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.780> under<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.140> hampire<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:46.370> now<00:02:46.490> we

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
spelled it under the hampire and now we

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.850 
spelled it under the hampire and now we
have<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.940> tighten<00:02:47.180> down<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:48.260> muffler<00:02:48.620> clamp

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
have to tighten down the muffler clamp

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.890 
have to tighten down the muffler clamp
onto<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.370> head<00:02:49.520> pipe<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.540> supplied

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900

carriage bolts onto the interconnect

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.620 
carriage bolts onto the interconnect
bracket<00:02:54.380> then<00:02:54.980> we'll<00:02:55.220> tighten<00:02:55.400> down<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:56.450> hose

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630
