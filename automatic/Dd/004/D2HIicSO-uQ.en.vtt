 this router your phone can not you can you 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.300
 they said that the computer does not 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.370
 he recognized the decoration mode of his 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.130
 phone that because they do not need those 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.259
 drivers and that although they install the sony 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.260
 for that companion the 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.940
 drivers then it has me 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.489
 happened because recently it forms 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.170
 he has a computer and then he does not 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.569
 they recognized the drivers and this nelson and 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.429
 have accompany and so then then 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:48.340
 I'm investigating, I'm trying and that 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.170
 and well I found the solution 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.930
 for this we are going to need this 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.890
 install the drivers manually 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.989
 people to install a real file that 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.450
 they leave it in the description of the video that 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.270
 it's called manual driver as well 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.130
 here or manual driver manual how to 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.989
 want to call to decompress us what 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.989
 leave a folder called usb driver 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.830
 in this field t is where are the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.990
 drivers 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.450
 first of all we'll see each other with the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.649
 control 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.649
 and device manager 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.270
 we're going to go where it says good here 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.780
 it's going to look something like 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.780
 Android device 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.190
 or it's just stretching and going 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.130
 appear with a symbol as well as l 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.770
 of warning as well as this yellow and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.130
 then we are going to click right 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.660
 properties and I here already appears to me as 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.900
 are and because I have installed the 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.790
 drivers we're going to right click 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.650
 properties we will go audience details 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.350
 here we are going to select where it says of 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.049
 of the hardware 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.600
 and we are going to look for a file in a line 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.650
 sorry that is similar to this one that says 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.490
 usb script this boy from jong below zero efe 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.590
 s / a 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:13.130
 an person asks god lowered 5 170 in 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.950
 person in my script under 011 that 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.230
 look like this one 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.060
 and well then once once what 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.519
 we have identified what we are going to copy 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.040
 in a notebook like me here what 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.890
 I have copied then we could 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.540
 close this by right now or minimize it from 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.480
 preference and well then let's go to the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.489
 folder that you downloaded we're going to open the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.489
 girl who says android wheel usb 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.150
 let's girl how many bits is our 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.950
 computer for this let's start 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.930
 Right click on equipment properties 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.750
 and as you see here it says 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.159
 the 64-bit operating system and the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.500
 1064 the one of you pre be of 32 or 64 if 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.730
 is 32 you are going to locate the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.829
 google partition in x86 and if it's 64 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.079
 they will locate the part that says google in 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:10.269
 the md of 64 in this case is 64 here 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.340
 where it says let's choose any of 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.750
 these devices is simply for 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.769
 can install the drivers does not matter 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.900
 they do not find the name of their 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.340
 device here in this case I'm going 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.290
 to modify in the first one that says the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:27.549
 next nexus one we are going to copy this but 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.159
 without the mi6 kindelÃ¡n person and he tells me no 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:33.780
 simply up to here we copy it and what 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.780
 we replace in this part 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.150
 in this part control control v and 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.099
 then we went back to copy problems 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.960
 sorry but with everything and in the person in 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:49.060
 my 0 1 control c 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.060
 control control 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.180
 control and this and now simply 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.800
 we would close we would leave 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.800
 new to this part 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.300
 we would right click on the device 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.780
 update your driver software or 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.130
 rather, it would appear to me as 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.160
 forgot how it appears yes yes as 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.730
 update software we would give you where 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.540
 says fly the controller on the computer 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.720
 but I showed it from here 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.730
 maybe the driver look for software from 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.090
 controller on the computer we look for the 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.650
 route where we have the folder 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.400
 in this case I got here I have it 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.600
 marked would be to examine we're going to 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.220
 downloads where the language in my case 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.430
 they are downloads 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.800
 usb driver and we accept 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.160
 we give you before even the folders you 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.770
 we give next and as it says that I already have 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.770
 the device and the driver and it's 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.259
 updated may take a little bit this 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.970
 this process but when it does not 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.400
 despair simply wait and now 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.479
 they would have the driver installed 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.909
 I recommend that after this, what 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.909
 start your pc and now if you could already 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:05.190
 Rooting on your phone is not 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.110
 necessary this this method is not 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.240
 only for the xperia type is for 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.680
 any phone mainly the same 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.229
 Can be used for Chinese phones 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.560
 that as we know they do not have a something 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.000
 to back them up or guarantee them 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.340
 install drivers such as the 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.810
 xperia type is sony and lowering its 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.240
 software supposedly should be 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.759
 install the drivers but not in 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.139
 this case was not like that and good for 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.650
 those who have problems this would be the 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.810
 solution 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.430
 you know any doubt I said no 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.880
 forget to subscribe and see you until the 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.880
 next
