00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.919
 welcome to gallery nights tv 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.519
 today we manage to visit his workshop we 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:30.659
 he cared affectionately and she is paula 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.659
 all blake 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.350
 an artist is a sensitive being that 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.660
 perceives life in a different way 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.370
 and that thanks to his work can generate 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.370
 another perception of the world 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.059
 what unifies my work is the subject me 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.860
 I think the artist works though 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.509
 change support several times with a 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.210
 only subject or the artist works with 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.119
 unresolved topics with topics that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.509
 They worry about issues that nobody gets 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.060
 enter and is enrolled at a time in 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.220
 the one who lives then I just think that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.310
 my work although the change of support 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.830
 photography facilities or I'm going 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.020
 using the element you need to 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.030
 whatever you want to say always what 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.460
 Underlying is this life that I work 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.970
 about protection protection themes 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.970
 existential 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.500
 my approach to art is of all 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.890

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.130
