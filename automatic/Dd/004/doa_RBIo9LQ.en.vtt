00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 so this time we will study in the budget 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.000
 on means independently bring in 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.160

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.200
 also the legendary South Korean abra 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.630
 kangaroo cosmetics and in order to all 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.250
 how it should be shone 1 class pleased us 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.650
 need naturally pre 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.490
 washing out and car cleaner tar 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.250
 by peach 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.840
 profoam 2000 universal cleaner 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 blacken or rubber me their shiner and 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.619
 one of two of such polishes 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.119
 knot what the difference between them will explain 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.400
 when it's time but for now 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.800
 I propose to watch avtomonov check the throne and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.230
 all sorts of pollution here to go far 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.140
 do not need a favorite place 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.120
 of all the tars in the world though the wings and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.460
 board the car to deal with this 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.989
 black road dirty trick will help us 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.239
 card cleaner 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.860
 special tool that is fast and not 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.170
 harming paintwork 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.690
 completely dissolve the stuck tar 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.280
 by the way and in the fight against insects won also 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.280
 have to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.280
 but 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.720
 Here's another thing by the way for the tart feature 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.610
 I have no planned experiment on 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.120
 regular shooting accidentally soiled 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.120
 try your favorite white master 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.610
 mashenka and were clean 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.830
 sorted out redeem drives remember in 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.450
 last time I was told about super 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.930
 universal cleaner pro can and 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.300
 thousands 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.490
 this time without him is also not particularly 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.470
 difficult places we clean with a brush do it 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.690
 without damaging the coating 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.410
 wash with plenty of water and dry 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.110
 to wipe 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.150
 to complete the overall look of the composition 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.280
 add extra shine to the wheel 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.050
 we will process tires polish them 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.730
 Shiner Apply the agent throughout 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.980
 tire circumference from a distance of 10 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.960
 centimeters from the surface wait 5 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.000
 minutes the agent is completely dissolved and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.310
 will give tires and deep black color 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.380
 another important stage of protecting the body from 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.750
 aging polished there are two ways 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.060
 either a liquid polishing head kc either 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.130
 solid guest difference between them is 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.530
 that the liquid is easier to apply it can 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.510
 applied even on wet but the shells 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.980
 and the effect does not last so long 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.050
 solid polish require more 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.000
 thorough preparation of time and effort 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.850
 accordingly lasts longer 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.130
 so how do you choose to resort to the old 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.650
 good method shishal-mouse 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.650
 in flash very much 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.210
 normal heroes always go round and round 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.520
 that which is the way it should be 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.770
 wipe and still handle the body 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.620
 exploded so much easier for the psyche and right 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.480
 in terms of instruction and remember neither 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.880
 In no case do not apply polish on 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.980
 heavily heated surface is dangerous 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.410
 so here with a small set 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.810
 special means kangaroo and labor hours 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.540
 we saved a budget and got decent 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.910
 the result we understand that 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.260
 putting enamel wax is only quick and 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.750
 easy way to force a car 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.940
 weave full polishing elimination 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.310
 scratching and restoring response requires 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.900
 much more time and effort it all 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.900
 will be but a little later
