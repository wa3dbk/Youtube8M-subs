00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
index of 12 I believe it is and has a

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.690 
index of 12 I believe it is and has a
square<00:03:09.829> marking<00:03:10.310> on<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:11.709> it's<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:13.010> improved

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
square marking on it and it's a improved

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.970 
square marking on it and it's a improved
injector<00:03:14.269> much<00:03:14.959> improved<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.590> think<00:03:15.799> they've

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
injector much improved I think they've

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.920 
injector much improved I think they've
gone<00:03:16.190> through<00:03:16.430> quite<00:03:16.579> a<00:03:16.670> few<00:03:16.760> injector<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:17.660> far

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
gone through quite a few injector so far

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.440 
gone through quite a few injector so far
I<00:03:18.200> think<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.160> remember<00:03:19.519> seeing<00:03:19.670> index<00:03:20.060> numbers

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
I think I remember seeing index numbers

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.660 
I think I remember seeing index numbers
of<00:03:20.630> two<00:03:20.900> on<00:03:21.200> some<00:03:21.859> other<00:03:22.010> vehicles<00:03:22.489> I've

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
of two on some other vehicles I've

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.590 
of two on some other vehicles I've
recently<00:03:22.910> worked<00:03:23.480> on<00:03:25.209> occasionally<00:03:26.209> we<00:03:26.390> see<00:03:26.420> a

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
recently worked on occasionally we see a

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.300 
recently worked on occasionally we see a
high<00:03:26.810> pressure<00:03:27.109> pump<00:03:27.230> fail<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.070> should

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
high pressure pump fail that you should

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.860 
high pressure pump fail that you should
be<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.459> common<00:03:28.940> failure<00:03:29.299> but<00:03:29.480> it's<00:03:29.660> not

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
be a common failure but it's not

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.289 
be a common failure but it's not
something<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:30.799> we<00:03:31.100> see<00:03:31.400> I've<00:03:32.030> seen

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
something that we see I've seen

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.180 
something that we see I've seen
catalytic<00:03:32.870> converters<00:03:33.380> fail<00:03:33.680> do<00:03:34.010> the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
catalytic converters fail do the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.720 
catalytic converters fail do the
injectors<00:03:35.709> dumping<00:03:36.709> too<00:03:36.890> much<00:03:37.069> fuel<00:03:37.430> and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
injectors dumping too much fuel and

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.210 
injectors dumping too much fuel and
recently<00:03:38.660> I've<00:03:38.989> actually<00:03:39.170> seen<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.739> opposite

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
recently I've actually seen the opposite

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.059 
recently I've actually seen the opposite
where<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:41.600> have<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.810> two<00:03:42.109> leaned<00:03:42.380> fault<00:03:42.799> and

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
where you have a two leaned fault and

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.640 
where you have a two leaned fault and
what's<00:03:44.060> actually<00:03:44.239> occurring<00:03:44.600> is<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
what's actually occurring is the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.949 
what's actually occurring is the
injectors<00:03:46.160> aren't<00:03:46.430> spraying<00:03:46.760> enough<00:03:47.359> fuel

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
injectors aren't spraying enough fuel

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.259 
injectors aren't spraying enough fuel
and<00:03:48.280> that's<00:03:49.280> actually<00:03:49.549> can<00:03:49.880> be<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.060> pretty

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
and that's actually can be a pretty

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.150 
and that's actually can be a pretty
difficult<00:03:50.510> diagnosis<00:03:51.380> when<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.889> normal

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
difficult diagnosis when the normal

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.420 
difficult diagnosis when the normal
failure<00:03:52.730> is<00:03:52.910> too<00:03:53.120> rich<00:03:53.799> and<00:03:54.799> that's<00:03:55.250> only

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
failure is too rich and that's only

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.369 
failure is too rich and that's only
something<00:03:55.879> I've<00:03:56.209> recently<00:03:56.780> run<00:03:56.930> into<00:03:57.230> one<00:03:57.349> a

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
something I've recently run into one a

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:58.670 
something I've recently run into one a
couple<00:03:57.739> of

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
couple of

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.330 
couple of
four<00:03:58.920> engines<00:03:59.310> I<00:04:00.500> still<00:04:01.500> see<00:04:01.709> some<00:04:01.739> carbon

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
four engines I still see some carbon

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.660 
four engines I still see some carbon
issues<00:04:02.700> usually<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.930> problem<00:04:04.560> there<00:04:04.829> is<00:04:05.069> on<00:04:05.609> a

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
issues usually the problem there is on a

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.429 
issues usually the problem there is on a
cold<00:04:05.969> start<00:04:06.299> you<00:04:06.629> can<00:04:06.840> get<00:04:07.019> some<00:04:07.230> rough

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
cold start you can get some rough

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.880 
cold start you can get some rough
running<00:04:07.890> or<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:09.780> know<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:09.959> actually<00:04:10.140> can<00:04:10.650> fit

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
running or you know it actually can fit

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.869 
running or you know it actually can fit
four<00:04:11.189> injectors<00:04:12.120> coils<00:04:13.079> and<00:04:13.409> carbon<00:04:14.310> if<00:04:14.489> you

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
four injectors coils and carbon if you

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.710 
four injectors coils and carbon if you
do<00:04:15.780> some<00:04:16.019> heavy<00:04:16.199> acceleration<00:04:17.239> say<00:04:18.239> you're<00:04:18.449> on

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
do some heavy acceleration say you're on

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.560 
do some heavy acceleration say you're on
an<00:04:19.169> on-ramp<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.400> get<00:04:20.759> on<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.090> hard<00:04:21.329> you

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
an on-ramp and you get on it hard you

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.810 
an on-ramp and you get on it hard you
can<00:04:21.720> actually<00:04:21.750> feel<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.470> skip<00:04:22.949> or<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.250> miss<00:04:23.520> and

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
can actually feel a skip or a miss and

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.730 
can actually feel a skip or a miss and
you<00:04:24.449> won't<00:04:24.660> even<00:04:24.780> get<00:04:25.020> a<00:04:25.080> check<00:04:25.380> engine<00:04:25.590> light

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
you won't even get a check engine light

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.430 
you won't even get a check engine light
so<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.880> difficulty<00:04:27.479> there<00:04:27.720> is<00:04:27.780> that<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.320> could

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
so the difficulty there is that it could

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.010 
so the difficulty there is that it could
be<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.650> lot<00:04:28.889> of<00:04:29.009> different<00:04:29.340> things<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.910> it<00:04:30.840> does

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
be a lot of different things and it does

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.040 
be a lot of different things and it does
take<00:04:31.259> some<00:04:31.289> part<00:04:31.740> swapping<00:04:32.539> you<00:04:33.539> know<00:04:33.599> coils

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
take some part swapping you know coils

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.100 
take some part swapping you know coils
first<00:04:35.210> check<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.240> see<00:04:36.509> if<00:04:36.599> injectors<00:04:37.080> have

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
first check to see if injectors have

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.100 
first check to see if injectors have
been<00:04:37.440> replaced<00:04:38.009> before<00:04:38.729> suspecting<00:04:39.630> carbon

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
been replaced before suspecting carbon

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.529 
been replaced before suspecting carbon
and<00:04:40.349> then<00:04:40.979> most<00:04:41.550> of<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.699> time<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.060> injectors

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
and then most of the time the injectors

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.360 
and then most of the time the injectors
fix<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:42.990> but<00:04:43.139> a<00:04:43.169> couple<00:04:43.229> of<00:04:43.590> times<00:04:43.800> I've<00:04:44.009> had<00:04:44.160> it

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
fix it but a couple of times I've had it

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.670 
fix it but a couple of times I've had it
where<00:04:44.610> you<00:04:45.120> still<00:04:45.479> feel<00:04:45.690> a<00:04:45.720> skip<00:04:46.169> it<00:04:46.380> might<00:04:46.530> not

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
where you still feel a skip it might not

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.159 
where you still feel a skip it might not
be<00:04:46.860> as<00:04:46.949> bad<00:04:47.160> as<00:04:47.220> when<00:04:48.060> before<00:04:48.599> you<00:04:48.900> replace

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
be as bad as when before you replace

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.350 
be as bad as when before you replace
injectors<00:04:49.770> but<00:04:50.070> once<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.729> take<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.060> intake

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
injectors but once you take the intake

injectors but once you take the intake
manifold<00:04:51.870> off<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.259> do<00:04:52.410> have<00:04:52.620> quite<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:52.860> bit<00:04:53.039> of

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
manifold off you do have quite a bit of

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.719 
manifold off you do have quite a bit of
carbon<00:04:53.490> usually<00:04:53.880> more<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:55.099> the<00:04:56.099> second<00:04:56.520> bank

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729

in cylinders four five and six tends to

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
cleaned up its the vehicles power is

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.800 
cleaned up its the vehicles power is
increased<00:05:12.139> exponentially<00:05:13.139> I've<00:05:13.860> seen<00:05:14.130> carbon

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
increased exponentially I've seen carbon

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.710 
increased exponentially I've seen carbon
build<00:05:15.810> up<00:05:15.960> anywhere<00:05:16.409> from<00:05:17.180> 60,000<00:05:18.180> miles<00:05:18.419> and

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
build up anywhere from 60,000 miles and

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.879 
build up anywhere from 60,000 miles and
on<00:05:18.870> so<00:05:19.680> if<00:05:19.860> you're<00:05:20.099> getting<00:05:20.729> if<00:05:21.210> you're<00:05:21.479> about

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
on so if you're getting if you're about

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.830 
on so if you're getting if you're about
70,000<00:05:22.889> 80,000<00:05:23.520> or<00:05:23.580> even<00:05:23.820> 90,000<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:24.750> you

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
70,000 80,000 or even 90,000 and you

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.300 
70,000 80,000 or even 90,000 and you
haven't<00:05:25.139> had<00:05:25.229> a<00:05:25.289> carbon<00:05:25.740> clean<00:05:25.919> it<00:05:26.070> might<00:05:26.190> be

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
haven't had a carbon clean it might be

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.060 
haven't had a carbon clean it might be
something<00:05:26.639> that<00:05:26.669> you<00:05:27.180> want<00:05:27.870> to<00:05:28.020> consider<00:05:28.199> you

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
something that you want to consider you

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.159 
something that you want to consider you
know<00:05:29.159> the<00:05:29.280> intake<00:05:29.610> does<00:05:29.820> come<00:05:30.060> off<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.599> BMW

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
know the intake does come off and BMW

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.310 
know the intake does come off and BMW
has<00:05:31.349> a<00:05:31.380> really<00:05:31.770> good<00:05:32.630> walnut-shell<00:05:33.630> blaster
