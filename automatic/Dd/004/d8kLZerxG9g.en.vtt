00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.500
 I bring a makeup that is a very 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.509
 intense with dark lips are very 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.080
 fashionable and very trendy nowadays 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.480
 so I invite you to see the tutorial 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.640
 let's start to pass us a base of 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.859
 shadow on our entire eyelid for a 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.190
 long duration and better presentation 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.440
 of shadow 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.000
 and this is the brand that girls is 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.460
 pharmacy product is easy 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.800
 get it now let's apply a 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.260
 brown tone that we are going to apply in 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.260
 arc shape throughout our watershed 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.269
 little by little we will increase the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.480
 intensity of the color and to achieve very 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.790
 well this color gradient we are going to 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.500
 do it with a template brush as 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.810
 is 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.230
 for our mobile eyelid we are going to 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.199
 I chose a color and this is 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.120
 a matte hue girls so what 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.900
 we are going to put a little taps with a 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.900
 flat brush 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.450
 to create this smoky let's take 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.700
 now a tonality to zero this too 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.820
 it's mate so we're going to put it in 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.550
 form of v in our external song and 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.550
 little by little we are going to blur 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.500
 you know the secret in this makeup 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.290
 is to blur very well so that the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.650
 shadows can conjugate each other also 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.590
 we will take a matte vanilla hue and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.750
 we will put it below our eyebrows and 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.900
 this will make our makeup 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.810
 see impeccable 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.000
 we will go on to outline our 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.470
 eyes and I'm doing it with our 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.620

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.870
 He lived very soon because he is so beautiful and 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.470
 so let's do a delineated type 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.470
 feline 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.350

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.870

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.150
