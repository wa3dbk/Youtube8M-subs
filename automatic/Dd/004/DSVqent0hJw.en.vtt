 know to say that when I put a game either 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.179
 their crash is the lie in half so 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.640
 it's very weird when I do not have 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.140
 knocked down I do not understand too much finally 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.880
 always is it that skin moment I 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.080
 am struggling to try to 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.720

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.150

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.680

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.820

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.940
 call after they will say no it takes 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.500
 call time it must be learned there I 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.740
 know that it's annoying at the end of a 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.050
 moment 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.150
 after a while I want to say 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.920
 it's bubbling a bit so here is the 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.090
 pole at the mans room mamma ps she is 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.160
 a little bit of trouble walking in the water 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.330
 I found a ploy guys for 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.700
 here to make her walk a little bit 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.710
 better and I will confess that if he is 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.490
 pretty amazing look how I have 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.840
 done well I just 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.730
 return the ps4 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.230
 so I put it in the sense of Europe on 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.140
 sees the judge issuing the back and she 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.450
 works better but she still works 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.860
 less well but here I was playing at 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.630
 some games there are others who postulates 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.770
 like for example and I swear to you that 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.720
 it's not bars guys I swear 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.190
 w double of someone i can not manage to 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.420
 to make it work that I swear no 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.740
 that's it to be a sketch because 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.659
 it is true that I present that 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.190
 wrestling videos then from the beginning and 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.350
 all of a sudden and well it does not work 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.080
 not look I swear it's no fake 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.340
 year guys I tell you it's the game 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.409
 of wrestling it is not working right now 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.820
 so that's very problematic 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.040
 so mostly because I had a lot 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.479
 videos to offer you these next 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.670
 these next few days it's for a 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.860
 week in the next few months finally voila 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.560
 I think you felt a little 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.270
 little frustration in my pavin voice 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.650
 does not want to have and well this decline that 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.810
 walk halfway so I do not understand 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.299
 what's going on finally good is nothing 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.430
 serious I hope because because good 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.659
 otherwise everything else works but here is the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.340
 name I promise you look at I you 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.350
 shows a video to show you that 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.479
 I do not wonder then look at me 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.489
 guys we're going to put the game w12 of 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.700
 someone his valet insert him into the 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.940
 in the box then 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.080
 the disc the casing look a little 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.830
 little what they know to his record what he 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.660
 will appear on the screen 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.069
 so here you have found that I have 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.370
 well put I read the game in the 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.930
 trick in the reader and then the airlock is 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.940
 reading well so everything works 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.050
 look well we hear the sound late I 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.640
 do not know if you hear it in all 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.920
 case I hear it well the sound of the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.370
 the two are from the reader who starts 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.319
 on the way 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.250
 and then there and then there you see that there 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.130
 we have more than I have more than 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.690
 select and started well and then there 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.709
 we say to ourselves but quiet and well we are 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.980
 gone for a video 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.390
 finally to do to play any walk 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.519
 for the moment so far everything works 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.040
 so no I you manage you look 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.870
 age and I put you the camera like that 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.260
 so the camcorder rather how to get it 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.870
 beat the balls 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.250
 in short I put it to you like that for you 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.690
 although you watch that these looting 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.150
 and no editing in the video and the 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.989
 everything but it's really aberrant it's 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.829
 really a big I do not understand 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.870
 how 's that how is it done 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.130
 how is it possible when it is 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.890
 true is no shock 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.450
 and yet and yet well it does not 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.560
 still not working so it's true 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.810
 that it's pretty boring to watch then 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.810
 there until then well you see we have 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.090
 the setup menu from the beginning which 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.530
 is to fischer there is a little blur good 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.019
 I wait until yeah that's it 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.380
 you understood 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:26.329
 I press I support for m luna there is a 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.859
 message that finally tells us yes a 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.700
 message that tells us an error resolves 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.889
 these products we fight the balls 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.470
 because we are I am not connected and 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.239
 here and then it stays like that so 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.930
 I do not understand how it's 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.950
 possible but that's how I tell you 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.230
 it's not credible but I'll try 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.690
 to fix that and I promise you that soon 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.400
 that all this about arranging well admit it 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.100
 you're swinging wrestling videos but at 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.989
 google mean i can tell you that right there 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.100
 will swing that swayed by the way 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.510
 do not worry anyway because 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.340
 I still have some act like 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.290
 some gameplay who have who are when 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.760
 even finally that I kept aside so 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.099
 some catch gameplay that I will go out 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.540
 soon and so I have not 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.709
 a lot i have 2 3d videos 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.540
 really that I had set aside as 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.319
 that but it was really where I would have 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.859
 did not have time to present it to you 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.019
 other 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.790
 so it was spare tire videos 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.069
 so suddenly I wanted to go out 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.109
 so two three games that will come out 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.299
 still badly and after that 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.799
 when i will finally fix this ps4 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.290
 well, I'll balance you all 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.420
 rest so that's all that 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.370
 the ribery prince was told me I tell you 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.930
 very quickly and do not hesitate to react 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.940
 in the comments to say what you 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.380
 have to say want to say and then and 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.380
 and then go 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.740
 he 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.740
 he
