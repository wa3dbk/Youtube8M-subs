00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.210
 good morning to all and my name is nicola piero a san marino pastry shop 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:10.989
 fishing 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:16.349
 I just started doing something for the Easter spirit in this case 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:16.930
 in conclusion 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.689
 of chocolate eggs 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.859
 among other things and chocolate always has me 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.849
 especially taken 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.859
 and because it really is something really interesting 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.520
 and nothing this here is a chocolate egg 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.460
 I state that the chocolate you use is your mind I can't make the name 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.790
 of the company but it is an exhibit called a blend and therefore it is a mixture of 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.250
 2 3 types of chocolate that over the years and have arrived ahaha mix in 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.920
 in the proper balancing of chocolate because they have some 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.110
 particularity 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.630
 and this is a red lipstick which is praline peanuts 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.920
 which I therefore put first 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.360
 baked pens toasting and then one by one as it was made. once l 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.510
 attack with chocolate 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.380
 of course this one goes in there 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.469
 after a surprise and then it must be closed 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.359
 closed that photo now 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.939
 we'll see if we can get out because anyway 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.859
 the preparation of the dipaster egg when it comes to good work 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.579
 craftsmanship unlike industry there is a lot of manual skills in 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.889
 in what you do and you always have to be very careful because 

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:36.560
 however chocolate should be tempered 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.990
 eva worked one of the instant. my polycarbonate 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.759
 it is always kept clean enough away from the water because anyway 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.530
 water led 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.159
 greatly damages the shine itself 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.380
 of chocolate 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.720
 here we start with 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.360
 this is I love at least I personally say keep on making the eggs of 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.350
 Easter still entirely but a lot of hand 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.270
 then a brush 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.460
 when I laugh and chocolate the temperate we start business we say the first 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.719
 layers 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.609
 finished filling 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:17.919
 the first layer of lotnisko will let the chocolate crystallize 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.779
 at naturally temperature environment what is it going on for 5 6 7 layers 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:28.319
 It is clear that this is a function of del 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.990
 of the greatness of man too because he is the smallest 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.859
 - layers are needed 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.969
 precisely because in this case in this case we are talking about a cook 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:43.139
 to the milk and not to the art hardness the resistance of the fondant because the 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:44.619
 much more melting 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:46.709
 resistant 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.949
 you leave as you see 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:54.040
 crystallize push chocolate intervenes in a nanosecond time 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.450
 to make another another pass of chocolate as we have said 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.129
 before 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.370
 we can keep 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.529
 the thickness that we are interested in is the most delicate phase 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.359
 because delicate because 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.079
 meanwhile we have to see s 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.479
 chocolate is crystallized as it is made 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:19.239
 if you look well around the polycarbonate mold there is still 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.589
 now at this moment a drop of chocolate that has not come off 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:27.229
 so if we went now to open the two molds 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.179
 we will find 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:31.539
 an easter egg 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:32.370
 in two 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.569
 because it has not yet crystallized us now we will slowly make sure that 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.799
 this year you 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.559
 dry completely to be able to 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:48.109
 to go there in April use gloves as well as a question is dgn but there is a 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.300
 reason - the specific 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.040
 we are carriers. 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.319
 with all our hands I am a conductor of heat 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.899
 going with your bare hands to touch the egg anyway to fix it for 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:05.509
 decorating it we will leave the footprints as they leave in a but 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.199
 in an investigation investigation here 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:14.239
 these adal footprints wait in terms of aesthetics are very ugly therefore 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.079
 to prevent this from happening you put on a pair of gloves 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.710
 and now let's try to see if we can do it 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.779
 here's how na would seem that 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.680
 the first part came 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.849
 I try 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.680
 to remove excess chocolate from the border 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.930
 I try to open 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.440
 to just widen the mold so that the water can enter 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.440
 allowed it 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.020
 as I told you 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.280
 here in this moment that pop solve as I told you before p twentyh that I am 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:11.039
 important precisely so as not to leave this type of footprint new 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.409
 let's say in the raw state 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:14.680
 it's clear you can 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.380
 every mess brings out his fantasy his% but hysteria 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.389
 in decorating it so here you can even decorate it with 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.520
 some flowers can be made into sugar 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.720
 using that if a chocolate paste is clear 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.069
 you can do what you want 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:39.680
 I will not conceal from you that Sebino is just 30 years old as I told you also in 

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:42.729
 this moment is believe me it is nothing prepared 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.149
 it gives me some satisfaction to see that anyway 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:54.110
 is a product I live is a product that if we consider that we started from 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.849
 a bit of chocolate cake 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.419
 we have it and how can I say modeled we made it 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.999
 mini transmits me still makes me pleasure in doing this today 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.349
 it is clear that there must be passion there must be the desire to do and to 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:14.129
 build something 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:15.430
 % 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.919
 and nothing 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.970
 I'm particularly happy regardless of the microphones that modÃ  la 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:24.199
 camera in front of me
