well the best way for doing this is to

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.279

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
recording over and over again because

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.460 
recording over and over again because
just<00:02:07.270> like<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.630> learn<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.930> words<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.259> pop

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
just like you learn the words to a pop

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.350 
just like you learn the words to a pop
song<00:02:08.649> where<00:02:08.800> anything<00:02:09.160> else<00:02:09.340> if<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.940> learn

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
song where anything else if you learn

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.240 
song where anything else if you learn
the<00:02:10.600> whole<00:02:10.630> piece<00:02:11.020> from<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.320> recording<00:02:11.830> then

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
the whole piece from the recording then

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.500 
the whole piece from the recording then
you'll<00:02:12.370> know<00:02:12.459> exactly<00:02:12.850> where<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.120> come<00:02:13.360> in

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
you'll know exactly where you come in

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.030 
you'll know exactly where you come in
and<00:02:13.720> where<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:13.959> finish<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.530> there'll<00:02:14.769> be<00:02:14.799> no

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
and where you finish and there'll be no

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:27.540 
and where you finish and there'll be no
problems<00:02:15.250> about<00:02:15.700> just<00:02:16.150> knowing<00:02:16.450> your<00:02:16.600> part

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.700 

tip<00:02:28.550> two<00:02:28.820> break<00:02:29.570> down<00:02:29.780> your<00:02:29.900> learning<00:02:30.290> into

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
tip two break down your learning into

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.710 
tip two break down your learning into
smaller<00:02:31.070> more<00:02:31.490> manageable<00:02:31.550> chunks<00:02:32.030> because

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
smaller more manageable chunks because

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.750 
smaller more manageable chunks because
we<00:02:32.870> all<00:02:33.110> know<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.650> it's<00:02:34.070> much<00:02:34.280> easier<00:02:34.700> to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
we all know that it's much easier to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.400 
we all know that it's much easier to
learn<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.030> shorter<00:02:35.450> list<00:02:35.600> than<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.020> is<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.260> learn

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
learn a shorter list than it is to learn

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.080 
learn a shorter list than it is to learn
a<00:02:36.440> longer<00:02:36.770> one<00:02:36.890> it's<00:02:37.400> exactly<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.940> same

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
a longer one it's exactly the same

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.030 
a longer one it's exactly the same
principle<00:02:38.270> that's<00:02:38.660> with<00:02:38.780> exams<00:02:39.140> with<00:02:39.770> any

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
principle that's with exams with any

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.490 
principle that's with exams with any
kind<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.340> information<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:41.120> we<00:02:41.840> have<00:02:42.080> not<00:02:42.470> only

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
kind of information and we have not only

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.290 
kind of information and we have not only
a<00:02:42.770> huge<00:02:43.040> amount<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.370> notes<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.850> learn<00:02:43.970> but<00:02:44.180> also

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
a huge amount of notes to learn but also

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.350 
a huge amount of notes to learn but also
a<00:02:44.390> huge<00:02:44.720> amount<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.320> words<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:46.760> I've<00:02:47.060> got<00:02:47.330> a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
a huge amount of words and so I've got a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.090 
a huge amount of words and so I've got a
quick<00:02:47.570> tip<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:47.990> for<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.290> which<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.709> use<00:02:48.920> all

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
quick tip here for you which I use all

quick tip here for you which I use all
the<00:02:49.190> time<00:02:51.280> here<00:02:52.280> are<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.430> words<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.910> first

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
the time here are the words to the first

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.810 
the time here are the words to the first
verse<00:02:53.420> if<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.780> are<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.230> new<00:02:54.380> day<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:55.640> are<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
verse if you are the new day you are the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.790 
verse if you are the new day you are the
new<00:02:56.030> day<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.510> will<00:02:56.840> love<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:57.140> more<00:02:57.350> than<00:02:57.500> me<00:02:57.650> and

new day I will love you more than me and
more<00:02:57.950> than<00:02:58.130> yesterday<00:02:58.370> if<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.600> can<00:02:59.840> but

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
more than yesterday if you can but

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.740 
more than yesterday if you can but
proved<00:03:00.320> to<00:03:00.530> me<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:01.190> are<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.520> new<00:03:01.640> day<00:03:01.750> now

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
proved to me you are the new day now

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.449 
proved to me you are the new day now
there<00:03:03.140> are<00:03:03.230> six<00:03:03.470> verses<00:03:03.860> like<00:03:03.980> this<00:03:04.220> in<00:03:04.370> this

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
there are six verses like this in this

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.640 
there are six verses like this in this
piece<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.060> often<00:03:05.780> people<00:03:06.050> have<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.440> write

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
piece and often people have to write

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.870 
piece and often people have to write
down<00:03:06.680> words<00:03:07.130> when<00:03:07.370> there<00:03:07.489> are<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:07.640> many

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
down words when there are this many

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.430 
down words when there are this many
because<00:03:08.300> otherwise<00:03:08.510> they'll<00:03:08.780> forget<00:03:09.020> them<00:03:09.230> so

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
because otherwise they'll forget them so

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.580 
because otherwise they'll forget them so
why<00:03:10.400> don't<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.760> create<00:03:11.260> mnemonics<00:03:12.260> for<00:03:12.350> each

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
why don't you create mnemonics for each

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.030 
why don't you create mnemonics for each
of<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:12.890> words<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.239> are<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.660> new<00:03:14.810> day

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
of the words so you are the new day

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.010 
of the words so you are the new day
first<00:03:16.040> letter<00:03:16.250> why<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.239> will<00:03:17.840> love<00:03:17.959> you

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
first letter why you I will love you

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.340 
first letter why you I will love you
more<00:03:18.290> than<00:03:18.380> me<00:03:18.590> first<00:03:19.280> letter<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:20.140> if<00:03:21.140> you

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
more than me first letter I is if you

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.190 
more than me first letter I is if you
will<00:03:21.500> but<00:03:21.620> prove<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:22.040> me<00:03:22.190> first<00:03:23.000> letter<00:03:23.270> I<00:03:23.570> it

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
will but prove to me first letter I it

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.390 
will but prove to me first letter I it
you<00:03:24.890> are<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.040> new<00:03:25.190> day<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.630> isn't<00:03:27.110> you

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
you are the new day you so you isn't you

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.310 
you are the new day you so you isn't you
becomes<00:03:28.400> verse<00:03:28.640> one<00:03:28.910> if<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.780> apply<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.050> same

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
becomes verse one if you apply the same

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.590 
becomes verse one if you apply the same
principle<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.799> all<00:03:31.070> six<00:03:31.730> verses<00:03:32.180> I've<00:03:32.390> written

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
principle to all six verses I've written

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.690 
principle to all six verses I've written
out<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.959> mnemonics<00:03:33.410> for<00:03:33.500> verses<00:03:34.100> two<00:03:34.340> four

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
out the mnemonics for verses two four

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.539 
out the mnemonics for verses two four
and<00:03:34.730> six<00:03:35.170> then<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.320> have<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.739> really<00:03:37.100> easy<00:03:37.190> way

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
and six then you have a really easy way

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.520 
and six then you have a really easy way
of<00:03:37.670> learning<00:03:37.790> all<00:03:38.030> six<00:03:38.239> verses<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:38.780> if<00:03:39.260> you're

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
of learning all six verses and if you're

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.560 
of learning all six verses and if you're
clever<00:03:39.739> take<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.580> first<00:03:40.880> word<00:03:41.120> from<00:03:41.360> each

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
clever take the first word from each

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.900 
clever take the first word from each
mnemonic<00:03:42.350> for<00:03:42.380> each<00:03:42.620> verse<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.269> hey<00:03:44.269> presto

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
mnemonic for each verse and hey presto

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.090 
mnemonic for each verse and hey presto
you<00:03:46.910> have<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.299> mnemonic<00:03:47.540> used<00:03:47.930> up<00:03:48.140> of<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.830> first

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
you have a mnemonic used up of the first

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.880 
you have a mnemonic used up of the first
words<00:03:49.489> of<00:03:49.850> each<00:03:50.239> of<00:03:50.450> those<00:03:50.600> mnemonics<00:03:51.110> you

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
words of each of those mnemonics you

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.600 
words of each of those mnemonics you
sure<00:03:52.489> woulda<00:03:53.030> thought<00:03:53.510> overly<00:03:54.230> hard<00:03:54.610> six

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
sure woulda thought overly hard six

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.039 
sure woulda thought overly hard six
words<00:03:55.880> you've<00:03:56.239> got<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.450> whole<00:03:56.600> piece<00:03:56.810> and

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
words you've got the whole piece and

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.660 
words you've got the whole piece and
that<00:03:57.680> tells<00:03:57.950> you<00:03:58.100> what<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.280> would<00:03:58.430> have<00:03:58.549> done

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
that tells you what you would have done
