00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.019
 hello again today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.540
 another of my trap traps the trap 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:11.719
 what I'm going to teach you today is what I taught 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.820
 on another occasion, that's a trap 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.519
 for squirrels but this time I have 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.100
 placed for rabbits is worth and for 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.789
 capture the living as you can use a 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.250
 loop is a network that we had 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.039
 the tube and show the other video 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.750
 look for it now I'm just going to teach how 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:33.170
 the placed the straight 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.710
 remember everything a romantic 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.559
 that 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.120
 instead of using three sticks tied I have 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.629
 caught two with this shape and posture 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.710
 under then we turn it around 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:50.739
 on the pole we support it a 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.829
 end of this there holding it and the 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.190
 another on another stick than the clear on the 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.729
 I now land for the net to the stick that goes to 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.310
 get fired and if it is tied a 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.520
 piece of string 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:09.210
 short and that piece of rope can a 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.850
 ring of these that come with keychains 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.420
 aissami and the other four strings 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.120
 equally long reported each other 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.640
 extreme 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.159
 to one side of each network that is like a 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.820
 square 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:28.380
 I spread here above 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.530
 and now look what we put like that if we put 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.970
 the ring in the middle will not work I 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.490
 to explain why because if this is 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.200
 raise as you see that rope is in 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.750
 medium then hit the animal 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.119
 and me of kogelo trapped then maybe 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.909
 you get out of the trap then for that 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.960
 you have to put the ring here and the two 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.330
 strings that go to which we are 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.180
 far away we join together a little 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.030
 and then the space is this then 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.540
 the other we cover a little 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.760
 The last step is how to use the network with 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.380
 leaves and all that I 'm going to do now 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.820
 so you can see the best demo 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.580
 how we went with everything there 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.980
 around and up to the trap then 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.980
 came the rabbit around here he plays the stick 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.460
 as you see 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.520
 if you lift the branch catching the animal 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.530
 he has not raised it alone because it weighs 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.340
 quite this stone but the network would have 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.400
 that being this way is worth the branch is left 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.690
 It would have to be here at the top 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.800
 but hey more or less this is the weight 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.770
 then if he wants he left there and the rabbit does not 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.150
 is going anywhere 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.900
 will come back here alone better 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.900
 the stick 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:55.000
 the four sticks and the ends when tying 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:56.650
 to each end as well today closes 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.390
 The good thing about the network is that there is more 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.320
 chances of catching the animal is worth 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.680
 because it always gives all what the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.879
 tie is just catch a part 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.879
 thanks for watching
