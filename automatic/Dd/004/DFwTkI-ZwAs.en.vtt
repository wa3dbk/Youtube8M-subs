is<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.640> should<00:03:21.849> have<00:03:21.879> a<00:03:22.060> diet<00:03:22.390> without

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
is that you should have a diet without

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:23.970 
is that you should have a diet without
dieting

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
dieting

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.300 
dieting
you<00:03:24.400> can't<00:03:24.700> build<00:03:25.030> muscle<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.890> what<00:03:27.129> these

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
you can't build muscle so what these

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.599 
you can't build muscle so what these
things<00:03:27.609> do<00:03:27.910> they<00:03:28.180> just<00:03:28.420> add<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:28.629> little<00:03:28.989> bit<00:03:29.349> of

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
things do they just add a little bit of

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:39.199 
things do they just add a little bit of
extra<00:03:31.349> what<00:03:32.349> do<00:03:32.410> you<00:03:32.470> say<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:34.590> kind<00:03:35.590> of

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.110 

I<00:03:39.860> don't<00:03:40.860> know<00:03:40.980> but<00:03:41.220> it's<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.640> kind<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.000> what

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
I don't know but it's the kind of what

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.270 
I don't know but it's the kind of what
you<00:03:42.239> say<00:03:42.450> they<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.349> give<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.709> an<00:03:43.800> extra<00:03:44.190> edge

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
you say they just give you an extra edge

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.720 
you say they just give you an extra edge

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
you know when you're dieting so it's

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.760 
you know when you're dieting so it's
pointless<00:03:48.360> when<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.810> use<00:03:49.080> these<00:03:49.290> stuff<00:03:49.590> and

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
pointless when you use these stuff and

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.400 
pointless when you use these stuff and
you<00:03:49.830> don't<00:03:49.950> diet<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.959> should<00:03:55.170> try

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
you don't diet and you should try

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
different some rules you should try all

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.990 
different some rules you should try all
sorts<00:03:58.860> of<00:03:59.069> supplements<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.209> should<00:04:00.239> cry<00:04:01.610> too

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.540 

you<00:04:06.000> should<00:04:06.239> try<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> see<00:04:07.130> what's<00:04:08.130> best<00:04:08.430> for

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550
