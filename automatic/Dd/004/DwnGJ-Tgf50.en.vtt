crazy let your imagination run wild

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.459 
crazy let your imagination run wild
that's<00:00:35.850> what<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.059> like<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.960> also<00:00:37.200> like

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
that's what I like about it I also like

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.959 
that's what I like about it I also like
the<00:00:37.590> fact<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.950> don't<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.760> pick

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
the fact that you don't have to pick

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.060 
the fact that you don't have to pick
just<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.300> color<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> little

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
just one color and I can be a little

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
just one color and I can be a little
indecisive<00:00:41.550> when<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.059> comes<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:42.750> color

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
indecisive when it comes to which color

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.410 
indecisive when it comes to which color
to<00:00:43.290> paint<00:00:43.469> my<00:00:43.680> nails<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:44.280> think<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.059> stems<00:00:45.300> from

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
to paint my nails I think it stems from

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.229 
to paint my nails I think it stems from
the<00:00:45.629> fact<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.469> many<00:00:46.620> colors<00:00:47.239> that

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the fact that I have so many colors that

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.360 
the fact that I have so many colors that
this<00:00:48.450> opens<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.079> my<00:00:49.230> collections<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.980> don't

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
this opens up my collections I don't

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.330 
this opens up my collections I don't
have<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.000> choose<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:51.780> color<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.920> most

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
have to choose just one color it's most

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.430 
have to choose just one color it's most
common<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:54.059> pick<00:00:54.239> two<00:00:54.449> colors<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.230> there's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
common to pick two colors but there's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.439 
common to pick two colors but there's
nothing<00:00:55.739> stopping<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.250> from<00:00:56.280> picking<00:00:56.760> 3<00:00:57.120> even

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
nothing stopping you from picking 3 even

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.900 
nothing stopping you from picking 3 even
5<00:00:58.020> colors<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.859> doing<00:00:59.129> every<00:00:59.370> single<00:00:59.730> nail<00:00:59.879> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
5 colors and doing every single nail a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.479 
5 colors and doing every single nail a
different<00:01:00.420> color<00:01:00.660> when<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
different color when really it is up to

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.160 
different color when really it is up to
you

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.140 
you
so<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.979> picked<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.549> couple<00:01:05.909> of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
so I have picked a couple of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.910 
so I have picked a couple of
combinations<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.200> liking<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
combinations that I'm liking at the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.800 
combinations that I'm liking at the
moment<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.850> don't<00:01:09.000> paint<00:01:09.630> my<00:01:09.780> nails

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810

depending on the season I paint whatever
I<00:01:13.380> feel<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.710> painting<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.760> could<00:01:14.909> be

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
I feel like painting so it could be

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.370 
I feel like painting so it could be
winter<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.570> could<00:01:15.750> still<00:01:15.960> wear<00:01:16.080> bright

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
by season and around the world at the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.160 
by season and around the world at the
moment<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.740> either<00:01:22.979> spring<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:23.939> autumn<00:01:24.170> /

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
moment it's either spring or autumn /

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.640 
moment it's either spring or autumn /
fall<00:01:25.740> depending<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.580> where<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.880> are<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.650> I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
fall depending on where you are and I

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
fall depending on where you are and I
understand<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.939> there<00:01:30.180> are<00:01:30.299> quite<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> few

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
understand that so there are quite a few

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.030 
understand that so there are quite a few
brights<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.500> that's<00:01:31.650> what<00:01:31.829> I'm

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
brights because that's what I'm

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.249 
brights because that's what I'm
gravitating<00:01:32.549> towards<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> moment<00:01:33.780> but

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
gravitating towards at the moment but

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.380 
gravitating towards at the moment but
there<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.560> also<00:01:34.740> some<00:01:35.070> darker<00:01:35.490> or<00:01:35.670> more<00:01:35.700> muted

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
there are also some darker or more muted

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.440 
there are also some darker or more muted
tones<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.530> hopefully<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.790> will<00:01:38.970> help<00:01:39.030> you

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.030 
by oli and this one's called blue color
by<00:02:33.350> oli<00:02:33.950> as<00:02:34.370> well<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:35.110> really<00:02:36.110> like<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.680> mixture

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
by oli as well I really like the mixture

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.360 
by oli as well I really like the mixture
of<00:02:37.370> Blues<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.270> corals<00:02:39.020> or<00:02:39.230> oranges<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:39.980> think

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
of Blues and corals or oranges I think

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.180 
of Blues and corals or oranges I think
they<00:02:40.550> go<00:02:40.760> together<00:02:41.000> really<00:02:41.420> really<00:02:41.720> well<00:02:42.190> it's

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
they go together really really well it's

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.690 
they go together really really well it's
very<00:02:43.520> bright<00:02:43.940> very<00:02:44.570> pink<00:02:44.930> coral<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.550> is

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
very bright very pink coral and this is

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.290 
very bright very pink coral and this is
a<00:02:46.730> very<00:02:47.120> very<00:02:47.660> nice<00:02:48.280> sky-blue<00:02:49.280> it's<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> bit

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
a very very nice sky-blue it's a bit

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.320 
a very very nice sky-blue it's a bit
bright<00:02:50.630> it's<00:02:51.170> not<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.680> light<00:02:51.950> blue<00:02:52.310> it's<00:02:52.580> quite

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
bright it's not a light blue it's quite

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.480 
bright it's not a light blue it's quite
a<00:02:53.360> bright<00:02:53.690> sky-blue<00:02:54.290> but<00:02:54.620> I<00:02:54.890> think<00:02:55.160> they<00:02:55.280> go<00:02:55.430> to

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
a bright sky-blue but I think they go to

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.580 
a bright sky-blue but I think they go to
get<00:02:55.640> their<00:02:55.700> really<00:02:56.060> nice<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.540> again<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:57.110> think

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
get their really nice and again I think

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.580 
get their really nice and again I think
this<00:02:57.770> would<00:02:57.950> be<00:02:57.980> great<00:02:58.280> for<00:02:58.430> summer<00:02:58.700> or<00:02:58.970> spring

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
this would be great for summer or spring

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.110 
this would be great for summer or spring
so<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.709> next<00:03:00.890> color<00:03:01.160> combination<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.850> really

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
so the next color combination I really

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.720 
so the next color combination I really
like<00:03:02.330> they're<00:03:03.170> both<00:03:03.290> by<00:03:03.590> Sally<00:03:03.890> Hansen<00:03:04.130> and

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
like they're both by Sally Hansen and

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.810 
like they're both by Sally Hansen and
it's<00:03:05.270> Pacific<00:03:05.780> Blue<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.350> mint<00:03:06.650> sorbet<00:03:07.130> now

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
it's Pacific Blue and mint sorbet now

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.199 
it's Pacific Blue and mint sorbet now
Pacific<00:03:08.300> Blue<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.480> think<00:03:08.810> goes<00:03:08.990> with<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:09.740> many

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
Pacific Blue I think goes with so many

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.790 
Pacific Blue I think goes with so many
different<00:03:11.209> colors<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.260> think<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.620> looks

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
different colors and I think it looks

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.190 
different colors and I think it looks
fantastic<00:03:13.030> with<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.150> accent<00:03:14.570> nail<00:03:14.750> trends

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
fantastic with the accent nail trends

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.810 
fantastic with the accent nail trends
it's<00:03:16.030> quite<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> bright<00:03:17.660> blue<00:03:18.530> but<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.580> has<00:03:19.790> a

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
it's quite a bright blue but it has a

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.500 
it's quite a bright blue but it has a
kiss<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.630> purple<00:03:21.290> lavender<00:03:21.800> through<00:03:22.580> it<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.360> it

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
kiss of purple lavender through it so it

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.390 
kiss of purple lavender through it so it
is<00:03:23.630> quite<00:03:24.050> bright<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:24.890> think<00:03:25.160> it's<00:03:25.280> an

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
is quite bright but I think it's an

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.000 
is quite bright but I think it's an
absolutely<00:03:25.820> stunning<00:03:26.180> color<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:27.080> of<00:03:27.769> course

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
absolutely stunning color and of course

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.540 
absolutely stunning color and of course
mint<00:03:28.250> sorbet<00:03:28.640> is<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.970> very<00:03:29.390> true<00:03:29.840> mint<00:03:30.410> color<00:03:30.890> so

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
mint sorbet is a very true mint color so

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.890 
mint sorbet is a very true mint color so
I<00:03:31.580> think<00:03:31.640> that<00:03:31.880> one<00:03:32.000> would<00:03:32.120> also<00:03:32.300> work<00:03:32.660> nicely

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
I think that one would also work nicely

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.740 
I think that one would also work nicely
with<00:03:33.080> a<00:03:33.260> pink<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.920> light<00:03:34.880> pink<00:03:35.150> or<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.420> bright

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
with a pink a light pink or a bright

these colors by starting with the
lightest<00:04:22.400> one<00:04:22.610> on<00:04:22.910> my<00:04:23.060> middle<00:04:23.270> finger<00:04:23.390> the

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
lightest one on my middle finger the

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.150 
lightest one on my middle finger the
teal<00:04:24.740> on<00:04:25.550> the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
teal on the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.130 
teal on the
finger<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.670> pointer<00:04:27.030> finger<00:04:27.420> and<00:04:27.660> the

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
finger and the pointer finger and the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.340 
finger and the pointer finger and the
purple<00:04:28.620> was<00:04:28.740> on<00:04:28.860> my<00:04:28.950> pinky<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.430> my<00:04:29.520> thumb<00:04:29.760> now

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
purple was on my pinky and my thumb now

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.480 
purple was on my pinky and my thumb now
and<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.410> really<00:04:31.590> liked<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:31.980> it<00:04:32.010> was<00:04:32.160> kind<00:04:32.370> of

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
and I really liked it it was kind of

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.420 
and I really liked it it was kind of
mermaid<00:04:33.150> esque<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.740> think<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:35.010> next<00:04:35.130> color

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
mermaid esque so I think the next color

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.070 
mermaid esque so I think the next color
combination<00:04:35.970> would<00:04:36.090> work<00:04:36.270> for<00:04:36.420> either<00:04:36.600> spring

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
combination would work for either spring

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.310 
combination would work for either spring
or<00:04:37.290> autumn<00:04:37.460> it's<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.610> OPI<00:04:38.970> colors<00:04:39.480> the<00:04:40.080> first

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
or autumn it's to OPI colors the first

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.650 
or autumn it's to OPI colors the first
color<00:04:40.560> is<00:04:40.650> Stranger<00:04:41.130> Tides<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.270> second

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
color is Stranger Tides and the second

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.100 
color is Stranger Tides and the second
color<00:04:42.810> is<00:04:42.900> auto<00:04:43.320> roll<00:04:43.980> down<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.400> window<00:04:45.110> so

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
color is auto roll down the window so

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.320 
color is auto roll down the window so
one<00:04:46.350> is<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:47.070> light<00:04:48.440> minty<00:04:49.440> green<00:04:49.860> with<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.610> kiss

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
one is a light minty green with a kiss

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.520 
one is a light minty green with a kiss
of<00:04:51.600> gray<00:04:52.340> beige<00:04:53.340> through<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.930> it's<00:04:55.140> not<00:04:55.470> a

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
of gray beige through it so it's not a

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.760 
of gray beige through it so it's not a
really<00:04:56.130> minty<00:04:56.640> minty<00:04:56.970> green<00:04:57.440> like<00:04:58.440> mint

so<00:05:18.960> with<00:05:19.500> these<00:05:20.190> colors<00:05:20.760> it<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.630> a<00:05:22.080> really<00:05:22.560> nice

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
so with these colors it is a really nice

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.880 
so with these colors it is a really nice
pastel<00:05:24.020> lavender<00:05:25.700> it<00:05:26.700> is<00:05:27.170> almost<00:05:28.170> a<00:05:28.350> pinky

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
pastel lavender it is almost a pinky

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.850 
pastel lavender it is almost a pinky
lavender<00:05:29.460> and<00:05:30.590> then<00:05:31.590> a<00:05:31.620> true<00:05:32.250> purple<00:05:33.210> and<00:05:33.860> they

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.830 
lavender and then a true purple and they
work<00:05:35.100> really<00:05:35.850> well<00:05:36.120> together

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
work really well together

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.650 
work really well together
I<00:05:36.870> think<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:38.160> pale<00:05:38.580> pub<00:05:38.850> would<00:05:39.030> also<00:05:39.240> work

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
I think the pale pub would also work

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.000 
I think the pale pub would also work
well<00:05:39.960> with<00:05:40.290> mint<00:05:40.860> sorbet<00:05:41.310> or<00:05:42.680> green<00:05:43.680> a

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
well with mint sorbet or green a

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.460 
well with mint sorbet or green a
different<00:05:45.000> type<00:05:45.120> of<00:05:45.150> mint<00:05:45.510> green<00:05:48.169> the<00:05:49.169> next

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
different type of mint green the next

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.560 
different type of mint green the next
two<00:05:49.650> colors<00:05:50.190> are<00:05:50.490> definitely<00:05:51.150> an<00:05:51.300> awesome

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
two colors are definitely an awesome

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.860 
two colors are definitely an awesome
combination<00:05:52.290> or<00:05:52.919> fall<00:05:53.700> depending<00:05:54.150> on<00:05:54.690> what

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
combination or fall depending on what

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.340 
combination or fall depending on what
you<00:05:54.960> call<00:05:55.200> it<00:05:55.520> so<00:05:56.520> it's<00:05:57.090> take<00:05:57.600> a<00:05:57.630> chance<00:05:57.930> and

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
you call it so it's take a chance and

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.970 
you call it so it's take a chance and
rage<00:05:59.130> I<00:05:59.870> also<00:06:00.870> like<00:06:01.230> the<00:06:01.410> difference<00:06:01.740> in<00:06:01.890> the

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
rage I also like the difference in the

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.310 
rage I also like the difference in the
textures<00:06:02.520> for<00:06:02.760> the<00:06:02.910> finishes<00:06:03.419> this<00:06:03.870> is<00:06:04.050> very

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
textures for the finishes this is very

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.290 
textures for the finishes this is very
shimmery<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:04.919> this<00:06:05.280> is<00:06:05.400> still<00:06:05.610> shimmery<00:06:06.030> that

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
shimmery and this is still shimmery that

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.159 
shimmery and this is still shimmery that
it<00:06:06.419> doesn't<00:06:06.810> have<00:06:07.020> that<00:06:07.290> glittery<00:06:08.250> look<00:06:08.520> to<00:06:08.760> it

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
it doesn't have that glittery look to it

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.600 
it doesn't have that glittery look to it
so<00:06:10.169> take<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.650> chance<00:06:10.919> is<00:06:11.340> a<00:06:11.880> deep<00:06:12.800> red<00:06:13.800> with

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
so take a chance is a deep red with

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.300 
so take a chance is a deep red with
flecks<00:06:14.970> of<00:06:15.090> gold<00:06:15.330> through<00:06:15.720> it<00:06:15.840> and<00:06:16.080> it<00:06:17.010> picks

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
flecks of gold through it and it picks

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.580 
flecks of gold through it and it picks
up<00:06:17.460> that<00:06:17.669> bronzy<00:06:18.270> Goldy<00:06:18.840> tone<00:06:19.200> in<00:06:19.650> rage<00:06:21.560> so<00:06:22.560> I

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
up that bronzy Goldy tone in rage so I

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.990 
up that bronzy Goldy tone in rage so I
think<00:06:22.740> those<00:06:23.070> two<00:06:23.310> would<00:06:23.370> make<00:06:23.520> a<00:06:23.580> really<00:06:23.850> good

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
think those two would make a really good

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.960 
think those two would make a really good
color<00:06:24.210> combination<00:06:24.480> for<00:06:24.900> autumn<00:06:25.790> second<00:06:26.790> last

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
color combination for autumn second last

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.700 
color combination for autumn second last
combination<00:06:27.270> we've<00:06:27.990> got<00:06:28.140> to<00:06:28.290> China<00:06:28.560> Glaze

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
combination we've got to China Glaze

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.860 
combination we've got to China Glaze
colors<00:06:29.250> it's<00:06:29.940> black<00:06:30.240> diamonds<00:06:30.750> and

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
colors it's black diamonds and

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.690 
colors it's black diamonds and
cha-cha-cha<00:06:31.500> now<00:06:32.070> I<00:06:32.100> really<00:06:32.580> like

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.700 
cha-cha-cha now I really like

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.940 
cha-cha-cha now I really like
cha-cha-cha<00:06:33.480> I<00:06:33.720> think<00:06:34.260> that<00:06:34.410> would<00:06:34.530> go<00:06:34.680> with

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
cha-cha-cha I think that would go with

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.129 
cha-cha-cha I think that would go with
other<00:06:35.250> colors

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
other colors

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.390 
other colors
like<00:06:36.280> maybe<00:06:37.280> a<00:06:37.370> blue<00:06:37.849> color<00:06:38.830> even<00:06:39.830> Purple's

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
like maybe a blue color even Purple's

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.309 
like maybe a blue color even Purple's
deep<00:06:40.759> purple's<00:06:41.330> would<00:06:41.509> go<00:06:41.659> well<00:06:41.870> with<00:06:42.020> it<00:06:42.080> as

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
deep purple's would go well with it as

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.409 
deep purple's would go well with it as
well<00:06:42.550> but<00:06:43.550> yeah<00:06:43.759> it's<00:06:43.939> a<00:06:43.999> really<00:06:44.150> different

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
well but yeah it's a really different

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:46.239 
well but yeah it's a really different
color<00:06:44.719> but<00:06:44.930> I<00:06:44.960> really<00:06:45.289> like<00:06:45.469> it<00:06:45.710> I<00:06:45.830> think<00:06:45.979> this

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:46.249 
color but I really like it I think this

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:48.999 
color but I really like it I think this
would<00:06:46.430> work<00:06:46.580> for<00:06:46.639> spring<00:06:47.330> or<00:06:47.599> autumn<00:06:48.050> with<00:06:48.919> the

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:49.009 
would work for spring or autumn with the

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:51.010 
would work for spring or autumn with the
darker<00:06:49.400> color<00:06:49.430> it<00:06:49.969> is<00:06:50.090> more<00:06:50.360> of<00:06:50.449> an<00:06:50.539> autumn

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
darker color it is more of an autumn

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.330 
darker color it is more of an autumn
winter<00:06:51.349> feel<00:06:51.830> so<00:06:52.960> Black<00:06:53.960> Diamond<00:06:54.169> is<00:06:54.680> pretty

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
winter feel so Black Diamond is pretty

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.709 
winter feel so Black Diamond is pretty
much<00:06:55.490> charcoal<00:06:56.270> with<00:06:57.229> a<00:06:57.439> shimmery<00:06:58.400> slaw

00:06:59.709 --> 00:06:59.719 
much charcoal with a shimmery slaw

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:02.890 
much charcoal with a shimmery slaw
shine<00:07:00.229> through<00:07:00.979> it<00:07:01.129> and<00:07:01.430> cha-cha-cha<00:07:02.300> is<00:07:02.840> a

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
shine through it and cha-cha-cha is a

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.369 
shine through it and cha-cha-cha is a
really<00:07:03.379> really<00:07:03.620> bright<00:07:03.889> vibrant<00:07:04.789> green<00:07:05.749> with

00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:06.379 
really really bright vibrant green with

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.999 
really really bright vibrant green with
yellow<00:07:06.770> chrome<00:07:07.759> through<00:07:08.389> it<00:07:08.710> but<00:07:09.710> I<00:07:09.800> think

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:10.009 
yellow chrome through it but I think

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:12.279 
yellow chrome through it but I think
together<00:07:10.240> green<00:07:11.240> as<00:07:11.389> the<00:07:11.509> accent<00:07:11.870> nail<00:07:11.960> would

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:12.289 
together green as the accent nail would

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:14.980 
together green as the accent nail would
definitely<00:07:12.650> make<00:07:12.830> it<00:07:12.979> pop<00:07:13.219> and<00:07:13.750> the<00:07:14.750> last

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:14.990 
definitely make it pop and the last

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.830 
definitely make it pop and the last
combination<00:07:15.770> which<00:07:15.979> I<00:07:16.189> really<00:07:16.699> like<00:07:16.939> as<00:07:17.240> well

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
combination which I really like as well

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.959 
combination which I really like as well
it's<00:07:18.080> an<00:07:18.169> oli<00:07:18.409> color<00:07:18.830> called<00:07:19.189> orange<00:07:19.580> sorbet

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:19.969 
it's an oli color called orange sorbet

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:24.969 
it's an oli color called orange sorbet
and<00:07:20.949> a<00:07:21.949> Revlon<00:07:22.310> color<00:07:22.580> called<00:07:23.090> royal<00:07:23.830> again<00:07:24.830> I

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:24.979 
and a Revlon color called royal again I

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:27.730 
and a Revlon color called royal again I
really<00:07:25.550> love<00:07:25.789> blues<00:07:26.240> with<00:07:26.659> corals<00:07:27.139> and<00:07:27.439> these

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 
really love blues with corals and these

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.570 
really love blues with corals and these
two<00:07:28.099> just<00:07:28.400> set<00:07:29.029> each<00:07:29.210> other<00:07:29.479> off<00:07:30.009> the<00:07:31.009> royal

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580 
two just set each other off the royal

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.879 
two just set each other off the royal
would<00:07:32.060> look<00:07:32.240> fantastic<00:07:32.449> with<00:07:33.080> maybe<00:07:33.379> Pink's

would look fantastic with maybe Pink's

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:37.989

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.830 
bright fuchsia pink I think would work

well<00:07:40.069> with<00:07:40.219> this<00:07:40.310> one<00:07:40.520> and<00:07:41.020> with<00:07:42.020> the<00:07:42.199> orange

well with this one and with the orange

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:44.350 
well with this one and with the orange
sorbet<00:07:42.770> I<00:07:43.159> just<00:07:43.400> think<00:07:43.580> it<00:07:43.729> works<00:07:43.939> really<00:07:44.180> well

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360
