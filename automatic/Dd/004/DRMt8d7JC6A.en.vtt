00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
a reason why I flip it over and I'll

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.509 
a reason why I flip it over and I'll
share<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.610> with<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.850> second<00:02:45.519> whenever

you're scoring and folding and most of

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.610 
you're scoring and folding and most of
you<00:02:48.320> probably<00:02:48.380> know<00:02:48.769> this<00:02:49.040> but<00:02:49.220> if<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.400> don't

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
you probably know this but if you don't

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.259 
you probably know this but if you don't
it's<00:02:51.620> always<00:02:52.040> best<00:02:52.340> when<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.640> score<00:02:53.060> that

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269

you're going to want to fold on the
mountain<00:02:55.489> side<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:57.530> was<00:02:57.830> where<00:02:58.070> we<00:02:58.310> did

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
from tearing if it's one of those cards

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.390 
from tearing if it's one of those cards
X<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.489> has<00:03:10.519> a<00:03:10.670> tendency<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.360> tear<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:13.190> then

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
X that has a tendency to tear so then

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.740 
X that has a tendency to tear so then
we're<00:03:13.549> gonna<00:03:13.640> fold<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:14.030> up<00:03:14.150> like<00:03:14.299> that

folds that's another pocket so in order

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.640 
folds that's another pocket so in order
to<00:03:56.210> create<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:56.540> what<00:03:57.050> we're<00:03:57.140> gonna<00:03:57.230> do<00:03:57.410> first

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
to create that what we're gonna do first

necessary um my inspiration for this

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.430 
necessary um my inspiration for this
page<00:07:01.530> I'd<00:07:01.740> actually<00:07:02.040> saw<00:07:02.250> a<00:07:02.550> physics<00:07:03.480> die<00:07:03.870> that

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
page I'd actually saw a physics die that

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.930 
page I'd actually saw a physics die that
you<00:07:04.530> can<00:07:04.710> buy<00:07:04.830> it's<00:07:05.190> called<00:07:05.370> a<00:07:05.460> pocket<00:07:05.610> page

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 
you can buy it's called a pocket page

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.390 
you can buy it's called a pocket page
die<00:07:06.540> and<00:07:06.990> I<00:07:07.230> was<00:07:07.410> looking<00:07:08.010> at<00:07:08.130> and<00:07:08.250> I<00:07:08.280> thought

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 
die and I was looking at and I thought

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.190 
die and I was looking at and I thought
oh<00:07:08.520> that's<00:07:08.760> really<00:07:09.090> cute<00:07:09.510> but<00:07:09.750> I'm<00:07:09.870> thinking

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
oh that's really cute but I'm thinking

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.840 
oh that's really cute but I'm thinking
you<00:07:10.290> know<00:07:10.380> I<00:07:10.410> could<00:07:10.830> probably<00:07:11.160> make<00:07:11.520> that<00:07:11.550> page

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:11.850 
you know I could probably make that page

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.700 
you know I could probably make that page
myself<00:07:12.270> so<00:07:12.510> there's<00:07:12.660> actually<00:07:12.840> successive

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
myself so there's actually successive

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.520 
myself so there's actually successive
die<00:07:13.860> that<00:07:14.520> will<00:07:14.640> create<00:07:14.850> this<00:07:15.030> page<00:07:15.380> for<00:07:16.380> you

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
die that will create this page for you

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.560 
die that will create this page for you
so<00:07:16.770> I<00:07:16.800> just<00:07:16.950> kind<00:07:17.370> of<00:07:17.460> did<00:07:17.970> it<00:07:18.000> without<00:07:18.270> the<00:07:18.420> die

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570 
so I just kind of did it without the die

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.990 
so I just kind of did it without the die
it's<00:07:18.930> really<00:07:19.140> not<00:07:19.260> necessary<00:07:19.730> so<00:07:20.730> there<00:07:20.880> you

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000
