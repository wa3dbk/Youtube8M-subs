00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.650
 hello welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.850
 really simple recipe 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.710
 as simple as making a simple one 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:38.240
 fruit milkshake 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.860
 this is one of the recipes that I love 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:46.640
 more to do for my breakfasts in this 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.680
 case I'll use apples and bananas but 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.400
 you can do absolutely with any 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.870
 kind of fruit I hope the law 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.309
 life to your liking 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.780
 let's go straight to the ingredients 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.170
 what we need for our fu 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.900
 side or fruit frappe an apple than me 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.680
 I've already cut a banana also already 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.620
 cut sugar circulated but it is not 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.640
 necessarily mandatory if you want 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.680
 Garnish with some milk chocolate 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.229
 then of course the whisk is a 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.080
 container where you can whisk the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.369
 the fruit if you have one of those 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.380
 big glasses is better I am this and 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.600
 nothing so this is all that 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.119
 we need for one thing we add the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:51.799
 our fruit then apples and bananas 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:54.950
 in this case bananas then apples second 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.759
 if you want it more or less sweet it 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 sugar 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.490
 I usually add a teaspoon e 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.490
 half 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:20.100
 and then the milk about 60 ml of milk or 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.880
 however enough to cover the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.190
 our crush then we take ours 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.780
 whisk or if you already have the blender 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.650
 those a little more professional goes 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.650
 very well that one 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.110
 our frappe and nice smoothie 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:56.170
 let's take a nice put 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:57.450
 big glass in this way then with a 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.190
 teaspoon 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.850
 we are going to garnish it with some 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.850
 chocolate 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.360
 and our smoothie is nice that ready 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.040
 to taste 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.970
 I hope you enjoyed the recipe 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.320
