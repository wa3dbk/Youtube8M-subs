00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.300
 Rome Derks 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.430
 promote 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.930
 you drive kz2 this year you have been world champion european champion 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.439
 stay by your bed in this class why 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.099
 Marc van also likes it very much 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.150
 it's very close racing 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.759
 and it is also affordable 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.019
 affordable approaching 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.289
 okay affordable with the viewer will wonder what is affordable 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.169
 for season and k 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.390
 I myself would not dare say that they were on the job in a strange way 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.500
 medication 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 compared to motor racing I think it is certainly a quarter 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.030
 also a rich lake 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.080
 that is a quarter of the costs 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.220
 so angry that he high tec i see the teddy bear help 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.960
 that creates in with the latest material this year 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.080
 what does a card cost 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.340
 we just didn't get in 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.830
 okay what beautiful Jennefer lived there 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.340
 but okay if I would drive I would also like to know what was damage 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.010
 was then driven 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.980
 but this year I also participate 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.730
 how does this season go that moment it goes very well there we are 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.370
 on 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.440
 no i am at a championship 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.440
 and that there are three races to go so you can do anything 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.940
 Well with the rain coming from the sky, the weather is your weather 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.350
 sometimes yes sometimes not 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.610
 heart for each other ax 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.200
 if it's not good the poor 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.440
 then it will be difficult 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.110
 also got you I have watched with weather on which stand for rain adjustment 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.110
 both were nice and two positions and pipes 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.470
 so it appears 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.930
 your competitors you have the enemy 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.080
 Yes a lot 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.080
 there are so many 15 I don't think you want to participate in the fight 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.380
 also a separate one 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.430
 bees 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.490
 in the middle of the field, the town had pupils far behind 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.310
 co2 that I understand but support should choose between the middle or 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.750
 at the back yes or no longer in the doors 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.730
 The problem is, of course, that they all clap there and that I 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.190
 this was the one blow 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.120
 they were waiting 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.440
 I have just looked at the banner it is a nice long job most important 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.899
 lots of fun 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.939
 cant in the bends that turned out to be the rain 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.499
 and lots of peeing 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.079
 from me 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.040
 unless you have to push your opponent a little to the inside it 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.199
 freezes 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.529
 also has the 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:23.889
 that job heart what he himself of the job 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.939
 I think it is a very nice job really flat 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.769
 mail 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.189
 nice but yes 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.369
 and very fast 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.809
 yes flat you mean of course that the asphalt is bumpy and it is beautiful 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:38.809
 there is nice quality if both have a nice bend 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.469
 a long straight with a little bit of chalk with a bend to the right 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.679
 you have to be your mother I bend yes yes then 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:49.289
 a fierce riots but I wanted quite a balloon flight per kilometer 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:50.249
 o'clock 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.799
 inside and outside with second proposition that think miles 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.829
 so the best and in the bend so throw 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.759
 are going to slide to another 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.839
 yes, because of course you have power outside of the centers in the corner 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.869
 braking delay earlier in sitting and that made the parts more difficult 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:09.729
 it probably 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.819
 I have also seen that you are mainly dealing with the vacant here with one 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.129
 dirty line 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.269
 very sensitive ok yes very gentleman if you as a trainer you are next to the 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.469
 ideal line then 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.529
 I wanted to lose my legs, I didn't even count 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.889
 also etc yes sometimes want to be angry that 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.029
 then certainly with jobs with the other side drinking that the high camp it 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:34.539
 In the broadest sense, the asphalt is therefore somewhat stiffer 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.719
 but that is also true here 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.599
 not really he becomes because the ea that the ideal line is quite wide 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.599
 we sit it seems that you are just beside the rest in the area 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.889
 under the clothes and 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.109
 on the drummer is slippery 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.709
 you have to train a will 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.139
 delete it completely if you score the shortest way the fastest 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.779
 to see the hospital bacterium 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.149
 no that time for style 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.659
 yes I already have a hefty about a bright yellow 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.659
 is that permissively poor 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:08.790
 it is true that you are there what goes to the inside, you have to 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:11.789
 with the account holder then you should not be able to go to the new year 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:15.369
 a pick-up store also benefited the club site on board 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.430
 dp will not be a problem 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.289
 they are jobs deere and apparently marie claire danes van 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.900
 living space 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.430
 also give a name to follow days 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.180
 after the training and with this says we come even better prepared 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.889
 interview 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.889
 good luck 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.649
 w 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.539
 look 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.069
 the 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.860
 the 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.860
 6 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.439
 6 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:05.869
 the 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.229
 the 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.770
 the 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:00.669
 so 

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:24.689
 6 

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.759
 she's sitting 

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.759
 the 500 meters 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.710
