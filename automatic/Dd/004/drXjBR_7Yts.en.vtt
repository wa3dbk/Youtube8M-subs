00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.910
 but still we see and today growth 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.200
 Russian currency why we ask Gleb 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.970
 ass and which ends to us from 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.889
 parents canals fisherman happy park hyatt 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.170
 Gleb good afternoon please tell me 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.199
 what is the reason for this 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.240
 tolerance of the Russian currency is kind 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 day I think that now our course 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.240
 national currency already throughout 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.500
 quite a long time that is 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.619
 throughout January 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.160
 constrained artificially and lowering 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.990
 rating of Russia by rating agency 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.460
 standard end purse of course negative 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.649
 affected the course of the Russian currency I 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.570
 waited honestly for more stormy 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.079
 the reaction in the market is because of that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.420
 parties to those quotes that we see 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.860
 Now on the market this decision was already 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.809
 pre- laid because of this 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.850
 talked back in the month of December on the other 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.260
 the parties believe that again the Russian 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.110
 ruble is artificially holding back 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.140
 the fact is that last year the ruble exchange rate 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.230
 the dollar rate is more precisely that was laid 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.090
 budget of about 37 rubles at the price of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.129
 $ 100 oil is a law budget 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.510
 respectively , budget receipts from 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.990
 oil sales in rubles should be 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.119
 somewhere about 3800 rubles there if we 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.010
 let's divide this cost into current 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.140
 oil quotes that are in 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.659
 around 50 dollars a barrel then we 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 must calculate very simply what course 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.479
 the ruble now start the dollar should 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.840
 be much higher 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.000
 much higher than even 75 rubles and I 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.340
 I think that itâ€™s quite likely to end 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 the current week, the dollar will exceed 70 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.320
 rubles and maybe even come close to 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.159
 around 75 on the second as you can 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.810
 comment on 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.430
 standard and poor's solution 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.009
 consequences for the Russian economy and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.509
 I think it threatens the financial system 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.700
 that it is obvious to everyone now that this 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.470
 the decision is probably more political 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.479
 as the next portion of sanctions from 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.399
 united states of america connection with 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.590
 escalation of the conflict in Ukraine 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.149
 I think that those investors who wanted 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.460
 get out of Russian assets they already 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.830
 long 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.180
 long ago they came out if we talk about 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.490
 increasing borrowing costs 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.100
 now not very many willing to give 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.860
 money loaned to Russian companies or 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.680
 Russia as a state therefore I think 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.360
 what a serious reflection on russian 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.890
 in the Russian financial markets from everything 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.209
 I probably won't find one yet 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.430
 will be to this panicky sale 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.440
 asset or active straight very buying 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.630

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.090
 driver for which now presses 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.360
 Russian economy is low prices 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.650
 oil it still remain relevant 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.360
