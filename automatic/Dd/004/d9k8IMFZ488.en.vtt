Laguna<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:07.280> I'm<00:00:08.280> about<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.610> make<00:00:09.620> mad

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
Laguna and I'm about to make mad

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:22.519 
Laguna and I'm about to make mad
magnetic<00:00:11.280> field<00:00:14.929> detector<00:00:17.090> for<00:00:18.090> 3d<00:00:19.369> in<00:00:20.369> 3d<00:00:21.529> I'm

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
magnetic field detector for 3d in 3d I'm

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.490 
magnetic field detector for 3d in 3d I'm
using<00:00:22.949> more<00:00:23.279> oil<00:00:23.359> regular<00:00:24.359> motor<00:00:24.570> oil<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.140> I'm

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
using more oil regular motor oil and I'm

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.900 
using more oil regular motor oil and I'm
thinking<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.949> thicker<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.430> better<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.849> I'm

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
thinking that thicker the better so I'm

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.099 
thinking that thicker the better so I'm
using<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.359> kind<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.349> thick<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:29.630> thick<00:00:30.630> motor

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
using a kind of a thick one thick motor

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.000 
using a kind of a thick one thick motor
oil<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.960> I<00:00:33.960> think<00:00:34.140> that's<00:00:34.410> enough<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.829> use

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
oil here and I think that's enough I use

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.709 
oil here and I think that's enough I use
just<00:00:35.670> about<00:00:36.920> one<00:00:37.920> cup<00:00:38.190> worth<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.210> oil<00:00:39.329> motor

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
just about one cup worth of oil motor

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:53.869 
just about one cup worth of oil motor
oil<00:00:45.410> next<00:00:48.980> I'm<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> add<00:00:50.750> toner<00:00:52.879> regular

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
oil next I'm going to add toner regular

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.099 
oil next I'm going to add toner regular
tone<00:00:54.059> refer<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.750> laser<00:00:55.739> printers<00:00:56.690> now<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.899> was

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
tone refer for laser printers now I was

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.610 
tone refer for laser printers now I was
told<00:00:58.350> that<00:01:00.020> different<00:01:01.020> toners<00:01:01.289> have

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
told that different toners have

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.960 
told that different toners have
different<00:01:02.100> metallic<00:01:02.879> content<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:07.790> was<00:01:08.790> told

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
different metallic content so I was told

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.359 
different metallic content so I was told
by<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.119> person<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.570> gave<00:01:09.780> me<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.080> which

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
by the person that gave me this which

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.980 
by the person that gave me this which
they<00:01:11.369> sell<00:01:11.640> inks<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> lot<00:01:12.930> about

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
they sell inks so they know a lot about

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.649 
they sell inks so they know a lot about
its<00:01:13.320> stuff<00:01:16.130> he<00:01:17.130> gladly<00:01:17.820> gave<00:01:18.150> me<00:01:18.270> some<00:01:18.450> others

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
its stuff he gladly gave me some others

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.260 
its stuff he gladly gave me some others
to<00:01:18.810> test<00:01:19.520> because<00:01:20.520> he<00:01:20.610> wants<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.150> as

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
to test because he wants to see it as

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.899 
to test because he wants to see it as
well<00:01:22.820> he<00:01:23.820> told<00:01:24.210> me<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:27.590> Serac's<00:01:28.590> or<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.759> more

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
well he told me that Serac's or the more

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210 
well he told me that Serac's or the more
expensive<00:01:30.299> toners<00:01:30.990> tend<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.920> higher

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
expensive toners tend to have a higher

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.969 
expensive toners tend to have a higher
concentration<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:33.030> oil<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:34.259> may<00:01:34.500> want<00:01:34.950> to

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
concentration of oil you may want to

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.990 
concentration of oil you may want to
look<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.280> how<00:01:35.549> cool<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.880> looks<00:01:40.490> as<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.670> spread

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
look at how cool this looks as I spread

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.960 
look at how cool this looks as I spread
her<00:01:42.150> around

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
her around

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.640 
her around
this<00:01:44.970> thing<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> turn<00:01:45.720> dark

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.540 

see<00:01:52.650> I<00:01:52.680> want<00:01:53.010> it<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.160> be<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> little<00:01:53.490> more

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
see I want it to be a little more

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.920 
see I want it to be a little more
concentrated<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.480> really<00:01:54.690> want<00:01:54.870> this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
concentrated because I really want this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.020 
concentrated because I really want this
thing<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.350> move<00:01:55.800> when<00:01:55.980> I<00:01:56.010> apply<00:01:56.370> a<00:01:56.400> magnet<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
thing to move when I apply a magnet to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:05.470 
thing to move when I apply a magnet to
it<00:01:57.150> I<00:02:03.020> think<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.140> want<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.380> throw<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.590> little<00:02:04.830> more

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
it I think I want to throw a little more

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.389 
it I think I want to throw a little more
now<00:02:06.480> I<00:02:06.510> did<00:02:06.750> place<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.050> magnet<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.160> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
now I did place a magnet on this and it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.900 
now I did place a magnet on this and it
was<00:02:09.050> picked<00:02:10.050> up<00:02:10.260> it<00:02:11.040> got<00:02:11.160> stuck<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.700> walls

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
was picked up it got stuck to the walls

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.960 
was picked up it got stuck to the walls
when<00:02:12.210> they<00:02:12.270> placed<00:02:13.520> that's<00:02:14.520> much<00:02:14.760> better

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
when they placed that's much better

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.360 
when they placed that's much better
when<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.000> place<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> magnet<00:02:18.690> on<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.840> side<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
when I place a magnet on the side on the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.630 
when I place a magnet on the side on the
side<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> wall<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.330> plastic<00:02:21.720> bottle

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
side of the wall of the plastic bottle

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.940 
side of the wall of the plastic bottle
so<00:02:24.230> hopefully<00:02:25.230> we'll<00:02:25.350> get<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.560> very<00:02:25.620> nice

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
so hopefully we'll get a very nice

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.330 
so hopefully we'll get a very nice
reaction<00:02:26.460> when<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:27.680> any<00:02:28.680> magnets<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
reaction when it any magnets on the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.160 
reaction when it any magnets on the
bottom<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.820> this<00:02:34.100> now<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.130> need<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.550> stir<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:40.050> out

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
bottom of this now I need to stir it out

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.990 
bottom of this now I need to stir it out
to<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.440> piston<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.459> it's<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:41.820> working

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
to this piston so it's not working

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.830 
to this piston so it's not working
anymore

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.250 

it's<00:02:45.840> slurry<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:51.270> might<00:02:51.480> have<00:02:51.660> put<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:51.990> bit

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
it's slurry and I might have put a bit

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.820 
it's slurry and I might have put a bit
too<00:02:52.920> much<00:02:53.130> but<00:02:53.430> that's<00:02:53.520> okay<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:57.560> know<00:02:58.560> this

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
too much but that's okay I know this

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.500 
too much but that's okay I know this
might<00:02:59.040> take<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> little<00:02:59.400> longer<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.910> little<00:03:00.120> long

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
might take a little longer a little long

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.410 
might take a little longer a little long
so<00:03:00.540> next<00:03:01.140> time<00:03:01.350> I'll<00:03:01.530> make<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.680> video<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:03.180> some

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
so next time I'll make a video and some

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.050 
so next time I'll make a video and some
like<00:03:03.570> this<00:03:03.720> I'm<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.019> going<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.820> do<00:03:05.820> with

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
like this I'm just going to do with

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.560 
like this I'm just going to do with
Windows<00:03:06.660> Movie<00:03:06.780> Maker<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.320> cut<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.680> apart<00:03:07.769> now

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
Windows Movie Maker and cut it apart now

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.729 
Windows Movie Maker and cut it apart now
the<00:03:09.570> whole<00:03:09.780> idea<00:03:10.019> of<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:12.739> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
the whole idea of this is that the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.740 
the whole idea of this is that the
metallic<00:03:14.330> particles<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:17.280> toner

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
metallic particles in the and the toner

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.250 
metallic particles in the and the toner
will<00:03:18.750> float<00:03:20.030> around<00:03:21.030> in<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.600> oil<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:22.200> the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
will float around in the oil in the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.970 
will float around in the oil in the
motor<00:03:22.470> oil<00:03:24.230> therefore<00:03:25.230> creating<00:03:25.860> a

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
motor oil therefore creating a

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.350 
motor oil therefore creating a
ferromagnetic<00:03:27.110> fluid<00:03:28.459> that<00:03:31.910> acts<00:03:32.910> like<00:03:33.209> a

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
ferromagnetic fluid that acts like a

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:43.500 
ferromagnetic fluid that acts like a
fluid<00:03:34.610> but<00:03:35.610> when<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.850> magnetic<00:03:39.320> it

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.850 

pass<00:03:44.510> through<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.020> middle<00:03:45.140> for<00:03:45.920> fluid<00:03:47.860> it'll

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
pass through the middle for fluid it'll

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.320 
pass through the middle for fluid it'll
it'll<00:03:49.100> start<00:03:49.580> behaving<00:03:49.700> like<00:03:50.030> that<00:03:50.090> like<00:03:50.300> a

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
it'll start behaving like that like a

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.630 
it'll start behaving like that like a
solid<00:03:52.750> giving<00:03:53.750> me<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.900> visual<00:03:54.410> cue<00:03:54.620> of<00:03:54.680> what<00:03:55.250> the

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
solid giving me a visual cue of what the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.440 
solid giving me a visual cue of what the
magnetic<00:03:55.880> flux<00:03:56.270> lines<00:03:56.690> look<00:03:56.930> like<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:58.450> that's

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
magnetic flux lines look like and that's

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.820 
magnetic flux lines look like and that's
what<00:03:59.570> I'm<00:03:59.720> very<00:03:59.810> interested<00:04:00.110> in<00:04:00.350> because<00:04:00.710> I'm

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
what I'm very interested in because I'm

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.740 
what I'm very interested in because I'm
trying<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.370> create<00:04:01.640> some<00:04:03.340> magnetic<00:04:04.750> machines

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
trying to create some magnetic machines

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.310 
trying to create some magnetic machines
magnetic<00:04:06.260> motors<00:04:06.850> but<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.880> really<00:04:08.390> I<00:04:08.540> mean<00:04:08.810> what

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
magnetic motors but a really I mean what

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.420 
magnetic motors but a really I mean what
YouTube<00:04:09.650> videos<00:04:10.040> they<00:04:10.580> show<00:04:10.910> a<00:04:11.180> lot<00:04:11.510> of

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
YouTube videos they show a lot of

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.090 
YouTube videos they show a lot of
magnetic<00:04:13.430> motor<00:04:14.300> designs<00:04:15.020> what<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:15.920> does<00:04:16.070> show

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
magnetic motor designs what it does show

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.360 
magnetic motor designs what it does show
is<00:04:16.340> what<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.790> magnetic<00:04:17.060> lines<00:04:17.420> look<00:04:17.750> like<00:04:18.370> in

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
is what the magnetic lines look like in

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.390 
is what the magnetic lines look like in
movement<00:04:19.940> or<00:04:20.120> static<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.080> I<00:04:21.109> really<00:04:21.590> want<00:04:22.220> to

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
movement or static so I really want to

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.530 
movement or static so I really want to
see<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.930> don't<00:04:24.080> want<00:04:24.200> to<00:04:24.260> bring
