00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.140
 often asked me why 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.600

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.250

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.019
 to escape once a month 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.289

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.320
 And besides, I wanted you two more 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.550
 Comments 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.239
 if any video see then I am already 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.230
 optimally lunch grandparents for the 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.789
 so by the way 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.379
 and secondly, you want to tell yourself 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.300
 that thieves cartier from the channel of 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 picture sticks here on youtube also continue 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.260
 So a demon has uploaded in the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.629
 You can find video in the infobox and also 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 but at the end of the video links now 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.199
 I want my whole first 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.339
 many products show that we 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.450
 all the leagues and I wish you 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.130
 have fun 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.900
 First, I mean directly 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.439
 I have always bought favorite products 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.119
 to buy 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.880
 you know it somehow a shower must 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.740
 always with and i have a hair on 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.720
 my mouth but everything show you that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.049
 gone through and that is the sweet 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.450
 blueberry shower gel of track moon 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.909
 that smells like the name suggests 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.710
 it could fall high after vw 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.360
 maybe a bit too artificial though 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.280
 I think it's actually quite good 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.229
 i like the smell and the second one 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.400
 Product is a call from the current one 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.500
 patch next stream livestream like was 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.990
 for name, yes , I want to dream a lot 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.780
 Of course they do not just say that 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.759
 triemli also always from the current lw 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.320
 and there are two different colors 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.140
 and I have here now the color 0 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.000
 10 in the resin desire I took 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.680
 even with the colors of the vod and I have to 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 I could not say anything at all 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.490
 I decided both were really nice 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.100
 and also from this I have me there 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.479
 a highlight that took it that way 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.479
 calmly it says all that is so 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.160
 A creamy liquid fits are again 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.440
 comes out and I really thought so 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.150
 totally nice that somehow totally like that 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.970
 like 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.730
 maybe it's even a benefit 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.019
 I just think about asking 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.120
 Maybe we would like it too 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.769
 So a news video so where I have some 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.470
 introduce products from the letter 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.569
 the many high end products or even 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.980
 are the same if yes then writes 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.150
 this time in the comments or gives the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.159
 video just a thumbs up 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.689
 So I know that, so continue with 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:36.470
 I got a washbow from us 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:38.930

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.269
 wash taken there I have in 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.310
 Lately a lot of good things 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.879
 read about it so it was him 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.159
 called or that yes that the partner 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.739

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.069

 I have sebamed shelf, too 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.569
 still the golden mask taken away 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.480
 Impure skin does not hit so completely without 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.519
 but I just hope that 's something 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.810
 still helps and of course had to 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.810
 I'm not just looking for my shower gel 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.769

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.720
 is looking for exactly 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.939
 and now I have p2 too 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.709

 really many cool items I need 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.650
 I have such a say now 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.799
 nail polish must be exactly that now 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.840
 no single cover anne clark but 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.620

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.409

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.690

 I already have one of these on the internet 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.069

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.659

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.639

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.220
 So I'm really looking forward to that 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.959
 to do it 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.269
 and then I have another one 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.629

 this is now the color I watermelon 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.810
 I'm really looking forward to painting 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.019
 because it's just really good 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.579
 lull power makes me find this color here 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.739
 and I'm just getting right on 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.940
 watermelon I said that and 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.199

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.699

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.970
 already unpacked because I have you from 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.290
 I tried it yesterday and I did 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.489
 found the really very very good 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.259
 well then she comes along with that 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.150
 a brush as you see and then here 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.840
 such a little jar and I have 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.060

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.030
 one in the café took me one so 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.870
 delete role there is also extra for 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.789
 dry skin 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.320
 I had already very early 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.360
 a bodylotion the family but not 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.710
 both of them because of me 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.000
 somehow did not care at all 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.410
 That's why I just hope so 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.240
 that this one will be better here 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.520
 give her one last chance 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.139
 The Track Immune Body Lotion Series and 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.789
 if that is not the case then I give 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.380
 it really does but he has me 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.870
 simply the smell again convinced and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.320
 that's why I never could 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.690
 resist and there's a lip left 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.820

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.520

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.740
 Do you know that I just lipstick pink 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.780
 or just generally rose lipsticks 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.789
 Whatever I love, I love it 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.620
 simply summarized is best for me 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.840
 and I'm not honest either 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.979
 great experimenting and that's why 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.509
 I have these colored ones now 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.599

 pink 100 and yes that's cool because 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.320
 that actually looks like one 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.389
 lipstick but then in the end also 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.039
