I have come to a very nice point so I

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.700 
I have come to a very nice point so I
just<00:00:47.309> filled<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.000> cut<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> end<00:00:49.350> off<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
just filled it up and cut the end off of

just filled it up and cut the end off of
the<00:00:50.070> piping<00:00:50.370> bag<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.150> can<00:00:51.360> use<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> ziplock

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
the piping bag but you can use a ziplock

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.680 
the piping bag but you can use a ziplock
bag<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.530> well<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.100> then<00:00:53.760> draw<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:54.240> your<00:00:54.270> arrow

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
bag as well and then draw out your arrow

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.960 
bag as well and then draw out your arrow
pieces<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.950> do<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.250> freehand<00:00:56.550> as

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
pieces now you can do this freehand as

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.910 
pieces now you can do this freehand as
well<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.110> you're<00:00:58.230> doing<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> whole<00:00:58.710> bunch

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
well but if you're doing a whole bunch

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.290 
well but if you're doing a whole bunch
of<00:00:59.010> cupcakes<00:00:59.430> if<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.610> want<00:00:59.790> them<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.270> be

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
of cupcakes if you want them all to be

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.450 
of cupcakes if you want them all to be
the<00:01:00.390> same<00:01:00.510> size<00:01:00.900> a<00:01:00.930> template<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.829> very<00:01:02.040> useful

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the same size a template is very useful

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.359 
the same size a template is very useful
for<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.700> purpose<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.619> I<00:01:04.619> once<00:01:04.800> you<00:01:04.920> draw<00:01:05.100> one

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
for that purpose and I once you draw one

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.370 
for that purpose and I once you draw one
section<00:01:05.759> out<00:01:05.910> just<00:01:06.300> move<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> paper<00:01:06.780> over<00:01:07.080> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
section out just move the paper over and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
section out just move the paper over and
then<00:01:07.979> draw<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> next<00:01:08.610> sets<00:01:10.729> just<00:01:11.729> keep<00:01:11.970> in

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
then draw the next sets just keep in

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.670 
then draw the next sets just keep in
mind<00:01:12.149> that<00:01:12.509> once<00:01:12.899> these<00:01:13.140> hardened<00:01:13.560> you'll

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
mind that once these hardened you'll

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
mind that once these hardened you'll
have<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> peel<00:01:14.190> them<00:01:14.280> off<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> wax<00:01:14.820> paper<00:01:15.090> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
have to peel them off the wax paper so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.749 
have to peel them off the wax paper so
if<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.750> shapes<00:01:16.080> are<00:01:16.259> very<00:01:16.530> very<00:01:16.800> thin<00:01:17.190> they

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
if your shapes are very very thin they

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.249 
if your shapes are very very thin they
may<00:01:17.970> break<00:01:18.240> when<00:01:18.450> you're<00:01:18.570> peeling<00:01:18.810> them<00:01:19.080> so

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
may break when you're peeling them so

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.139 
may break when you're peeling them so
keep<00:01:19.410> that<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.590> mind<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.670> sure<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.970> do

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
keep that in mind and make sure you do

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.240 
keep that in mind and make sure you do
lots<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.630> extras<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.440> case<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.070> have

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
lots of extras in case you do have

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.210 
lots of extras in case you do have
things<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.670> break<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.590> I<00:01:25.590> decided<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.190> a

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
things that break and I decided to do a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.010 
things that break and I decided to do a
free-standing<00:01:26.790> heart<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.450> an<00:01:27.570> arrow<00:01:27.690> going

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
free-standing heart with an arrow going

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.980 
free-standing heart with an arrow going
through<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.299> after<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.330> was<00:01:30.510> done<00:01:30.690> all<00:01:30.870> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
through it and after I was done all the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.420 
through it and after I was done all the
shapes<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.920> popped<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.370> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
shapes I just popped that in the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.430 
shapes I just popped that in the
refrigerator<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.119> everything<00:01:33.990> was<00:01:34.080> hardened

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
refrigerator and everything was hardened

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.890 
refrigerator and everything was hardened
within<00:01:34.710> 5<00:01:34.890> minutes<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.510> to<00:01:36.750> the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
simple but really cute and here's the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.120 
simple but really cute and here's the
freestanding<00:03:55.980> heart<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:56.940> made<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:58.130> I

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
freestanding heart that I made and I

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.530 
freestanding heart that I made and I
made<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.459> long<00:03:59.730> piece<00:04:00.030> at<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.209> bottom<00:04:00.330> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
made that long piece at the bottom the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.300 
made that long piece at the bottom the
heart<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.080> can<00:04:01.290> push<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.650> into<00:04:01.830> the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
heart so that you can push it into the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.140 
heart so that you can push it into the
cupcake<00:04:03.260> just<00:04:04.260> like<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:07.490> and<00:04:08.490> here's<00:04:08.820> a<00:04:08.910> few

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
cupcake just like that and here's a few

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.180 
cupcake just like that and here's a few
of<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.330> cupcakes<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.900> made<00:04:10.140> actually<00:04:10.830> a

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
of the cupcakes that I made actually a

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.460 
of the cupcakes that I made actually a
upon<00:04:11.820> reflection<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.480> think<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.110> black

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
upon reflection I think that the black

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.320 
upon reflection I think that the black
liner<00:04:13.830> is<00:04:14.010> actually<00:04:14.400> kind<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.730> nice<00:04:14.850> with<00:04:15.240> the

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
liner is actually kind of nice with the

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.030 
liner is actually kind of nice with the
pink<00:04:15.570> frosting<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.169> makes<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.410> nice<00:04:16.560> contrast

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
pink frosting and makes a nice contrast

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.010 
pink frosting and makes a nice contrast
now<00:04:17.910> keep<00:04:18.150> in<00:04:18.270> mind<00:04:18.299> whenever<00:04:18.630> you're<00:04:18.900> dealing

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
now keep in mind whenever you're dealing

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.599 
now keep in mind whenever you're dealing
with<00:04:19.230> strawberries<00:04:20.040> that<00:04:20.070> have<00:04:20.220> been<00:04:20.400> cut

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
with strawberries that have been cut

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.400 
with strawberries that have been cut
like<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.299> when<00:04:21.900> they're<00:04:22.049> in<00:04:22.140> contact

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
like this and when they're in contact

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.080 
like this and when they're in contact
with<00:04:22.800> something<00:04:23.010> with<00:04:23.250> sugar<00:04:23.430> like<00:04:23.970> the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
with something with sugar like the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.390 
with something with sugar like the
frosting<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:25.200> strawberries<00:04:25.680> will<00:04:25.830> soften<00:04:26.130> a

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
frosting the strawberries will soften a

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.130 
frosting the strawberries will soften a
little<00:04:26.430> bit<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:26.970> will<00:04:27.150> start<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.480> seep<00:04:27.750> juice

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
little bit and will start to seep juice

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.530 
little bit and will start to seep juice
over<00:04:28.620> time<00:04:28.890> so<00:04:29.520> it's<00:04:29.640> always<00:04:29.730> best<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.300> make

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
over time so it's always best to make

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.260 
over time so it's always best to make
and<00:04:30.780> serve<00:04:30.900> these<00:04:31.169> on<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.680> same<00:04:31.890> day<00:04:32.250> or<00:04:32.610> add
