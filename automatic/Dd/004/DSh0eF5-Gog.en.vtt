I mean like any comments on that and I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.170 
I mean like any comments on that and I
think<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.899> most<00:00:58.350> people<00:00:58.680> should<00:00:59.180> understand

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
think that most people should understand

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.310 
think that most people should understand
that<00:01:00.239> they're<00:01:00.449> different<00:01:00.600> times<00:01:01.020> for

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that they're different times for

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.779 
that they're different times for
everything<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.859> life<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.280> different<00:01:02.609> people

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
everything in life for different people

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.810 
everything in life for different people
so<00:01:03.739> they<00:01:04.739> should<00:01:04.920> cut<00:01:05.100> them<00:01:05.309> some<00:01:05.489> slack

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
so they should cut them some slack

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.570 
so they should cut them some slack
yeah<00:01:06.600> yeah<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.950> had<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> daughter<00:01:08.369> and
