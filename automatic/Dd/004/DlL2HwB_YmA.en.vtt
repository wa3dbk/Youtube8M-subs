00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
current creativity at all and I wouldn't

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
be surprised if the new songs were just

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.929

out<00:01:23.179> takes<00:01:23.600> from<00:01:24.229> old<00:01:24.829> album<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:25.520> never<00:01:25.759> got

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
out takes from old album I never got
