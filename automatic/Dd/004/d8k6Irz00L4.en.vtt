don't you take a look firstly we were

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.020 
don't you take a look firstly we were

the<00:00:37.150> ICAM<00:00:37.480> tracks<00:00:37.720> in<00:00:37.870> 3d<00:00:38.230> so<00:00:38.410> you<00:00:38.500> can<00:00:38.650> move

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
the ICAM tracks in 3d so you can move

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.049 
the ICAM tracks in 3d so you can move
forwards<00:00:39.190> backwards<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:39.820> on-screen

forwards backwards and the on-screen
graphic<00:00:40.540> replicate<00:00:41.110> this<00:00:41.260> now<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.890> move

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
graphic replicate this now the move

graphic replicate this now the move
controller<00:00:42.400> has<00:00:42.550> also<00:00:42.760> been<00:00:43.059> rendered<00:00:43.420> over

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
controller has also been rendered over

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:44.969 
controller has also been rendered over
the<00:00:43.750> top<00:00:43.900> of<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:44.110> video<00:00:44.350> giving<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:44.949> a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:44.979 
the top of the video giving you a

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.950 
the top of the video giving you a
virtual<00:00:45.280> replica<00:00:45.760> but<00:00:46.449> you<00:00:46.600> will<00:00:46.720> know<00:00:46.780> what

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
virtual replica but you will know what

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.899 
virtual replica but you will know what
that<00:00:47.170> looks<00:00:47.409> like<00:00:47.500> we'd<00:00:48.040> much<00:00:48.280> rather<00:00:48.309> wield

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
that looks like we'd much rather wield

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.439 
that looks like we'd much rather wield
two<00:00:49.269> swords<00:00:49.780> ah<00:00:50.010> that's<00:00:51.010> much<00:00:51.280> better<00:00:51.610> now<00:00:52.360> if

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
two swords ah that's much better now if

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.180 
two swords ah that's much better now if
the<00:00:52.570> ICAM<00:00:52.900> doesn't<00:00:53.170> see<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.500> move<00:00:53.650> it<00:00:53.860> doesn't

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
the ICAM doesn't see the move it doesn't

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.979 
the ICAM doesn't see the move it doesn't
track<00:00:54.370> movement<00:00:54.610> properly<00:00:55.150> so<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:55.540> really<00:00:55.870> is

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
track movement properly so it really is

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.719 
track movement properly so it really is
using<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.620> camera<00:00:56.769> all<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.070> time<00:00:57.220> to<00:00:57.519> do<00:00:57.610> the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
using the camera all the time to do the

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.399 
using the camera all the time to do the
tracking<00:00:57.970> and<00:00:58.239> is<00:00:58.479> therefore<00:00:58.659> integral<00:00:59.229> to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
tracking and is therefore integral to

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.289 
tracking and is therefore integral to
the<00:00:59.530> whole<00:00:59.680> system<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:00.729> can<00:01:00.879> do<00:01:01.030> this<00:01:01.150> in

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
the whole system and you can do this in

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.759 
the whole system and you can do this in
a<00:01:01.360> bir<00:01:01.420> third<00:01:01.690> or<00:01:01.900> first<00:01:02.170> person<00:01:02.620> perspective

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
a bir third or first person perspective

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.979 
a bir third or first person perspective
this<00:01:03.489> is<00:01:03.640> obviously<00:01:03.790> first<00:01:04.299> person<00:01:04.690> and<00:01:04.809> looks

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
this is obviously first person and looks

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.870 
this is obviously first person and looks
pretty<00:01:05.260> accurate<00:01:05.799> as<00:01:06.010> we<00:01:06.610> know<00:01:06.729> the

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
pretty accurate as we know the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.850 
pretty accurate as we know the
controller<00:01:07.210> can<00:01:07.390> take<00:01:07.540> on<00:01:07.690> many<00:01:07.930> forms<00:01:08.110> as<00:01:08.470> you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
controller can take on many forms as you

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.440 
controller can take on many forms as you
can<00:01:08.979> see<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.280> lift<00:01:09.460> controller<00:01:09.820> is<00:01:10.000> now<00:01:10.119> a<00:01:10.150> bat

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
can see the lift controller is now a bat

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.600 
can see the lift controller is now a bat
and<00:01:10.690> now<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.049> table<00:01:11.290> tennis<00:01:11.619> paddle<00:01:12.010> and<00:01:12.159> this

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
and now a table tennis paddle and this

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.920 
and now a table tennis paddle and this
is<00:01:12.730> a<00:01:12.760> globe<00:01:13.000> Richard<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.480> his<00:01:13.600> team<00:01:13.900> have

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
is a globe Richard and his team have

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.420 
is a globe Richard and his team have
created<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.560> show<00:01:14.680> us<00:01:14.800> that<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:15.010> can<00:01:15.160> really

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
created to show us that you can really

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.580 
created to show us that you can really
zoom<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:15.760> in<00:01:15.880> 3d<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.450> still<00:01:16.840> have<00:01:16.990> fun<00:01:17.170> control

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
zoom in in 3d and still have fun control

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.980 
zoom in in 3d and still have fun control
over<00:01:17.890> rotation<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:19.180> move<00:01:19.390> team<00:01:19.660> have<00:01:19.840> also

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
over rotation the move team have also

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.210 
over rotation the move team have also
been<00:01:20.380> playing<00:01:20.650> around<00:01:20.800> with<00:01:21.010> more

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
been playing around with more

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.560 
been playing around with more
interactive<00:01:21.760> game<00:01:21.940> pay<00:01:22.120> that<00:01:22.270> involves

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
interactive game pay that involves

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.660 
interactive game pay that involves
physical<00:01:23.140> interaction<00:01:23.770> so<00:01:24.220> out<00:01:24.340> comes<00:01:24.490> the

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
physical interaction so out comes the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.460 
physical interaction so out comes the
sword<00:01:24.880> again<00:01:25.150> as<00:01:25.300> you<00:01:25.690> can<00:01:25.780> see<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.170> dummy<00:01:26.380> is

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
sword again as you can see the dummy is

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.440 
sword again as you can see the dummy is
being<00:01:26.740> moved<00:01:26.890> around<00:01:27.070> simple<00:01:28.030> taps<00:01:28.240> and

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
being moved around simple taps and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.720 
being moved around simple taps and
gestures<00:01:29.020> gestures<00:01:29.800> can<00:01:29.830> be<00:01:30.070> quick<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.310> so<00:01:30.700> a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
gestures gestures can be quick to so a

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.370 
gestures gestures can be quick to so a
few<00:01:30.940> quick<00:01:31.150> swipes<00:01:31.510> means<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.960> poor<00:01:32.140> dummy

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
few quick swipes means the poor dummy

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.650 
few quick swipes means the poor dummy
has<00:01:32.560> lost<00:01:32.740> all<00:01:32.950> its<00:01:33.130> limbs<00:01:33.430> now<00:01:34.390> there<00:01:34.540> is<00:01:34.630> a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
has lost all its limbs now there is a

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.180 
has lost all its limbs now there is a
more<00:01:34.900> direct<00:01:35.140> way<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:35.560> interact<00:01:36.040> with<00:01:36.070> the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
more direct way to interact with the

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.590 
more direct way to interact with the
dummy<00:01:36.370> and<00:01:36.550> this<00:01:36.670> involves<00:01:37.030> no<00:01:37.240> on-screen

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
dummy and this involves no on-screen

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.870 
dummy and this involves no on-screen
graphic<00:01:38.140> using<00:01:38.440> just<00:01:38.620> the<00:01:38.740> move<00:01:38.890> itself<00:01:39.250> this

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
graphic using just the move itself this

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.700 
graphic using just the move itself this
is<00:01:40.030> being<00:01:40.210> demonstrated<00:01:40.510> through<00:01:41.020> levitation

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
is being demonstrated through levitation

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.500 
is being demonstrated through levitation
force<00:01:41.950> so<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:42.520> can<00:01:42.640> grab<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:42.910> dummy<00:01:43.120> lift<00:01:43.420> it

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
force so you can grab the dummy lift it

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.820 
force so you can grab the dummy lift it
up<00:01:43.570> in<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.810> air<00:01:43.840> shake<00:01:44.230> it<00:01:44.350> around<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.680> bit

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
up in the air shake it around a bit

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.950 
up in the air shake it around a bit
maybe<00:01:45.160> frame<00:01:45.490> around<00:01:45.640> take<00:01:46.270> out<00:01:46.420> some<00:01:46.600> pins<00:01:46.840> or

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
maybe frame around take out some pins or

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.570 
maybe frame around take out some pins or
progression<00:01:47.260> perhaps<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:47.920> as<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.430> can

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
progression perhaps and as you can

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.610 
progression perhaps and as you can
probably<00:01:48.610> tell<00:01:49.000> you<00:01:49.390> can<00:01:49.720> really<00:01:49.990> abuse<00:01:50.440> this

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
probably tell you can really abuse this

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.560 
probably tell you can really abuse this
thing<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:51.430> can<00:01:51.580> throw<00:01:51.760> stuff<00:01:51.970> as<00:01:52.150> well<00:01:52.300> and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
thing you can throw stuff as well and

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.720 
thing you can throw stuff as well and
control<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.170> demonstrated<00:01:53.680> nicely<00:01:54.190> by<00:01:54.430> this

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
control it demonstrated nicely by this

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.600 
control it demonstrated nicely by this
fireball<00:01:55.240> now<00:01:56.230> it<00:01:56.409> gets<00:01:56.470> really<00:01:56.890> interactive

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
fireball now it gets really interactive

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.190 
fireball now it gets really interactive
and<00:01:57.790> with<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:57.940> controller<00:01:58.330> in<00:01:58.510> each<00:01:58.630> hand<00:01:58.840> you

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
and with a controller in each hand you

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.560 
and with a controller in each hand you
can<00:01:59.350> take<00:01:59.500> on<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.770> guise<00:01:59.920> of<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.280> robot<00:02:00.670> or<00:02:01.150> kind

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
can take on the guise of a robot or kind

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.360 
can take on the guise of a robot or kind
of<00:02:01.690> so<00:02:02.170> if<00:02:02.260> your<00:02:02.380> hands<00:02:02.530> stay<00:02:02.800> fixed<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.340> you

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
of so if your hands stay fixed and you

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.860 
of so if your hands stay fixed and you
move<00:02:03.550> around<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.970> on-screen<00:02:04.270> graphic<00:02:04.750> will

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
move around the on-screen graphic will

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.750 
move around the on-screen graphic will
replicate<00:02:05.080> this<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.100> button<00:02:06.400> press<00:02:06.610> will

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
replicate this and the button press will

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.219 
replicate this and the button press will
enable<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.240> control<00:02:07.630> its<00:02:07.810> hands<00:02:08.019> and

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
enable you to control its hands and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.809 
enable you to control its hands and
switch<00:02:08.500> animations<00:02:09.129> and<00:02:09.310> looks<00:02:09.640> like

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
switch animations and looks like

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.339 
switch animations and looks like
something<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.330> can<00:02:10.509> really<00:02:10.780> have<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.080> laugh

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
something you can really have a laugh

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.229 
something you can really have a laugh
with<00:02:11.379> again<00:02:12.099> this<00:02:12.459> can<00:02:12.670> be<00:02:12.790> done<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.120> either

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
with again this can be done in either

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.270 
with again this can be done in either
first<00:02:13.569> or<00:02:13.750> third<00:02:13.840> person<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.040> we're<00:02:15.159> quite

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
first or third person and we're quite

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.069 
first or third person and we're quite
liking<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.849> wolverines<00:02:16.269> side<00:02:16.510> effects<00:02:16.810> too

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
liking the wolverines side effects too

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.839 
liking the wolverines side effects too
and<00:02:17.319> as<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:17.859> can<00:02:18.010> see<00:02:18.040> when<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:18.549> in<00:02:18.670> third

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
and as you can see when it's in third

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.070 
and as you can see when it's in third
person<00:02:19.090> when<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.450> move<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.170> graphic<00:02:20.590> moves

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
person when you move the graphic moves

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.330 
person when you move the graphic moves
now<00:02:22.170> another<00:02:22.440> potential<00:02:22.980> use<00:02:23.130> for<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
now another potential use for the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.800 
now another potential use for the
controller<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.300> use<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.660> as<00:02:24.750> a

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
controller is to just use it as a

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.960 
controller is to just use it as a
pointer<00:02:25.320> games<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.010> Killzone<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.640> socom

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
pointer games like Killzone and socom

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.790 
pointer games like Killzone and socom
already<00:02:27.360> do<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.990> taking<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.590> same

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
already do this and taking that same

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.320 
already do this and taking that same
kind<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.160> idea<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.610> team<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:29.910> bumped<00:02:30.210> this

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
kind of idea the team have bumped this

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.090 
kind of idea the team have bumped this
into<00:02:30.630> more<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.960> virtual<00:02:31.320> reality<00:02:31.800> kind<00:02:32.010> of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
into more of a virtual reality kind of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.070 
into more of a virtual reality kind of
experience<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.390> as<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.600> can<00:02:33.720> see<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
experience so as you can see the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.810 
experience so as you can see the
flashlight<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.620> held<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.980> one<00:02:35.130> hand<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.520> in

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
flashlight is held of one hand and in

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.310 
flashlight is held of one hand and in
the<00:02:35.910> other<00:02:36.030> virtual<00:02:36.630> hand<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:36.990> can<00:02:37.110> be<00:02:37.200> used

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
the other virtual hand that can be used

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.320 
the other virtual hand that can be used
to<00:02:37.440> point<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:37.830> pet<00:02:38.070> what's<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.580> screen<00:02:38.760> which

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
to point and pet what's on screen which

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.510 
to point and pet what's on screen which
in<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:39.570> instance<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:40.170> an<00:02:40.320> octopus<00:02:40.770> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
in this instance is an octopus the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.370 
in this instance is an octopus the
shadows<00:02:41.880> are<00:02:41.910> all<00:02:42.120> pretty<00:02:42.330> realistic<00:02:43.020> as<00:02:43.170> well

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
shadows are all pretty realistic as well

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.620 
shadows are all pretty realistic as well
now<00:02:44.160> we're<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.520> exploring<00:02:45.120> multi-touch

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
now we're on to exploring multi-touch

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.360 
now we're on to exploring multi-touch
and<00:02:46.110> using<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.470> controller<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.040> make<00:02:47.250> an

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
and using the controller you can make an

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.070 
and using the controller you can make an
object<00:02:47.490> bigger<00:02:47.850> move<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.300> around<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.780> for

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
object bigger move it around and for

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.390 
object bigger move it around and for
multi-touch<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.740> course<00:02:49.890> need<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.280> use

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
multi-touch you of course need to use

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.430 
multi-touch you of course need to use
both<00:02:50.580> controllers<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:51.660> we've<00:02:51.780> seen<00:02:52.050> edge<00:02:52.260> to

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
both controllers but we've seen edge to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.530 
both controllers but we've seen edge to
edge<00:02:52.560> multi-touch<00:02:53.100> action<00:02:53.490> before<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:54.480> with

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
edge multi-touch action before but with

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.150 
edge multi-touch action before but with
the<00:02:54.690> move<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.440> experience<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:56.070> more

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
the move you can experience a more

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.100 
the move you can experience a more
advanced<00:02:56.550> kind<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:57.000> multi-touch<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:57.990> can

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
advanced kind of multi-touch so you can

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.630 
advanced kind of multi-touch so you can
not<00:02:58.230> only<00:02:58.350> use<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.770> endpoints<00:02:59.310> but<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.520> can

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
not only use the endpoints but you can

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.130 
not only use the endpoints but you can
move<00:02:59.790> an<00:02:59.910> object<00:03:00.030> from<00:03:00.360> different<00:03:00.720> angles

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
move an object from different angles

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.810

to alter what's on screen and as you can

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.110 
to alter what's on screen and as you can
see<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.350> can<00:03:34.380> carpool<00:03:35.100> stretch<00:03:35.519> disfigure

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
see you can carpool stretch disfigure

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.000 
see you can carpool stretch disfigure
and<00:03:36.330> do<00:03:36.540> some<00:03:36.750> really<00:03:37.019> interesting<00:03:37.410> things<00:03:37.680> of

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
and do some really interesting things of

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.890 
and do some really interesting things of
object<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.880> more<00:03:39.030> geometry<00:03:39.300> you<00:03:39.600> start

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
object and the more geometry you start

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.600 
object and the more geometry you start
with<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.200> less<00:03:40.410> important<00:03:41.070> those<00:03:41.220> artistic

with the less important those artistic
skills<00:03:42.090> become<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.660> could<00:03:43.110> be<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.230> really

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
skills become and could be a really

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.290 
skills become and could be a really
great<00:03:43.769> way<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.010> create<00:03:44.250> or<00:03:44.580> modify<00:03:44.760> your<00:03:45.239> own

great way to create or modify your own
characters<00:03:46.190> now<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.220> completely<00:03:47.760> different

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
characters now a completely different

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.729 
characters now a completely different
way<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.360> use<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.780> move<00:03:48.959> is<00:03:49.170> with<00:03:49.350> realtime

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
way to use the move is with realtime

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.800 
way to use the move is with realtime
strategy<00:03:49.950> games<00:03:50.489> like<00:03:50.700> this<00:03:50.910> using<00:03:51.600> the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
strategy games like this using the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.750 
strategy games like this using the
controller<00:03:52.170> like<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.470> mouse<00:03:52.800> pointer<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.670> you

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
controller like a mouse pointer so you

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.400 
controller like a mouse pointer so you
can<00:03:53.910> zoom<00:03:54.120> in<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.540> out<00:03:54.600> use<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.019> analog<00:03:55.170> stick

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
can zoom in and out use the analog stick

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.350 
can zoom in and out use the analog stick
to<00:03:55.800> move<00:03:55.950> around<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.459> traditional<00:03:56.970> way<00:03:57.090> and

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
to move around in a traditional way and

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.300 
to move around in a traditional way and
lastly<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.260> can<00:03:58.290> use<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.739> as<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.890> selection

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
lastly you can use it as a selection

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.460 
lastly you can use it as a selection
device<00:03:59.730> so<00:04:00.239> for<00:04:00.390> example<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.930> can<00:04:01.200> paint<00:04:01.380> your

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
device so for example you can paint your

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.170 
device so for example you can paint your
troops<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:01.980> then<00:04:02.130> send<00:04:02.459> them<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.700> attack<00:04:02.940> by

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
troops and then send them to attack by

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.530 
troops and then send them to attack by
drawing<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.600> path<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:05.070> that's<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.030> end<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.360> the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
drawing a path and that's the end of the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.479 
drawing a path and that's the end of the
demo<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.470> purpose<00:04:07.830> of<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.070> was<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.250> show

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
demo so the purpose of it was to show

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.160 
demo so the purpose of it was to show
off<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.730> PlayStation<00:04:09.330> moves<00:04:09.540> capabilities

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170

off the PlayStation moves capabilities
and<00:04:10.350> technology<00:04:10.950> potential<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.730> from<00:04:12.120> this

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
and technology potential and from this

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.000 
and technology potential and from this
it's<00:04:12.540> clear<00:04:12.780> we<00:04:12.959> could<00:04:13.110> soon<00:04:13.350> be<00:04:13.530> introduced

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
it's clear we could soon be introduced

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.590 
it's clear we could soon be introduced
to<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.400> completely<00:04:14.880> different<00:04:15.030> kind<00:04:15.510> of

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
to a completely different kind of

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.909 
to a completely different kind of
gameplay<00:04:15.930> we're<00:04:16.169> not<00:04:16.290> used<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.560> seeing

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
gameplay we're not used to seeing

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.400 
gameplay we're not used to seeing
exciting<00:04:17.850> yes<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:18.630> it's<00:04:18.780> definitely<00:04:19.169> worth

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
exciting yes so it's definitely worth

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.459 
exciting yes so it's definitely worth
