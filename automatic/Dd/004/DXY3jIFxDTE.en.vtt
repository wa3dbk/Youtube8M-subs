00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
such little impact in range I think you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.120 
such little impact in range I think you
have<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.550> max<00:01:19.970> that<00:01:20.300> out<00:01:20.510> as<00:01:21.380> much<00:01:21.650> as<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:21.920> can

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
have to max that out as much as you can

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.340 
have to max that out as much as you can
and<00:01:22.190> that<00:01:22.520> was<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:23.210> load<00:01:23.420> out<00:01:23.570> for<00:01:23.810> having<00:01:24.080> max

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
and that was the load out for having max

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.100 
and that was the load out for having max
impact<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.160> range<00:01:25.490> now<00:01:25.910> right<00:01:26.690> off<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.870> bat

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110

guys<00:01:27.320> I<00:01:27.560> don't<00:01:28.070> think<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.610> this<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.090> great

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
guys I don't think it this is a great

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.780 
guys I don't think it this is a great
shot<00:01:29.780> gun<00:01:30.050> I<00:01:30.260> do<00:01:30.320> think<00:01:31.010> there<00:01:31.250> are<00:01:31.340> legend

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
shot gun I do think there are legend

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.580 
shot gun I do think there are legend
areas<00:01:32.060> that<00:01:32.210> are<00:01:32.300> much<00:01:32.570> more<00:01:32.840> effective<00:01:33.410> and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
areas that are much more effective and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.490 
areas that are much more effective and
do<00:01:33.980> the<00:01:34.130> job<00:01:34.160> much<00:01:34.820> better<00:01:35.120> um<00:01:35.420> well<00:01:36.410> you

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
do the job much better um well you

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.860 
do the job much better um well you
notice<00:01:36.860> not<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:37.400> much<00:01:37.580> range<00:01:38.030> that's<00:01:38.600> the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
notice not so much range that's the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.390 
notice not so much range that's the
issue<00:01:38.990> with<00:01:39.260> this<00:01:39.380> shotgun<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:40.010> it's<00:01:40.160> rather

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
issue with this shotgun but it's rather

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.360 
issue with this shotgun but it's rather
the<00:01:40.730> impact<00:01:41.470> maybe<00:01:42.470> it's<00:01:42.650> a<00:01:42.710> combination<00:01:43.040> of

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
the impact maybe it's a combination of

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.850 
the impact maybe it's a combination of
both<00:01:43.430> but<00:01:44.000> overall<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:45.080> just<00:01:45.110> wasn't<00:01:45.620> a<00:01:45.680> big

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
both but overall it just wasn't a big

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.700 
both but overall it just wasn't a big
fan<00:01:45.890> of<00:01:46.159> it<00:01:46.510> it<00:01:47.510> was<00:01:47.630> situations<00:01:48.230> where<00:01:48.440> I<00:01:48.470> had

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
fan of it it was situations where I had

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.680 
fan of it it was situations where I had
to<00:01:48.830> actually<00:01:49.010> shoot<00:01:49.340> four<00:01:49.850> bullets<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:50.659> kill

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
to actually shoot four bullets to kill

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.620 
to actually shoot four bullets to kill
somebody<00:01:51.140> at<00:01:51.380> range<00:01:51.650> when<00:01:52.460> my<00:01:52.820> comedian<00:01:53.420> with

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
somebody at range when my comedian with

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.570 
somebody at range when my comedian with
the<00:01:53.960> Shah<00:01:54.200> package<00:01:54.680> could<00:01:54.890> have<00:01:55.010> just<00:01:55.220> one

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
the Shah package could have just one

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.730 
the Shah package could have just one
shot<00:01:55.850> him<00:01:56.000> from<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:56.270> distance<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.500> I

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
shot him from that distance so I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.760 
shot him from that distance so I
personally<00:01:58.220> like<00:01:58.930> shotguns<00:01:59.930> that<00:02:00.200> have<00:02:00.530> that

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
personally like shotguns that have that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.700 
personally like shotguns that have that
spread<00:02:01.550> capability<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.510> tight<00:02:02.780> spread<00:02:03.200> that

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710

such<00:02:09.110> as<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.440> where<00:02:09.679> they<00:02:09.860> show<00:02:10.280> very

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
such as this where they show very

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.580

but<00:02:11.400> don't<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.209> good<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.599> range<00:02:13.349> and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
but don't have that good of range and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.220 
but don't have that good of range and
stability<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:14.909> know<00:02:15.180> not<00:02:15.359> too<00:02:15.540> bad<00:02:15.749> didn't

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
stability so you know not too bad didn't

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.929 
stability so you know not too bad didn't
didn't<00:02:16.709> really<00:02:16.980> hate<00:02:17.159> this<00:02:17.310> weapon<00:02:17.730> but

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
didn't really hate this weapon but

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.149 
didn't really hate this weapon but
there's<00:02:18.239> definitely<00:02:18.540> shot<00:02:19.409> guns<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:20.099> are

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
there's definitely shot guns that are

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.619 
there's definitely shot guns that are
much<00:02:20.459> better<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.939> do<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> job<00:02:21.180> more

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
much better and do the job more

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.830 
much better and do the job more
effectively<00:02:22.609> this<00:02:23.609> could<00:02:24.060> be<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.480> viable

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
effectively this could be a viable

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.110 
effectively this could be a viable
