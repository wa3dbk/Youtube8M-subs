00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
there it's down here doing a temperature

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.260 
there it's down here doing a temperature

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
this you actually can calibrate this

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.569 
this you actually can calibrate this
which<00:01:57.180> I'm<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.450> I'm<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.439> try<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.799> do<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.250> anyways

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
which I'm a I'm a try and do but anyways

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.060 
which I'm a I'm a try and do but anyways
yeah<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.060> basic<00:02:00.930> settings<00:02:01.350> down<00:02:02.009> here

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
yeah we just basic settings down here

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.910 
yeah we just basic settings down here
the<00:02:03.000> Niner<00:02:03.270> switch<00:02:03.600> there's<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.259> high<00:02:04.469> medium

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the Niner switch there's a high medium

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160 
the Niner switch there's a high medium
well<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.579> low<00:02:05.790> even<00:02:06.090> though<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.659> adjust

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
well and low even though you can adjust

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.600 
well and low even though you can adjust
it's<00:02:07.350> not<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.799> only<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.220> those<00:02:08.369> three

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
it's not like you only have those three

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.880 
it's not like you only have those three
positions<00:02:09.030> there's<00:02:09.239> obviously<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.530> end

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
positions there's obviously the end

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.590 
positions there's obviously the end
Queens<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.640> one<00:02:11.819> thing<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.060> did<00:02:12.240> read<00:02:12.420> about

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
Queens the one thing I did read about

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.000 
Queens the one thing I did read about
this<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.319> we<00:02:13.500> may<00:02:13.650> have<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.830> do<00:02:13.980> a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
this and we may have to do a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.820 
this and we may have to do a
modification<00:02:14.910> which<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.540> basically<00:02:15.959> it's

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
modification which is basically it's

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.670 
modification which is basically it's
real<00:02:17.220> nice<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> smoker<00:02:18.500> ben-hur<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
real nice that the smoker ben-hur the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.680 
real nice that the smoker ben-hur the
Chipman<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.310> actually<00:02:20.760> completely<00:02:21.180> cast-iron

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
Chipman is actually completely cast-iron

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.240 
Chipman is actually completely cast-iron
but<00:02:21.900> one<00:02:22.050> thing<00:02:22.230> about<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.950> takes<00:02:23.130> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
but one thing about that is it takes a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.280 
but one thing about that is it takes a
while<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.459> heat<00:02:23.850> up<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.569> get<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.930> where<00:02:25.110> you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
while to heat up to get to where you

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.710 
while to heat up to get to where you
know<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.560> smoking<00:02:26.030> its<00:02:27.030> smoking<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.480> chips

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
know it's smoking its smoking the chips

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.449 
know it's smoking its smoking the chips
or<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.140> case<00:02:28.380> I'm<00:02:28.590> actually<00:02:28.740> using<00:02:29.070> both

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
or in this case I'm actually using both

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.540 
or in this case I'm actually using both
these<00:02:30.030> aren't<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.330> best<00:02:30.480> wood<00:02:30.780> chunks<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.260> know

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550

going<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.410> do<00:02:44.400> today<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.820> read<00:02:44.970> some<00:02:45.180> people

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
going to do today and I read some people

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.340 
going to do today and I read some people
when<00:02:45.510> they<00:02:45.600> get<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.810> they<00:02:45.870> get<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.080> thinner

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
when they get it they get a thinner

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.050 
when they get it they get a thinner
there<00:02:47.310> they<00:02:47.400> actually<00:02:47.459> even<00:02:47.790> use<00:02:47.820> like<00:02:48.030> a

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
there they actually even use like a

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.759 
there they actually even use like a
coffee<00:02:48.360> can<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.810> they<00:02:48.900> kind<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.140> cut<00:02:49.320> down<00:02:49.530> or

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
coffee can that they kind of cut down or

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.440 
coffee can that they kind of cut down or
I<00:02:49.800> use<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.519> thinner<00:02:50.820> plate<00:02:51.090> because<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.360> just

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
I use a thinner plate because it just

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.330 
I use a thinner plate because it just
takes<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.780> little<00:02:51.930> bit<00:02:52.140> longer<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.860> get<00:02:53.010> going

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
takes a little bit longer to get going

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.640 
takes a little bit longer to get going
um<00:02:53.519> yesterday<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.420> think<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.989> get<00:02:55.110> smoking<00:02:55.410> it

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the you know the chunks would start

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.380 
the you know the chunks would start
smoking<00:03:10.830> but<00:03:10.890> one<00:03:11.040> thing<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.280> do<00:03:11.340> have<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.360> I

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
smoking but one thing I do have and I

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.380 
smoking but one thing I do have and I
got<00:03:12.600> is<00:03:12.780> an<00:03:13.290> expensive<00:03:14.100> hand<00:03:14.730> torch<00:03:15.000> that

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
got is an expensive hand torch that

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.050 
got is an expensive hand torch that
helps<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.900> actually<00:03:16.350> start<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.610> process<00:03:18.030> a

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
helps to actually start the process a

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.580 
helps to actually start the process a
little<00:03:18.269> bit<00:03:18.420> quicker<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.959> especially<00:03:19.350> when

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
little bit quicker and especially when

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.000 
little bit quicker and especially when
you<00:03:19.680> add<00:03:19.829> in<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.160> next<00:03:20.310> chunk<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:21.030> chips<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.230> so

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
you add in the next chunk of chips so so

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.110 
you add in the next chunk of chips so so
yeah<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:23.250> we'll<00:03:23.370> kind<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.579> show<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.910> process

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
yeah so we'll kind of show the process

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.030 
yeah so we'll kind of show the process
hopefully<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.750> video<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.200> can<00:03:25.650> get<00:03:25.769> in<00:03:25.860> under

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
hopefully this video I can get in under

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.770 
hopefully this video I can get in under
ten<00:03:26.250> minutes<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.640> don't<00:03:26.700> have<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.090> cut<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.690> up

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
ten minutes so I don't have to cut it up

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.390 
ten minutes so I don't have to cut it up
into<00:03:27.900> two<00:03:28.260> different<00:03:28.560> parts<00:03:28.980> but<00:03:29.040> yeah<00:03:29.250> but

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
into two different parts but yeah but

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.770 
into two different parts but yeah but
the<00:03:29.489> things<00:03:29.700> really<00:03:29.880> big<00:03:30.090> it's<00:03:30.209> really<00:03:30.540> sturdy

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
the things really big it's really sturdy

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.720 
the things really big it's really sturdy
one<00:03:31.260> thing<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.560> definitely<00:03:31.920> knew<00:03:32.070> going<00:03:32.519> into

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
one thing I definitely knew going into

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.130 
one thing I definitely knew going into
it<00:03:32.910> though<00:03:33.030> what<00:03:33.390> was<00:03:33.510> nice<00:03:33.630> about<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.930> is

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
it though what was nice about that is

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.780 
it though what was nice about that is
like<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.350> refrigerator<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.950> could<00:03:35.310> touch<00:03:35.549> any

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
like a refrigerator you could touch any

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.729 
like a refrigerator you could touch any
outside<00:03:36.180> part<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.600> but<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.840> thing<00:03:36.900> is

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
outside part of it but this thing is

outside part of it but this thing is
yeah<00:03:38.610> it's<00:03:38.850> it's<00:03:39.150> all<00:03:39.360> just<00:03:39.660> steel<00:03:39.900> all<00:03:40.049> around

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
yeah it's it's all just steel all around

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.110 
yeah it's it's all just steel all around
it<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.650> gets<00:03:40.799> pretty<00:03:41.010> pretty<00:03:41.579> darn<00:03:41.820> hot<00:03:42.000> so

it so it gets pretty pretty darn hot so
I<00:03:42.150> can't<00:03:42.390> set<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.690> temperature<00:03:42.959> gauges<00:03:43.350> on

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
I can't set the temperature gauges on

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.900 
I can't set the temperature gauges on
the<00:03:43.650> top<00:03:43.890> anymore<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.459> got<00:03:44.579> it<00:03:44.670> kind<00:03:44.820> of

always if the rib Braca ribs was a
little<00:03:58.980> bit<00:03:59.100> smaller<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.640> not<00:04:00.120> that<00:04:00.269> it's<00:04:00.390> a

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
little bit smaller and not that it's a

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.789 
little bit smaller and not that it's a
huge<00:04:00.630> deal<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.840> cut<00:04:01.140> them<00:04:01.230> in<00:04:01.320> half<00:04:01.470> but<00:04:01.709> this

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
huge deal to cut them in half but this

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.100 
huge deal to cut them in half but this
thing<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.340> just<00:04:02.670> it's<00:04:03.060> it's<00:04:03.540> not<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:03.900> know<00:04:03.989> the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
thing is just it's it's not you know the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.780 
thing is just it's it's not you know the
biggest<00:04:04.290> smoker<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:04.799> can<00:04:04.920> get<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.459> in<00:04:05.670> the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
biggest smoker you can get in the in the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.880 
biggest smoker you can get in the in the
world<00:04:06.000> but<00:04:06.269> but<00:04:06.930> for<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.140> next<00:04:07.350> size<00:04:07.500> up<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.769> do

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
world but but for the next size up to do

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.069 
world but but for the next size up to do
large<00:04:08.430> quantities<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.180> stuff<00:04:09.420> I<00:04:09.570> mean<00:04:09.600> you

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
large quantities of stuff I mean you

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.170 
large quantities of stuff I mean you
could<00:04:10.230> do<00:04:10.320> multiple<00:04:10.530> again<00:04:11.459> multiple<00:04:11.940> things

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
could do multiple again multiple things

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.699 
could do multiple again multiple things
I<00:04:12.570> think<00:04:12.959> someone<00:04:13.200> said<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.440> could<00:04:13.560> hide<00:04:13.680> a

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
I think someone said you could hide a

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.530 
I think someone said you could hide a
dead<00:04:13.920> body<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.280> here<00:04:14.400> which<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.549> which<00:04:15.420> is

dead body in here which is which is

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.000 
dead body in here which is which is
pretty<00:04:15.690> cool<00:04:15.900> because<00:04:16.079> that's<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.890> know<00:04:16.919> I

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
pretty cool because that's you know I

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.560 
pretty cool because that's you know I
need<00:04:17.220> that's<00:04:17.609> that's<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.970> good<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.239> know<00:04:18.390> you

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
need that's that's a good to know you

need that's that's a good to know you
know<00:04:18.690> it's<00:04:19.109> like<00:04:19.229> GI<00:04:19.440> Joe<00:04:19.709> knowing<00:04:20.580> is<00:04:20.669> half

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
know it's like GI Joe knowing is half

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.279 
know it's like GI Joe knowing is half
the<00:04:20.849> battle<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.479> if<00:04:21.599> you<00:04:21.720> need<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.049> hide<00:04:22.260> a

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
you could probably do it but you could

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.170 
you could probably do it but you could
get<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:26.010> don't<00:04:26.400> know<00:04:26.490> probably<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:27.090> couple

turkeys<00:04:27.600> in<00:04:27.720> there<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:27.990> smoke<00:04:28.170> and<00:04:28.380> whatnot<00:04:28.680> so

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
turkeys in there to smoke and whatnot so

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.520 
turkeys in there to smoke and whatnot so
anyways<00:04:30.030> that's<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:30.750> oh<00:04:30.780> one<00:04:31.260> other<00:04:31.410> thing

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
anyways that's that oh one other thing

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.650 
anyways that's that oh one other thing
that<00:04:31.800> I'm<00:04:31.860> probably<00:04:32.010> going<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.550> do<00:04:32.700> these

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
that I'm probably going to do these

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.360 
that I'm probably going to do these
dampers<00:04:34.140> they<00:04:34.590> come<00:04:34.800> when<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.040> put<00:04:35.190> them<00:04:35.280> on

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
dampers they come when you put them on

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.980 
dampers they come when you put them on
they<00:04:35.790> have<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.030> tabs<00:04:36.300> here<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.720> move<00:04:36.840> them

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
they have the tabs here to move them

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.720 
they have the tabs here to move them
well<00:04:37.110> that's<00:04:37.200> hot<00:04:37.440> but<00:04:38.010> one<00:04:38.190> is<00:04:38.310> up<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.610> one<00:04:38.700> is

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
well that's hot but one is up and one is

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.120 
well that's hot but one is up and one is
down<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.450> so<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:40.170> can<00:04:40.320> go<00:04:40.440> kind<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.800> I'm

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
down and so you can go kind of I'm

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.830 
down and so you can go kind of I'm
stupid<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.640> have<00:04:41.760> this<00:04:41.880> thing<00:04:42.090> right<00:04:42.180> here<00:04:42.420> you

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
stupid I have this thing right here you

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.230 
stupid I have this thing right here you
can<00:04:43.140> when<00:04:43.740> it's<00:04:43.860> shut<00:04:44.250> it's<00:04:44.520> still<00:04:44.790> kind<00:04:45.090> of

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
can when it's shut it's still kind of

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.810 
can when it's shut it's still kind of
open<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.860> what<00:04:47.160> I'm<00:04:47.250> probably<00:04:47.400> gonna<00:04:47.580> do<00:04:47.700> is

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
just bend those tabs up so I can

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.960 
just bend those tabs up so I can

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
this thing set it to 54 I don't know for

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.760 
this thing set it to 54 I don't know for
as<00:05:27.450> long<00:05:27.630> as<00:05:27.690> it<00:05:27.990> needed<00:05:28.260> to<00:05:28.350> it<00:05:28.470> did<00:05:28.620> not

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
as long as it needed to it did not

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.020 
as long as it needed to it did not
fluctuate<00:05:29.340> obviously<00:05:29.640> when<00:05:29.760> you<00:05:29.820> put<00:05:29.940> the

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
fluctuate obviously when you put the

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.670 
fluctuate obviously when you put the
meat<00:05:30.150> in<00:05:30.270> there<00:05:30.390> it<00:05:30.480> may<00:05:30.600> take<00:05:31.020> you<00:05:31.320> know<00:05:31.440> maybe

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
meat in there it may take you know maybe

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.980 
meat in there it may take you know maybe
a<00:05:31.800> medium<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.550> high<00:05:33.240> to<00:05:33.300> hold<00:05:33.840> that

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
a medium to high to hold that

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.930 
a medium to high to hold that
temperature<00:05:34.440> but<00:05:34.470> but<00:05:35.100> we'll<00:05:35.250> see<00:05:35.430> this<00:05:35.790> is<00:05:35.880> a

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
temperature but but we'll see this is a

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.260 
temperature but but we'll see this is a
brand<00:05:36.180> new<00:05:36.300> canister<00:05:36.780> of<00:05:37.490> propane<00:05:38.490> I<00:05:38.730> always
