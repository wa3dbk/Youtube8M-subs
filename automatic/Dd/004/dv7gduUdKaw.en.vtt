men<00:00:30.960> also<00:00:31.230> tracks<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:32.040> cow<00:00:32.369> how<00:00:32.820> many

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
men also tracks your cow how many

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.810 
men also tracks your cow how many
calories<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.540> burn<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.079> how<00:00:34.230> many<00:00:34.350> steps<00:00:35.070> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
calories you burn and how many steps you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.690 
calories you burn and how many steps you
make<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.280> pretty<00:00:38.520> accurate

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
make and I think it's pretty accurate

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.410 
make and I think it's pretty accurate
and<00:00:39.149> by<00:00:40.050> how<00:00:40.200> many<00:00:40.379> steps<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.829> take<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:42.030> can

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and by how many steps you take it can

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.540 
and by how many steps you take it can
track<00:00:42.660> how<00:00:43.110> far<00:00:43.170> you've<00:00:43.680> gone<00:00:43.950> throughout<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
track how far you've gone throughout the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.810 
track how far you've gone throughout the
day<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.360> think<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:45.719> pretty<00:00:45.840> cool<00:00:46.820> so

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
day and I think that's pretty cool so

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.119 
day and I think that's pretty cool so
yeah<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.899> steps<00:00:49.170> are<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.410> accurate

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.430 

sometimes<00:00:53.149> I've<00:00:54.149> tested<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.719> see<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:54.960> like

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
sometimes I've tested to see if like

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.500 
sometimes I've tested to see if like
when<00:00:55.739> I'm<00:00:55.829> sitting<00:00:56.070> down<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.670> move<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.030> lot<00:00:57.210> to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
when I'm sitting down and move a lot to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
when I'm sitting down and move a lot to
see<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> step<00:00:58.230> number<00:00:58.410> goes<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
see if the step number goes up and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.770 
see if the step number goes up and
sometimes<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.910> doesn't<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> yeah<00:01:01.800> they<00:01:02.780> got

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
sometimes it doesn't so yeah they got

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.950 
sometimes it doesn't so yeah they got
pretty<00:01:04.439> good<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.369> oh<00:01:05.790> that's<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.810> good
