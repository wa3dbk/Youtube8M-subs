stretchy white stuff in the back but I

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.280

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
thought that it was cool and it was much

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.900 
thought that it was cool and it was much
cheaper<00:00:40.590> than<00:00:40.920> they<00:00:41.040> would<00:00:41.190> normally<00:00:41.219> sell<00:00:41.760> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
cheaper than they would normally sell it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.540 
cheaper than they would normally sell it
for<00:00:42.149> because<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.600> was<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> sample<00:00:43.260> sale<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
for because it was a sample sale so I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.970
