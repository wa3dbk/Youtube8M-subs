would<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.159> cool<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.580> fun<00:01:17.939> solved<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
would be really cool and fun solved and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.920 
would be really cool and fun solved and
I'm<00:01:19.530> seeing<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.130> some<00:01:20.280> people<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.930> YouTube

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
I'm seeing as some people on YouTube

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.690 
I'm seeing as some people on YouTube
have<00:01:22.170> come<00:01:22.380> across<00:01:22.619> some<00:01:22.830> strange<00:01:22.860> parody<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
have come across some strange parody to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.340 
have come across some strange parody to
do<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> corners<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:25.170> thought

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
do with the corners but I just thought

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.870 
do with the corners but I just thought
about<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.159> see<00:01:26.369> why<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.580> would

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
about that and I can see why that would

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640 
about that and I can see why that would
happen<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.540> also<00:01:27.750> figure<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.470> how

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
happen and I can also figure it out how

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.469 
happen and I can also figure it out how
to<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> little<00:01:29.549> bit<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.850> deconstruction

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
to it's a little bit of deconstruction

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.670 
to it's a little bit of deconstruction
and<00:01:30.540> reconstruction<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:31.259> get<00:01:31.380> out<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and reconstruction to get out of that

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.069 
and reconstruction to get out of that
but<00:01:31.860> anyways<00:01:32.520> I'm<00:01:33.119> super<00:01:33.479> stoked<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:33.869> into

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079

display<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:47.070> these<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.490> think<00:01:48.240> he<00:01:48.420> does<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> great

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
display on these I think he does a great

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.840 
display on these I think he does a great
job<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.619> his<00:01:49.710> puzzles<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.670> also

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
job with not just his puzzles but also

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.840 
job with not just his puzzles but also
his<00:01:51.210> packaging<00:01:52.220> alright<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.340> let's<00:01:53.490> open<00:01:53.610> this

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
his packaging alright so let's open this

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.880 
his packaging alright so let's open this
thing<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:54.180> now<00:01:55.079> there's<00:01:55.290> actually<00:01:55.409> eight

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
thing up now there's actually eight

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.709 
thing up now there's actually eight
different<00:01:56.520> variations<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.540> there's

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
different variations and I think there's

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.330 
different variations and I think there's
still<00:01:57.899> gonna<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.110> more<00:01:58.439> I'm<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.829> sure<00:01:59.070> but

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
still gonna be more I'm not sure but

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.550 
still gonna be more I'm not sure but
I've<00:02:00.329> actually<00:02:00.540> got<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> couple<00:02:00.960> more<00:02:01.259> coming

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
I've actually got a couple more coming

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.889 
I've actually got a couple more coming
to<00:02:02.189> show<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.430> guys<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.420> every<00:02:03.719> one<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
to show you guys so and every one of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.740 
to show you guys so and every one of
them<00:02:04.219> that<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.399> about<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:06.450> see<00:02:06.630> that

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
them that I know about I can see that

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.359 
them that I know about I can see that
it's<00:02:06.899> solved<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.350> little<00:02:07.680> bit<00:02:07.799> differently<00:02:08.190> but

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it's solved a little bit differently but

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.010 
it's solved a little bit differently but
they<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.849> some<00:02:09.030> similarities<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:09.840> well

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
they do have some similarities as well

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.360 
they do have some similarities as well
alright<00:02:10.979> so

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
alright so

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.550 
alright so
yes<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.819> L<00:02:15.150> cube<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.319> called

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
yes this is the L cube and it is called

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.229 
yes this is the L cube and it is called
that<00:02:16.620> obviously<00:02:17.220> because<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.849> shaped<00:02:18.120> like

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
that obviously because it is shaped like

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.940 
that obviously because it is shaped like
an<00:02:18.569> L<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:20.099> big<00:02:20.430> fat<00:02:20.700> Alba<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:22.349> can<00:02:22.530> see<00:02:22.770> that

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
an L a big fat Alba and you can see that

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.420 
an L a big fat Alba and you can see that
the<00:02:24.110> puzzle<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.930> shape-shifting<00:02:28.680> puzzle

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the puzzle is a shape-shifting puzzle

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.110 
the puzzle is a shape-shifting puzzle
just<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> rest<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.360> them<00:02:30.510> as<00:02:30.630> well<00:02:30.870> but

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
just like the rest of them as well but

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.400 
just like the rest of them as well but
it<00:02:33.120> looks<00:02:33.150> like<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.480> 3x3<00:02:33.870> before<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.350> were

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
it looks like a 3x3 before if you were

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.100 
it looks like a 3x3 before if you were
to<00:02:34.470> hold<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:34.800> but<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.310> course<00:02:36.110> this

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
to hold like this but of course this

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.070 
to hold like this but of course this
changes<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.709> now<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:37.830> can't<00:02:38.190> move<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.390> and

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
changes and now you can't move this and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.080 
changes and now you can't move this and
you<00:02:40.230> can't<00:02:40.440> separate<00:02:41.220> these<00:02:41.489> from<00:02:41.790> these<00:02:42.269> ones

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
you can't separate these from these ones

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.250 
you can't separate these from these ones
so<00:02:45.090> let's<00:02:45.239> try<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.390> checkerboard<00:02:45.750> see<00:02:46.110> what

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
so let's try a checkerboard see what

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.259 
so let's try a checkerboard see what
that<00:02:46.410> looks<00:02:46.620> like

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.890 

go<00:02:51.269> oh<00:02:51.709> wow<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.980> looks<00:02:53.010> pretty<00:02:53.340> neat<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.900> like

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
go oh wow that looks pretty neat I like

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.530 
go oh wow that looks pretty neat I like
the<00:02:55.019> look<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.819> alright<00:02:56.819> so<00:02:56.880> as<00:02:57.180> for<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
the look of that alright so as for the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.600 
the look of that alright so as for the
turning<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.290> puzzle<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.920> really<00:02:59.370> like

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
turning of this puzzle I I really like

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.520 
turning of this puzzle I I really like
the<00:02:59.730> turning<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.180> think<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:00.690> it's

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
the turning I think that it's it's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.990 
the turning I think that it's it's
pretty<00:03:01.739> smooth<00:03:02.130> actually<00:03:02.459> it's<00:03:02.730> really

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
pretty smooth actually it's really

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.330 
pretty smooth actually it's really
smooth<00:03:03.330> it's<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.049> little<00:03:04.290> bit<00:03:04.410> catchy<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:05.069> some

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
smooth it's a little bit catchy on some

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.890 
smooth it's a little bit catchy on some
areas<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.760> noticed<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.209> was<00:03:06.239> doing<00:03:06.569> that<00:03:06.660> checker

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
areas I noticed I was doing that checker

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.520 
areas I noticed I was doing that checker
pattern<00:03:07.170> but<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.450> feels<00:03:09.720> really<00:03:10.049> strong

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
pattern but it's it feels really strong

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.240 
pattern but it's it feels really strong
really<00:03:10.830> sturdy<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:12.330> X<00:03:12.780> cube<00:03:13.170> also<00:03:13.739> felt

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
really sturdy and the X cube also felt

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.220 
really sturdy and the X cube also felt
like<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.610> as<00:03:14.850> well<00:03:15.120> whereas<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.840> three<00:03:16.110> by

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
like that as well whereas a three by

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.870 
like that as well whereas a three by
three<00:03:16.290> by<00:03:16.530> five<00:03:16.709> didn't<00:03:17.190> but<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.340> actually<00:03:17.519> made

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
three by five didn't but I actually made

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.970 
three by five didn't but I actually made
it<00:03:17.910> feel<00:03:18.239> really<00:03:18.540> good<00:03:18.660> by<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.380> lubricating

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
it feel really good by just lubricating

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.830 
it feel really good by just lubricating
a<00:03:20.100> little<00:03:20.310> bit<00:03:20.430> more<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.850> tightening<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.359> so

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
a little bit more and tightening it so

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.539 
a little bit more and tightening it so
the<00:03:22.799> mechanism<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.430> really<00:03:23.730> really<00:03:23.910> good<00:03:25.549> so

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
the mechanism is really really good so

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.949 
the mechanism is really really good so
I'm<00:03:26.670> not<00:03:26.820> gonna<00:03:27.000> go<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.359> break<00:03:27.510> open<00:03:27.570> this

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
I'm not gonna go and break open this

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.240 
I'm not gonna go and break open this
puzzle<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.410> show<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.709> mechanism<00:03:28.829> and

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
puzzle and show you the mechanism and

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.440 
puzzle and show you the mechanism and
the<00:03:29.280> reason<00:03:29.579> for<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.910> because<00:03:30.060> it's<00:03:30.359> the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
the reason for that is because it's the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.449 
the reason for that is because it's the
exact<00:03:30.930> same<00:03:31.200> mechanism<00:03:31.470> as<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.950> three<00:03:32.250> by<00:03:32.430> three

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
exact same mechanism as a three by three

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.490 
exact same mechanism as a three by three
by<00:03:32.790> five<00:03:33.120> it's<00:03:33.720> just<00:03:33.930> instead<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:34.290> putting

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
by five it's just instead of putting

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.069 
by five it's just instead of putting
this<00:03:34.739> one<00:03:34.980> here<00:03:35.549> they<00:03:35.970> put<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.269> here<00:03:36.299> it's<00:03:36.720> the

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
this one here they put it here it's the

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.660 
this one here they put it here it's the
same<00:03:37.350> thing<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.850> now<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:40.200> can<00:03:40.380> also<00:03:40.530> mix<00:03:40.950> these

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
same thing and now we can also mix these

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.539 
same thing and now we can also mix these
layers<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.750> these<00:03:43.170> layers<00:03:43.530> by<00:03:44.100> turning<00:03:44.430> them

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
layers with these layers by turning them

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.640 
layers with these layers by turning them
up<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:44.910> now<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.150> can<00:03:45.299> see<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:45.780> I've<00:03:45.900> just

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
up and now you can see that I've just

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.789 
up and now you can see that I've just
changed<00:03:46.980> everything<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:48.500> alright<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:49.650> I'm

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
changed everything so alright so I'm

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:50.810 
changed everything so alright so I'm
going<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.010> go<00:03:50.070> ahead<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.370> scramble<00:03:50.760> this

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
going to go ahead and scramble this

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.400 
going to go ahead and scramble this
thing<00:03:51.030> up<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.359> guess<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.720> first<00:03:52.079> thing<00:03:52.320> I

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
thing up I guess the first thing I

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
thing up I guess the first thing I
should<00:03:52.440> do<00:03:52.709> is<00:03:52.739> scramble<00:03:53.340> these<00:03:53.880> up<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:59.700> then

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.080 

I<00:04:05.659> want<00:04:06.659> to<00:04:06.719> make<00:04:06.810> sure<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.140> they're<00:04:07.319> all<00:04:08.090> so

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
I want to make sure that they're all so

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.349 
I want to make sure that they're all so
these<00:04:09.329> are<00:04:09.659> together<00:04:09.900> still<00:04:11.150> sort<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.209> though

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
these are together still sort of though

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.240 
these are together still sort of though
so<00:04:12.629> let's<00:04:12.719> move<00:04:13.049> these<00:04:13.200> back<00:04:13.439> okay<00:04:13.829> so<00:04:13.890> now<00:04:14.219> all

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
so let's move these back okay so now all

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.360 
so let's move these back okay so now all
of<00:04:14.549> these<00:04:14.909> are<00:04:15.450> separated<00:04:16.199> out<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.889> now<00:04:17.310> we

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
of these are separated out and now we

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:27.370 
of these are separated out and now we
can<00:04:17.699> go<00:04:17.820> ahead<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.509> scramble<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.079> like<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.769> 3x3

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:35.439 

all<00:04:28.380> right<00:04:32.000> all<00:04:33.000> right<00:04:33.060> so<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.449> would<00:04:33.509> call<00:04:33.870> that

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
all right all right so I would call that

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.749 
all right all right so I would call that
a<00:04:36.449> pretty<00:04:37.139> sufficient<00:04:37.770> scramble<00:04:38.250> so<00:04:38.639> now<00:04:38.729> I

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
a pretty sufficient scramble so now I

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.010 
a pretty sufficient scramble so now I
gotta<00:04:38.940> figure<00:04:39.090> out<00:04:39.180> how<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.360> solve<00:04:39.630> this<00:04:39.810> thing

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
gotta figure out how to solve this thing

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.050 
gotta figure out how to solve this thing
and<00:04:40.139> I<00:04:40.169> think<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.979> already<00:04:41.220> have<00:04:41.430> an<00:04:41.639> idea<00:04:41.729> how

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
and I think I already have an idea how

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.460 
and I think I already have an idea how
to<00:04:42.120> solve<00:04:42.389> it<00:04:42.570> so<00:04:42.750> we'll<00:04:43.259> see

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
to solve it so we'll see

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.540 
to solve it so we'll see
anyways<00:04:43.830> I'll<00:04:44.070> be<00:04:44.310> back<00:04:44.550> in<00:04:44.849> a<00:04:45.389> little<00:04:45.419> bit

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
anyways I'll be back in a little bit

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.830 
anyways I'll be back in a little bit
okay<00:04:47.550> so<00:04:47.580> it's<00:04:47.880> been<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.090> few<00:04:48.330> days<00:04:48.509> now<00:04:48.570> and

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
okay so it's been a few days now and

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.990 
okay so it's been a few days now and
I've<00:04:49.080> solved<00:04:49.380> this<00:04:49.470> a<00:04:49.530> couple<00:04:49.949> of<00:04:50.039> times<00:04:50.340> it's

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
I've solved this a couple of times it's

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.120 
I've solved this a couple of times it's
relatively<00:04:51.479> a<00:04:51.780> lot<00:04:52.050> easier<00:04:52.410> than<00:04:52.530> I<00:04:52.620> thought

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
relatively a lot easier than I thought

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.129 
relatively a lot easier than I thought
the<00:04:53.430> first<00:04:53.789> time<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.090> solve<00:04:54.509> it<00:04:54.690> though<00:04:54.870> I'm

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
the first time I solve it though I'm

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.320 
the first time I solve it though I'm
getting<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.710> back<00:04:55.860> into<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.639> shape<00:04:56.970> even

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
getting it back into the shape even

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.760 
getting it back into the shape even
though<00:04:57.479> it<00:04:57.570> would<00:04:57.660> still<00:04:57.990> be<00:04:58.020> scrambled<00:04:58.530> on

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
though it would still be scrambled on

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.180 
though it would still be scrambled on
this<00:04:59.400> layer<00:04:59.669> here<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.120> this<00:05:00.330> layer<00:05:00.570> here<00:05:01.190> it

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
this layer here and this layer here it

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.010 
this layer here and this layer here it
was<00:05:02.370> relatively<00:05:03.060> challenging<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.840> first

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
was relatively challenging the first

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.689 
was relatively challenging the first
time<00:05:04.289> and<00:05:04.710> I'm<00:05:04.889> not<00:05:05.039> sure<00:05:05.220> why<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.610> I

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
time and I'm not sure why that is I

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:06.680 
time and I'm not sure why that is I
think<00:05:05.789> it's<00:05:05.970> just<00:05:06.090> because<00:05:06.240> I'm<00:05:06.449> trying<00:05:06.599> to

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
think it's just because I'm trying to

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.790 
think it's just because I'm trying to
deal<00:05:06.870> with<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.169> many<00:05:07.260> different<00:05:07.620> shapes

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
deal with so many different shapes

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.760 
deal with so many different shapes
because<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.970> know<00:05:09.060> this<00:05:09.389> corner<00:05:10.110> piece<00:05:10.320> here

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
because you know this corner piece here

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.890 
because you know this corner piece here
is<00:05:10.860> actually<00:05:11.370> this<00:05:12.000> shape<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.570> this<00:05:12.659> one's

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
is actually this shape and this one's

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.330 
is actually this shape and this one's
this<00:05:13.080> one<00:05:13.289> going<00:05:13.500> out<00:05:13.620> that<00:05:13.830> way<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:14.250> this

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
this one going out that way and this

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.399 
this one going out that way and this
one's<00:05:14.550> this<00:05:14.639> one<00:05:14.820> going<00:05:15.000> out<00:05:15.120> this<00:05:15.300> way<00:05:15.510> edges

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
one's this one going out this way edges

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.620 
one's this one going out this way edges
have<00:05:16.620> two<00:05:16.919> that<00:05:17.520> have<00:05:17.789> two<00:05:17.970> pieces<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.510> then

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
have two that have two pieces and then

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.020 
have two that have two pieces and then
two<00:05:18.810> that<00:05:18.960> have<00:05:19.110> one<00:05:19.320> I<00:05:20.130> just<00:05:20.400> had<00:05:20.669> to<00:05:20.729> wrap<00:05:20.880> my

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
two that have one I just had to wrap my

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.490 
two that have one I just had to wrap my
mind<00:05:21.180> around<00:05:21.360> that<00:05:21.599> but<00:05:21.810> once<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.110> finally

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
mind around that but once I finally

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.860 
mind around that but once I finally
figured<00:05:23.070> it<00:05:23.190> out<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.880> kind<00:05:24.120> of<00:05:24.180> understood<00:05:24.630> it

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
figured it out and kind of understood it

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.649 
figured it out and kind of understood it
was<00:05:24.930> relatively<00:05:25.440> easy<00:05:26.270> now<00:05:27.270> it's<00:05:27.449> basically

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
was relatively easy now it's basically

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.589 
was relatively easy now it's basically
the<00:05:27.990> same<00:05:28.169> thing<00:05:28.470> as<00:05:28.590> that<00:05:28.849> X<00:05:29.849> cube<00:05:30.300> where<00:05:30.479> it's

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
the same thing as that X cube where it's

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.420 
the same thing as that X cube where it's
got<00:05:30.750> this<00:05:31.020> you<00:05:31.409> know<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:31.620> extensions<00:05:32.070> on<00:05:32.220> all

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
got this you know the extensions on all

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.020 
got this you know the extensions on all
four<00:05:32.789> sides<00:05:33.530> it's<00:05:34.530> the<00:05:34.949> same<00:05:35.190> thing<00:05:35.520> except

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
four sides it's the same thing except

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.879 
four sides it's the same thing except
I'm<00:05:36.180> just<00:05:36.389> dealing<00:05:36.570> with<00:05:36.870> two<00:05:37.259> instead<00:05:37.770> of

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
I'm just dealing with two instead of

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.110 
I'm just dealing with two instead of
four<00:05:38.250> however<00:05:38.849> my<00:05:39.120> method<00:05:39.599> for<00:05:39.630> doing<00:05:40.199> -<00:05:41.120> you

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
four however my method for doing - you

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.730 
four however my method for doing - you
know<00:05:42.150> that<00:05:42.479> are<00:05:42.630> adjacent<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.139> each<00:05:43.229> other<00:05:43.440> is

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
know that are adjacent to each other is

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.529 
know that are adjacent to each other is
different<00:05:44.180> than<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.479> way<00:05:45.599> that<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.810> do<00:05:45.930> the

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
different than the way that I do the

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.300 
different than the way that I do the
cross<00:05:48.539> cube<00:05:48.960> would<00:05:49.050> be<00:05:49.139> X<00:05:49.320> cube<00:05:49.680> whatever<00:05:50.159> it's

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
cross cube would be X cube whatever it's

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.760 
cross cube would be X cube whatever it's
called<00:05:50.599> so<00:05:51.599> for<00:05:51.840> this<00:05:51.900> one<00:05:52.110> I<00:05:52.259> just<00:05:52.289> solve<00:05:52.650> it

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
called so for this one I just solve it

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.499 
called so for this one I just solve it
like<00:05:52.830> a<00:05:52.889> 3x3<00:05:53.580> but<00:05:53.789> really<00:05:54.060> only<00:05:54.210> paying

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
like a 3x3 but really only paying

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.770 
like a 3x3 but really only paying
attention<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.860> 3x3<00:05:56.370> part<00:05:57.000> of<00:05:57.240> it<00:05:57.389> you<00:05:57.750> know

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
attention to the 3x3 part of it you know

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.200 
attention to the 3x3 part of it you know
like<00:05:58.050> this<00:05:58.409> and<00:05:58.680> then<00:05:59.220> once<00:05:59.729> that's<00:05:59.880> done<00:06:00.150> I

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
like this and then once that's done I

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.300 
like this and then once that's done I
just<00:06:00.479> deal<00:06:00.659> with<00:06:00.690> these<00:06:01.020> two<00:06:01.289> just<00:06:01.919> like<00:06:02.099> I<00:06:02.250> do

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
just deal with these two just like I do

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.070 
just deal with these two just like I do
with<00:06:03.949> with<00:06:04.949> 5x5<00:06:05.159> super<00:06:06.090> cube<00:06:06.389> centers<00:06:06.840> it's

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
with with 5x5 super cube centers it's

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.279 
with with 5x5 super cube centers it's
really<00:06:07.620> not<00:06:07.919> that<00:06:08.130> difficult<00:06:08.430> at<00:06:08.820> all<00:06:09.080> but<00:06:10.080> I

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
really not that difficult at all but I

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.310 
really not that difficult at all but I
mean<00:06:10.469> that's<00:06:10.740> saying<00:06:11.250> you<00:06:11.370> know<00:06:11.550> if<00:06:11.669> I<00:06:12.320> it's

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
mean that's saying you know if I it's

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.050 
mean that's saying you know if I it's
not<00:06:13.500> difficult<00:06:13.740> if<00:06:14.219> you<00:06:14.370> know<00:06:14.520> how<00:06:14.639> to<00:06:14.669> do<00:06:14.940> it

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
not difficult if you know how to do it

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.420 
not difficult if you know how to do it
of<00:06:15.180> course

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
of course

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.180 
of course
but<00:06:16.140> now<00:06:17.140> I<00:06:17.170> do<00:06:17.320> plan<00:06:17.650> to<00:06:17.710> come<00:06:17.980> out<00:06:18.100> with

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
but now I do plan to come out with

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.820 
but now I do plan to come out with
tutorials<00:06:18.490> very<00:06:19.000> soon<00:06:19.330> with<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:20.350> three<00:06:20.710> by

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
tutorials very soon with the three by

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.390 
tutorials very soon with the three by
three<00:06:21.040> by<00:06:21.070> five<00:06:21.430> the<00:06:21.970> X<00:06:22.630> cube<00:06:23.170> this<00:06:24.130> one

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
three by five the X cube this one

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.980 
three by five the X cube this one
there's<00:06:24.910> another<00:06:25.120> one<00:06:25.300> out<00:06:25.330> coming<00:06:25.750> the<00:06:25.960> I

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
there's another one out coming the I

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.530 
there's another one out coming the I
cube<00:06:26.590> which<00:06:26.800> is<00:06:26.950> just<00:06:27.190> like<00:06:27.340> this<00:06:27.670> it's<00:06:28.240> it's

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
cube which is just like this it's it's

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.000 
cube which is just like this it's it's
like<00:06:28.690> a<00:06:28.750> three<00:06:28.960> by<00:06:29.080> three<00:06:29.110> by<00:06:29.260> four<00:06:29.380> except

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
like a three by three by four except

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.730 
like a three by three by four except
it's<00:06:30.700> trickier<00:06:31.180> because<00:06:31.360> it<00:06:32.350> doesn't<00:06:32.650> move

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
it's trickier because it doesn't move

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.020 
it's trickier because it doesn't move
like<00:06:32.800> it's<00:06:33.100> true<00:06:33.190> by<00:06:33.310> 3<00:06:33.430> by<00:06:33.550> 4<00:06:33.790> it's<00:06:33.940> an

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
like it's true by 3 by 4 it's an

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.330 
like it's true by 3 by 4 it's an
extended<00:06:34.300> 3<00:06:34.480> by<00:06:34.600> 3<00:06:34.780> and<00:06:35.140> there's<00:06:35.590> also<00:06:35.800> a<00:06:35.980> cross

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
extended 3 by 3 and there's also a cross

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.190 
extended 3 by 3 and there's also a cross
cube<00:06:36.880> that's<00:06:37.270> coming<00:06:37.570> out<00:06:37.690> that<00:06:37.810> I<00:06:37.870> have<00:06:38.050> on

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
cube that's coming out that I have on

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.720 
cube that's coming out that I have on
order<00:06:38.440> as<00:06:38.680> well<00:06:38.920> and<00:06:39.190> that's<00:06:39.490> got<00:06:39.640> an

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
order as well and that's got an

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.850 
order as well and that's got an
extension<00:06:40.000> on<00:06:40.210> every<00:06:40.690> single<00:06:40.900> side<00:06:41.290> that's

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
extension on every single side that's

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.990 
extension on every single side that's
been<00:06:42.040> a<00:06:42.070> cube<00:06:42.340> that's<00:06:42.430> wanted<00:06:42.730> for<00:06:42.850> a<00:06:42.880> while

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
been a cube that's wanted for a while

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.940 
been a cube that's wanted for a while
and<00:06:43.120> I'll<00:06:43.210> do<00:06:43.330> a<00:06:43.360> tutorial<00:06:43.930> on<00:06:44.350> that<00:06:44.410> as<00:06:44.770> well

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
and I'll do a tutorial on that as well

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.940 
and I'll do a tutorial on that as well
so<00:06:45.190> as<00:06:45.760> far<00:06:46.030> as<00:06:46.210> this<00:06:47.080> puzzle<00:06:47.440> goes<00:06:47.590> I<00:06:47.800> guess

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
so as far as this puzzle goes I guess

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.350 
so as far as this puzzle goes I guess
the<00:06:48.100> review<00:06:48.400> is<00:06:48.460> done<00:06:48.580> it<00:06:48.790> turns<00:06:49.000> really

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
the review is done it turns really

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.820 
the review is done it turns really
really<00:06:49.570> well<00:06:49.720> one<00:06:50.050> thing<00:06:50.260> I<00:06:50.380> have<00:06:50.560> noticed

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
really well one thing I have noticed

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.130 
really well one thing I have noticed
though<00:06:51.130> is<00:06:51.340> the<00:06:51.880> stickers<00:06:52.300> okay<00:06:52.600> the<00:06:52.750> stickers

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
though is the stickers okay the stickers

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.820 
though is the stickers okay the stickers
do<00:06:53.380> chip<00:06:53.710> on<00:06:53.980> these<00:06:54.970> puzzles<00:06:55.540> so<00:06:56.140> if<00:06:56.470> you

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
do chip on these puzzles so if you

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.800 
do chip on these puzzles so if you
seriously<00:06:57.610> want<00:06:57.790> to<00:06:57.850> collect<00:06:58.300> them<00:06:58.570> all<00:06:58.780> I

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
seriously want to collect them all I

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.970 
seriously want to collect them all I
would<00:06:59.260> consider<00:06:59.950> you<00:07:00.940> know<00:07:01.090> getting<00:07:01.990> getting

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980 
would consider you know getting getting

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.410 
would consider you know getting getting
new<00:07:03.100> stickers<00:07:03.460> for<00:07:03.610> them<00:07:03.790> because<00:07:03.880> the

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:04.420 
new stickers for them because the

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.930 
new stickers for them because the
stickers<00:07:04.840> themselves<00:07:05.590> are<00:07:05.830> nice<00:07:06.280> colors<00:07:06.850> and

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
stickers themselves are nice colors and

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.920 
stickers themselves are nice colors and
you<00:07:09.940> don't<00:07:10.090> really<00:07:10.210> see<00:07:10.300> through<00:07:10.690> them<00:07:10.780> like

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
you don't really see through them like

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.020 
you don't really see through them like
they're<00:07:11.080> not<00:07:11.230> too<00:07:11.440> thick<00:07:11.830> not<00:07:12.340> too<00:07:12.400> thin<00:07:12.580> like

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030 
they're not too thick not too thin like

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.450 
they're not too thick not too thin like
they're<00:07:13.240> they're<00:07:13.630> a<00:07:13.660> good<00:07:13.960> thickness<00:07:14.410> or<00:07:14.890> but

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
they're they're a good thickness or but

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.450 
they're they're a good thickness or but
they<00:07:15.910> chip<00:07:16.270> very<00:07:16.750> very<00:07:17.140> easy<00:07:17.500> you<00:07:18.130> know<00:07:18.250> like

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 
they chip very very easy you know like

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.890 
they chip very very easy you know like
