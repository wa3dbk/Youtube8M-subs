00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
types and what they might be used for so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.400 
types and what they might be used for so
just<00:00:26.760> kind<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.060> want<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.240> shared<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.720> little<00:00:28.019> of

just kind of want to shared a little of
what<00:00:28.769> I've<00:00:28.920> been<00:00:29.070> learning<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:30.230> and

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
what I've been learning with that and

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.770 
what I've been learning with that and
specifically<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:33.270> different<00:00:33.570> kind<00:00:33.719> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
specifically with different kind of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.490 
specifically with different kind of
locks<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.380> because<00:00:35.210> I<00:00:36.210> mean<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> didn't<00:00:37.380> really

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
locks and because I mean I didn't really

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.900 
locks and because I mean I didn't really
know<00:00:37.680> when<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.950> first<00:00:38.160> started<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.760> into

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
know when I first started going into

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610 
know when I first started going into
more<00:00:39.180> tactical<00:00:39.629> type<00:00:39.809> stuff<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.200> didn't<00:00:40.440> really

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
more tactical type stuff I didn't really

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.950 
more tactical type stuff I didn't really
know<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.129> there<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:41.910> different<00:00:42.660> types<00:00:42.809> of

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
know that there was different types of

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.770 
know that there was different types of
blocks<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.340> blades<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.850> now<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.600> he

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
blocks for the blades but now that he

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.850 
blocks for the blades but now that he
kind<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> explained<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> me<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.649> makes<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
kind of explained it to me it makes a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.560 
kind of explained it to me it makes a
lot<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> sense<00:00:47.280> why<00:00:48.180> there<00:00:48.390> would<00:00:48.539> be

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
lot of sense why there would be

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.209 
lot of sense why there would be
different<00:00:49.020> kinds<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:50.690> first<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.920> baby

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
different kinds so first up is this baby

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
different kinds so first up is this baby
and<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.539> has<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:56.780> frame<00:00:57.780> lock<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.260> there<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> it's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and it has a frame lock on there so it's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.920 
and it has a frame lock on there so it's
actually<00:01:00.680> part<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> frame<00:01:02.539> comes<00:01:03.539> over

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
actually part of the frame comes over

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.719 
actually part of the frame comes over
and<00:01:04.170> that's<00:01:04.350> what<00:01:04.680> stops<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.339> blade<00:01:05.489> from

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and that's what stops the blade from

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.490 
and that's what stops the blade from
going<00:01:06.060> down<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.600> hands<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.110> when<00:01:07.260> you're

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
going down on your hands so when you're

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.490 
going down on your hands so when you're
you<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.950> doing<00:01:07.979> your<00:01:08.340> work<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.909> not

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
you know doing your work it's not

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.440 
you know doing your work it's not
closing<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:10.979> fingers<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.939> when<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
closing in on your fingers so when you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.649 
closing in on your fingers so when you
want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.720> put<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.320> back<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.970> move<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.240> frame

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
want to put it back you move that frame

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.800 
want to put it back you move that frame
part<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> frame<00:01:16.350> over<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.159> close<00:01:17.340> that

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
part of the frame over and close that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.980 
part of the frame over and close that
time<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.930> that's<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.000> then<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:21.420> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
time so that's one and then this one is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.450 
time so that's one and then this one is
the<00:01:22.409> liner<00:01:22.890> lock<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:25.140> actually<00:01:25.470> has<00:01:25.710> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the liner lock and that actually has you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.630 
the liner lock and that actually has you
can<00:01:26.610> see<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.030> right<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:28.369> actually<00:01:29.369> like

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
can see that right here I actually like

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.679 
can see that right here I actually like
this<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:29.820> Kershaw<00:01:30.450> leak<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:32.509> this<00:01:33.509> one

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
this one Kershaw leak and this one

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.870 
this one Kershaw leak and this one
actually<00:01:33.810> has<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.350> kind<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.009> very<00:01:35.159> thin<00:01:35.520> liner

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
actually has a kind of very thin liner

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420 
actually has a kind of very thin liner
that<00:01:36.240> goes<00:01:36.689> over<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.740> obstructs<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
that goes over and that obstructs the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.090 
that goes over and that obstructs the
blade<00:01:38.700> from<00:01:38.939> coming<00:01:39.240> down<00:01:39.500> if<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.829> notice

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
blade from coming down if you notice

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.819 
blade from coming down if you notice
that<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.549> pretty<00:01:42.390> thin<00:01:42.780> liner<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.470> not

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that it is pretty thin liner it's not

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.270 
that it is pretty thin liner it's not
for<00:01:44.520> very<00:01:44.970> heavy-duty<00:01:45.270> jobs<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.860> keep

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
for very heavy-duty jobs so just keep

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.740 
for very heavy-duty jobs so just keep
that<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.549> mind<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.090> can't<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:48.509> saw

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
that in mind you can't really saw

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.710 
that in mind you can't really saw
through<00:01:49.020> anything<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:50.720> simply

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
through anything with it and then simply

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.389 
through anything with it and then simply
move<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> liner<00:01:52.200> over<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:52.950> that's<00:01:53.250> how

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
move the liner over and then that's how

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.899 
move the liner over and then that's how
that<00:01:53.460> closes<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.350> back<00:01:58.350> lock<00:01:58.909> one

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that closes so this is the back lock one

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.929 
that closes so this is the back lock one
it's<00:02:00.119> actually<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> Spyderco<00:02:01.380> which<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.520> love

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
it's actually a Spyderco which I love

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.490 
it's actually a Spyderco which I love
the<00:02:03.060> look<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.360> spider<00:02:03.630> coast<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.380> know

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the look of spider coast but you know

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.370 
the look of spider coast but you know
the<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:06.149> little<00:02:06.299> thumb<00:02:06.570> hole<00:02:06.780> I've<00:02:07.170> been

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the the little thumb hole I've been

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.809 
the the little thumb hole I've been
having<00:02:07.619> issues<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:08.580> want<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
having issues with it I really want to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.089 
having issues with it I really want to
look<00:02:08.970> cool<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.440> whip<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.009> out

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
look cool and like just like whip it out

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.730 
look cool and like just like whip it out
but

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
but

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.050 
but
it<00:02:12.890> doesn't<00:02:13.310> really<00:02:13.400> work<00:02:13.520> out<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:13.910> way<00:02:14.000> so

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
it doesn't really work out that way so

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.410 
it doesn't really work out that way so
I'm<00:02:14.450> still<00:02:14.780> kind<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.200> learning<00:02:15.500> with<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.740> one

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
I'm still kind of learning with that one

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.420 
I'm still kind of learning with that one
but<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.810> back<00:02:18.140> lock<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:22.010> lock<00:02:22.250> is

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
but this is a back lock and that lock is

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.370 
but this is a back lock and that lock is
what<00:02:22.610> prevents<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.540> blade<00:02:23.750> from<00:02:23.900> going<00:02:24.230> down

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
what prevents the blade from going down

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.730 
what prevents the blade from going down
so<00:02:25.310> when<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:25.520> want<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.700> put<00:02:25.850> it<00:02:25.940> away<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:27.500> push

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
so when you want to put it away you push

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.140 
so when you want to put it away you push
down<00:02:27.770> on<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:29.120> voila

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
down on that and voila

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.600 
down on that and voila
and<00:02:32.150> next<00:02:32.570> up<00:02:32.660> we<00:02:32.780> got<00:02:33.310> axis<00:02:34.310> lock<00:02:36.280> pitch<00:02:37.280> you

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
and next up we got axis lock pitch you

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.600 
and next up we got axis lock pitch you
can<00:02:37.730> see<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.390> has<00:02:38.860> little<00:02:39.860> ball<00:02:40.130> bearings

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
can see that it has little ball bearings

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.860 
can see that it has little ball bearings
in<00:02:40.850> there<00:02:41.210> and<00:02:41.510> that's<00:02:42.260> what<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.650> move<00:02:42.890> to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
in there and that's what you move to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.340 
in there and that's what you move to
close<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.080> knife<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.330> then<00:02:47.990> you<00:02:48.110> can<00:02:48.260> move

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
close the knife so and then you can move

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.200 
close the knife so and then you can move
them<00:02:48.500> from<00:02:48.620> either<00:02:48.770> side<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:49.130> if<00:02:49.790> you're

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
them from either side so if you're

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.440 
them from either side so if you're
left-handed<00:02:51.080> right-handed<00:02:52.060> that's<00:02:53.060> how<00:02:53.240> that

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
left-handed right-handed that's how that

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.840 
left-handed right-handed that's how that
looks<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.760> close<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.700> then<00:02:59.360> this<00:03:00.140> one

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
looks so close that and then this one

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.310 
looks so close that and then this one
Swiss<00:03:01.850> Army<00:03:02.060> like<00:03:02.210> knife<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.870> actually

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
Swiss Army like knife it actually

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.820 
Swiss Army like knife it actually
doesn't<00:03:03.560> have<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.580> lock<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:06.200> particular<00:03:06.620> one

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
doesn't have a lock this particular one

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.710 
doesn't have a lock this particular one
and<00:03:08.050> that<00:03:09.050> is<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.380> slip<00:03:10.010> joint<00:03:10.330> what<00:03:11.330> they<00:03:11.480> call

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
and that is a slip joint what they call

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.210 
and that is a slip joint what they call
and<00:03:12.140> so<00:03:12.860> when<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.070> open<00:03:13.100> this<00:03:14.830> there<00:03:15.830> there's

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
and so when you open this there there's

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.280 
and so when you open this there there's
a<00:03:16.280> little<00:03:16.610> resistance<00:03:17.150> when<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.660> push<00:03:18.260> it

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
a little resistance when you push it

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.230 
a little resistance when you push it
down<00:03:18.440> but<00:03:19.070> there's<00:03:19.340> nothing<00:03:19.670> no<00:03:19.820> lock<00:03:20.060> or

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
down but there's nothing no lock or

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.020 
down but there's nothing no lock or
anything<00:03:20.450> stopping<00:03:21.110> that<00:03:21.610> from<00:03:22.610> going<00:03:22.880> down

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
anything stopping that from going down

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.780 
anything stopping that from going down
so<00:03:23.330> obviously<00:03:23.660> it's<00:03:24.170> not<00:03:24.290> for<00:03:24.920> really

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
so obviously it's not for really

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.210 
so obviously it's not for really
heavy-duty<00:03:26.150> jobs<00:03:26.480> it's<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.440> nice<00:03:27.800> little<00:03:28.100> thing

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
heavy-duty jobs it's a nice little thing

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.890 
heavy-duty jobs it's a nice little thing
to<00:03:28.310> have<00:03:28.430> nice<00:03:28.640> little<00:03:28.880> pocket<00:03:28.970> knife<00:03:29.150> but<00:03:29.540> if

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
to have nice little pocket knife but if

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.760 
to have nice little pocket knife but if
you're<00:03:30.590> looking<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.520> get<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.670> little<00:03:31.910> more<00:03:32.770> use

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
you're looking to get a little more use

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.880 
you're looking to get a little more use
out<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.340> little<00:03:34.790> more<00:03:35.180> dirty<00:03:35.780> work<00:03:36.080> not

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
out of it a little more dirty work not

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.200 
out of it a little more dirty work not
killing<00:03:37.160> anybody<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:37.790> know<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:38.090> know

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
killing anybody but you know you know

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.110 
killing anybody but you know you know
hearts<00:03:39.080> tough<00:03:39.320> man<00:03:39.530> work<00:03:39.740> probably<00:03:40.610> not<00:03:40.970> the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
hearts tough man work probably not the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.270 
hearts tough man work probably not the
best<00:03:41.150> thing<00:03:41.510> for<00:03:41.860> you

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
best thing for you

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.180 
best thing for you
so<00:03:43.600> though<00:03:44.600> they<00:03:44.720> are<00:03:44.840> very<00:03:45.170> helpful<00:03:45.440> like<00:03:45.800> I<00:03:45.980> I

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
so though they are very helpful like I I

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.700 
so though they are very helpful like I I
like<00:03:46.460> them<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.790> have<00:03:46.970> one<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.150> my<00:03:47.240> own<00:03:47.330> some<00:03:47.710> and

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
like them I have one of my own some and

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.500 
like them I have one of my own some and
then<00:03:48.830> we<00:03:48.950> have<00:03:49.160> obviously<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.120> fixed<00:03:50.420> blade

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
then we have obviously the fixed blade

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.160 
then we have obviously the fixed blade
which<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:53.120> can't<00:03:53.330> put<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.600> away

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
which you can't put it away

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.520 
which you can't put it away
that's<00:03:54.860> why<00:03:54.980> they<00:03:55.100> have<00:03:55.250> sheets<00:03:56.200> but<00:03:57.200> this<00:03:57.380> is

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
that's why they have sheets but this is

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.340 
that's why they have sheets but this is
definitely<00:03:57.890> for<00:03:58.220> more<00:03:58.460> heavy-duty<00:03:59.000> work<00:03:59.660> it

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
definitely for more heavy-duty work it

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.200 
definitely for more heavy-duty work it
doesn't<00:04:00.680> do<00:04:00.800> you<00:04:01.130> know<00:04:01.220> it<00:04:01.340> doesn't<00:04:01.640> doesn't

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
doesn't do you know it doesn't doesn't

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.270 
doesn't do you know it doesn't doesn't
fold<00:04:02.480> it's<00:04:02.660> not<00:04:02.810> when<00:04:02.990> you<00:04:03.020> use<00:04:03.770> it<00:04:03.980> it's<00:04:04.130> not

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
fold it's not when you use it it's not

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.160 
fold it's not when you use it it's not
going<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.520> come<00:04:04.730> back<00:04:05.240> on<00:04:05.510> your<00:04:05.570> fingers<00:04:06.140> and

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
going to come back on your fingers and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.810 
going to come back on your fingers and
slice<00:04:06.650> them<00:04:06.800> all<00:04:06.920> off<00:04:07.100> so<00:04:07.730> that's<00:04:07.910> helpful<00:04:08.380> so

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
slice them all off so that's helpful so

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.300 
slice them all off so that's helpful so
so<00:04:10.820> it's<00:04:10.970> really<00:04:11.270> crucial<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.900> kind<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.440> think

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
so it's really crucial to kind of think

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.890 
so it's really crucial to kind of think
about<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.640> work<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:13.820> you<00:04:14.090> are<00:04:14.300> planning<00:04:14.810> on

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
about the work that you are planning on

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.580 
about the work that you are planning on
doing<00:04:14.930> with<00:04:15.320> your<00:04:15.440> knife<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:17.260> then<00:04:18.260> from

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
doing with your knife and then from

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.520 
doing with your knife and then from
there<00:04:18.859> figure<00:04:19.190> out<00:04:19.340> what<00:04:19.989> what<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.020> locking

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
there figure out what what a locking
