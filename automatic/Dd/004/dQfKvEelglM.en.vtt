00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
check these out i think there is well

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.740 
check these out i think there is well
let's<00:01:32.880> count<00:01:33.180> them<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.659> got<00:01:38.180> 14<00:01:39.180> engines

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
let's count them out I got 14 engines

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.740 
let's count them out I got 14 engines
out<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.560> there<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.150> some<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.270> these<00:01:42.329> engines

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
out of there and some of these engines

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.420 
out of there and some of these engines
go<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.409> ten<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.710> twenty<00:01:44.130> dollars<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
go for like ten to twenty dollars a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.190 
go for like ten to twenty dollars a
piece<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.500> I'm<00:01:46.500> guessing<00:01:47.090> low<00:01:48.090> ball<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.720> can

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
piece so I'm guessing low ball I can

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
piece so I'm guessing low ball I can
probably<00:01:49.520> lat<00:01:50.520> these<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> hundred

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
probably lat these up for a hundred

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.560 
probably lat these up for a hundred
bucks<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.079> sell<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.560> pretty<00:01:52.950> quick<00:01:53.570> maybe

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
bucks and sell it pretty quick maybe

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.520 
bucks and sell it pretty quick maybe
even<00:01:55.100> 150<00:01:56.360> but<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.659> sold<00:01:57.899> them<00:01:58.020> separately<00:01:58.500> i

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
even 150 but if I sold them separately i

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.139 
even 150 but if I sold them separately i
could<00:01:58.770> probably<00:01:58.920> get<00:01:59.070> up<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.340> 200<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.030> these

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
could probably get up to 200 for these

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.630 
could probably get up to 200 for these
guys<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.780> i<00:02:00.960> don't<00:02:01.200> know<00:02:01.259> i<00:02:01.560> want<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.340> spend
