anyway the oil pickup tube now if you're

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.119 
anyway the oil pickup tube now if you're
familiar<00:00:59.090> with<00:00:59.450> Subarus<00:01:00.110> you<00:01:00.500> know<00:01:00.800> how

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
familiar with Subarus you know how

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.059 
familiar with Subarus you know how
critical<00:01:01.969> this<00:01:02.390> component<00:01:02.960> can<00:01:03.079> be<00:01:03.110> or<00:01:03.590> is

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:04.069 
critical this component can be or is

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.849 
critical this component can be or is
because<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.969> factory<00:01:05.389> oil<00:01:05.630> pickup<00:01:05.810> tubes<00:01:06.229> are

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:06.859 
because the factory oil pickup tubes are

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.239 
because the factory oil pickup tubes are
notorious<00:01:07.729> for<00:01:07.759> cracking<00:01:08.509> right<00:01:08.959> here<00:01:09.679> all

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
notorious for cracking right here all

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.279 
notorious for cracking right here all
right<00:01:10.280> around<00:01:10.579> there<00:01:10.939> anyway<00:01:11.719> what<00:01:11.929> happens

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
right around there anyway what happens

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.620 
right around there anyway what happens
is<00:01:12.439> when<00:01:12.590> they<00:01:12.740> crack<00:01:13.159> you<00:01:13.789> start<00:01:14.090> sucking<00:01:14.509> up

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
is when they crack you start sucking up

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.379 
is when they crack you start sucking up
air<00:01:14.869> well<00:01:15.380> engines<00:01:16.009> don't<00:01:16.310> run<00:01:16.549> very<00:01:16.880> well<00:01:16.969> on

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:17.389 
air well engines don't run very well on

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:18.910 
air well engines don't run very well on
air<00:01:17.719> but<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.229> shouldn't<00:01:18.529> say<00:01:18.649> that<00:01:18.770> they

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
air but I shouldn't say that they

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.249 
air but I shouldn't say that they
actually<00:01:19.100> do<00:01:19.340> run<00:01:19.579> on<00:01:19.609> air<00:01:19.880> but<00:01:20.209> they<00:01:20.659> they

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
actually do run on air but they they

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.709 
actually do run on air but they they
don't<00:01:21.409> get<00:01:21.679> very<00:01:21.889> good<00:01:22.310> lubrication<00:01:22.969> from<00:01:23.479> air

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
don't get very good lubrication from air

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.620 
don't get very good lubrication from air
and<00:01:23.959> so<00:01:24.709> you<00:01:24.770> spin<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.549> bearing<00:01:25.909> you<00:01:26.240> destroy

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
and so you spin a bearing you destroy

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.480 
and so you spin a bearing you destroy
the<00:01:26.749> motor<00:01:26.929> and<00:01:27.200> it's<00:01:27.590> all<00:01:27.859> said<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.159> done<00:01:28.219> all
