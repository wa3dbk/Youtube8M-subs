00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.930 

ok<00:00:05.040> this<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.940> crude<00:00:06.480> model<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.140> fuel<00:00:07.470> cell

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
ok this is a crude model of a fuel cell

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.530 
ok this is a crude model of a fuel cell
you<00:00:08.940> these<00:00:09.840> are<00:00:10.050> three<00:00:10.889> steel<00:00:11.340> plates<00:00:11.670> here

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
you these are three steel plates here

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.079 
you these are three steel plates here
here<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.019> here<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.469> they're<00:00:14.219> separated<00:00:14.880> by

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
here and here and they're separated by

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.390 
here and here and they're separated by
electrical<00:00:15.809> tape<00:00:15.990> because<00:00:16.199> if<00:00:16.560> they<00:00:17.190> touch

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
electrical tape because if they touch

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.220 
electrical tape because if they touch
the<00:00:17.789> fuel<00:00:18.180> cell<00:00:18.390> won't<00:00:18.690> work<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.140> bubble<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
the fuel cell won't work and bubble and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.710 
the fuel cell won't work and bubble and
and<00:00:22.939> these<00:00:23.939> two<00:00:24.930> screws<00:00:25.439> right<00:00:25.769> here<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.730> here

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and these two screws right here and here

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.599 
and these two screws right here and here
are<00:00:27.900> like<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.230> electrodes<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.070> fuel<00:00:29.400> cell

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
are like the electrodes in the fuel cell

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.819 
are like the electrodes in the fuel cell
and<00:00:30.890> this<00:00:31.890> tube<00:00:32.189> right<00:00:32.489> here<00:00:32.930> goes<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.649> this

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
and this tube right here goes to this

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.639 
and this tube right here goes to this
cup<00:00:35.160> which<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.630> bubbler<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> that's

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
cup which is the bubbler and that's

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.069 
cup which is the bubbler and that's
where<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.010> bubbles<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.520> which<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.750> bubbles

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
where the bubbles go which the bubbles

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.660 
where the bubbles go which the bubbles
are<00:00:40.200> kind<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.860> energy<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.430> fuel

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
are kind of like the energy in the fuel

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.920 
are kind of like the energy in the fuel
cell<00:00:42.320> push<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.530> tempo<00:00:44.360> push<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.570> tempo<00:00:45.750> tempo

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
cell push the tempo push the tempo tempo

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.549 
cell push the tempo push the tempo tempo
ok<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.100> fuel<00:00:50.760> cell<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.440> screwed<00:00:52.440> on

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
ok so this is the fuel cell I screwed on

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.750 
ok so this is the fuel cell I screwed on
the<00:00:52.710> lid<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.190> connected<00:00:54.050> these<00:00:55.050> two

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
the lid and I connected these two

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.110 
the lid and I connected these two
electrodes<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.690> batteries<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
electrodes to the batteries and the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.529 
electrodes to the batteries and the
steel<00:01:00.120> plates<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:00.780> are<00:01:01.050> bubbling<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.539> that's

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
steel plates now are bubbling and that's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.450 
steel plates now are bubbling and that's
kind<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> energy<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> bubbles

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
kind of like the energy and the bubbles

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.050 
kind of like the energy and the bubbles
will<00:01:06.140> go<00:01:07.140> through<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> pipe<00:01:07.799> into<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
will go through the pipe into the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.960 
will go through the pipe into the
bubbler<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.130> those<00:01:11.130> are<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> bubbles<00:01:11.610> right

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
bubbler and those are the bubbles right

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.420 
bubbler and those are the bubbles right
there<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> these<00:01:13.140> bubbles<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
there and these bubbles are like the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.690 
there and these bubbles are like the
energy<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> fuel<00:01:15.330> cell<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.930> if<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
energy in the fuel cell and if and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.370 
energy in the fuel cell and if and
basically<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> fuel<00:01:21.689> cell<00:01:21.869> does<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
basically if what a fuel cell does is it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.330 
basically if what a fuel cell does is it
used<00:01:22.950> obviously<00:01:23.549> has<00:01:23.759> much<00:01:24.090> more<00:01:24.119> power<00:01:24.740> in<00:01:25.740> it

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
used obviously has much more power in it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
used obviously has much more power in it
but<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.409> pop<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.310> bubbles<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.119> see

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
but if you pop the bubbles you can see

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.679 
but if you pop the bubbles you can see
that<00:01:30.600> there's<00:01:31.380> energy<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.820> that's

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
that there's energy in them and that's

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:58.100 
that there's energy in them and that's
basically<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> fuel<00:01:34.829> cell<00:01:35.040> does

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.170
