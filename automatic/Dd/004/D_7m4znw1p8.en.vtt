00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello today is a very special day 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.319
 today's one premiere today 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.510
 comes the very first hairstyle video of 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.280
 me since i do youtube i have 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.840
 something never shot but that too 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.969
 that's why I think so about 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.590
 Two months hardly ever mine 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.240
 I always had hair care 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.910
 either worn open or to one 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.740
 Dutt and then that began 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.570
 fever phase and since then I can not 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.890
 stop touching my hair and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.199
 to weave over 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.359
 and I myself as a beginner 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 I would call today 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.340
 video with four hairstyles the incredible 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.350
 simply are suitable for beginners 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.820
 and very fast go in any case for 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.290
 People who are a bit hairdressing 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.090
 inexperienced are just like me 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.739
 myself too and I would say that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.940
 Get started right away with the first hairstyle 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.190
 and that's the one I'm here right now 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.379
 moment the acer hairstyle 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.180
 I wish you much fun with the video 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.770
 I pull first scheitl the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.960
 is with me as usual a bit 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.969
 sideways and all other hair I would come 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.340
 me once on the other side about the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.320
 shoulder and then it starts already 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.049
 I take the idea of ​​the crest 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.330
 a small strand of the pond in two 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.830
 aspire and then I start to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.560
 I twirl that for once 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.320
 front strand over the back strand 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.270
 and then the back strand gets from 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.290
 Front again so a little something 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.939
 hair too 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.439
 So it goes on until under the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.869
 ears and that is actually the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.180
 the simplest method to directly on the head 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.439
 something badly similar to what it looks like 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.090
 to produce it 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.799
 that's a lot easier than going to one another 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.509
 now divide three strands and then 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.220
 really such an important weaving 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.600
 makes that but will end anyway 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.090
 look very pretty as if you had one 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.130
 unbelievably done and if 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.320
 not arrived at the ear down then 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.729
 I would like to continue then normally 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.649
 I just have all the remaining hair 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.810
 in a braid together and share that 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.460
 then in three equal strands and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.320
 then begin to braid as normal 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.119
 but I always bad under the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.700
 middle strand because it has it 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.630
 always the same rotation as on the head and 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.820
 that they just a bit 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.619
 more uniform before I think so 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.820
 rubber and I can do the strands 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.290
 to pull out a little bit further 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.049
 so that after a bit thicker 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.759
 Zoff looks like the head on the top 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.680
 I can do that very well 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.450
 that is a hairstyle that is very good anyway 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.830
 is suitable for the second third day 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.270
 after the hardware puts there you can 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.930
 that's a bit more 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.909
 volume 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.349
 cheat where really far on 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.939
 and then I just pull some 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.319
 Strähnen is out and that then 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.969
 all so a bit thicker and 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.590
 voluminous and that was it 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:26.700
 Already this is my parents on hairstyle 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.799
 I already had the next hairstyle 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.450
 shown in another video but briefly 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.459
 I thought a little bit today 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.230
 more precise and above all things because it is yes 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.569
 one of my favorite hairstyles currently 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.359
 are and I take away from me first 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.340
 crown a thicker strand that will 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.409
 later split that is why 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.180
 actually only look nice and so 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.739
 I cover a bit after that 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.760
 me something below this 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.799
 thick tear another tear and the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.569
 I then just like normal 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.030
 always plait a pigtail until completely 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.169
 below and then I fix that when 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.090
 you would like to do that again 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.859
 pull out a bit thicker 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.879
 but I leave that so I think so 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.829
 makes again this look quite 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.480
 especially from then I take the 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.730
 thick strands I'm in the beginning 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.069
 once separated and find out 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.169
 At the back of my head with 12 bobby 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.219
 pins depending on how it holds and that is 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.949
 I really like a hairstyle 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.810
 Wear it when I have it open 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.590
 but still wants the easy 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.479
 braids in it 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.139
 that 's a bit like something 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.139
 looks 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.340
 everyone comes at the next hairstyle 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.350
 Hair from the face therefore is the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.420
 really well suited for very hot 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.340
 summer days and I start first 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.100
 thus my normal side too 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.530
 pull and then the hair left behind 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.090
 and right as evenly as possible 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.709
 split and then over your shoulders 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.780
 I actually do exactly that 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.340
 the same as the first hairstyle and 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.920
 Although I first take a strand 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.470
 right on the approach and divide it into two 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.270
 halves and then be twirled again 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.920
 So the front is over the rear 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.280
 placed at the rear will be again 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.650
 Hair from the head and then 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.260
 placed over the back and so on 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.150
 continue until all hair is intertwined 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.370
 That should be the case when I am 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.440
 I arrived below the ear and 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.810
 there is the whole one with it 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.370
 hair elastic fixes the whole thing repeatedly 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.919
 I just on the other side 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.979
 pull back a bit and then again 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.870
 Twirl and with the lower hair always 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.450
 to take with me then if so 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.370
 I'm downstairs and all the hair 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.840
 then I can feel desperate 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.700
 I take the other strand again 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.560
 had already finished and 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.479
 the two then stand together in one 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.500
 Ponytail make the ponytail 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.720
 you can be a bit higher then 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.919
 start with that looks special 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.510
 and if you feel like you can go to the 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.700
 hair then but a little bit with 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.169
 make a curling iron or man 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.669
 make you there like I do now 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.729
 here and then you can still with a few 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.070
 h needles so that the work already clear 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.229
 sits and looks good at all and 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.880
 Front I do it always like so 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.770
 I get a few strands out too 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.150
 Opel thus also has a bit messi 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.789
 because it looks a bit more natural 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.350
 and not so strict and then it was 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.670
 that actually already with the third 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.170
 hairstyle 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.450
 the led hairstyle I find personally 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.800
 now the hardest of them all 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.900
 I wanted to show her anyway because 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.040
 I totally like to ask you the time 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.720
 I'm getting one again 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.340
 side vertex and all hair come 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.760
 then over the shoulder to the other 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.500
 page 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.500
 then I take the approach again 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.780
 divide a strand into 2 and this one 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.340
 not really quiet though 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.770
 if you can do it now 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.780
 a bit too happy but I will 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.100
 this time will be a discrete braid 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.740
 I always take plait 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.430
 from the outer half of a strand 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.250
 a much smaller strand and lay 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.170
 then below the strand then to 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.120
 the other side so it always a bit 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.710
 difficult to explain but if you know 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.500
 how a fishbone braid works 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.150
 then you are the speech then the same 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.950
 Of course, on the other side 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.400
 just from the edge of a thick 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.290
 streak a small take and then 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.220
 pull through underneath the other and 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.180
 here we go 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.250
 it's going to be a bit like that now 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.100
 complicated because I still take time 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.530
 hair with it from the head and one 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.200
 smaller strand and then another 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.730
 small strand of the two euros is 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.980
 really explain that bad 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.110
 you see it and then it always works 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.760
 So that's what I think 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.900
 at the moment very very difficult and me 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.730
 Do me a little bit too 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.010
 but it's hard to braid 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.810
 Exercise does the master and if I do 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.580
 here then below the ear 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.440
 then I want to take all 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.480
 Remaining hair together again and 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.820
 bad then quite normal in the future 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.310
 herringbone soft but beware that 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.720
 I continue below the strand 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.700
 braid like me on the top of the head 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.130
 have done so again this 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.350
 whirls on and on and not 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.390
 suddenly twisted and then to the end 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.130
 before I clean my hair gum 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.440
 grants you that kind of a bit more 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.850
 Strands out just when fish heads 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.650
 I think that's really pretty if that's the case 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.750
 looks a bit more voluminous and 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.640
 if you have to go out so much 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.040
 picture and even if I have the hair tie 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.510
 then fixed down then pull 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.100
 I again the remaining hair like that 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.240
 a bit high, I think that pushes too 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.680
 a little bit at least that 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.300
 lower part that always looks very much 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.950
 very pretty from the four 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.960
 hairstyles I find the easiest 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.210
 and with whom I am very personally 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.010
 I really enjoy decorating 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.540
 which hairstyle I liked the best 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.880
 and maybe a maximum of one or 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.380
 other 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.910
 imitate me there I would over 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.440
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.660
 a few get on twitter and 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.550
 instagram like to link me there and 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.500
 then I'll look at it for me 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.420
 really cool and if I left 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.740
 still my last two videos and us 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.740
 See you next time again
