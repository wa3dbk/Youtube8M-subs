 to make a headboard hello then everything 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.130
 first they do it to you 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.460
 a dive dimension sipa two boards 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.190
 with bars davis inglis had two 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.929
 kilos doe nails upholster a fabric 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.240
 of your choice to the right dimensions 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.890
 you see me I had no clans game 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.869
 here is how they will stand between 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.850
 they gorgeous and small 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.279
 barrettes and levis will allow him to 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.789
 secure everything so here are my 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.410
 bar 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.910
 we have to look at how to put them 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.189
 so upside down or upside down 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.700
 this is a place so there I make you 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.280
 the example I could lily aa sarsar 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.260
 turn kind but life on the bright side at 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.480
 his sister month which means that it's okay 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.390
 less embarrassed you have to take a good 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.590
 list obviously they do not exceed 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.129
 length of the board because we are going 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.500
 do that front and back obviously so 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.320
 you close you tighten well all the way 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.699
 then as I had no bis 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.829
 soesbee yes I'm not going much 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.510
 of tools so I used a 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.699
 hammer to support a little bit for 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.100
 push in a little screw and then screwdriver 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.460
 and you know what do you know what 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.170
 of elbow grease and yes I got 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.670
 does a huge hen doing that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.950
 that's wonderful 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.229
 I lasted 1h30 no I laugh one hour 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.900
 just to fix the bowels 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.909
 because you see three bars per 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.220
 front but there was also the cradle 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:29.100
 and by barrett there are six screws yes yes that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.570
 it's too civis what your including 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.490
 I had more palm of my hand like 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.689
 so you see here are the results at 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.450
 magnificent 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.159
 now we are preparing law you these 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.590
 gorgeous you work you find 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.170
 where I found in an online site that 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.170
 sells 12 which is supplies for the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.540
 sewing or upholstery you 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.950
 will not find at least merlin I have 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.229
 not found they did not have small 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.149
 rolls like these will cost nothing 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.310
 I think it was 9 euros per kilo 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.869
 or 7 euros per kilo you need 2 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.070
 I took 3 because I am 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.340
 greedy and I wanted to make 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.630
 little blows that I'll see so here's me 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.369
 I tell you to ask as you want 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.560
 I thought it sounded logical 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.270
 dispose of 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.959
 vertical because yes it knows of my 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.640
 height so we have it's beautiful 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.940
 it's all sweet and it's too 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.620
 funny 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.680
 good after you have stuffed animals everywhere 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.360
 but I do not care so I cut 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.099
 with a pair of scissors one so I 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.810
 exceeds a little bit ranged edge for 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.790
 can do the padded edge 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.180
 also for no costa platel shot of 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.540
 the page 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.310
 here you understand so here you go 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.280
 it was my first layer we will do 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.840
 a second 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.739
 you see it's better fishing 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.640
 owl 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.780
 I like very much I removed the 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.280
 scene where I was going to sleep 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.370
 in like a sick but it was 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.440
 nice she wanted confident so we 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.430
 cutting is deposited early there are more 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.630
 in magnificent so still a package 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.650
 excuse me just for fun 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.900
 oh yes there I am it's gone and 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.830
 honor I laugh the most part 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.920
 long was the boards 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.700
 obviously it's fun party in 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.049
 party that starts 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.660
 if you have a good board 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.440
 dimension its ends take your fabric to 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.760
 the right dimension 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.340
 you will see that the net a little bit 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.859
 too short so it does not matter then 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.049
 I make squares of 20 out of 20 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.590
 obviously everything depends on the dimension of 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.670
 your board 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.670
 how do you like hope the space 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.680
 between your nobility upholstery and a 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.319
 nail upholsterer that I have is everything 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.400
 just type in until 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.030
 when they cling to fear 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.470
 until the end 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.600
 so that's what gives this effect 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.069
 padded and so I made twenty 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.049
 centimeters above 22 cm below 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.780
 see what finally his side on the top 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.609
 to try to have a bit of a good 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.560
 grid then you will see in the 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.019
 late pictures that I have a little lag 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.000
 for two things and that's not it 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.530
 not because I do not know measured no 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.079
 no it's just because 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.959
 I had the bars that bothered me for 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.150
 put the nail so that's it but I you 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.680
 reassure me by putting my bed 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.350
 precisely at the height of the mattress so 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.080
 it does not serve yes 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.360
 awesome kid so I actually went 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.750
 it may be padded then for 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.670
 tell you the price of all that stuff 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.470
 boards my account and cost me 30 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.520
 euros 2 1 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.580
 so it's been 30 years of tissue cost me 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.000
 17 euros I think that's 47 euros 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.590
 the nails cost me 7 euros it's 5 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.320
 24 euros if I calculate well because 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.420
 it's head up in hand as has 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.120
 maybe lifted anything short the 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.040
 vigilantes cost me 4 euros you are more to 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.530
 how much I was it's 58 euros and 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:53.080
 louane cost me this quest 15 euros this 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:57.340
 which is super 68 +5 it's 73 euros 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.370
 73 for Belgians and Swiss 73 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.550
 euros and a lot of elbow grease for 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.410
 this magnificent captain head and so 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.170
 see I folded the fabric towards the end 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.970
 that I nailed to the board and 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.060
 now good I'm all alone no 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.830
 voice so voice bipedalism to the force of 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.660
 fine arts it does not look like that 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.530
 but I wanted on his heavy ah ah ah 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.780
 ah I got you 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.480
 so here it is I had to annoy 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.700
 the neighbors days the little revenge 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.710
 personal 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.620
 so here is my beautiful head of 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.480
 bed you see a little bit maybe the 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.000
 shift especially to the right to the left 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.000
 speaking I have no more mold
