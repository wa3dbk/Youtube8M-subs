components<00:00:18.510> are<00:00:18.600> mounted<00:00:18.779> 23<00:00:19.680> feet<00:00:19.949> forward

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
components are mounted 23 feet forward

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.000 
components are mounted 23 feet forward
of<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.880> rear<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.330> trailer<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.930> what<00:00:22.830> this

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
of the rear of the trailer and what this

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.490 
of the rear of the trailer and what this
does<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.180> air<00:00:24.390> travels<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.140> gathers

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
does is as the air travels it gathers

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.970 
does is as the air travels it gathers
the<00:00:25.680> air<00:00:25.890> up<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.760> compresses<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.619> puts<00:00:28.859> it

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the air up it compresses it and puts it

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.370 
the air up it compresses it and puts it
in<00:00:29.130> ground<00:00:29.400> effect<00:00:29.550> between<00:00:29.970> here<00:00:30.539> this

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
in ground effect between here this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.549 
in ground effect between here this
allows<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.099> air<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.369> be<00:00:33.210> compressed<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.050> it

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
allows the air to be compressed and it

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.610 
allows the air to be compressed and it
will<00:00:34.680> pick<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:35.040> speed<00:00:35.570> velocity<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.410> go

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
will pick up speed velocity and go

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.619 
will pick up speed velocity and go
underneath<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.219> undercarriage<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.000> clean

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
shape that has a bit like this as well

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.899 
shape that has a bit like this as well
as<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> same<00:01:04.170> places<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:05.309> gives<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
as the same places that gives the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.380 
as the same places that gives the
airflow<00:01:06.299> up<00:01:06.510> around<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.020> ICC<00:01:07.650> bumper<00:01:08.390> also

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
airflow up around the ICC bumper also

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.960 
airflow up around the ICC bumper also
helps<00:01:09.840> get<00:01:10.380> regather<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.159> air<00:01:11.340> air<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.880> like

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
helps get regather the air air just like

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
helps get regather the air air just like
water<00:01:12.390> as<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.840> gets<00:01:13.020> further<00:01:13.290> away<00:01:13.439> from<00:01:13.710> its

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
water as it gets further away from its

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.850 
water as it gets further away from its
choke<00:01:14.790> point<00:01:15.119> will<00:01:15.330> start<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.750> dissipate<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
choke point will start to dissipate and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.010 
choke point will start to dissipate and
fan<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.060> helps<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> regather

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
fan out so it helps going to regather

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
fan out so it helps going to regather
that<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.680> keep<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.070> high<00:01:20.310> pressure<00:01:20.670> area

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that and keep that high pressure area

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.380 
that and keep that high pressure area
low<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:22.439> remaining<00:01:23.430> part<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.850> drag<00:01:24.150> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
low the remaining part of the drag that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.240 
low the remaining part of the drag that
we're<00:01:24.570> trying<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.990> affect<00:01:25.409> while<00:01:26.040> we're

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
we're trying to affect while we're

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.950 
we're trying to affect while we're
cleaning<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.670> air<00:01:26.939> around<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> axles<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
cleaning up air around the axles and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
cleaning up air around the axles and
that<00:01:28.110> creates<00:01:28.439> track<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.310> back<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
that creates track the back of the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.899 
that creates track the back of the
trailer<00:01:30.150> has<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> big<00:01:30.750> base<00:01:31.430> dragon<00:01:32.430> texture

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
trailer has a big base dragon texture

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
trailer has a big base dragon texture
because<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.420> its<00:01:33.570> blood<00:01:33.840> surface<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.920> there's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
because of its blood surface so there's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.249 
because of its blood surface so there's
a<00:01:35.189> large<00:01:35.520> low-pressure<00:01:36.210> area<00:01:36.750> behind<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a large low-pressure area behind the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.620 
a large low-pressure area behind the
trailer<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.850> feel<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.360> when<00:01:39.540> you

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
trailer and we can feel that when you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.300 
trailer and we can feel that when you
pull<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:39.900> behind<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.650> these<00:01:40.740> trucks<00:01:41.100> and

pull up behind one of these trucks and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.510 
pull up behind one of these trucks and
we<00:01:41.369> still<00:01:41.579> actually<00:01:41.970> draw<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:44.310> do

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
we still actually draw you so what we do

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.690 
we still actually draw you so what we do
as<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.450> attempt<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.899> lower<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.590> low<00:01:47.369> pressure

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
as we attempt to lower that low pressure

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.660 
as we attempt to lower that low pressure
area<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.180> bring<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.479> closer<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> ground

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
area and bring it closer to the ground

this<00:01:53.049> these<00:01:54.049> are<00:01:54.200> size<00:01:54.439> varies<00:01:54.860> what<00:01:55.369> these<00:01:55.610> do

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
this these are size varies what these do

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.999 
this these are size varies what these do
is<00:01:55.880> they're<00:01:56.240> curve<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:57.560> they're<00:01:57.740> meant<00:01:57.950> to

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
is they're curve and they're meant to

component on the roof is our dynamic
rain<00:02:06.289> gutter<00:02:06.560> it's<00:02:07.039> a<00:02:07.130> very<00:02:07.340> similar<00:02:07.640> shape<00:02:08.060> to

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
rain gutter it's a very similar shape to

parachute and shrink it and make it

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.960 
parachute and shrink it and make it
smaller<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.739> bring<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.040> closer<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.670> ground

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970
