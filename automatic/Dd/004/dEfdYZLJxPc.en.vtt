00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.500 

either<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.500> beeping<00:01:10.160> with<00:01:10.430> a<00:01:10.460> faint<00:01:11.030> blue<00:01:11.210> light

either a beeping with a faint blue light
or<00:01:11.780> that<00:01:11.840> weird<00:01:12.650> popping<00:01:13.070> sound<00:01:13.370> from<00:01:14.120> the

back

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.330 

the<00:01:24.430> seven-second<00:01:25.090> hold<00:01:25.300> for<00:01:25.570> safe<00:01:26.100> safe<00:01:27.100> mode

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
the seven-second hold for safe safe mode

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.320 
the seven-second hold for safe safe mode
does<00:01:27.580> not<00:01:27.610> work<00:01:27.910> either

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
does not work either

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.270 
does not work either
as<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:29.140> system<00:01:29.470> doesn't<00:01:29.650> get<00:01:29.860> past<00:01:30.070> that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
as the system doesn't get past that

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.740 
as the system doesn't get past that
initial<00:01:30.430> one<00:01:30.850> second<00:01:31.330> I<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:32.740> just<00:01:32.890> sit<00:01:33.070> here

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.880 

again<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:37.960> weird<00:01:38.140> noise<00:01:38.320> from<00:01:38.620> the<00:01:38.710> back

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
again that weird noise from the back

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.750 
again that weird noise from the back
sounds<00:01:39.400> like<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.520> hardware<00:01:39.940> issue<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.430> there's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
sounds like a hardware issue and there's

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.010 
sounds like a hardware issue and there's
still<00:01:43.120> no<00:01:43.390> signal

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
still no signal

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.440 
still no signal
and<00:01:44.860> almost<00:01:45.160> spits<00:01:45.490> one<00:01:45.670> out<00:01:45.820> momentarily

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
and almost spits one out momentarily

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.160 
and almost spits one out momentarily
when<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:49.180> blue<00:01:49.360> light<00:01:49.600> comes<00:01:49.930> on<00:01:50.110> and

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
when it and that blue light comes on and

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.690 
when it and that blue light comes on and
that's<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.500> said<00:01:53.680> it's<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.250> month<00:01:54.460> old

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.380 
that's it like I said it's a month old
system<00:01:55.120> I<00:01:55.330> had<00:01:55.660> no<00:01:55.810> previous<00:01:56.170> issues<00:01:56.650> with<00:01:56.860> it

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
system I had no previous issues with it

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.790 
system I had no previous issues with it
same<00:01:58.390> issue<00:01:58.570> with<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.900> controller<00:01:59.290> if<00:01:59.530> I<00:01:59.620> try

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
same issue with the controller if I try

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.010 
same issue with the controller if I try
to<00:01:59.830> turn<00:02:00.130> it<00:02:00.250> on<00:02:03.540> sometimes<00:02:04.540> that<00:02:04.840> happens

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
to turn it on sometimes that happens

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.600 
to turn it on sometimes that happens
sometimes<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.710> won't<00:02:05.800> even<00:02:05.979> connect<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.490> the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
sometimes it won't even connect to the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.340 
sometimes it won't even connect to the
system<00:02:06.940> at<00:02:07.240> all<00:02:07.300> little<00:02:07.960> surprise<00:02:08.320> that

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
system at all little surprise that

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.280 
system at all little surprise that
happened<00:02:08.920> then<00:02:09.010> the<00:02:09.100> controller<00:02:09.429> remains<00:02:09.850> on

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
happened then the controller remains on

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.860 
happened then the controller remains on
even<00:02:11.290> though<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.470> system<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.920> off<00:02:12.630> as<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.750> can

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
even though the system is off as you can

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.460 
even though the system is off as you can
see<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> controllers<00:02:14.650> on<00:02:14.860> system<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:16.470> so

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
see the controllers on system is that so

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.530 
see the controllers on system is that so
