00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.630
 how much 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.190
 hello to all ages to be known and well me anyway 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.480
 very good on 100 m so today a new video not a guigne 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.220
 commented is not a new nba tutorial to their citizens has consisted of a 

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:21.740
 technical 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.069
 karam 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:24.169
 know how 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.759
 it's really a 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.699
 dubai technique to bab bu when you play 40 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.390
 it's the blur the navy on three barak 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.510
 technical it consists is a little my delay these rock techniques 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.610
 you're actually basing yourself on full marine three-bar early 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.910
 in the game 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.490
 laughter after shopping sinaï sinaï continued until your 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.390
 opponent 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.470
 good you know that philippe this technocrat 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.810
 % and love you are really in shit what are you doing 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.289
 so that's a bit of the title from where the moment 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.039
 donkalor 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.220
 d some if you build vcs 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.940
 you're going to do so right now when these play-offs percent to 10 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.670
 on another rank 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.580
 then you go directly 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.730
 2 a barracks here 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.290
 I will tell you the rest of the story after that, but all the points of view 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.470
 barracks 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.720
 you build more for 100 euros sas with the last message before in 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.880
 do you stop population cardiac build more accuracy 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.000
 then you will take 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.370
 by your orbital station and you will not take our gauze duo 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.100
 it's really very important 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.409
 no war not hurt his orbital station 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.590
 so the sickness I made for 100 th while waiting any case the barracks 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.799
 finish I explained to you 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.350
 for these techniques 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.040
 not really enviable that counts the protoss practically account the accesses 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.630
 more difficult 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.950
 on the other hand togo you must carved 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.820
 you see who served the classics 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.890
 % then you come out there naturally on the meaning of 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.810
 command and see her 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.900
 he is no longer a 16 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.830
 how can we see this is because let him care koninck a crumb 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.660
 when for others and left so if you could only rent that we see that the state 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.980
 no longer builds defeats 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.479
 so the life builder the ccp not take these gases 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.210
 he does not take his orbital station there you have to wonder yourself about life 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.590
 typical immediately what is doing its best so you judge 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.080
 go around around vote d'ea could see 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.089
 you need to know if euro was better in fact 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.939
 if you are lucky to go and look at these two barracks and so that's 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.429
 of baraka and consisting of party m 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.589
 right after this role booth build you go 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:26.369
 the 300 ore 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.849
 finally 150 more than 150 immediately built the two barracks 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.619
 why unveil your technique 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.619
 so it's a train three barracks and the repartee of that time 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.040
 for the country 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.620
 dumas a semi bunker 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.079
 kirsten prout to pump husband 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.610
 it's not very complicated 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.950
 and so seeing her teeth percent and even one will go but neither 40 of the game 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:49.419
 he replied I did it 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.789
 practically going to have four marines he said I'll have my fourth to 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:56.669
 risk but I'm going directly% allies on the basis of my opponent 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.669
 voice here and there I leave then I continue 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.530
 to feel the most matches possible with and then there to properly monitor 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.710
 his back because the pumps were moved 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.899
 surprised of these four units 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.359
 on the other hand unfortunately a c4 united there will die right away 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.729
 so this is the woman rail disappears so here I should have actually directly 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:17.399
 placed for 100 euros these two weapons other prima Estienne opponents 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.100
 directly on your opponents 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.790
 instead of doing on the units 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.559
 that you send 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:25.629
 so the sinal lamal enameling what she said with ueli maurer because 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:26.829
 of these two and the storm 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.819
 I understood very badly 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.550
 I already saw to raise 50% of their life 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.809
 so here I believe that our navy is coming 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:36.540
 4 5 does not have anything that happens 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.990
 so here I would not have attacked too much attacked in vain the voters 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.050
 french ae slap or not late she waits for me I'm still crying 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.139
 it's catherine to make believe 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.179
 the announced students who will punctuate 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:49.300
 and there I can practically kill them 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.459
 then the bomb to 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.299
 this is the stiffness the friendship nordea of 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.150
 this has just announced my mistake here is what I said about 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.690
 met 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.169
 so there j writers do nothing 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.559
 so here corn should have been there we are good they will not be long in arriving 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.209
 what then so there 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.369
 boutin Algeria could not say causes of the accident Islam so there I 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:08.619
 realize my mistake 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:10.609
 % and here I see all the troops 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.899
 so in the meantime I still made a superior to be able to support 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.409
 in e1 a maximum number of marine 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.199
 and there I closed orbital station surely because I 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.109
 I really have some resource 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.099
 but otherwise you do not do anything that does not produce gas no station 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.759
 orbital not his 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.009
 so there apart from that moment travels a ton of corn 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.370
 I understood that this more newsletters blow 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.979
 there is the protoss in the north 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.689
 nothing can do 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:39.769
 the Jews smoke enough of these riots in less than two at coffee this is 

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:40.430
 completed 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.439
 it's in the heart will fall 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.389
 and I will arrive directly in the base 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.629
 not my enemy in celebration 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:50.969
 that's it there is nothing more to eat these pylons for investors want 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:52.380
 kill very quickly 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.090
 meanwhile people believe more in a marine what happens 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.090
 so here it's really the end for trémoulinas attacking pylons 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.110
 can studies then lexus it ended 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.030
 why at my age did you understand everything if you have questions 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.120
 do not hesitate 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.659
 % aman ask or impose on everyone 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:10.520
 world on the video commentaries 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.780
 in any case see you soon for new ideas after
