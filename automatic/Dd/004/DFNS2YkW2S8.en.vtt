um<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.500> interesting<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.280> see

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
um it's just really interesting to see

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.830 
um it's just really interesting to see
how<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.789> trend<00:00:45.329> happened<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.660> break

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
how this trend happened so if we break

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.840 
how this trend happened so if we break
it<00:00:49.020> down<00:00:49.230> by<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.649> type<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.340> opioid<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.640> see

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
it down by the type of opioid so we see

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.670 
it down by the type of opioid so we see
methadone<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.719> orange<00:00:55.079> line<00:00:55.350> and

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
being prescribed way more often

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.210 
being prescribed way more often
unfortunately<00:02:21.629> it's<00:02:22.230> also<00:02:22.379> a<00:02:22.560> drug<00:02:22.980> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
unfortunately it's also a drug that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.800 
unfortunately it's also a drug that
lasts

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
lasts

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.720 
lasts
really<00:02:24.110> long<00:02:24.319> time<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.950> system<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.520> takes

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
really long time in the system and takes

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.600 
really long time in the system and takes
a<00:02:25.849> long<00:02:26.060> time<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.330> kick<00:02:26.720> in<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:28.040> people<00:02:28.489> may

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
a long time to kick in and so people may

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.400 
a long time to kick in and so people may
not<00:02:28.760> know<00:02:28.819> how<00:02:29.209> much<00:02:29.390> they're<00:02:29.660> taking<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.230> so

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
not know how much they're taking and so

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.180 
not know how much they're taking and so
one<00:02:30.860> of<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.250> theories<00:02:31.849> is<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.800> this<00:02:33.800> these

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
one of the theories is that this these

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.710 
one of the theories is that this these
properties<00:02:34.790> these<00:02:35.000> pharmaceutical

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
properties these pharmaceutical

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.170 
properties these pharmaceutical
properties<00:02:35.900> in<00:02:36.319> methadone<00:02:36.739> have<00:02:37.730> led<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.150> a

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
properties in methadone have led to a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.229 
properties in methadone have led to a
lot<00:02:38.420> more<00:02:38.630> deaths<00:02:39.519> but<00:02:40.519> as<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.730> can<00:02:40.880> see<00:02:41.090> it

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
lot more deaths but as you can see it

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.750 
lot more deaths but as you can see it
kind<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.569> applies<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.890> category<00:02:43.519> that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
kind of applies to the category that

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.790 
kind of applies to the category that
says<00:02:43.940> other<00:02:44.209> opioids<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.080> red<00:02:45.260> line<00:02:45.500> and

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
says other opioids the red line and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.820 
says other opioids the red line and
those<00:02:46.400> are<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.580> medications<00:02:47.360> like<00:02:47.840> vicodin

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
those are the medications like vicodin

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.800 
those are the medications like vicodin
and<00:02:49.190> percocet<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.380> darvocet<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:53.720> I'm

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
and percocet and darvocet that that I'm

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.030 
and percocet and darvocet that that I'm
sure<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.019> guys<00:02:54.290> have<00:02:54.349> heard<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:58.420> and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
sure you guys have heard of and

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.680 
sure you guys have heard of and
unfortunately<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.430> rise<00:03:02.030> in<00:03:02.060> deaths

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
unfortunately this rise in deaths

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.710 
unfortunately this rise in deaths
applied<00:03:03.260> across<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.160> board<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.850> most<00:03:05.150> adult

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
applied across the board to most adult

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.539 
applied across the board to most adult
age<00:03:05.930> groups<00:03:06.319> so<00:03:06.530> pretty<00:03:06.739> much<00:03:06.920> from<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.160> ages

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
age groups so pretty much from the ages

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.660 
age groups so pretty much from the ages
of<00:03:07.580> 15<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.150> 64<00:03:08.989> we<00:03:09.650> saw<00:03:09.860> an<00:03:09.980> increase<00:03:10.130> in<00:03:10.400> the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
of 15 to 64 we saw an increase in the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.520 
of 15 to 64 we saw an increase in the
number<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.000> deaths<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.260> it's<00:03:12.410> not

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
number of deaths and so it's not

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.020 
number of deaths and so it's not
something<00:03:12.890> that's<00:03:12.920> just<00:03:13.099> relegated<00:03:13.580> let's

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
something that's just relegated let's

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.680 
something that's just relegated let's
say<00:03:14.180> two<00:03:15.099> teenagers<00:03:16.099> or<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:17.209> really

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
say two teenagers or to the really

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.479 
say two teenagers or to the really
elderly<00:03:18.140> population<00:03:18.830> it's<00:03:19.040> pretty<00:03:19.340> much

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
elderly population it's pretty much

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.150 
elderly population it's pretty much
across<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.849> board
