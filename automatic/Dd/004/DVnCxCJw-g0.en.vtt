00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
me and just compared to the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.480 
me and just compared to the
version<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.740> know<00:02:14.860> some<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.250> stature

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
version you know some of the stature

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.220

other<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:18.100> me<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.280> don't<00:02:18.580> think<00:02:18.790> that's<00:02:18.970> going

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
other to me I don't think that's going

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.780 
other to me I don't think that's going
to<00:02:19.120> make<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.720> big<00:02:19.990> difference<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:21.130> he<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.730> a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
to make a big difference but he is a

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.070 
to make a big difference but he is a
really<00:02:22.090> good<00:02:22.180> card<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.810> should

really good card that you should

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.720 
really good card that you should
probably<00:02:23.470> look<00:02:23.560> into<00:02:23.710> getting<00:02:24.010> for<00:02:24.520> your

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
probably look into getting for your

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.220 
probably look into getting for your
writing<00:02:25.030> back<00:02:25.210> if<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.600> don't<00:02:25.750> already<00:02:25.900> have<00:02:26.110> a

58<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.330> little<00:02:52.450> guy<00:02:52.720> 98<00:02:53.590> speed<00:02:54.270> 89<00:02:55.270> of

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
58 just a little guy 98 speed 89 of

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.450 
58 just a little guy 98 speed 89 of
jelly<00:02:55.630> which<00:02:55.900> seems<00:02:56.200> pretty<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.980> know<00:02:57.010> I

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
jelly which seems pretty you know I

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.370 
jelly which seems pretty you know I
think<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.660> should<00:02:58.780> be<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.930> little<00:02:59.050> bit<00:02:59.230> higher

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
think that should be a little bit higher

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.000 
think that should be a little bit higher
because<00:02:59.620> he<00:02:59.890> plays<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.130> lot<00:03:00.460> better<00:03:00.760> than<00:03:01.060> that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
because he plays a lot better than that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.810 
because he plays a lot better than that
