00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.910 
them back together with a 3/4 inch
nipple<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.600> reason<00:01:40.900> I<00:01:40.990> did<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.260> is<00:01:41.470> now

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
nipple and the reason I did that is now

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.400 
nipple and the reason I did that is now
if<00:01:42.460> there's<00:01:42.729> any<00:01:42.880> dripping<00:01:43.270> or<00:01:43.630> water<00:01:43.960> coming

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
if there's any dripping or water coming

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.080 
if there's any dripping or water coming
back<00:01:44.590> through<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.979> line<00:01:45.190> then<00:01:45.850> it's<00:01:46.030> just

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
back through the line then it's just

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.450 
back through the line then it's just
going<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.360> be<00:01:46.830> encapsulated<00:01:47.830> in<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.040> system

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
going to be encapsulated in the system

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.510 
going to be encapsulated in the system
and<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:48.820> now<00:01:49.000> we<00:01:49.060> have<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.390> system<00:01:50.520> tied

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
and so now we have a system tied

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.460 
and so now we have a system tied
together<00:01:51.700> if<00:01:52.270> somebody<00:01:52.600> turns<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.960> water<00:01:53.140> on

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
together if somebody turns the water on

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.499 
together if somebody turns the water on
it's<00:01:53.680> actually<00:01:54.040> just<00:01:54.220> going<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.430> drain<00:01:55.240> back

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
it's actually just going to drain back

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.359 
it's actually just going to drain back
through<00:01:55.780> itself<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.950> lines<00:01:57.190> are

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
through itself and so the lines are

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.450 
through itself and so the lines are
disconnected<00:01:58.090> we've<00:01:58.479> taken<00:01:58.750> off<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.460> taking

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
disconnected we've taken off the taking

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.730 
disconnected we've taken off the taking
off<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.820> drain<00:02:01.090> line<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.750> is<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:02.590> a

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
temperature relief valve and so we want

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.290 
temperature relief valve and so we want

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
to make sure that that valve is not just

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.420 
to make sure that that valve is not just
sticking<00:02:23.110> out<00:02:23.350> somewhere<00:02:23.830> or<00:02:24.010> pointing

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
sticking out somewhere or pointing

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.680 
sticking out somewhere or pointing
towards<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.910> floor<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:25.330> want<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.570> actually

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
towards the floor we want to actually

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.120 
towards the floor we want to actually
make<00:02:25.900> sure<00:02:26.019> it's<00:02:26.320> draining<00:02:26.650> somewhere

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
make sure it's draining somewhere

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.280 
make sure it's draining somewhere
because<00:02:27.400> if<00:02:27.550> not<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:28.239> does<00:02:28.480> go<00:02:28.660> off<00:02:28.870> somebody's

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
because if not it does go off somebody's

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.750 
because if not it does go off somebody's
going<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.500> get<00:02:29.620> burned<00:02:29.890> we're<00:02:30.489> going<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.670> go

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
going to get burned we're going to go

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.039 
going to get burned we're going to go
over<00:02:30.790> just<00:02:31.090> for<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.269> minute<00:02:31.720> here<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:31.959> the

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
over just for a minute here in the

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
venting on the water heater because it's

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.590 
venting on the water heater because it's
pretty<00:02:33.610> important<00:02:34.060> especially<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.540> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
pretty important especially in the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.060 
pretty important especially in the
location<00:02:35.049> of<00:02:35.170> where<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.410> water<00:02:35.590> heater<00:02:35.799> is<00:02:35.890> at

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
location of where the water heater is at

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.610 
location of where the water heater is at
here<00:02:36.549> we're<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.850> garage<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:38.140> you're

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
here we're in the garage and so you're

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.140 
here we're in the garage and so you're
not<00:02:38.709> affecting<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.250> inside<00:02:39.640> air<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:40.030> the

car or anything that are combustible to
be<00:02:53.200> ignited<00:02:53.470> by<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.799> water<00:02:54.100> heater<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.489> so

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
be ignited by the water heater and so

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.610 
be ignited by the water heater and so
they<00:02:55.209> figure<00:02:55.480> if<00:02:55.570> it's<00:02:55.690> 18<00:02:55.959> inches<00:02:56.200> up<00:02:56.350> off<00:02:56.470> the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
they figure if it's 18 inches up off the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.770 
they figure if it's 18 inches up off the
floor<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:56.920> those<00:02:57.190> gases<00:02:57.670> settle<00:02:58.060> where<00:02:58.239> less

also the garage is well ventilated
typically<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.170> don't<00:03:05.350> have<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.500> silk<00:03:05.769> karachi

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
typically you don't have a silk karachi

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.470 
typically you don't have a silk karachi
or<00:03:06.310> we're<00:03:06.400> not<00:03:06.489> worried<00:03:06.730> about<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.150> carbon

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
or we're not worried about the carbon

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.539 
or we're not worried about the carbon
monoxide<00:03:08.049> issues<00:03:08.410> but<00:03:08.920> we<00:03:09.010> still<00:03:09.250> need<00:03:09.459> to

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
monoxide issues but we still need to

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.940 
monoxide issues but we still need to
vent<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.329> water<00:03:10.570> heater<00:03:10.870> up<00:03:11.079> but<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:11.590> do<00:03:11.739> that

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
vent the water heater up but we do that

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.550 
vent the water heater up but we do that
by<00:03:12.340> making<00:03:12.519> sure<00:03:12.850> we<00:03:13.000> have<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.180> metal<00:03:14.019> roof<00:03:14.230> jack

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
by making sure we have a metal roof jack

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.660 
by making sure we have a metal roof jack
and<00:03:14.799> as<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:15.579> can<00:03:15.700> see<00:03:15.760> we're<00:03:16.180> going

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
and as you can see we're going

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.220 
and as you can see we're going
to<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.790> piece<00:03:16.970> of<00:03:17.000> pipe<00:03:17.300> that's<00:03:17.599> actually<00:03:18.080> a

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
to a piece of pipe that's actually a

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.620 
to a piece of pipe that's actually a
piece<00:03:18.590> of<00:03:18.620> asbestos<00:03:18.920> pipe<00:03:19.580> there's<00:03:20.180> no<00:03:20.360> harm

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
piece of asbestos pipe there's no harm

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.479 
piece of asbestos pipe there's no harm
in<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.870> asbestos<00:03:21.020> because<00:03:21.709> it's<00:03:21.860> intact<00:03:22.220> and

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
in the asbestos because it's intact and

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.920 
in the asbestos because it's intact and
we're<00:03:22.580> not<00:03:22.700> tearing<00:03:23.060> into<00:03:23.330> it<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:23.630> it's<00:03:23.780> not

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
we're not tearing into it so it's not

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.170 
we're not tearing into it so it's not
it's<00:03:24.500> not<00:03:24.739> going<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.280> cause<00:03:25.430> anybody<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.030> have

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
it's not going to cause anybody to have

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.449 
it's not going to cause anybody to have
misophonia<00:03:26.480> or<00:03:27.470> whatever<00:03:27.800> so<00:03:28.099> we'd<00:03:28.250> have<00:03:28.370> to

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
misophonia or whatever so we'd have to

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.800 
misophonia or whatever so we'd have to
worry<00:03:28.640> about<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:29.090> no<00:03:29.330> it's<00:03:29.480> going<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:29.630> die

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
worry about that no it's going to die

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.110 
worry about that no it's going to die
today<00:03:30.160> but<00:03:31.160> we<00:03:31.250> do<00:03:31.400> need<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.610> make<00:03:31.760> sure<00:03:31.940> that

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
today but we do need to make sure that

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.440 
today but we do need to make sure that
it's<00:03:32.300> vented<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.819> one<00:03:34.819> thing<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.120> we<00:03:35.239> do

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
it's vented and so one thing that we do

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.420 
it's vented and so one thing that we do
is<00:03:35.660> make<00:03:36.140> sure<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.319> has<00:03:36.440> adequate<00:03:36.800> clearances

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
is make sure it has adequate clearances

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.100 
is make sure it has adequate clearances
and<00:03:37.819> we<00:03:37.910> make<00:03:38.090> sure<00:03:38.239> that<00:03:38.270> it's<00:03:38.540> sealed<00:03:38.870> in

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
and we make sure that it's sealed in

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.050 
and we make sure that it's sealed in
every<00:03:39.650> area<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.100> so<00:03:40.340> I've<00:03:40.489> already<00:03:40.730> taken<00:03:40.910> the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
every area and so I've already taken the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.420 
every area and so I've already taken the
screws<00:03:41.390> out<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.230> pipe<00:03:42.920> should<00:03:43.220> just

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
screws out and this pipe should just

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.210 
screws out and this pipe should just
slide<00:03:44.209> up<00:03:44.450> slightly<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.560> what<00:03:45.680> it<00:03:45.800> does<00:03:45.980> we're

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
slide up slightly and what it does we're

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.380 
slide up slightly and what it does we're
just<00:03:46.370> going<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.519> rest<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:47.000> over<00:03:47.239> here

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
just going to rest it over here

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.600 
just going to rest it over here
somewhere<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.050> it's<00:03:48.830> not<00:03:49.010> going<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.370> fall<00:03:49.550> down

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
somewhere so it's not going to fall down

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.120 
somewhere so it's not going to fall down
on<00:03:49.970> us<00:03:50.120> while<00:03:50.300> we're<00:03:50.450> working<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.890> it's<00:03:52.040> going

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
on us while we're working and it's going

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.250 
on us while we're working and it's going
to<00:03:52.190> just<00:03:52.430> kind<00:03:52.640> of<00:03:52.700> sit<00:03:52.880> there<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:53.510> now<00:03:53.930> we<00:03:53.989> can

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
to just kind of sit there and now we can

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.009 
to just kind of sit there and now we can
actually<00:03:54.410> remove<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:56.150> rest<00:03:56.330> of<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.569> vent<00:03:56.780> cap

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
actually remove the rest of the vent cap

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.600 
actually remove the rest of the vent cap
from<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.260> top<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.739> water<00:03:57.920> heater<00:03:58.190> and

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
from the top of the water heater and

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.949 
from the top of the water heater and
when<00:03:58.760> we<00:03:58.850> take<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.030> water<00:03:59.299> heater<00:03:59.569> off<00:03:59.780> it's

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
when we take the water heater off it's

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.030 
when we take the water heater off it's
not<00:04:00.080> going<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.319> be<00:04:00.380> in<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.560> way<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.799> anything

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
not going to be in the way of anything

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.009 
not going to be in the way of anything
and<00:04:01.400> so<00:04:01.880> we'll<00:04:02.090> be<00:04:02.209> back<00:04:02.390> again<00:04:02.540> in<00:04:02.720> a<00:04:02.870> minute

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
and so we'll be back again in a minute

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.979 
and so we'll be back again in a minute
with<00:04:03.230> just<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.620> couple<00:04:03.799> more<00:04:03.950> tips<00:04:04.630> in<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:05.720> couple

with just a couple more tips in a couple

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.090 
with just a couple more tips in a couple
of<00:04:06.049> minutes<00:04:06.290> we're<00:04:06.410> going<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.590> take<00:04:06.739> off<00:04:06.920> these

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
hot ball jets we're going to turn the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.740 
hot ball jets we're going to turn the
gas<00:04:12.290> off<00:04:12.560> which<00:04:12.769> is<00:04:12.890> already<00:04:13.130> off<00:04:13.420> gas<00:04:14.420> valve

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
gas off which is already off gas valve

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.289 
gas off which is already off gas valve
here<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:15.230> gas<00:04:15.860> valve<00:04:16.160> here<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:17.000> don't<00:04:17.180> want

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
here and gas valve here you don't want

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.569 
here and gas valve here you don't want
to<00:04:17.359> miss<00:04:17.510> that<00:04:17.750> you<00:04:18.739> don't<00:04:18.889> want<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:19.160> no<00:04:19.400> one

to miss that you don't want that no one

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.279 
to miss that you don't want that no one
can<00:04:19.669> water<00:04:19.940> you're<00:04:20.239> running<00:04:20.630> why<00:04:21.109> it's

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
can water you're running why it's

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.110 
can water you're running why it's
draining<00:04:21.829> because<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.520> will<00:04:22.610> just<00:04:22.729> be<00:04:22.850> heating

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
draining because it will just be heating

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.430 
draining because it will just be heating
up<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.360> tank<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:23.750> make<00:04:23.930> sure<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.110> turn<00:04:24.260> off
