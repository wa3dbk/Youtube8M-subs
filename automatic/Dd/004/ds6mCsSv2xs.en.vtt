step with the right leg we go step step
step<00:01:33.329> step<00:01:33.950> step<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.249> then<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.670> hold<00:01:36.240> two

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:36.749 
step step step and then you hold two

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:40.069 
step step step and then you hold two
three<00:01:37.200> four<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.979> go<00:01:38.310> around<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.479> again

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
three four and go around we do it again

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.399 
three four and go around we do it again
step<00:01:41.390> step<00:01:42.649> we<00:01:43.649> go<00:01:43.890> hold<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:45.090> go<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:45.749> two<00:01:45.990> three

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
step step we go hold we go one two three

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.940 
step step we go hold we go one two three
four<00:01:47.100> now<00:01:47.280> we<00:01:47.429> go<00:01:47.639> to<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.880> last<00:01:48.119> step<00:01:48.950> it's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
four now we go to the last step it's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.010 
four now we go to the last step it's
called<00:01:50.340> favela<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.359> was<00:01:51.509> made<00:01:51.659> famous<00:01:51.810> by

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020

called favela and it was made famous by
boom<00:01:52.350> Shaka<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.219> we<00:01:53.399> go<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.719> two<00:01:55.549> one<00:01:56.549> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
boom Shaka so we go one and two one and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.209 
boom Shaka so we go one and two one and
two<00:01:57.649> one<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.950> two<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.969> one<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.990> stop<00:02:01.829> right

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
two one and two and one and stop right

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.690 
two one and two and one and stop right
so<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.569> got<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> combine<00:02:03.929> this<00:02:04.200> step<00:02:04.499> with<00:02:05.280> what

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
so we got to combine this step with what

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.900 
so we got to combine this step with what
is<00:02:05.819> happening<00:02:06.270> right<00:02:06.420> now<00:02:06.829> Gavin<00:02:07.829> came<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
is happening right now Gavin came in the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
is happening right now Gavin came in the
music<00:02:09.179> industry<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.780> South<00:02:10.530> Africa<00:02:10.860> by<00:02:10.979> storm

music industry in South Africa by storm

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.400 
music industry in South Africa by storm
now<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.000> step<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.900> happening<00:02:13.290> right

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
now this step is what is happening right

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.610 
now this step is what is happening right
now<00:02:13.880> from<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.060> tabular<00:02:15.270> four<00:02:15.660> times<00:02:15.900> we<00:02:16.410> just

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
now from the tabular four times we just

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.170 
now from the tabular four times we just
woke<00:02:16.800> one

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
woke one

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.770 
woke one
