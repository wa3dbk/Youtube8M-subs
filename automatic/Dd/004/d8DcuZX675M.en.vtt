going to talk about here one is the UV
looking<00:02:40.010> connect<00:02:40.700> port<00:02:41.000> because<00:02:41.480> it's<00:02:41.599> a

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
looking connect port because it's a

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.649 
looking connect port because it's a
goofy-looking<00:02:42.019> I<00:02:42.620> mean<00:02:43.359> what<00:02:44.359> the<00:02:44.510> hell<00:02:44.629> are

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659

they<00:02:44.870> thinking<00:02:45.280> after<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.310> we<00:02:46.670> have<00:02:46.819> HDMI<00:02:47.599> in

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
they thinking after that we have HDMI in

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.960 
they thinking after that we have HDMI in
so<00:02:48.409> here's<00:02:48.620> how<00:02:48.769> that<00:02:48.799> works<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.790> have<00:02:49.849> a

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
so here's how that works you have a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.629 
so here's how that works you have a
cable<00:02:50.269> box<00:02:50.389> you<00:02:50.959> can<00:02:51.139> run<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.680> HDMI<00:02:52.220> from<00:02:52.519> your
