00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.710 
there's going to be 16 verses 16 game
modes<00:02:08.310> which<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.819> think<00:02:09.090> would<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:09.270> awesome

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
modes which I think would be awesome

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.600 
modes which I think would be awesome
because<00:02:10.709> if<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.979> guys<00:02:11.099> have<00:02:11.280> ever<00:02:11.400> played

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
because if you guys have ever played

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.670 
because if you guys have ever played
battlefield<00:02:12.120> 4<00:02:12.569> battlefield<00:02:12.810> 3

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
battlefield 4 battlefield 3

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.429 
battlefield 4 battlefield 3
they<00:02:14.280> use<00:02:14.459> or<00:02:14.939> they<00:02:15.180> are<00:02:15.299> usually<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.019> lot<00:02:16.379> more

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
they use or they are usually a lot more

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.160 
they use or they are usually a lot more
than<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:17.010> 12<00:02:17.280> players<00:02:17.549> in<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.849> game<00:02:18.109> and<00:02:19.109> I

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
than like 12 players in the game and I

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.530 
than like 12 players in the game and I
think<00:02:19.230> it's<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.560> lot<00:02:19.680> more<00:02:19.829> fun<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.310> way<00:02:20.540> if

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
think it's a lot more fun that way if

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.020 
think it's a lot more fun that way if
they<00:02:21.719> do<00:02:21.780> end<00:02:22.170> up<00:02:22.290> doing<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.680> 16<00:02:23.069> verses<00:02:23.400> 16<00:02:23.670> or

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
they do end up doing a 16 verses 16 or

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.360 
they do end up doing a 16 verses 16 or
even<00:02:24.450> something<00:02:24.719> larger<00:02:25.260> hopefully<00:02:26.159> they

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
even something larger hopefully they

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.309 
even something larger hopefully they
will<00:02:26.519> add<00:02:26.670> some<00:02:26.700> larger<00:02:27.269> Maps<00:02:27.510> because<00:02:27.840> i<00:02:28.260> know

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
will add some larger Maps because i know

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.709 
will add some larger Maps because i know
most<00:02:28.560> call<00:02:28.859> duty<00:02:29.099> maps<00:02:29.370> are<00:02:29.670> pretty<00:02:30.150> small<00:02:30.420> and

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
most call duty maps are pretty small and

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.720 
most call duty maps are pretty small and
would<00:02:31.469> not<00:02:31.620> even<00:02:31.799> be<00:02:32.010> able<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.280> accompany<00:02:32.489> that

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
would not even be able to accompany that

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.179 
would not even be able to accompany that
many<00:02:33.090> people<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.780> map<00:02:33.959> for<00:02:34.709> instance<00:02:35.040> this

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
many people on the map for instance this

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.000 
many people on the map for instance this
map<00:02:35.430> right<00:02:35.639> here<00:02:35.670> nuketown<00:02:36.239> for<00:02:36.450> black<00:02:36.599> ops<00:02:36.750> 2

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
map right here nuketown for black ops 2

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.619 
map right here nuketown for black ops 2
you<00:02:38.010> definitely<00:02:38.189> could<00:02:38.519> not<00:02:38.700> fit<00:02:38.939> 32<00:02:39.299> people

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
you definitely could not fit 32 people

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.929 
you definitely could not fit 32 people
on<00:02:39.810> here<00:02:39.959> without<00:02:40.109> it<00:02:40.349> being<00:02:40.799> too<00:02:41.069> chaotic<00:02:41.549> and

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
on here without it being too chaotic and

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.990 
on here without it being too chaotic and
crazy<00:02:42.379> but<00:02:43.379> another<00:02:44.159> thing<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.609> people<00:02:44.879> have

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
crazy but another thing that people have

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.240 
crazy but another thing that people have
been<00:02:45.120> speculating<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.049> saying<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.620> black

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
been speculating and saying that black

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.670 
been speculating and saying that black
ops<00:02:47.459> 3<00:02:47.639> will<00:02:47.790> have<00:02:47.939> a<00:02:47.970> map<00:02:48.450> creator<00:02:48.870> which<00:02:49.500> I

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
ops 3 will have a map creator which I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.429 
ops 3 will have a map creator which I
think<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.129> would<00:02:50.220> also<00:02:50.400> be<00:02:50.549> awesome<00:02:51.379> if<00:02:52.379> you

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
think that would also be awesome if you

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.929 
think that would also be awesome if you
could<00:02:52.769> especially<00:02:53.099> if<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.400> could<00:02:53.519> play<00:02:53.730> the

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
could especially if you could play the

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.899 
could especially if you could play the
maps<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.599> you<00:02:54.689> create<00:02:54.989> like<00:02:55.169> online<00:02:55.909> that

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
maps that you create like online that

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.399 
maps that you create like online that
would<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.120> cool<00:02:57.329> but<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:58.079> know<00:02:58.169> who<00:02:58.349> knows

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
would be cool but you know who knows

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.839 
would be cool but you know who knows
what<00:02:58.769> they're<00:02:58.889> really<00:02:59.040> going<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.340> do<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.519> doubt

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
what they're really going to do I doubt

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.750 
what they're really going to do I doubt
that<00:03:00.389> it's<00:03:00.629> going<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.840> be<00:03:00.989> as<00:03:01.889> good<00:03:02.489> as<00:03:02.549> we

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
that it's going to be as good as we

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.449 
that it's going to be as good as we
think<00:03:02.939> it<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:04.019> anyways<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:05.099> would<00:03:05.219> still

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
think it is but anyways that would still

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.699 
think it is but anyways that would still
be<00:03:05.549> cool<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:06.359> few<00:03:06.900> other<00:03:07.079> things<00:03:07.109> people<00:03:07.680> have

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
be cool a few other things people have

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.429 
be cool a few other things people have
been<00:03:07.889> saying<00:03:08.099> is<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:09.060> there<00:03:09.989> will<00:03:10.079> be<00:03:10.169> a
