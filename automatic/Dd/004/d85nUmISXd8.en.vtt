 soccer skills you always have 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.270
 personal skill shown during the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.530
 play during the touch of the ball I think 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.430
 have to show collectivity that the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.490
 Football is it, right? 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.500
 we had each one while I 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.590
 25 minutes inside the house of 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.380
 25 minutes even by their age 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.330
 who were from 16 years old with above 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.150
 We can not use it if we've had it. 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.509
 that use that player who stood out 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.840
 technically he gave a little 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.640
 more emphasis on the technique and was 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.799
 selected the others were deleted 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.780

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.439
 some fundamentals were not kicked at 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.570
 goal one pass is driving with finish 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.810
 so from that moment we saw 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.000
 also 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.100
 the condition that they will demonstrate in that 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.890
 moment there what is best 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.720

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.100
 also managed to injunction 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.880

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.490

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.030
