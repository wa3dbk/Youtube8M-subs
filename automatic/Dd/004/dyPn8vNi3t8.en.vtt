00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.630 
you know sometimes voice recognition can
be<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> bit<00:00:52.110> shitty<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.739> they<00:00:53.190> seem<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.520> have

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
be a bit shitty but they seem to have

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.850 
be a bit shitty but they seem to have
hit<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> nail<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> head<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:55.620> the
