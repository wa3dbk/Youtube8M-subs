00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.620
 the car completely changed its appearance and 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.280
 on the look looks and decided approximate weight 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:27.210

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.840
 now we will go we will open to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.729
 open the hood 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.729
 but a request for 10 to pull 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.880
 that is, to fully open you need 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.329
 so find a button on it and here 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.329
 it turns out 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:02:01.990
 engine capacity is 2 and 5 liters 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:04.870
 4- liter engine fucked salon 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.940
 the machine is very extensive and 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:11.620
 big here is a comfortable seat maximum 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.500
 five people fit in this car 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:21.430
 including the driver that is all not 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:24.930

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:30.430
 up front seat 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.510
 what looks very comfortable is all this 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.950
 So 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.739
 front seat covers are cute 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.569

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.170
