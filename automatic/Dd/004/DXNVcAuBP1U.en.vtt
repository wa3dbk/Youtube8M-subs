yourself and a few others I would I
would<00:00:49.730> I<00:00:49.760> think<00:00:50.120> that<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.809> world<00:00:51.020> would

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
would I think that the world would

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.470 
would I think that the world would
definitely<00:00:52.070> we<00:00:52.580> it<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:52.879> provable

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
definitely we it is provable

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.479 
definitely we it is provable
statistically<00:00:54.290> that<00:00:54.500> there<00:00:55.040> are<00:00:55.250> less

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
statistically that there are less

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.820 
statistically that there are less
murders<00:00:56.330> and<00:00:56.510> social<00:00:56.839> problems<00:00:57.050> where<00:00:57.530> people

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
murders and social problems where people

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.979 
murders and social problems where people
eat<00:00:57.979> together<00:00:58.309> more<00:00:58.610> so<00:00:59.089> surely<00:00:59.720> it<00:00:59.809> would<00:00:59.930> be

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
eat together more so surely it would be

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.810 
eat together more so surely it would be
good<00:01:00.199> for<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.470> world<00:01:00.620> I<00:01:00.890> also<00:01:01.250> believe<00:01:01.790> that

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
good for the world I also believe that

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.329 
good for the world I also believe that
that<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.809> just<00:01:03.080> part<00:01:03.260> of<00:01:03.409> growing<00:01:04.280> I<00:01:04.309> think

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
that is just part of growing I think

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.760 
that is just part of growing I think
every<00:01:04.729> adolescent<00:01:05.390> before<00:01:06.140> they<00:01:06.320> have<00:01:06.500> sex

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
every adolescent before they have sex

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.040 
every adolescent before they have sex
should<00:01:07.280> know<00:01:07.460> how<00:01:07.640> to<00:01:07.700> make<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.690> other<00:01:08.840> person

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
should know how to make the other person

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.389 
should know how to make the other person
an<00:01:09.290> omelet<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:14.229> think

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
an omelet I think

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.020 
an omelet I think
the<00:01:16.880> world<00:01:17.149> would<00:01:17.420> be<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.570> better<00:01:17.659> place<00:01:18.079> if<00:01:19.030> you

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
the world would be a better place if you

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.760 
the world would be a better place if you
know<00:01:20.180> only<00:01:20.960> people<00:01:21.229> who<00:01:21.290> slept<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:21.680> know

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
know only people who slept you know

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.260 
know only people who slept you know
people<00:01:22.009> only<00:01:22.189> stop<00:01:22.490> together<00:01:22.640> when<00:01:22.939> one<00:01:23.149> of

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
people only stop together when one of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.969 
people only stop together when one of
them<00:01:23.390> would<00:01:23.720> both<00:01:23.930> parties<00:01:24.470> we're<00:01:24.649> able<00:01:24.799> to

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
them would both parties we're able to

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.690 
them would both parties we're able to
say<00:01:25.189> you<00:01:25.640> know<00:01:25.670> let<00:01:26.299> me<00:01:26.329> make<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:26.630> an<00:01:26.750> omelet
