00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
idea how I ended up not in my

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.940 
idea how I ended up not in my
walkie-talkie

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
walkie-talkie

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:34.830 
walkie-talkie
I<00:02:20.980> just<00:02:21.790> act<00:02:22.090> with<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:23.610> now<00:02:26.040> signals<00:02:33.840> so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
I just act with it and now signals so

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.080 
I just act with it and now signals so
when<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.230> let<00:02:35.440> go<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:39.250> can't<00:02:39.640> hear<00:02:39.820> II

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
when you let go and you can't hear II

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.110 
when you let go and you can't hear II
that's<00:02:40.750> because<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.230> password<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:42.460> have<00:02:42.580> -<00:02:42.760> I

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
that's because the password you have - I

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:54.740 
that's because the password you have - I
set<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.750> be<00:02:50.790> me<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.000> mine<00:02:52.210> isn't<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.630> solid

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
set it to be me but mine isn't on solid

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.340 
set it to be me but mine isn't on solid
this<00:02:55.750> works

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
this works

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.890 
this works
these<00:02:56.560> are<00:02:56.770> modded<00:02:57.190> walkie<00:02:57.400> talkies<00:02:57.970> so<00:02:58.570> he'll

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
these are modded walkie talkies so he'll

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.480 
these are modded walkie talkies so he'll
