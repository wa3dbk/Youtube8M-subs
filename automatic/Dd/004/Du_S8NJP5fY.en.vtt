 In general, such a shade is gold and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.640
 such gold is very beautiful 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.820
 otherwise when shading is given very 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.360
 beautiful shimmer on and shine and now i'm 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.620

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.989
 apply highlighter 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.680
 and so and the first place where you can apply 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.260
 highlighter 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.429
 I'll take a brush like that and a little bit 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.429
 spreading 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.950
 you can see that the lips have become a little 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.500
 more 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.600
 pearl shadows 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.790
 the next place where in general in principle 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.490
 highlight was originally created 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.730
 righteous for what is this part 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:47.370
 but I will show first we put it over here 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.440
 so here and so here we 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.900
 I get a simple band I take again 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:57.900
 brush and start just you and 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:01.020
 shade and see this 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.080
 beautiful gentle shine which 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.660
 the sun will look very beautiful 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.010
 you can shake a little bit with your finger 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.540
 because highlighter whatsapp he 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.510
 creamy enough 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.610

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.860
 highlighter thin strip and apply 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.989
 so here and shade it will create 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.790
 visual effect over a 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.070
 past the nose but look not 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.790
 go too far and because otherwise 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.980
 create the effect of a fat face a and show 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.290
 you the last place to put 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.870
 highlight and last place you can 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.580
 apply a highlighter this under the brow and 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.760
 corner of the eye now I tell you 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.760

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:02.730

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.730
 one eye and 2 looks 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.840
 compare this eye with the highlighter and 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.090
 this one without everything 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.600
 this eye definitely looks like 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.420
 fresh and cute i would say 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:32.460

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:37.020
