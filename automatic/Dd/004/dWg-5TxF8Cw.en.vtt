00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.770
 tee 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.780
 We introduce practice of the department of congress school 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:19.400
 This is safe 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:23.890
 Words and letters are used to convey human ideas, but in the field of manufacturing 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:33.290
 Use nails to indicate shape and size 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:36.510
 We share work processes such as design processing assembly inspection when we produce one product 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.629
 It is the drawing that is necessary there 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:46.480
 Not only the shape and size in the drawings 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:52.170
 Information on materials used and processing methods and processing order are also included. 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.170
 Drawing is the universal language of the box office 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:01.400
 To become a mechanical engineer, it is essential to learn mechanical drafting 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:08.440
 This is cad cam 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:12.050
 cad is a computer processing system that automates from design to processing 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:20.350
 Do modeling first 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:20.350
 Modeling is the operation of drawing a three-dimensional figure on a computer using necessary commands 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.390
 ãƒ¼ 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.030
 me 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:50.340
 Move to cam when modeling is complete 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.900
 Cam and programming data required for processing model data created by cad 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.900
 It is work to convert 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:06.570
 Finally, machining simulation is performed in the work 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.570
 You can check the cutting process and product shape without actually cutting 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.000
 b 2 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.690
 3 types 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.450
 2 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:34.070
 This is actually a machining center using programming data created with jam 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.070
 We are doing the processing 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:45.040
 The work of human beings in machining process is only the setting of work and setting of plateau store 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.680
 All else is automatic operation by program 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.680
 Machining center will make a three-dimensional processing 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:03:03.850
 The introduction of the cad cam system has been promoted by local companies, and it has become the center of production . 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.850
 Delivery is also one of the very practical and attractive training themes . 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.440
 This is lathe processing 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:21.810
 A lathe is a machine tool that performs cutting 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:25.940
 Cutting process removes unnecessary parts of the workpiece as a cut 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.940
 It is a processing method to finish in a prescribed shape 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:36.739
 Lathe machining is the most basic removal process with a long history 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.739
 Continues to evolve with advances in machines and tools 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:47.820
 This is carbon dioxide gas arc welding 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.920
 The parts that make up the parliament are joined in various ways 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:55.850
 Assembled and will be in the product 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:04:03.260
 Referred to as welding the method described by dissolving the metal to each other 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:07.819
 In our welding practice, gas welding and discharge using heat generated when combustible gas burns 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:14.290
 We perform arc welding using the phenomenon 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:21.039
 In order to be involved in the work of welding in the future , qualification for welding is required 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:26.240
 Since the mechanical engineering department meets the practical skill content necessary for qualification acquisition in the practical training, it is only the department exam 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:32.139
 You can qualify for gas welding arc welding 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.139
 Every year all mechanical engineering students get qualifications 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.980
 There is no pursuit that there was computer technology 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.920
 Even in the field of processing 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:45.000
 Introduction of automatic machines such as cad cab system cnc lathe machining center 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.040
 Advance 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.889
 Development of human resources who can cope with this is required 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.280
 In mechanical engineering 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:56.139
 I need to communicate to the industry from expensive foundation 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.949
 Navi knowledge and technology 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:02.920
 Practice regular car that can cope with advanced technology 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.740
 I aim to be a Rose specialist 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.470
 Your story from this year 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.950
 Technician third grade 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.550
 Previous version of the work and Nigg Center adopted 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.210
 Minister's work 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:20.860
 General Mestre vehicle monthly car 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:24.310
 Arc will be like the guy company ShoTakashi boiler handling person to 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:29.159
 Everyone's aim your deposit of specialists also together 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.159
 Make your dream come true in the mechanical engineering department
