conversation becomes pointless
repetitive<00:02:25.769> or<00:02:26.329> unproductive<00:02:27.329> it's<00:02:28.260> that

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
repetitive or unproductive it's that

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.940 
repetitive or unproductive it's that
easy<00:02:29.780> now<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.840> reason<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.409> works<00:02:31.650> is

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
easy now the reason this works is

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.309 
easy now the reason this works is
because<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.579> code<00:02:32.849> word<00:02:33.090> X<00:02:33.329> as<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.629> boundary

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
because the code word X as a boundary

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.800 
because the code word X as a boundary
that<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.980> create<00:02:35.489> around<00:02:36.000> your<00:02:36.209> relationship

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
that you create around your relationship

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.860 
that you create around your relationship
it's<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.620> way<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:37.829> saying<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.870> demonstrating

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
it's a way of saying and demonstrating

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.599 
it's a way of saying and demonstrating
that<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.409> are<00:02:40.500> not<00:02:40.680> going<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.010> let<00:02:41.280> another

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
that you are not going to let another

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.990 
that you are not going to let another
person<00:02:42.049> inside<00:02:43.049> your<00:02:43.290> relationship<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.819> act

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
person inside your relationship the act

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.849 
person inside your relationship the act
of<00:02:45.180> seeing<00:02:45.420> your<00:02:45.599> code<00:02:45.870> word<00:02:46.079> out<00:02:46.230> loud

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
of seeing your code word out loud

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.979 
of seeing your code word out loud
literally<00:02:47.549> interrupts<00:02:48.120> your<00:02:48.239> conversation

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
literally interrupts your conversation

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.770 
literally interrupts your conversation
but<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.650> also<00:02:50.010> helps<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:50.670> redirect<00:02:51.510> your

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
but it also helps you redirect your

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.129 
but it also helps you redirect your
attention<00:02:52.260> back<00:02:53.069> where<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.489> belongs<00:02:53.849> on<00:02:54.180> each

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
attention back where it belongs on each

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.830 
attention back where it belongs on each
other<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.879> next<00:02:57.120> time<00:02:57.329> you<00:02:57.450> find<00:02:57.750> yourself

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
other so the next time you find yourself

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.409 
other so the next time you find yourself
talking<00:02:58.500> incessantly<00:02:58.889> about<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.609> X<00:02:59.760> shout

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419
