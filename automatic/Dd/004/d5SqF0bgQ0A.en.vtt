00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.799
 Hello everyone, today I show you a new one 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.269
 tutorial with the wire technique since 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.450
 it gets closer to halloween 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.160
 I decided to make these kids 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.520
 a few years ago I had already done it with 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.570
 the beads and now I have decided to make them 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.420
 all of them with the wire cut 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.830
 3 small pieces of metal wire 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.989
 thickness of 0 8 mm and is using a 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.239
 artistic green wire and you will see me do it 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.270
 this tutorial in two variants because 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.070
 when I made the first shots, I am 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.280
 noticed that some passages were not 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.620
 came and then I did the shooting 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.160
 creating another spider for which 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.739
 you will notice some differences and colors 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.710
 dimensions in some video clips 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.180
 as you can see I created an eyelet with 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.640
 the pizzas at the center of each of these 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.360
 segments of metal wire 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.049
 you can make them about 7 to 8 long 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.930
 centimeters up to 12 cm depending on how much 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.900
 you want to make long the spider's legs and 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.960
 also in proportion to the body that 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.180
 you will use I made a spider more 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.150
 little one the second time I turned 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.159
 the video so you see both of the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.259
 little paws that are smaller than 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.979
 longer paws that are those of the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.380
 spider on the cover and to do this 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.560
 spider in fact then you will need two 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.590
 pearls and one for the body and one for the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.220
 head and I used you for was mine 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.189
 small one spoken 08 and one 06 and for 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.450
 it was my big a spoken 10 is a 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.850
 pearl from 8 ml to 8 mm 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.790
 I then took a thinner thread like 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.810
 you have already seen in the images of 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.900
 thickness 03 green or even of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.480
 another color 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.940
 I started to wrap it in both of us 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.780
 the sides of those that will be then the 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.210
 Spider's legs I made gods 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.880
 spiders with 6 legs and reality 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.220
 you can also make them with 8 paws ho 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.990
 decided to do it this way so as not to do it 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.390
 come too big and bulky 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.940
 so I'm going to wrap the thread doing 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.130
 the clan the classic technique of the thread with 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.220
 led on one side and on the other 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.820
 of the central eyelet and then I go to 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.920
 create two side glasses that will be 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.290
 the ends of my legs 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.070
 spider is a very very processing 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.130
 simple suitable even for beginners 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:53.630
 then I take a wire segment of 08 plus 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:57.530
 at least 20 25 cm long to create one 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.810
 spiral at the end and bend the 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.190
 stars of the spirals na 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.280
 perpendicular to the wire 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.820
 also on this thread I'm going to wrap 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.640
 the thinnest thread doing all one 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.870
 series of rounds for four or five 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.130
 centimeters 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.360
 I take yet another long wire about 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.120
 7 8 centimeters 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.660
 I make a spiral and I always wear it 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.370
 so this perpendicular to the wire 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.459
 you can actually do it with a 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.980
 nail I no longer had TV tuned to 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.230
 wires he was using and then me 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.190
 the nail is created with the same 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.860
 wire I then inserted on the wire 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.709
 the last created the other thread with the 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.500
 part toilet and then I inserted the part 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.500
 bigger than the spider's body will be 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.820
 the for the greatest that will be precisely the 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.070
 spider body I turned the part 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.970
 of the coil wire portion and around 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.910
 to the body of the radio thus creating a 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.970
 spiral that wraps the pearl and then ho 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.740
 turned the bare thread around 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.320
 to the other wire to the main one 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.150
 that creates me let's say the skeleton there 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.110
 spider structure 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:20.430
 now I'm going to put the three paws on 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:23.400
 on the main wire and then the raw file 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:28.080
 smallest pearl that creates your head 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.260
 terragno since these spiders are 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.260
 Also of luck actually how 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.170
 the saying goes spider brings gain and 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.120
 I advise you to make them with 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.130
 I used both gemstones 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.280
 of hard stones than of pearls in 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.620
 glass details because the effect is 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.140
 really very nice then they can be 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.560
 used as pendants or can 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.020
 become keychains and are suitable 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.230
 also as a key ring to be a 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.220
 male type gift considering that in 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:05.040
 it's kind of hard to have ideas that that 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.010
 Also fit men at least for 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.740
 me is quite complicated 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.450
 once I inserted the head 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.310
 I take the big thread I had inserted 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.420
 at the beginning we say on the main wire e 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.510
 I run it around the legs I create 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.610
 a spiral around this head 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.890
 time without the wire being with the LEDs 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.140
 then or the same spiral I had 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.150
 created around the body but less 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.880
 cumbersome because it is around the 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.600
 head wrap around the thread 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:43.050
 the main cut I'm going to make 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.470
 retract the protruding part into the 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.050
 processing and then I simply have to 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:55.500
 create an eyelet with thread 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:58.350
 the main part is so the part we say more 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.690
 important of the spider is made to this 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.750
 point however the paws will remain a 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.850
 little bit mobile you can decide 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:09.630
 release them or block them from 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:12.030
 plus the position and if you left one 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.080
 portion of the coil wire and is out of the 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.820
 the action will be enough to make it pass 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.610
 intertwining it between the various paws the 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.820
 spider's body and so the legs do 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.370
 will stabilize and in the case of the spider more 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.980
 I had folded my paws before 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.920
 to mount them in the case of the little spider 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.040
 stubble giving to it as you see it is 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.030
 very simple the thread I used 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.980
 quite soft 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.370
 in the case of this little spider is a 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.170
 bronze colored wire with enamelled copper 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.050
 in the other case it was an artistic air 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.900
 green here it is this more rayo 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.210
 as big as you see even the legs more 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.980
 long and you can fix me once 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:57.360
 finished you can fix there is the 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:59.580
 position of the legs to complete 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.790
 this kind of creations with spiders 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:05.820
 in reality you can also create 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.560
 small cobwebs the technique to create 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.530
 the cobwebs is just what I have 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.720
 illustrated in the tutorial I uploaded 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.760
 a few days ago but that was already on 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.220
 my second channel which is the one for 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.320
 make yogo de dios 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.150
 but if you want a tutorial on 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.140
 cobwebs and leave me a comment e 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.510
 let me know 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:27.210
 I hope these spiders are there 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:30.500
 liked and greet you and see you at 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.500
 next video bye bye
