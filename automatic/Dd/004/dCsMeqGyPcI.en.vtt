00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.229 
and that's why we chose as our publisher
yes<00:00:48.059> I'm<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.410> guess<00:00:50.030> starting<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
yes I'm because I guess starting up a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.569 
yes I'm because I guess starting up a
new<00:00:51.270> project<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.989> always<00:00:52.350> difficult<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.160> of

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
new project is always difficult and of

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.760 
new project is always difficult and of
course<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.030> project<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> probably<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
course this project is probably the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.939 
course this project is probably the
biggest<00:00:55.949> one<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.000> ghm<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.739> ever

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
biggest one of a ghm and have ever

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.880 
biggest one of a ghm and have ever
worked<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.820> also<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.410> was<00:01:01.620> for

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
worked on and also it was for

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.329 
worked on and also it was for
multi-platform<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:04.010> instead<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.129> using

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
multi-platform and instead of using

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.250 
multi-platform and instead of using
internal<00:01:06.060> engine

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
internal engine

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.850 
internal engine
they<00:01:07.380> used<00:01:08.360> unreal<00:01:09.360> engine<00:01:09.870> 2<00:01:10.050> they<00:01:10.470> started

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
they used unreal engine 2 they started

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.100 
they used unreal engine 2 they started
to<00:01:11.070> use<00:01:11.280> Unreal<00:01:11.760> Engine<00:01:11.910> so<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.930> were

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
to use Unreal Engine so there were

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.000 
to use Unreal Engine so there were
multiple<00:01:13.800> challenges<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.970> project<00:01:16.010> so

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
multiple challenges for the project so

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.510 
multiple challenges for the project so
yes<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> world<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.920> psychological<00:01:19.920> action

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
long time to really and implement mjm

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.750 
long time to really and implement mjm
like<00:01:45.780> grasshopper<00:01:46.320> unique<00:01:46.740> style<00:01:47.220> into<00:01:47.640> the
