00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and my favorite so far is the tempest so

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.630 
and my favorite so far is the tempest so
the<00:00:24.930> tempest<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.680> lightning<00:00:26.160> gun<00:00:26.400> where

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the tempest is that lightning gun where

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.250 
the tempest is that lightning gun where
you<00:00:26.820> shoot<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.359> at<00:00:27.480> an<00:00:27.599> enemy<00:00:27.720> if<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.019> hit<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
you shoot it at an enemy if you hit the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.810 
you shoot it at an enemy if you hit the
enemy<00:00:28.590> then<00:00:28.769> they<00:00:28.920> get<00:00:29.099> all<00:00:29.279> shocked<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
enemy then they get all shocked and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.609 
enemy then they get all shocked and
everything<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.390> then<00:00:30.750> every<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.410> their

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
everything and then every one of their

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.530 
everything and then every one of their
teammates<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.189> comes<00:00:32.399> close<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.940> them<00:00:33.059> it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
teammates that comes close to them it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.299 
teammates that comes close to them it
will<00:00:33.719> actually<00:00:33.870> arc<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.559> them<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.010> kill<00:00:35.280> them

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
will actually arc to them and kill them

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.190 
will actually arc to them and kill them
as<00:00:35.670> well<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.300> could<00:00:36.420> actually<00:00:36.540> get<00:00:36.780> multi

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
as well so you could actually get multi

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200 
as well so you could actually get multi
kills<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.670> gonna<00:00:38.760> say<00:00:38.969> really

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
kills with this I'm not gonna say really

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.360 
kills with this I'm not gonna say really
easily<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> chance<00:00:41.129> of

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
easily but you do have the chance of

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.709 
easily but you do have the chance of
getting<00:00:41.670> multi<00:00:41.969> kills<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.480> which<00:00:42.690> is

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
getting multi kills with this which is

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.069 
getting multi kills with this which is
awesome<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.559> why<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:44.910> favorite<00:00:45.420> well

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
with my playstyle and I've kind of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.580 
with my playstyle and I've kind of
figured<00:00:48.180> out<00:00:48.239> how<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> use<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.020> feel<00:00:49.379> it's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
figured out how to use it I feel it's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.500 
figured out how to use it I feel it's
like<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.039> most<00:00:50.309> effective<00:00:50.969> thing<00:00:51.239> for

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
like the most effective thing for

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.090 
like the most effective thing for
cutting<00:00:51.809> off<00:00:51.960> choke<00:00:52.289> points<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.829> there's<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
cutting off choke points and there's a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.459 
cutting off choke points and there's a
lot<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.520> choke<00:00:53.760> points<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.360> game<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:55.350> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
lot of choke points in this game if you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.660 
lot of choke points in this game if you
don't<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> choke<00:00:56.100> point<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.460> where

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
don't know a choke point is where

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.369 
don't know a choke point is where
enemies<00:00:56.850> are<00:00:57.090> basically<00:00:57.570> funneled<00:00:58.050> into<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
enemies are basically funneled into a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.069 
enemies are basically funneled into a
smaller<00:00:58.770> area<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.940> lot<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.539> times<00:01:00.780> there's<00:01:00.960> like

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
smaller area a lot of times there's like

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.569 
smaller area a lot of times there's like
a<00:01:01.109> head<00:01:01.350> glitch<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.920> choke<00:01:02.129> point<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.520> if

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
a head glitch on this choke point so if

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.609 
a head glitch on this choke point so if
you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.820> hit<00:01:02.969> somebody<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> head

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
glitch on a lot of the head glitches if

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.600 
glitch on a lot of the head glitches if
any<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.470> their<00:01:07.590> teammates<00:01:07.979> tries<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.400> run

by them or is anywhere near them which
is<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:10.920> common<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.729> will<00:01:11.880> arc<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.270> them<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
is very common it will arc to them and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.590 
is very common it will arc to them and
kill<00:01:12.930> them<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> few<00:01:15.210> tips<00:01:15.240> for

kill them as well so a few tips for
using<00:01:15.810> The<00:01:16.020> Tempest<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.470> lot<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.710> people<00:01:16.950> during

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
using The Tempest a lot of people during

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.800 
using The Tempest a lot of people during
my<00:01:17.220> stream<00:01:17.580> were<00:01:17.729> wondering<00:01:18.119> how<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.360> was<00:01:18.689> so

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
my stream were wondering how I was so

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.240 
my stream were wondering how I was so
effective<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> tempest<00:01:19.950> because<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
effective with the tempest because I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
effective with the tempest because I
usually<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.880> at<00:01:21.090> least<00:01:21.600> about<00:01:21.930> four<00:01:22.350> kills

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
usually get at least about four kills

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.679 
usually get at least about four kills
with<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.860> unless<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:24.060> taken<00:01:24.540> off<00:01:24.659> guard

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
with it unless I get taken off guard

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.840 
with it unless I get taken off guard
which<00:01:25.080> does<00:01:25.320> happen<00:01:25.530> every<00:01:25.770> now<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.280> but

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
which does happen every now and then but

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.060 
which does happen every now and then but
if<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.180> use<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.540> properly<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.290> at<00:01:28.409> least<00:01:28.650> four

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
if I use it properly I get at least four

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.130 
if I use it properly I get at least four
kills<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.909> think<00:01:30.119> my<00:01:30.210> record<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.930> like

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
kills with it I think my record is like

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590 
kills with it I think my record is like
seven<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:31.770> eight<00:01:31.829> kills<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.939> that's

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
seven or eight kills with it and that's

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
seven or eight kills with it and that's
that's<00:01:34.020> pretty<00:01:34.290> good<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> specialist<00:01:35.220> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that's pretty good for a specialist in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.370 
that's pretty good for a specialist in
my<00:01:35.460> opinion<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.659> how<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.049> use<00:01:37.229> it

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
my opinion so how do you use it

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.890 
my opinion so how do you use it
effectively<00:01:37.619> well<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.850> key<00:01:39.090> here<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.420> first

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
effectively well the key here is first

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.560 
effectively well the key here is first
off<00:01:40.079> recognizing<00:01:40.860> choke<00:01:41.130> points<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.700> second

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
off recognizing choke points and second

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.350 
off recognizing choke points and second
not<00:01:43.079> control<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.189> want<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> enemies<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.240> be

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
not control you want the enemies to be

not control you want the enemies to be

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
pushing towards you you don't want to be

using this trying to break out of a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
spawn trap I mean you can try this but

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.120 
spawn trap I mean you can try this but
it's<00:01:51.810> probably<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.439> going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.860> get<00:01:52.979> you

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it's probably not going to get you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.550 
it's probably not going to get you
nearly<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.610> many<00:01:53.759> kills<00:01:54.149> as<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.380> the

nearly as many kills as if you have the

nearly as many kills as if you have the

map control the reason for this is when

you have the map control first off your

you have the map control first off your

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
enemies are pushed back further so you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.160 
enemies are pushed back further so you
have<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.610> less<00:02:02.969> chance<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.390> being<00:02:03.450> flanked<00:02:04.049> and

have a less chance of being flanked and

shot in the back while you're trying to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
use your tempest and second they have

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.520 
use your tempest and second they have
the<00:02:08.280> pressure<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.819> them<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.209> push<00:02:09.690> towards<00:02:10.229> you

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the pressure on them to push towards you

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.559 
the pressure on them to push towards you
whereas<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.520> they<00:02:11.700> are<00:02:11.970> holding<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.510> a

spawn trap there

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.110 
spawn trap there
basically<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:14.130> kind<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.370> hanging<00:02:14.610> out<00:02:14.910> and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
basically just kind of hanging out and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.479 
basically just kind of hanging out and
it's<00:02:16.050> very<00:02:16.170> difficult<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.830> break<00:02:16.980> out<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.220> that

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
it's very difficult to break out of that

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.430 
it's very difficult to break out of that
and<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.390> choke<00:02:18.599> points<00:02:18.900> don't<00:02:19.050> really<00:02:19.290> matter

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
and the choke points don't really matter

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.320 
and the choke points don't really matter
as<00:02:19.709> much<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:20.190> choke<00:02:20.400> points<00:02:20.700> really<00:02:21.000> matter

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
as much the choke points really matter

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.240 
as much the choke points really matter
when<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> pressure<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.349> them<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:23.040> push

through<00:02:23.550> those<00:02:23.849> choke<00:02:24.180> points<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:25.230> push<00:02:25.530> them

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
through those choke points so push them

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.410 
through those choke points so push them
back<00:02:25.890> into<00:02:26.160> their<00:02:26.340> spawn<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.790> best<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.209> can

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
back into their spawn the best you can

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.690 
back into their spawn the best you can
before<00:02:27.900> calling<00:02:28.260> your<00:02:28.290> tempest<00:02:28.770> in<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.130> then

before calling your tempest in and then

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.309 
before calling your tempest in and then
use<00:02:29.910> your<00:02:29.940> tempest<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.599> just<00:02:30.959> make<00:02:31.140> sure

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
use your tempest and just make sure

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.720 
use your tempest and just make sure
you're<00:02:31.500> trying<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.890> pick<00:02:32.069> those<00:02:32.220> people<00:02:32.550> off

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
you're trying to pick those people off

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.610 
you're trying to pick those people off
that<00:02:32.940> are<00:02:33.030> within<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.390> choke<00:02:33.599> points<00:02:34.050> now<00:02:34.590> I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
that are within the choke points now I

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.960 
that are within the choke points now I
know<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.890> don't<00:02:35.069> have<00:02:35.250> complete<00:02:35.580> control

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
know you don't have complete control

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.520 
know you don't have complete control
over<00:02:36.090> where<00:02:36.540> your<00:02:36.660> enemies<00:02:37.019> are<00:02:37.050> going<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.380> be

over where your enemies are going to be

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.990 
over where your enemies are going to be
and<00:02:37.769> sometimes<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.670> take<00:02:38.880> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
and sometimes you just have to take the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.960 
and sometimes you just have to take the
shot<00:02:39.239> but<00:02:40.080> by<00:02:40.830> having<00:02:41.220> Matt<00:02:41.400> control<00:02:41.790> you

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
shot but by having Matt control you

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.850 
shot but by having Matt control you
maximize<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.599> chance<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.290> getting<00:02:43.560> these

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
maximize the chance of getting these

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.370 
maximize the chance of getting these
multi<00:02:44.310> kills<00:02:44.550> with<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.080> another<00:02:46.080> thing<00:02:46.290> to

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
point out with The Tempest this is the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.220 
point out with The Tempest this is the
part<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.360> lot<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.540> people<00:02:48.810> struggle<00:02:49.200> with

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
part that a lot of people struggle with

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.100 
part that a lot of people struggle with
is<00:02:49.470> work<00:02:50.160> on<00:02:50.340> your<00:02:50.400> timing<00:02:50.880> for<00:02:51.299> it<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.900> can't

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
is work on your timing for it you can't

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.870 
is work on your timing for it you can't
just<00:02:52.319> pull<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.620> trigger<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.400> instantly

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
just pull the trigger and you instantly

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.270 
just pull the trigger and you instantly
fire<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.810> has<00:02:55.019> like<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> half<00:02:55.530> second<00:02:56.010> charge

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
fire it it has like a half second charge

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.220 
fire it it has like a half second charge
up<00:02:56.459> time<00:02:56.670> before<00:02:56.970> firing<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.390> shot<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.049> I

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
up time before firing the shot and I

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.809 
up time before firing the shot and I
think<00:02:58.440> that's<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.739> main<00:02:58.920> balancing<00:02:59.489> factor

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
think that's the main balancing factor

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.580 
think that's the main balancing factor
with<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.180> tempest<00:03:00.599> is<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.319> don't<00:03:01.500> get

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
with the tempest is if you don't get

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.530 
with the tempest is if you don't get
your<00:03:01.680> timing<00:03:01.950> right<00:03:02.130> you're<00:03:02.940> basically<00:03:03.480> just

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
your timing right you're basically just

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.030 
your timing right you're basically just
going<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.959> miss<00:03:04.110> every<00:03:04.410> single<00:03:04.739> one<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:04.860> your

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
going to miss every single one of your

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.180 
going to miss every single one of your
shots<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:06.239> best<00:03:06.480> way<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.720> find<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.769> pre<00:03:08.040> aim

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
shots the best way I find is to pre aim

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.740 
shots the best way I find is to pre aim
where<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.519> expect<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.060> enemy<00:03:09.239> is<00:03:09.480> going<00:03:09.540> to

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
where you expect the enemy is going to

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.780 
where you expect the enemy is going to
be<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.230> then<00:03:10.709> once<00:03:11.010> your<00:03:11.160> aim<00:03:11.310> down<00:03:11.489> sight

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
be and then once your aim down sight

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.039 
be and then once your aim down sight
there<00:03:12.000> all<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.330> have<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.540> do<00:03:12.630> is<00:03:12.750> pull<00:03:12.930> that

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
there all you have to do is pull that

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.330 
there all you have to do is pull that
trigger<00:03:13.290> as<00:03:13.500> soon<00:03:13.709> as<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.920> enemy<00:03:14.040> comes

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
trigger as soon as the enemy comes

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.130 
trigger as soon as the enemy comes
around<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.700> corner<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.030> usually<00:03:15.930> by<00:03:16.080> this

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
around the corner and usually by this

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.900 
around the corner and usually by this
time<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.680> half<00:03:17.010> second<00:03:17.489> won't<00:03:17.730> really

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
time that half second won't really

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.880 
time that half second won't really
matter<00:03:18.150> much<00:03:18.450> because<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:19.140> enemy<00:03:19.470> won't<00:03:19.620> have

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
matter much because the enemy won't have

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.920 
matter much because the enemy won't have
enough<00:03:20.130> time<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.549> react<00:03:20.880> whereas<00:03:21.600> if<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.810> get

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
enough time to react whereas if you get

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.720 
enough time to react whereas if you get
into<00:03:22.140> like<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.380> face-to-face<00:03:22.859> gunfight<00:03:23.519> with

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
into like a face-to-face gunfight with

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.729 
into like a face-to-face gunfight with
them<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.090> neither<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.690> are<00:03:24.720> ready<00:03:25.079> it's

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
them and neither of you are ready it's

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.500 
them and neither of you are ready it's
very<00:03:26.190> likely<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.700> they'll<00:03:26.970> be<00:03:27.060> able<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.269> get

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
very likely that they'll be able to get

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.270 
very likely that they'll be able to get
their<00:03:27.660> gun<00:03:27.840> out<00:03:27.989> fast<00:03:28.320> enough<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.859> kill<00:03:29.100> you

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
their gun out fast enough to kill you

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.160 
their gun out fast enough to kill you
before<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:30.000> get<00:03:30.150> your<00:03:30.209> tempest<00:03:30.780> up<00:03:30.959> and

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
before you can get your tempest up and

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.170 
before you can get your tempest up and
wait<00:03:31.769> for<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.069> half<00:03:32.280> second<00:03:32.670> charge<00:03:32.940> time

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
wait for that half second charge time

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.020 
wait for that half second charge time
before<00:03:33.540> taking<00:03:33.900> your<00:03:34.140> shot<00:03:34.370> so<00:03:35.370> that's<00:03:35.760> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
before taking your shot so that's the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.240 
before taking your shot so that's the
