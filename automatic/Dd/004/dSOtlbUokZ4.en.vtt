00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 the fight is far from over 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.549
 just started there is still 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.760
 so many games and come almost every day 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.110
 which belong to the absolutely forbidden 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.240
 and many attributions also show me 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.920
 again that I definitely on the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.289
 right way is like for example 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 do you mean serious merck yourself? 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.769
 also the same forbidden minecraft 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.730
 heard there I am really angry or 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.529
 which idiot plays there please yes 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.060
 it was about a perverse planting mode 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.059
 this is also one of our simulations 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.370
 spectator then so called and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.920
 now the measure is full 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.050
 because now I'll get one of the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.290
 to cite spectators correctly right 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.120
 sour because since this week is for the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.489
 nintendo 3ds appeared and that does 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.530
 definitely not better, namely professor 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.579
 layton versus phoenix wright ace 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.070
 attorney 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.149
 and now it's suddenly the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.219
 appeal to the collar 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.329
 or play in this and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.649
 you will see it soon and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.680
 especially my colleagues 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.870
 certainly more agree that this 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.119
 One game is absolutely forbidden 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.729
 heard because one of the nicest and 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.110
 sympathetic groups of people in 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.700
 this world here in one dimension 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.360
 it is that demoted simply not 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.020
 more acceptable 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.430
 it's about us advocating 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.680
 look for yourself 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.140
 Here we experience the history of 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.140
 American colleagues Phoenix Wright 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.869
 and already in one of the initial sequences 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.509
 this man is already like that before 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.299
 it helped many people 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.659
 rescued lives played very badly 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.430
 a lawyer as a joke figure who comes up 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.200
 such sick ideas 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.759
 I thought the times of darling 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.180
 Kreuzberg and a fall for two 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.360
 we would have overcome but it will still be 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.159
 they see themselves grotesquely 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.409
 but initially it continues normally 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.020
 which lawyer does not know that 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.189
 as a participant of a 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.649
 training program is called a 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.500
 Aliens in London over night a fall 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.439
 not uncommon transfer that one then 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.780
 no files to see something like this 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.879
 is known to hold only and 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.560
 Daily business is also as 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.380
 Defender first 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.920
 revenues and activities of its clients 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.560
 call 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.360
 bad if you then provide the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.920
 own clients of a murder 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.620
 Although only accuses 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.770
 Beating is hip but good 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.930
 yes, there is the lawyer 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.120
 Liability insurance but something for everyone 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.769
 jurists the anger flush in the face 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.050
 shoot and professor layton 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.470
 evil phoenix wright at a game 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.170
 That absolutely forbids that 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.790
 See here 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:50.310
 the poor gentleman colleague he is sweating 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.590
 Do not believe me a lawyer sweats 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.019
 finally, public courts must 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.569
 save building because nobody transfers 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.090
 because of excessive heat and lawyers 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.489
 do not sweat out of fear that have 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.200
 the money for deos and are sovereign cool 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.799
 sympathetic and usually to 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.690
 kneel handsome Friedel what 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.160
 for a cruel disfigured world becomes 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.170
 here in this game already six-year-old 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.910
 presented a ban would actually be 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.910
 still too few do it away
