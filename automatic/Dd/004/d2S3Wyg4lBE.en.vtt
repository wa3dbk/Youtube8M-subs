00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
to worry so much half just has to be

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.060 
to worry so much half just has to be
blended<00:03:05.180> out<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.630> that's<00:03:06.290> with<00:03:06.650> your<00:03:06.799> white

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070

blended out and that's with your white
silica<00:03:07.880> powders<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:09.049> has<00:03:09.739> silica<00:03:10.190> in<00:03:10.370> it

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
silica powders this has silica in it

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.050 
silica powders this has silica in it
it's<00:03:11.269> also<00:03:11.510> mineral<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.260> it's<00:03:12.950> got<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.670> color

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060

it's also mineral and it's got a color
to<00:03:14.390> it<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:15.140> something<00:03:15.560> like<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:16.400> would<00:03:16.519> be

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
to it so something like that it would be

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.479 
to it so something like that it would be
a<00:03:17.170> differentiation<00:03:18.170> between<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:19.040> makeup

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489

forever white silica base or the Mac
prep<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.180> prime<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:23.900> that's<00:03:24.110> just<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.380> little

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
prep and prime so that's just a little

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.229 
prep and prime so that's just a little
bit<00:03:24.709> info<00:03:25.160> on<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.519> because<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.880> lot<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.060> people

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
bit info on that because a lot of people

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.449 
bit info on that because a lot of people
get<00:03:26.900> afraid<00:03:27.320> of<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.590> silica<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.130> they<00:03:28.250> say<00:03:28.430> oh

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459
