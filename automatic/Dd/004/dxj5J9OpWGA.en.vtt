going to set them equal to a variable

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.760 
going to set them equal to a variable
let's<00:00:13.799> say<00:00:14.009> X<00:00:15.080> then<00:00:16.080> we'll<00:00:16.199> write<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.500> as<00:00:16.619> an

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
let's say X then we'll write this as an

let's say X then we'll write this as an
exponential<00:00:17.190> equation<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.970> determine<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
as an exponential equation we can use

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.849 
as an exponential equation we can use
our<00:00:24.900> notes<00:00:25.109> below<00:00:25.470> where<00:00:26.070> B<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> base<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:27.859> is

the exponent and n is the number another

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.069 
the exponent and n is the number another
nice<00:00:35.820> way<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.030> remember<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.899> start

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
nice way to remember this is to start

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.200 
nice way to remember this is to start
with<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> base<00:00:37.500> work<00:00:38.309> around<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> equal<00:00:38.969> sign

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
with the base work around the equal sign

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
with the base work around the equal sign
to<00:00:39.239> form<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> exponential<00:00:40.260> equation<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.370> here

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
to form the exponential equation so here

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.350 
to form the exponential equation so here
we<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.760> 3<00:00:42.469> raised<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> power<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.950> X<00:00:44.360> must

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
we have 3 raised to the power of X must

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.520 
we have 3 raised to the power of X must
equal<00:00:45.539> 81<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> 3<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.360> power<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.750> X<00:00:48.930> must

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
equal 81 so 3 to the power of X must

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.970 
equal 81 so 3 to the power of X must
equal<00:00:49.710> 81<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.629> we'll<00:00:51.809> solve<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.079> X<00:00:52.350> we

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
equal 81 and now we'll solve for X we

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.200 
equal 81 and now we'll solve for X we
can<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.399> without<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.820> use<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
can do this without the use of a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.930 
can do this without the use of a
calculator<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.590> write<00:00:55.680> 81<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.520> 3

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
calculator because we can write 81 as 3

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.110 
calculator because we can write 81 as 3
raised<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.510> power<00:00:57.949> 81<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.160> equal<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.460> 9<00:00:59.640> times

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
raised to a power 81 is equal to 9 times

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.260 
raised to a power 81 is equal to 9 times
9<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.260> 9<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.309> equal<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.730> 3<00:01:02.969> times<00:01:03.210> 3<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> 81<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
9 and 9 is equal to 3 times 3 so 81 is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.870 
9 and 9 is equal to 3 times 3 so 81 is
equal<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.570> 3<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.200> fourth<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.640> have

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
equal to 3 to the fourth so now we have

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
equal to 3 to the fourth so now we have
3<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> x<00:01:10.010> equals<00:01:11.010> 3<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> fourth<00:01:12.590> so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
3 to the x equals 3 to the fourth so

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.080 
3 to the x equals 3 to the fourth so
these<00:01:13.710> two<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.070> equal<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> bases<00:01:14.970> are

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
these two are equal and the bases are

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.270 
these two are equal and the bases are
the<00:01:15.240> same<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.750> therefore<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.710> exponents

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the same and therefore the exponents

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.280 
the same and therefore the exponents
must<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.549> equal<00:01:18.530> meaning<00:01:19.530> X<00:01:19.799> must<00:01:20.640> equal<00:01:20.820> 4

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.330 

well<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.380> x<00:01:25.530> equals<00:01:25.650> 4<00:01:26.540> then<00:01:27.540> log<00:01:28.049> base<00:01:28.320> 3<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:30.290> 81

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
well if x equals 4 then log base 3 of 81

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.679 
well if x equals 4 then log base 3 of 81
most<00:01:32.340> equal<00:01:32.670> 4<00:01:35.240> let's<00:01:36.240> take<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> look<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
most equal 4 let's take a look at a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.899 
most equal 4 let's take a look at a
second<00:01:36.990> example<00:01:37.220> we'll<00:01:38.220> set<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.460> equal<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
second example we'll set this equal to a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.539 
second example we'll set this equal to a
variable<00:01:39.000> let's<00:01:39.570> say<00:01:39.659> Y<00:01:40.159> write<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.430> an

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
variable let's say Y write this as an

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.899 
variable let's say Y write this as an
exponential<00:01:42.000> equation<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:43.380> 2<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> base<00:01:44.130> Y

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
exponential equation so 2 is the base Y

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.920 
exponential equation so 2 is the base Y
is<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.240> exponent<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.470> number<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.829> 32<00:01:47.930> so

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
is the exponent and the number is 32 so

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.230 
is the exponent and the number is 32 so
2<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.710> power<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.100> y<00:01:50.460> must<00:01:51.149> equal<00:01:51.329> 32<00:01:53.240> let's

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
2 to the power of y must equal 32 let's

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.090 
2 to the power of y must equal 32 let's
take<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> look<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:54.720> 32<00:01:56.299> 32<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.719> equal<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.200> 2<00:01:58.710> times

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
take a look at 32 32 is equal to 2 times

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.859 
take a look at 32 32 is equal to 2 times
16<00:02:00.079> 16<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.200> equal<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.469> 4<00:02:01.560> times<00:02:02.040> 4<00:02:02.509> 4<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.630> equal

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
16 16 is equal to 4 times 4 4 is equal

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.330 
16 16 is equal to 4 times 4 4 is equal
to<00:02:03.960> 2<00:02:04.140> times<00:02:04.439> 2<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.630> 1<00:02:06.869> 2<00:02:07.200> 3<00:02:07.229> 4<00:02:07.649> 5

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
to 2 times 2 so we have 1 2 3 4 5

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.100 
to 2 times 2 so we have 1 2 3 4 5
factors<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.849> 2<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:10.649> 32<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.489> 2<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.030> 5th

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
factors of 2 so 32 is 2 to the 5th

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.830 
factors of 2 so 32 is 2 to the 5th
so<00:02:13.230> two<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.770> power<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:14.160> y<00:02:14.520> equals<00:02:15.300> two<00:02:15.720> to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so two to the power of y equals two to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.500 
so two to the power of y equals two to
the<00:02:15.930> fifth<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.850> again<00:02:17.850> these<00:02:17.970> are<00:02:18.030> equal<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
the fifth and again these are equal the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.110 
the fifth and again these are equal the
bases<00:02:18.810> are<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.050> same<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:20.370> exponents<00:02:20.970> must

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
bases are the same so the exponents must

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.240 
bases are the same so the exponents must
be<00:02:21.240> equal<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.780> therefore<00:02:22.170> Y<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.710> equal<00:02:23.160> to

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
be equal and therefore Y is equal to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.400 
be equal and therefore Y is equal to
five<00:02:26.330> which<00:02:27.330> means<00:02:27.570> our<00:02:27.690> logarithm<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.320> equal

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
five which means our logarithm is equal

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.580 
five which means our logarithm is equal
to<00:02:28.680> five<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.880> have<00:02:29.970> log<00:02:30.210> base<00:02:31.250> two<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.280> 32

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
to five so we have log base two of 32

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.510 
to five so we have log base two of 32
equals<00:02:34.590> five<00:02:36.890> next<00:02:37.890> we'll<00:02:38.070> take<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.220> look<00:02:38.280> at

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
equals five next we'll take a look at

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.760 
equals five next we'll take a look at
two<00:02:38.670> examples<00:02:38.990> when<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.080> number<00:02:40.320> part<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.710> the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
two examples when the number part of the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.030 
two examples when the number part of the
logarithm<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> fraction
