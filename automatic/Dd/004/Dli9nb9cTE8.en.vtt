 I want to show several ways how 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.060
 Wound business scored in her at the time dacha 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.820
 the site was sung somewhere brought home to 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.519
 save for a while 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.400
 what kind of simple tips think this 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.529
 The theme of spring and summer is very important 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.609
 let's go to feb you probably know what 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.610
 main enemy 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.550
 the enemy of the vitamins contained in our 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.739
 really it is not light and heat under 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.579
 exposure to sunlight green 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.489
 quickly loses vitamin c and it can be 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.789
 several hours and so let me tell you 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.850
 show you how I keep potions fresh here 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.300
 first we need to wash you 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.430
 brought greens wash it I already washed 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.550
 rigged the water jet then dial 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.760
 you can immerse in some dishes of water 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.369
 completely green then you have to rinse 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.740
 that is, if you have it of course 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.640
 heavily polluted and then needed 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.680
 washed out and squeezed greens lay out 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.170
 on some paper towel 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:24.150
 should not be removed from the point and that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:28.110
 turned yellow and leave on the table let it 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.479
 dry for about 15 minutes after that the greens need 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.570
 move plastic container 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.530
 if you have vacuum plastic 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.740
 the container is even better if not 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.250
 plastic container then fit 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.960
 ordinary glass dry jar that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.740
 the main thing was dry inside 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.220
 with the usual cap now we put 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.460
 greenery 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.460
 Plastic container 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:06.009
 the target must be dry ship to 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.229
 lower shelf of the fridge and in such 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.929
 the place it can be stored is marked not 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.489
 turns yellow nothing spoils next 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.010
 we need the usual advice 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.050
 plastic bag is desirable of course 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.470
 so new in pack 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.970
 so that there are no little ones 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:30.030
 metro holes 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.180
 put our greens and where you can even 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.840
 blow 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.019
 I don't know, but itâ€™s better open wide 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.599
 there got more air and very 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:45.310
 tight hold up in stages desirable 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:48.190
 see how swollen very tightly tie 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.769
 we tightly tied the package there inside there 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.500
 air and need to put on the bottom shelf 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.440
 the fridge is also well kept too 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.349
 for long-term storage of herbs and 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.650
 It is necessary to sort out, that is, remove the yellow 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.569
 garbage but never wash it afterwards 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.380
 fold a plastic bag and go there 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:11.260
 put the servant's bulb 8 stripped 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.799
 can not be peeled and put also in 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.970
 fridge after 45 days you bulb 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:23.859
 take out change to another can be changed 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:27.400
 package and if it raw on the inside, too, and identity 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.910
 also the green is kept very long 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.389
 when I don't have time yet sometimes 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.030
 it happens yes I type in a mug 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.549
 boiled water and put requests there 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.849
 greenery is also preserved 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.690
 time but you need to change the water more often and 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:49.180
 look so that the tips do not rot and 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.720
 so sometimes for example mint yes 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.510
 she can give roots like this even on 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.790
 planted the next way for 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.540
 dumping greens for two or three weeks her 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.850
 need to rinse let drain water that is 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.990
 so she dried out a little and for this 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.090
 we need the paper can be 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.000
 kraft paper can be tight paper 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.230
 the towel is the main thing that it was not 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.329
 thin paper and which does not creep away 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.329
 now we will need to wrap 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.040
 we will need to wrap the greens 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.160
 spray damage or moisten 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:50.150
 under the temple after that put 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:57.050
 moistened bag paper bag 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:05:01.009
 plastic bag folded 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.770
 and put on the bottom shelf of the fridge 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.409
 that's the way two or three are saved 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.750
 weeks if there is no time rushing that 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:12.680
 need to completely wrap in greens 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:16.190
 a towel and also put something 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.840
 there is here all edges close and put 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.020
 on the bottom shelf is also very good 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.169
 saved maybe you have 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.919
 some such advice too so that 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.770
 save 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:32.780

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:35.870
