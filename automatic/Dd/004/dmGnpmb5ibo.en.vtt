want to show you guys various ways of
creating<00:00:08.730> glass<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.420> Maya<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.990> got<00:00:10.860> some

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
creating glass in Maya I got some

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.740 
creating glass in Maya I got some
questions<00:00:11.190> about<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.330> thought<00:00:12.540> I'd

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
questions about this and I thought I'd

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.120 
questions about this and I thought I'd
do<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> quick<00:00:13.049> tutorial<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.210> so<00:00:15.859> what<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.890> did

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
do a quick tutorial on it so what I did

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.340 
do a quick tutorial on it so what I did
is<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> very<00:00:18.029> basic<00:00:18.390> set<00:00:18.570> up<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.900> created<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
is a very basic set up I created a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.300 
is a very basic set up I created a
ground<00:00:19.590> plane<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.189> credit<00:00:20.850> three<00:00:22.100> cubes<00:00:23.100> that

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
ground plane and credit three cubes that

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.710 
ground plane and credit three cubes that
I<00:00:23.400> stretch<00:00:23.699> out<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.119> look<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.359> little<00:00:24.480> bit<00:00:24.660> like

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
I stretch out to look a little bit like

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.009 
I stretch out to look a little bit like
a<00:00:24.869> window<00:00:25.230> plane<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.449> I'm<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> apply

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
a window plane and I'm going to apply

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.230 
a window plane and I'm going to apply
some<00:00:28.050> different<00:00:28.769> materials<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.670> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
some different materials to this to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.549 
some different materials to this to
create<00:00:30.810> some<00:00:30.900> glass<00:00:31.610> okay<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.899> we're<00:00:34.380> going<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
create some glass okay so we're going to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.770 
create some glass okay so we're going to
select<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.860> first<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.600> we're<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.690> to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
select the first one and we're going to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.160 
select the first one and we're going to
right<00:00:37.079> click<00:00:37.110> go<00:00:38.030> down<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.360> assign<00:00:40.020> new

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
right click go down to assign new

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.950 
right click go down to assign new
material<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:41.149> we're<00:00:42.149> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.420> look<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
material and we're going to look for the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.200 
material and we're going to look for the
MIAA

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
MIAA

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.029 
MIAA
underscore<00:00:45.210> material<00:00:45.930> underscore<00:00:46.559> X<00:00:47.210> like<00:00:48.210> so

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
underscore material underscore X like so

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.900 
underscore material underscore X like so
then<00:00:50.039> we're<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:50.610> into<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
then we're going to go into the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.459 
then we're going to go into the
attribute<00:00:51.030> editor<00:00:51.360> we're<00:00:51.960> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> select

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
attribute editor we're going to select

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.639 
attribute editor we're going to select
the<00:00:52.980> material<00:00:53.730> tab<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.360> we're<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.500> go

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the material tab and we're going to go

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.400 
the material tab and we're going to go
into<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.250> presets<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.170> then<00:00:58.170> I'm<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.379> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
into the presets and then I'm going to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.799 
into the presets and then I'm going to
go<00:00:58.530> down<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.070> glass<00:00:59.579> solid<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:01.070> replace<00:01:02.809> now

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
go down to glass solid and replace now

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.630 
go down to glass solid and replace now
if<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.650> go<00:01:04.830> into<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.869> render<00:01:06.869> settings<00:01:07.640> I'm

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
if we go into the render settings I'm

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.190 
if we go into the render settings I'm
just<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> quick<00:01:09.570> render<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:10.020> I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
just going to do a quick render here I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140 
just going to do a quick render here I
selected<00:01:10.680> mental<00:01:11.100> ray<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
selected mental ray because this is a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.719 
selected mental ray because this is a
mental<00:01:12.540> ray<00:01:12.630> material<00:01:13.430> just<00:01:14.430> going<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
mental ray material just going to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.840 
mental ray material just going to
quickly<00:01:16.130> create<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.340> quality<00:01:17.549> of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
quickly create a quality of

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.830 
quickly create a quality of
approximately<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:20.640> size<00:01:20.939> okay

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
approximately one and this size okay

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.350 
approximately one and this size okay
that's<00:01:22.049> fine<00:01:22.229> okay<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:23.939> created<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
that's fine okay so I just created a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.880 
that's fine okay so I just created a
couple<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.630> point<00:01:24.840> lights<00:01:25.049> here<00:01:25.439> I'm<00:01:25.770> just

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
couple of point lights here I'm just

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.399 
couple of point lights here I'm just
going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.159> see<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.610> looks<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:30.409> just

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
going to see what this looks like just

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.130 
going to see what this looks like just
give<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> second<00:01:34.790> okay<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.869> see

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
give that a second okay as you can see

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.980 
give that a second okay as you can see
there's<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> kind<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.610> blue<00:01:38.939> glow<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.840> this

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
there's a kind of a blue glow to this

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.039 
there's a kind of a blue glow to this
and<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:41.280> typically<00:01:41.820> use<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.270> glass<00:01:42.540> when<00:01:42.930> I'm

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and I typically use this glass when I'm

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.380 
and I typically use this glass when I'm
creating<00:01:43.829> something<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.640> has<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.210> bit

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
creating something that has a little bit

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.499 
creating something that has a little bit
of<00:01:45.450> body<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> person<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.509> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
of body like a person like that so

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.929 
of body like a person like that so
that's<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.049> way<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.560> now<00:01:50.399> we're<00:01:50.820> going

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that's one way to do it now we're going

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.660 
that's one way to do it now we're going
to<00:01:51.000> close<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.600> render<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.430> we're<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
to close this render here we're going to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.899 
to close this render here we're going to
select<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.210> second<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.840> right<00:01:55.549> click<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.729> it

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
select the second one right click on it

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.020 
select the second one right click on it
go<00:01:57.090> down<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.140> assign<00:01:58.469> new<00:01:58.619> material<00:01:59.030> we're

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
go down to assign new material we're

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.350 
go down to assign new material we're
going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> select<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.750> same<00:02:00.930> material<00:02:01.380> again

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
going to select the same material again

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.730 
going to select the same material again
but<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.540> case<00:02:03.750> I'm<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.439> go<00:02:04.530> into

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
but in this case I'm going to go into

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.130 
but in this case I'm going to go into
the<00:02:04.860> presets<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.939> I'm<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.689> go<00:02:06.840> with

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the presets and I'm going to go with

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
the presets and I'm going to go with
glass<00:02:07.560> thin<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.750> replace<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.849> we're<00:02:11.849> going

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
glass thin and replace and we're going

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:31.470 
glass thin and replace and we're going
to<00:02:12.030> do<00:02:12.090> another<00:02:12.270> render

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.480 

okay<00:02:32.480> now<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:32.810> looks<00:02:33.140> very<00:02:33.320> very<00:02:33.860> similar

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
okay now this looks very very similar

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.580 
okay now this looks very very similar
but<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:34.940> fact<00:02:35.210> it's<00:02:35.420> not<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.990> difference

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
but in the fact it's not the difference

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.850 
but in the fact it's not the difference
between<00:02:37.010> these<00:02:37.160> two<00:02:37.460> is<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:38.030> when<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.260> have

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
between these two is that when you have

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.130 
between these two is that when you have
light<00:02:40.310> coming<00:02:40.580> through<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.330> surface<00:02:41.840> it's

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
light coming through the surface it's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.370 
light coming through the surface it's
going<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.440> respond<00:02:43.040> differently<00:02:43.780> in<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.990> flat

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
going to respond differently in a flat

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.980 
going to respond differently in a flat
surface<00:02:46.040> like<00:02:46.070> this<00:02:46.460> not<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.540> big<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.930> a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
surface like this not so big of a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.340 
surface like this not so big of a
difference<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:49.310> what<00:02:49.670> I'll<00:02:49.790> do<00:02:50.000> here<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.540> just

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
difference but what I'll do here is just

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.250 
difference but what I'll do here is just
to<00:02:51.800> illustrate<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:52.360> I'm<00:02:53.360> going<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.720> create

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
to illustrate that I'm going to create

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.700 
to illustrate that I'm going to create
two<00:02:54.350> quick<00:02:54.920> spheres<00:02:55.430> here<00:02:56.290> which<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.500> can

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
two quick spheres here which you can

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.460 
two quick spheres here which you can
consider<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:59.770> know<00:03:00.770> kind<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.460> solid<00:03:01.790> object

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
consider a know kind of a solid object

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.520 
consider a know kind of a solid object
I'm<00:03:03.470> just<00:03:03.770> going<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.010> pull<00:03:04.190> these<00:03:04.310> two<00:03:04.550> up<00:03:05.530> and

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
I'm just going to pull these two up and

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.890 
I'm just going to pull these two up and
I'm<00:03:06.980> going<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.190> quickly<00:03:07.400> assign<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.720> two

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
I'm going to quickly assign the two

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.160 
I'm going to quickly assign the two
different<00:03:09.410> types<00:03:09.710> that<00:03:09.890> we<00:03:10.100> use<00:03:10.280> so<00:03:10.460> far<00:03:11.170> so

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
different types that we use so far so

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.320 
different types that we use so far so
the<00:03:12.620> first<00:03:12.890> one<00:03:13.130> I'm<00:03:13.520> going<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:13.880> go<00:03:14.060> with

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
the first one I'm going to go with

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.790 
the first one I'm going to go with
presets<00:03:15.130> glass<00:03:16.130> solid<00:03:16.700> or<00:03:16.970> place<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:18.380> second

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
presets glass solid or place the second

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.690 
presets glass solid or place the second
one<00:03:18.980> right<00:03:19.520> click<00:03:19.760> assign<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.750> material<00:03:21.700> same

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
one right click assign the material same

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.450 
one right click assign the material same
material<00:03:23.590> presets<00:03:24.590> glass<00:03:26.410> then<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.800> replace

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
material presets glass then and replace

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.380 
material presets glass then and replace
and<00:03:29.770> we're<00:03:30.770> just<00:03:30.950> going<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.220> zoom<00:03:31.910> in<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.180> these

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
and we're just going to zoom in on these

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.290 
and we're just going to zoom in on these
two<00:03:32.630> here<00:03:32.990> and<00:03:33.640> I'm<00:03:34.640> just<00:03:34.670> going<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.060> do<00:03:35.180> an

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
two here and I'm just going to do an

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:56.020 
two here and I'm just going to do an
additional<00:03:35.600> render

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.960 

we'll<00:03:56.810> just<00:03:56.990> get<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.319> second<00:04:03.819> okay

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
we'll just get that second okay

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.420 
we'll just get that second okay
now<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:05.750> can<00:04:05.959> clearly<00:04:06.500> see<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:07.069> difference

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
now you can clearly see the difference

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.110 
now you can clearly see the difference
within<00:04:07.760> these<00:04:07.940> two<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:08.959> left<00:04:09.560> one<00:04:09.800> here<00:04:10.310> is<00:04:10.610> a

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
within these two this left one here is a

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.710 
within these two this left one here is a
solid<00:04:11.720> glass<00:04:12.560> ball<00:04:13.160> so<00:04:13.520> to<00:04:13.550> speak<00:04:13.850> and<00:04:14.150> this

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
solid glass ball so to speak and this

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.680 
solid glass ball so to speak and this
one<00:04:14.930> is<00:04:15.140> more<00:04:15.410> like<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.620> glass<00:04:15.950> bubble<00:04:16.730> but

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
one is more like a glass bubble but

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.770 
one is more like a glass bubble but
again<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.230> see<00:04:18.470> this<00:04:18.769> blue<00:04:19.430> is<00:04:19.609> kind<00:04:20.030> of<00:04:20.150> hue

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
again you see this blue is kind of hue

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.290 
again you see this blue is kind of hue
on<00:04:20.989> it<00:04:21.169> that<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.799> know<00:04:21.889> it's<00:04:22.610> not<00:04:22.940> always<00:04:23.090> what

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
on it that you know it's not always what

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.260 
on it that you know it's not always what
you<00:04:23.330> want<00:04:23.680> so<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:25.220> third<00:04:25.520> example<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:26.180> I'm

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
you want so the third example that I'm

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.480 
you want so the third example that I'm
going<00:04:26.389> to<00:04:26.419> show<00:04:26.600> you<00:04:26.630> is<00:04:27.110> what<00:04:27.860> if<00:04:27.950> you<00:04:28.070> want<00:04:28.310> to

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
going to show you is what if you want to

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.340 
going to show you is what if you want to
have<00:04:28.700> an<00:04:28.940> absolutely<00:04:29.510> clear<00:04:30.350> glass<00:04:31.340> plane<00:04:32.350> now

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
have an absolutely clear glass plane now

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.390 
have an absolutely clear glass plane now
this<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.490> specific<00:04:35.120> to<00:04:35.419> my<00:04:36.220> 2014

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
this is specific to my 2014

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.850 
this is specific to my 2014
so<00:04:38.000> I'll<00:04:38.360> just<00:04:38.570> explain<00:04:38.900> what's<00:04:39.470> going<00:04:39.530> on

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
so I'll just explain what's going on

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.310 
so I'll just explain what's going on
there<00:04:40.100> we're<00:04:40.910> going<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.120> select<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.840> the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
there we're going to select the the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.220 
there we're going to select the the
object<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:43.090> instead<00:04:44.090> of<00:04:44.150> right-clicking<00:04:44.960> an

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
object and instead of right-clicking an

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.870 
object and instead of right-clicking an
assign<00:04:45.560> new<00:04:45.710> material<00:04:45.740> because<00:04:46.640> we're<00:04:46.790> going

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
assign new material because we're going

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.180 
assign new material because we're going
to<00:04:46.940> use<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.150> dielectric<00:04:47.780> material<00:04:47.930> we<00:04:48.919> need<00:04:49.070> to

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
to use a dielectric material we need to

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.090 
to use a dielectric material we need to
get<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.550> from<00:04:49.790> our<00:04:49.940> hypershade<00:04:50.570> so<00:04:51.500> select

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
get that from our hypershade so select

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.340 
get that from our hypershade so select
the<00:04:52.490> plane<00:04:53.000> go<00:04:53.840> up<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.169> window<00:04:55.570> go<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.600> render

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
the plane go up to window go to render

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.830 
the plane go up to window go to render
editors<00:04:58.600> hypershade<00:04:59.600> and<00:05:01.660> we're<00:05:02.660> going<00:05:02.810> to

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
editors hypershade and we're going to

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.950 
editors hypershade and we're going to
search<00:05:03.710> for<00:05:04.510> D<00:05:05.510> ie<00:05:06.790> okay<00:05:07.790> dielectric<00:05:08.540> material

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
search for D ie okay dielectric material

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.350 
search for D ie okay dielectric material
and<00:05:10.120> there<00:05:11.120> it<00:05:11.210> is<00:05:11.360> now<00:05:12.350> we're<00:05:12.890> going<00:05:13.070> to

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
and there it is now we're going to

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.719 
and there it is now we're going to
middle<00:05:14.360> mouse<00:05:14.539> click<00:05:14.570> on<00:05:15.080> this<00:05:15.289> and<00:05:15.729> we're

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
middle mouse click on this and we're

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.520 
middle mouse click on this and we're
going<00:05:16.850> to<00:05:16.880> drag<00:05:17.210> it<00:05:17.419> out<00:05:17.539> and<00:05:17.780> release<00:05:18.200> it<00:05:18.440> on

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
going to drag it out and release it on

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.040 
going to drag it out and release it on
top<00:05:18.979> of<00:05:19.250> that<00:05:19.610> object<00:05:19.789> like<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:20.300> okay<00:05:21.020> so

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
top of that object like so okay so

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.490

it<00:05:29.840> a<00:05:29.990> bug<00:05:30.289> but<00:05:30.650> it's<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:30.979> bit<00:05:31.400> of<00:05:31.430> an<00:05:31.610> issue<00:05:31.729> with

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
it a bug but it's a bit of an issue with

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.180 
it a bug but it's a bit of an issue with
my<00:05:33.229> 2014<00:05:34.010> it<00:05:34.970> has<00:05:35.450> been<00:05:35.720> adjusted<00:05:36.080> within<00:05:36.919> an

my 2014 it has been adjusted within an

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.310 
my 2014 it has been adjusted within an
update<00:05:37.550> but<00:05:38.000> for<00:05:38.240> now<00:05:38.450> if<00:05:38.840> you<00:05:38.990> want<00:05:39.169> this<00:05:39.260> to

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
update but for now if you want this to

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.730 
update but for now if you want this to
work<00:05:39.470> what<00:05:40.070> you<00:05:40.190> do<00:05:40.340> is<00:05:40.960> after<00:05:41.960> applying<00:05:42.530> the

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
work what you do is after applying the

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.510 
work what you do is after applying the
material<00:05:43.330> selector<00:05:44.330> object<00:05:44.800> go<00:05:45.800> into<00:05:46.190> the

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
material selector object go into the

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.290 
material selector object go into the
dielectric<00:05:47.000> material<00:05:47.479> tab<00:05:47.750> right<00:05:48.440> here<00:05:49.300> then

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
dielectric material tab right here then

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.140 
dielectric material tab right here then
go<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:51.020> surface<00:05:51.919> material<00:05:53.289> check<00:05:54.289> on<00:05:54.470> the

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
go to surface material check on the

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.990 
go to surface material check on the
checker<00:05:56.150> box<00:05:56.360> and<00:05:57.250> then<00:05:58.250> we're<00:05:58.669> going<00:05:58.789> to<00:05:58.820> go

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
checker box and then we're going to go

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.469 
checker box and then we're going to go
to<00:05:59.060> the<00:05:59.810> legacy<00:06:00.470> materials<00:06:01.070> down<00:06:01.280> here<00:06:01.700> like

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
to the legacy materials down here like

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.029 
to the legacy materials down here like
so<00:06:02.780> and<00:06:03.700> within<00:06:04.700> that<00:06:05.240> checklist<00:06:05.800> we're<00:06:06.800> going

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
so and within that checklist we're going

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.469 
so and within that checklist we're going
to<00:06:07.190> look<00:06:07.400> for<00:06:07.640> our<00:06:07.669> that

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
to look for our that

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.809 
to look for our that
material<00:06:09.050> and<00:06:09.169> as<00:06:09.740> you'll<00:06:09.919> see<00:06:10.159> this<00:06:10.430> green

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:10.819 
material and as you'll see this green

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.739 
material and as you'll see this green
color<00:06:11.090> will<00:06:11.449> turn<00:06:11.479> to<00:06:12.289> red<00:06:13.029> like<00:06:14.029> so<00:06:14.860> okay<00:06:15.860> now

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:16.749 
color will turn to red like so okay now

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:20.379 
color will turn to red like so okay now
if<00:06:17.749> we<00:06:17.960> render<00:06:18.199> this<00:06:18.669> we<00:06:19.669> should<00:06:19.879> see<00:06:20.150> a

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
if we render this we should see a

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.999 
if we render this we should see a
complete<00:06:20.930> clear<00:06:21.379> glass<00:06:22.839> plane<00:06:23.839> okay<00:06:24.770> here<00:06:24.919> we

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
complete clear glass plane okay here we

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:53.380 
complete clear glass plane okay here we
go

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:07:01.360 

let's<00:06:54.390> give<00:06:54.720> it<00:06:54.750> another<00:06:54.990> second<00:06:58.460> excuse<00:06:59.460> me

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
let's give it another second excuse me

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.650 
let's give it another second excuse me
and<00:07:02.370> already<00:07:02.550> you<00:07:02.760> can<00:07:02.790> see<00:07:03.180> this<00:07:03.480> is<00:07:03.630> a

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
and already you can see this is a

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.150 
and already you can see this is a
totally<00:07:04.320> different<00:07:04.710> look

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
totally different look

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.450 
totally different look
the<00:07:05.970> glass<00:07:06.240> is<00:07:06.680> without<00:07:07.680> color<00:07:08.040> it's

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
the glass is without color it's

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.450 
the glass is without color it's
completely<00:07:09.120> clear<00:07:09.800> this<00:07:10.800> is<00:07:11.010> something<00:07:11.430> that

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 
completely clear this is something that

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.000 
completely clear this is something that
I<00:07:11.700> would<00:07:11.790> use<00:07:12.330> when<00:07:12.660> creating<00:07:12.990> the<00:07:13.560> windows

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010 
I would use when creating the windows

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.990 
I would use when creating the windows
and<00:07:14.220> building<00:07:14.640> and<00:07:14.790> such<00:07:14.970> and<00:07:16.370> as<00:07:17.370> you<00:07:17.610> can<00:07:17.730> see

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
and building and such and as you can see

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.850 
and building and such and as you can see
it<00:07:18.300> looks<00:07:18.540> very<00:07:19.080> very<00:07:19.710> different<00:07:21.440> so<00:07:22.440> in<00:07:22.560> short

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
it looks very very different so in short

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.430 
it looks very very different so in short
this<00:07:23.400> these<00:07:23.910> are<00:07:24.150> a<00:07:24.180> couple<00:07:24.900> of<00:07:25.020> types<00:07:25.230> of

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 
this these are a couple of types of

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.410 
this these are a couple of types of
glass<00:07:25.620> you<00:07:25.830> can<00:07:25.920> create<00:07:26.220> and<00:07:26.610> some<00:07:27.090> of<00:07:27.210> them

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:27.420 
glass you can create and some of them

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.080 
glass you can create and some of them
come<00:07:27.780> from<00:07:27.810> the<00:07:28.110> MIAA<00:07:28.440> material<00:07:29.220> and<00:07:29.520> this

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.090 
come from the MIAA material and this

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.790 
come from the MIAA material and this
specific<00:07:30.270> one<00:07:30.780> comes<00:07:31.080> from<00:07:31.170> the<00:07:31.320> dielectric

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800
