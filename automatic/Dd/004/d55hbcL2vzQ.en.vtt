hey<00:00:16.690> what's<00:00:16.930> up<00:00:17.050> guys<00:00:17.230> BSU<00:00:17.800> truck<00:00:18.010> for<00:00:18.160> an<00:00:18.220> 88

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
hey what's up guys BSU truck for an 88

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.160 
hey what's up guys BSU truck for an 88
here<00:00:18.820> with<00:00:19.330> a<00:00:19.360> problem

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
here with a problem

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.590 
here with a problem
my<00:00:20.860> four-wheel<00:00:21.280> drive<00:00:21.520> I<00:00:21.880> discovered<00:00:22.480> the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
my four-wheel drive I discovered the

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.440 
my four-wheel drive I discovered the
other<00:00:22.630> day<00:00:23.160> will<00:00:24.160> not<00:00:24.340> engage<00:00:24.930> now<00:00:26.220> normally<00:00:27.220> I

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 
other day will not engage now normally I

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.269 
other day will not engage now normally I
guess<00:00:28.450> the<00:00:28.630> way<00:00:28.779> that<00:00:28.810> a<00:00:29.140> jeeps<00:00:29.560> transmission

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
guess the way that a jeeps transmission

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.000 
guess the way that a jeeps transmission
transfer<00:00:31.029> case<00:00:31.210> works<00:00:31.660> is<00:00:32.850> quite<00:00:33.850> simple

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
transfer case works is quite simple

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.479 
transfer case works is quite simple
where<00:00:36.010> you<00:00:36.580> have<00:00:37.050> your<00:00:38.050> shifter<00:00:38.559> and<00:00:39.309> you<00:00:39.400> have

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
where you have your shifter and you have

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.250 
where you have your shifter and you have
your<00:00:39.640> transfer<00:00:40.000> case<00:00:40.150> it's<00:00:40.450> working<00:00:41.110> on<00:00:41.230> a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
your transfer case it's working on a

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.450 
your transfer case it's working on a
vacuum<00:00:41.710> actuation<00:00:42.309> system<00:00:43.410> where<00:00:44.410> okay<00:00:45.400> so

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
vacuum actuation system where okay so

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.439 
vacuum actuation system where okay so
there's<00:00:45.940> a<00:00:46.000> vacuum<00:00:46.449> in<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:47.409> system<00:00:47.769> well<00:00:49.589> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
there's a vacuum in the system well I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.689 
there's a vacuum in the system well I
have<00:00:52.449> a<00:00:53.250> vacuum<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:55.570> at<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.110> shack<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.650> if<00:00:57.580> I

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
have a vacuum here at the shack and if I

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:06.140 
have a vacuum here at the shack and if I
go<00:00:57.879> over<00:00:58.120> here<00:01:01.589> there<00:01:02.589> is<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.769> vacuum<00:01:05.100> here

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
go over here there is a vacuum here

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.490 
go over here there is a vacuum here
where<00:01:07.150> it<00:01:07.270> starts<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:10.000> go<00:01:10.180> down<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:11.260> this<00:01:11.350> is

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
where it starts if I go down and this is

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.719 
where it starts if I go down and this is
gonna<00:01:11.620> suck<00:01:11.920> for<00:01:12.130> me<00:01:12.159> to<00:01:12.340> do<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:14.520> hold<00:01:15.520> on<00:01:15.700> a

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
gonna suck for me to do but hold on a

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.109 
gonna suck for me to do but hold on a
second<00:01:16.299> if<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:19.450> go<00:01:19.600> down<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.899> my<00:01:20.020> transfer<00:01:20.469> case

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
second if I go down to my transfer case

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:29.760 
second if I go down to my transfer case
see<00:01:22.119> if<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.420> guys<00:01:22.630> can<00:01:23.020> see<00:01:26.100> okay<00:01:29.530> now<00:01:29.740> I

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
see if you guys can see okay now I

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.319 
see if you guys can see okay now I
care<00:01:30.070> each<00:01:30.250> other

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.539 

yeah

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.069 

see<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.469> that's<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.770> vacuum<00:01:41.130> line<00:01:42.079> section

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
see that that's the vacuum line section

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.709 
see that that's the vacuum line section
that<00:01:43.259> connects<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.859> transfer<00:01:44.280> case<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
that connects to the transfer case if I

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.200 
that connects to the transfer case if I
pull<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.170> off<00:01:46.490> while<00:01:47.490> shifting<00:01:47.759> into

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
pull that off while shifting into

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.440 
pull that off while shifting into
four-wheel<00:01:48.570> drive<00:01:49.130> or<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.280> there<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.270> no

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
four-wheel drive or not there is no

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.760 
four-wheel drive or not there is no
vacuum<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:53.159> somewhere<00:01:53.640> between<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.719> and<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
vacuum so somewhere between that and the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.309 
vacuum so somewhere between that and the
engine<00:01:56.130> compartment<00:01:56.689> either<00:01:57.689> there's<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.079> leak

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
engine compartment either there's a leak

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.249 
engine compartment either there's a leak
or<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.579> broken<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.240> honestly<00:02:01.110> don't

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
or it's just broken I honestly don't

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.620 
or it's just broken I honestly don't
know<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.729> over<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> axle<00:02:03.509> which

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
know and over there on the axle which

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.789 
know and over there on the axle which
you<00:02:03.750> can't<00:02:03.929> see<00:02:04.020> because<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.439> light<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.740> this

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
you can't see because the light on this

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.590 
you can't see because the light on this
phone<00:02:05.039> is<00:02:05.549> retarded<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.149> stupid

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
phone is retarded and stupid

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.300 
phone is retarded and stupid
can't<00:02:07.409> wait<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.649> train<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.039> piece<00:02:08.280> of

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.190 
can't wait to train in this piece of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.030 

there's<00:02:10.920> no<00:02:11.099> vacuum<00:02:11.579> there<00:02:11.730> either<00:02:13.040> so

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
there's no vacuum there either so

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.110 
there's no vacuum there either so
