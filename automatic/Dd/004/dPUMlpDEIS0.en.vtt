00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.860
 silence without windy afternoon 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.590
 thin, trembling lips filled with air, we 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.779
 in a research institute 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.700
 beekeeping lives freely here 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.989
 bees 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.500
 pollen and nectar in the very 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.510
 a wide assortment of scientists find out on 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.050
 what plants are most likely to fly to 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.809
 what is studying their role in pollination from 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.000
 Correctly chosen food supply in 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.449
 performance depends a lot 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.850
 winged mida collector here successfully 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.920
 engaged in breeding derive new 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.789
 rocks for a variety of climatic 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.789
 country zones 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.610
 here are stubbornly seeking prevention methods and 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.200
 fight bee diseases 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.260
 and in the department of biology in bio physical 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.600
 the lab is studying bee language yes yes 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.330
 there are pretty perfect bees 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.790
 sound alarm can be put 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.270
 there were a microphone and hear different 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.360
 conversations 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.990
 even taping them is not easy 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.979
 fun 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.760
 the sound of the bee colony is judged on 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.760
 biological condition 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.750
 set for example what signals 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.870
 frequency of 210 two hundred forty hertz 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.770
 without uterine family reacts to 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.770
 appearance mate 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.289
 see uterus character signals 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.289
 testifies that it is accepted 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.580
 happen that for some reason the family is not 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.950
 wanting to take uterus kills her 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.950
 and then the signals are different 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.910
 compare frequency data plate and 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.710
 the characteristics of these sounds 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.220
 fixed film differences 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.220
 obviously 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.510
 transfer dancing bees know that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.910
 returning with a good booty scout 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.190
 here is such a kind of dance reports 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.760
 other working bees address where 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.360
 just visited dance accompanies 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.320
 is always 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.260
 and songs more activity 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.020
 sounded the dance phase the more in the song 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.040
 impulses the farther away 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.040
 source of karma 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.300
 strictly for each distance 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.300
 certain acoustic indicators a 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.730
 Now let's hear what this one is concerned about. 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.739
 still homeless swarm here goes something like 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.730
 discuss where he will settle down so far 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.730
 fly to work 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.080
 it scouts forager survey 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.080
 feed base 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.500
 come back tell 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:53.240
 yes typical distance information to 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:55.640
 places of abundant honey collection fly to 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.040
 searches scout quartermaster and 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.040
 few hives and need to settle in one 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.609
 because quartermaster bees dance 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.590
 long foraging skys need time for 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.590
 matching to choose 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.760
 gradually one any route 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.360
 becomes common to most 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:27.610
 scout quartermaster of choice made 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:31.840
 and a special signal is coming total collection this 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.650
 signal at frequencies of 400 550 hertz 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:41.070
 intense of all the general strongest 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.070
 the excitement and settling of the hive begins 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.810
 with housewarming great workers 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.300
 learn to understand and reproduce 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.070
 beeps mean learn 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.070
 manage the life of bees
