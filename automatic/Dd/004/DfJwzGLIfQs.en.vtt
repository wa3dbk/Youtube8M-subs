00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 we are back with a 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.980
 traveler 5 and in this case we are playing 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.109
 a new career as writing with 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.220
 subscribers and well I guess there will be 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.599
 that go here less bad that is 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.210
 also put in contact because if not 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.950
 sometimes I would not have bundled it 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.780
 come on and I really do not want to have put 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.199
 I have no contact but it has happened to me 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.660
 the time I was doing by finishing 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.279
 edit a video and just then has 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.560
 started to fall well that I realize 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.449
 and I do not have time to change the settings 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.070
 but well let's see how we 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.080
 wait for this race today 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.940
 because it looks pretty epic 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.399
 we have around here about 70 world live 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.910
 as you are seeing there are not so many 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.559
 chase like about 7 or something like that we're going to 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 see how it was because it gave me the race 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.629
 it paints pretty pretty well 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.789
 we take this did not give before it went super well 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.200
 and foregoing we can have done 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.300
 quite full without opposition already 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.820
 bet for certain 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.829
 this bet on an area is set on 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.829
 the return we go here 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.339
 we go 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.890
 eye note I knew I was going to bounce 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.850
 I knew it was going to bounce so the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.060
 bit of a bit 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.030
 come on, I'm sorry it can be good 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.000
 eyes 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.600
 come on, we crash 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.740
 we bounce again no no 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.620
 no no no no it 's complicated thing 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.770
 It is quite complicated 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.240
 and now we do it right let's go fast 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.500
 as fast around here we vote is not 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.490
 lowering the press car here is 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.079
 going down very soon so it gives up 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.610
 and the currency of this race is going to be 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.030
 quite quite complicated guys 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.939
 let's see if we get it but now 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.210
 I say it's going to be a difficult race how much 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.210
 less 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.690
 do not 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.280
 it can not be the best attempts that 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.619
 we were doing and the best 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.619
 come on let's go back 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.819
 eye not because because you have to do that 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.770
 does good well with the container not 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.290
 just give it a little bit at the end 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.189
 but you have to give it quite well 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.189
 come on let's go 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.019
 do not 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.730
 it's difficult in this race it's pretty 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.989
 pretty complicated 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.989
 let's see if this time 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.660
 do not 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.750
 no no no no this is going to be very difficult 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.480
 but well let's think about what 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.739
 we can do well 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.739
 and so it does not work out 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.850
 ok not very high I knew I did not know 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.490
 more girl very high known that was 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.580
 it was a bad attempt 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.150
 Come, come, come, let's try again 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.150
 to see if now 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.420
 one 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.340
 you are not wrong 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.660
 when that happens it is very difficult because 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.819
 there has not been the moment I am 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.740
 looking and it seems that is not what happened 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.970
 no one 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:27.260
 because this race looks like being 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.260
 the one that will last 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.910
 quite 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.010
 it looks like he's going to play kid 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.500
 Come on, lad, come on, kid, I'm staying here 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.600
 stopped and all godmother for that to happen 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.319
 well and look at someone and take the 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.880
 race but we're not going there 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.390
 I can not believe 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:54.350
 in the past right behind me 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:58.470
 and he did not go out he did not have a good kid 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.930
 well we had 1234 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.120
 and 5 the same root here but of the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.000
 complicated in addition to the complicated 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.050
 because this is not done like that a second 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.610
 marriage I think we go starts 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.319
 even the race six people if not 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.079
 I'm wrong 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.389
 and I was going to the end 1 we're also going 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.039
 to say or more I hope not but the 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.690
 if they have flown very much 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.669
 very much we have made it super fast 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.770
 for how difficult it is seriously this 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.009
 race is one of the most difficult 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.990
 we can do because it's like I've seen 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.720
 five guards we will see results of 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:35.180
 new one 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.470
 2 1 and 2 3 4 and 5 what I said and over 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.820
 we have to go all the time crashing 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.460
 you have to send us well you have already seen 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.810
 which is complicated and we have done it 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.100
 pretty fast as fun well 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.660
 I would really appreciate it if you can 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.530
 brushes subscribe to this guy but 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.310
 none and see you in the next 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.310
 goodbye
