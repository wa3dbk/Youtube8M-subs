in<00:00:00.599> this<00:00:00.719> video<00:00:00.930> I'm<00:00:01.110> going<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.260> show<00:00:01.410> you<00:00:01.500> how

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.740 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:01.740> deal<00:00:02.040> with<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.310> tight<00:00:02.730> fit<00:00:03.120> between<00:00:03.419> the

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
to deal with a tight fit between the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.559 
to deal with a tight fit between the
driveshaft<00:00:04.410> in<00:00:04.799> any<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.910> police<00:00:06.299> or

possibilities that might cause our be a
tight<00:00:12.719> fit<00:00:12.750> one<00:00:14.509> during<00:00:15.509> assembly<00:00:16.080> when<00:00:16.289> they

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
tight fit one during assembly when they

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.400 
tight fit one during assembly when they
build<00:00:16.800> these<00:00:17.010> with<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.550> set<00:00:17.760> screws<00:00:18.150> they<00:00:18.960> put

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
build these with the set screws they put

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.870 
build these with the set screws they put
locked<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> set<00:00:20.100> screw<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.430> possibly

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
locked on the set screw it's possibly

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.490 
locked on the set screw it's possibly
they've<00:00:21.000> gotten<00:00:21.270> too<00:00:21.510> much<00:00:21.750> locked<00:00:22.050> tight<00:00:22.320> on

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
they've gotten too much locked tight on

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.929 
they've gotten too much locked tight on
the<00:00:22.710> set<00:00:22.949> true<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.400> actually<00:00:23.519> running

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the set true and it's actually running

the whole and partially filled the hole

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
the whole and partially filled the hole
one<00:00:26.640> other<00:00:26.760> thing<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.060> note<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.269> when<00:00:27.539> you're

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
one other thing to note is when you're

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.240 
one other thing to note is when you're
assembling<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.080> make<00:00:28.260> sure<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.769> back<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
assembling it make sure you do back the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.859 
assembling it make sure you do back the
set<00:00:29.429> screw<00:00:29.670> out<00:00:29.880> enough<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> set<00:00:30.720> screw

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
set screw out enough that the set screw

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.799 
set screw out enough that the set screw
itself<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.349> not<00:00:31.470> blocking<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:32.009> hole<00:00:32.660> that's<00:00:33.660> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
itself is not blocking a hole that's a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.060 
itself is not blocking a hole that's a
good<00:00:33.960> first<00:00:34.200> thing<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.500> check<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:34.860> if<00:00:34.950> you've

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
good first thing to check but if you've

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.030 
good first thing to check but if you've
done<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.700> still<00:00:35.850> fitting<00:00:36.180> tight<00:00:37.040> one

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
done that it's still fitting tight one

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
done that it's still fitting tight one
thing<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.579> check<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> tight<00:00:39.930> fit

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
thing is to check if it is a tight fit

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.470 
thing is to check if it is a tight fit
what<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.040> check<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:41.670> what's

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
what you can do is check to see what's

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.049 
what you can do is check to see what's
tight<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.050> know<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.430> pulleys<00:00:44.610> type

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
tight you know or all the pulleys type

tight you know or all the pulleys type
on<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.570> shaft<00:00:45.840> or<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.340> pulley

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
on the shaft or is it just one pulley

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
on the shaft or is it just one pulley
that's<00:00:47.879> tight<00:00:48.090> if<00:00:48.300> they're<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.750> tight<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
that's tight if they're all tight on the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
sanding like this or you can put it in a

it's<00:01:13.380> very<00:01:13.740> rare<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.189> would<00:01:14.430> happen

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it's very rare that that would happen

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
it's very rare that that would happen
but<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.909> might<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.409> them

need just a little bit of sanding to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.020 
need just a little bit of sanding to
clean<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.650> up<00:01:19.770> once<00:01:20.430> you've<00:01:20.580> done<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.759> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
clean it up once you've done that it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.840 
clean it up once you've done that it
should<00:01:21.240> slide<00:01:21.479> thru<00:01:21.540> nice<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.259> free<00:01:22.549> if<00:01:23.549> only

one<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.869> pulleys<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.320> tight<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> shaft

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
one of the pulleys is tight on the shaft

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.310 
one of the pulleys is tight on the shaft
I<00:01:26.400> mean<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> likely<00:01:27.330> either<00:01:27.479> has<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> lot<00:01:28.020> tight

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
I mean it likely either has a lot tight

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.200 
I mean it likely either has a lot tight
on<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.710> may<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> burrow<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.790> something

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
on it may have a burrow on it something

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.690 
on it may have a burrow on it something
else<00:01:30.409> then<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.770> take<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> round<00:01:32.340> file

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
else then you can just take a round file

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.219 
else then you can just take a round file
if<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.840> file<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> hole<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:36.509> keep<00:01:36.810> checking

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
if we file in the hole and keep checking

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.390 
if we file in the hole and keep checking
the<00:01:37.259> shaft<00:01:37.619> until<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.520> nice<00:01:38.640> fit<00:01:40.400> that's

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the shaft until it's a nice fit that's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.420 
the shaft until it's a nice fit that's
true<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.600> main<00:01:43.350> pulleys<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
true of the main pulleys that go on the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.980 
true of the main pulleys that go on the
shaft<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.970> also<00:01:45.119> true<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> motor<00:01:45.750> pulley

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
shaft it's also true of the motor pulley

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.260 
shaft it's also true of the motor pulley
to<00:01:46.799> go<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.490> real<00:01:47.700> tight<00:01:47.939> fit

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
to go on there it's a real tight fit

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.330 
to go on there it's a real tight fit
it's<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.540> fairly<00:01:48.780> nice<00:01:49.049> snug<00:01:49.560> fit<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:50.070> begin

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it's a fairly nice snug fit to begin

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.770 
it's a fairly nice snug fit to begin
with<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:51.000> where<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.299> really<00:01:51.600> just

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
with but if it's where you really just

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.429 
with but if it's where you really just
can't<00:01:52.020> even<00:01:52.140> press<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.579> try<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
can't even press it on and try a you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.780 
can't even press it on and try a you
know<00:01:55.530> check<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.979> shows<00:01:56.159> no<00:01:56.340> burrs<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
know check that I shows no burrs on the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.539 
know check that I shows no burrs on the
motor<00:01:56.939> shaft<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.420> should<00:01:57.540> maybe<00:01:57.719> just<00:01:57.810> check

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
motor shaft it should maybe just check

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.830 
motor shaft it should maybe just check
then<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.820> also<00:01:59.939> make<00:02:00.420> sure<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.659> set

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
then you can also make sure you set

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.260 
then you can also make sure you set
screws<00:02:01.049> backed<00:02:01.290> out<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.130> pulley<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.610> then

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
screws backed out on the pulley and then

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.910 
screws backed out on the pulley and then
as<00:02:03.390> needed<00:02:03.719> file<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.530> bit<00:02:04.740> to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
as needed file it just a little bit to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.360 
as needed file it just a little bit to
clean<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> out<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.719> then<00:02:06.719> make<00:02:07.170> sure

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
clean it out and then make sure

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.850 
clean it out and then make sure
it's<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.550> smooth<00:02:07.760> fit<00:02:08.060> on<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.510> motor<00:02:08.860> that's

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
it's a smooth fit on the motor that's

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.140 
it's a smooth fit on the motor that's
the<00:02:10.040> main<00:02:10.190> thing<00:02:10.220> she<00:02:10.610> should<00:02:10.760> have<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.030> do

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
the main thing she should have to do

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.580 
the main thing she should have to do
when<00:02:11.390> you're<00:02:11.510> building<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.380> should<00:02:12.560> just

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
when you're building it you should just

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.080 
when you're building it you should just
build<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.100> it's<00:02:13.250> fine<00:02:13.460> but<00:02:13.700> if<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:13.910> run

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
build it and it's fine but if you run

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.250 
build it and it's fine but if you run
into<00:02:14.120> any<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.480> those<00:02:14.540> issues<00:02:14.690> those<00:02:15.080> are<00:02:15.170> just
