 pauli two draws and four victories 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.600
 paderborn 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.759
 tabular ninth paderborn 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.380
 35 points and Pauli is twelfth with 32 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.780
 points 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.650
 m 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.860
 otherwise the scorers in both 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.770
 unite each fly player at the 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.840
 top of the scorers list 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.090
 borrowed from st pauli daniel ginczek 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.850
 from german champion with 12 dollars 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.630
 behind of bartels fabian boll marius 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.850
 ebbers &amp; more with significantly fewer goals 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.250
 it goes with four the rest 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.680
 in each case with two goals already 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.190
 clear distance to daniel ginczek at 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.899
 paderborn flat hierarchy here 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.990
 best scorer philipp hofmann 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.470
 player from the revier club fc schalke 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:13.300
 So in principle a small Derby in 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.540
 Sturm von Schalke and second best scorer 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.130
 the alban alban meha with five goals 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.810
 maybe he once again a 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.660
 nice free kick out you do not know 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.959
 otherwise deniz yilmaz with 4 tobias 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.200
 kempe with 3 and thomas bertels also 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.200
 With 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.600
 Well, how about injury? 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.420
 technically kevin schindler injured 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.560
 sÃ¶ren gonther the ex paderborn the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.350
 again and again a cruciate ligament tear behind 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.020
 otherwise here daniel ginczek there 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.640
 has still in the last game the red 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.500
 card has been won for two games 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.650
 So locked I just do not got me 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.900
 a relative i think then will 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.560
 marius ebbers the storm position 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.560
 take over 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.300
 good 35 years of otherwise still 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.520
 playmaker talent christopher buchtmann 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.670
 hurt again in england 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.540
 on the way at the fc liverpool 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.350
 before that from the youth of dortmund after 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.800
 england changed 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.950
 at paderborn there are a few 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 less hurt sebastian long the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.190
 torre replacement goalkeeper otherwise manuel 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.500
 guilder muscular fiber of the palionis by ok 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.480
 which is only locked in the dfb cup but 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.940
 but there are already four days of play 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.720
 otherwise there is no other one now 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.900
 injured on the plan and 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.670
 which is typical for the game I guess 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.680
 one saw at the scorer that 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.680
 pauli quite dependent on 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.549
 by daniel ginczek is and therefore type 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.329
 I ended up here on a 1 0 victory 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.329
 the paderborn
