00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.810 

in<00:00:06.270> any<00:00:06.420> town<00:00:06.720> there's<00:00:07.109> usually<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.830> clock

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
in any town there's usually a clock

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.520 
in any town there's usually a clock
tower<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.510> course<00:00:09.690> mine<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.990> no<00:00:10.139> different

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
tower and of course mine is no different

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.190 
tower and of course mine is no different
I<00:00:10.590> decided<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.040> put<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> clock<00:00:11.490> tower<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.969> here

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
I decided to put a clock tower in here

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.200 
I decided to put a clock tower in here
and<00:00:13.200> as<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.160> can<00:00:14.250> see<00:00:14.309> up<00:00:14.580> there<00:00:14.610> at<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.880> top<00:00:15.059> I

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
and as you can see up there at the top I

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.700 
and as you can see up there at the top I
got<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> pendulum<00:00:15.870> which<00:00:16.020> goes<00:00:16.199> back<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.650> forth

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
got a pendulum which goes back and forth

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
got a pendulum which goes back and forth
which<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.190> basically<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:18.000> minecart<00:00:19.730> but

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
which is basically just a minecart but

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.310 
which is basically just a minecart but
it<00:00:21.060> also<00:00:21.180> has<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> mechanism<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:22.170> which

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
it also has a mechanism here which

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.700 
it also has a mechanism here which
causes<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.949> ring<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:24.199> I'll<00:00:25.199> show<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.500> how

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
causes it to ring and I'll show you how

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.609 
causes it to ring and I'll show you how
that<00:00:25.769> works<00:00:26.660> go<00:00:27.660> inside<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.109> front<00:00:28.260> door<00:00:28.500> is

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
that works go inside the front door is

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.540 
that works go inside the front door is
here<00:00:30.740> now<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.009> get<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.430> also

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
here now as you get to here it also

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.299 
here now as you get to here it also
makes<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.120> ticking<00:00:33.450> noise<00:00:33.480> which<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.020> very<00:00:34.200> nice

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.530 

haven't<00:00:38.309> actually<00:00:38.399> decorated<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:39.300> yet

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
haven't actually decorated in here yet

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.220 
haven't actually decorated in here yet
got<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.500> some<00:00:40.680> point<00:00:42.230> let's

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
got to get to that at some point let's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.660 
got to get to that at some point let's
go<00:00:43.500> over<00:00:43.649> roof<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.520> right

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
go over roof and as you can see right

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.000 
go over roof and as you can see right
here<00:00:50.879> I've<00:00:51.149> got<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.780> inside<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.890> here

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
here I've got the inside here and here

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.160 
here I've got the inside here and here
it's<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> bell<00:00:53.340> tower<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:57.020> basically<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it's a bell tower and basically have a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.049 
it's a bell tower and basically have a
mechanism<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.859> here<00:00:59.100> which<00:00:59.280> actually

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
mechanism in here which actually

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.130 
mechanism in here which actually
triggers<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:03.270> bell<00:01:03.480> sounds<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.080> what

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
triggers the the bell sounds and what

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.170 
triggers the the bell sounds and what
happens<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> dispenser<00:01:05.339> puts<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> block<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
happens is a dispenser puts a block on a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.750 
happens is a dispenser puts a block on a
pressure<00:01:06.840> plate<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.830> once<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.460> block

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
pressure plate and once that block

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.480 
pressure plate and once that block
disappears<00:01:09.560> which<00:01:10.560> however<00:01:10.770> long<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.159> takes<00:01:11.340> I

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
disappears which however long it takes I

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.700 
disappears which however long it takes I
can't<00:01:11.640> remember<00:01:11.760> how<00:01:11.970> long<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:13.560> actually

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
can't remember how long but it actually

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
can't remember how long but it actually
triggers<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> minecart<00:01:14.700> which<00:01:15.119> goes<00:01:15.570> along<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
triggers a minecart which goes along and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.410 
triggers a minecart which goes along and
plays<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> sounds<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.270> I'll<00:01:18.270> just

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
plays all the sounds and I'll just

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.730 
plays all the sounds and I'll just
remove<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.840> block<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.229> quick<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.680> can

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
remove the block really quick so you can

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.460 
remove the block really quick so you can
see<00:01:20.750> that<00:01:21.750> way<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.990> once<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.259> gets<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
see that way and then once it gets to

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.620 
see that way and then once it gets to
the<00:01:28.560> end<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.920> sort<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> resets<00:01:29.520> itself<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the end it sort of resets itself and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.929 
the end it sort of resets itself and
gets<00:01:30.810> ready<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> next<00:01:31.470> run<00:01:31.650> at<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> same

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
gets ready for the next run at the same

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.310 
gets ready for the next run at the same
time<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.240> course<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.479> triggers<00:01:33.750> another<00:01:33.900> block

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
time of course it triggers another block

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.920 
time of course it triggers another block
out<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.150> pressure<00:01:36.150> plate<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:38.930> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
out on the pressure plate and the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.630 
out on the pressure plate and the
ticking<00:01:40.259> sound<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.650> actually<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
ticking sound is actually up here in the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.109 
ticking sound is actually up here in the
top<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.890> put<00:01:43.890> some<00:01:44.070> glowstone<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.670> inside<00:01:44.970> there

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
top I put some glowstone up inside there

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.670 
top I put some glowstone up inside there
to<00:01:45.210> try<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.390> backlight<00:01:45.930> everything<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.590> in

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
to try and backlight everything up in

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.679 
to try and backlight everything up in
there<00:01:46.799> which<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.340> neat<00:01:47.850> little<00:01:48.000> effect

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
there which was a neat little effect

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.399 
there which was a neat little effect
from<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> outside<00:01:49.409> which<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.860> nice<00:01:51.229> also<00:01:52.229> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
from the outside which is nice also you

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.319 
from the outside which is nice also you
can<00:01:52.530> see<00:01:52.740> basically<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.090> dispenser

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
can see basically it's a dispenser

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.660 
can see basically it's a dispenser
on<00:01:56.869> a<00:01:56.930> block<00:01:57.289> and<00:01:57.530> as<00:01:57.680> that<00:01:57.859> car<00:01:57.920> goes<00:01:58.280> back<00:01:58.460> and

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
on a block and as that car goes back and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.010 
on a block and as that car goes back and
forth<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:59.030> makes<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.299> nice<00:01:59.420> little<00:01:59.479> ticking

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
forth it makes a nice little ticking

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.300 
forth it makes a nice little ticking
noise<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.549> tried<00:02:01.549> using<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.710> sound<00:02:03.710> box<00:02:03.950> but

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
noise I tried using a a sound box but

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.179 
noise I tried using a a sound box but
problem<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.729> is<00:02:04.909> it<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:06.469> went<00:02:06.710> really<00:02:06.890> far

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
problem is is it it it went really far

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.830 
problem is is it it it went really far
the<00:02:07.369> sound<00:02:07.549> was<00:02:07.759> like<00:02:07.789> really<00:02:08.149> loud<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.539> it

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
the sound was like really loud and it

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.600 
the sound was like really loud and it
went<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.289> long<00:02:09.619> way<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.220> can<00:02:10.369> hear<00:02:10.489> the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
went a long way and you can hear the

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.800 
went a long way and you can hear the
ticking<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:10.970> throughout<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.269> whole<00:02:11.420> town<00:02:11.629> it

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
ticking in throughout the whole town it

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.619 
ticking in throughout the whole town it
