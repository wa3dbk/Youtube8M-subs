this is already but you also need to
enter<00:03:09.520> four<00:03:10.210> numbers<00:03:10.510> with<00:03:10.690> using<00:03:10.960> after<00:03:11.230> life

into<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.740> fuse<00:03:12.460> box<00:03:12.670> right<00:03:12.850> here<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.150> it's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
into this fuse box right here and it's

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.820 
into this fuse box right here and it's
very<00:03:13.720> very<00:03:13.780> hard<00:03:14.140> because<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.440> numbers<00:03:14.680> keep

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
very very hard because the numbers keep

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.190 
very very hard because the numbers keep
sort<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.310> cycling<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.060> there<00:03:16.930> are<00:03:17.020> four

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
sort of cycling and there are four

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.240 
sort of cycling and there are four
numbers<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.560> guys<00:03:17.650> like<00:03:17.770> I<00:03:17.860> said<00:03:18.010> she<00:03:18.160> had

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
numbers of guys like I said she had

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.980 
numbers of guys like I said she had
stopped<00:03:18.400> riding<00:03:18.580> at<00:03:18.760> least<00:03:18.910> one<00:03:19.150> or<00:03:19.450> even<00:03:19.510> two

afterlife's<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.220> this<00:03:21.400> but<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.000> numbers<00:03:22.270> are

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
afterlife's to this but the numbers are

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.300 
afterlife's to this but the numbers are
eight<00:03:22.540> seven<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.110> 10<00:03:24.570> 1386<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.840> then<00:03:26.050> 481<00:03:26.770> she

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
eight seven to 10 1386 and then 481 she

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.650 
eight seven to 10 1386 and then 481 she
doesn't<00:03:27.550> need<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.730> enter<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:27.970> in<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.390> order

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
doesn't need to enter that in the order

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.210 
doesn't need to enter that in the order
and<00:03:28.810> each<00:03:29.200> time<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.590> guys<00:03:29.680> get<00:03:29.860> them<00:03:29.950> correct

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
and each time you guys get them correct

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.340 
and each time you guys get them correct
then<00:03:30.670> they<00:03:30.790> will<00:03:30.880> reset<00:03:31.300> just<00:03:31.959> kind<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.140> into<00:03:32.290> a

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
then they will reset just kind of into a

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.690 
then they will reset just kind of into a
random<00:03:32.530> number<00:03:32.890> code<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.370> also<00:03:33.459> need<00:03:33.640> to

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
random number code and you also need to

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.220 
random number code and you also need to
enter<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.060> numbers<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:34.870> right<00:03:35.020> here<00:03:35.140> I'm

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
enter the numbers so right here I'm

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.380 
enter the numbers so right here I'm
entering<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.590> third<00:03:35.770> number<00:03:35.920> which<00:03:36.160> is<00:03:36.390> 386

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
entering the third number which is 386

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.540 
entering the third number which is 386
and<00:03:37.740> you<00:03:38.740> guys<00:03:38.800> will<00:03:38.920> see<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.160> ones<00:03:39.340> who<00:03:39.430> do

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
and you guys will see the ones who do

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.010 
and you guys will see the ones who do
that<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:39.850> will<00:03:39.910> reset<00:03:40.270> in<00:03:40.450> disarray<00:03:40.780> num

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
that it will reset in disarray num

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.930 
that it will reset in disarray num
number<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.440> then<00:03:41.950> my<00:03:42.340> friend<00:03:42.580> actually<00:03:42.700> dies

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
here next to the plane and use we need

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.650 
here next to the plane and use we need
to<00:04:32.650> have<00:04:32.770> him<00:04:32.800> go<00:04:33.130> on<00:04:33.370> top<00:04:33.639> of<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.850> plane<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:34.570> he
