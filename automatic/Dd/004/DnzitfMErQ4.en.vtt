I'll just call it the invisible car

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.830 
I'll just call it the invisible car
glitch<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.140> looks<00:00:40.410> pretty<00:00:40.800> nice<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.790> guess<00:00:42.510> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
glitch it looks pretty nice I guess I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.240 
glitch it looks pretty nice I guess I
don't<00:00:43.050> know<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.620> at<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:44.000> yeah<00:00:46.190> although<00:00:47.190> you

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
don't know like at all yeah although you

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.850 
don't know like at all yeah although you
can't<00:00:47.640> throw<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.030> ball<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:50.510> you<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
can't throw the ball and you just I

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.819 
can't throw the ball and you just I
don't<00:00:53.640> know<00:00:53.909> how<00:00:54.089> to<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.829> that

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
don't know how to get out of that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.410 
don't know how to get out of that
position<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:57.360> stuck<00:00:57.839> yeah<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> um<00:01:02.030> just<00:01:03.030> wow

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
position it's stuck yeah so um just wow

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
position it's stuck yeah so um just wow
I<00:01:05.450> find<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.570> kind<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.080> hard<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.440> imagine<00:01:07.830> he

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
I find that kind of hard to imagine he

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.760 
I find that kind of hard to imagine he
went<00:01:08.399> under<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.030> course<00:01:09.300> and<00:01:09.539> now<00:01:09.690> he<00:01:10.530> somehow

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
went under the course and now he somehow

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.609 
went under the course and now he somehow
got<00:01:11.100> ripped<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> his<00:01:12.030> vehicle<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.619> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
got ripped out of his vehicle and so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.570 
got ripped out of his vehicle and so
well<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:15.140> just<00:01:16.140> don't<00:01:17.070> know<00:01:17.220> what<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.399> say

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.670 

and<00:02:50.680> another<00:02:51.520> question<00:02:52.239> not<00:02:52.780> getting<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.410> boost

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
and another question not getting a boost

and another question not getting a boost
Connor

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.410 

wait<00:03:16.530> Connor<00:03:16.830> go<00:03:17.129> back<00:03:17.280> down<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.519> tiny<00:03:17.909> bit<00:03:18.180> I

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
wait Connor go back down a tiny bit I

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.850 
wait Connor go back down a tiny bit I
think<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.140> saw<00:03:19.379> like<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.629> somewhere<00:03:21.629> oh<00:03:21.860> no

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
think I saw like on a somewhere oh no

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.430 
think I saw like on a somewhere oh no
that<00:03:23.099> was<00:03:23.220> just<00:03:23.459> how<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.090> plastic<00:03:24.870> Trek<00:03:25.260> was

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
that was just how the plastic Trek was

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.890 
that was just how the plastic Trek was
put<00:03:25.709> together<00:03:25.890> never<00:03:26.489> mind<00:03:26.819> but<00:03:27.599> it<00:03:27.690> did<00:03:27.870> look

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
put together never mind but it did look
