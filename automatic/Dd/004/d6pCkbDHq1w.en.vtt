00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.580
 hello to everyone today in this 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.969
 video I propose a slap convent 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.929
 from my technical book for the 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.580
 low this is the number 11 pages 50 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:21.980
 I start with you play it as 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.970
 usually at the metronome at tempo 210 1 2 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.970
 3 4 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.820
 so at the rhythm level already it's 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.809
 very simple that semiquavers 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:52.180
 so four notes starting at 2 3 4 1 2 3 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:55.010
 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 etc 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.989
 we'll start by typing the half agreement 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.149
 with the thumb then we just hit the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.980
 strings with the left hand with the 3 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:09.890
 must play like these and that must 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.689
 give a door a thump 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:18.650
 percussion in fact so pushes the 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:21.040
 demagoguery and again everything upside down in 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.930
 the fingers on the strings 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.710
 we come back to type the rope so what 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:33.950
 do three things in fact damer gandini 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:36.229
 an empty typed my left leaves to my 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.810
 left workshops and voted with the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:48.820
 pushes so that's two three and we 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.820
 repeat this gesture twice so 3 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:02:19.840
 1 2 then we do a series of hammer 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.840
 all in box 5 and 7 on the rope of the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:32.310
 body coordinates of one of your orders 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:40.500
 and and when the skin grows with 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:45.860
 so again rope rope 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:51.230
 and rope there again again from the 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.230
 great life from there 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:59.500
 the bodies of the company have joined its two 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.500
 parts it's done 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.710

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.320
 group 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:39.900
 the second is the same as 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:46.560

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.020
 repeated gesture twice that makes 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:58.830
 I would have done 307 a little faster and 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.360
