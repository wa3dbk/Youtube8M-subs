00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 We cover the area with paper 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.190
 need a ruler for a pencil 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:15.389
 maybe even an eraser then 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.029
 we need one of those for leaf in 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.619
 We know where to finish everything 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.150
 glue it on and we put it first 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.640
 page and then six din a 4 sheets 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.699
 Here I have once purple green white 10 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.690
 yellow brand you can also use other colors 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.860
 take six din a 4 sheets as well 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.340
 to cut 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:47.460
 Now look for a 4 leaves and stripes and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.050
 Although I have ever done 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.550
 made 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.649
 we are the long and the white and 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.910
 then we need a greenish one 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:05.360
 roads can sometimes me because 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:07.010
 strokes one takes ingeniously lighter and 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.170
 cake on 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:18.210
 to mark and always one 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:23.119
 half past 15 cm 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.119
 make yourself points here 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.450
 then you make below will also 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.450
 times the points 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:53.330
 We ask that we use the known ones 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.330
 all the messages among each other 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.400
 so that makes it the leaf and then you have to 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:25.659
 of course, still a scissors and obtained 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:27.670
 you have the stripes off then you have 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:31.390
 you once purple green and white stripes 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.359
 the surface to the side does the same 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.329
 you now with the saviors you lay 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:43.060
 because so not so up but 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:45.340
 obliquely to the width and does that 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.319
 same to this weather, that has become 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:54.400
 already prepared you call again 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:56.489
 the distances one and a half centimeters and 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.519
 connects them 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:04.409
 and then you make stripes again 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.409
 has on it 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.390
 of the oranges of the yellow and 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.900
 I already had roses 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:30.560
 which prepares these stripes or 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:33.770
 take the white sheet of paper and her 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.280
 I still need a trip pen 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.280
 Totally forgot 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.190
 with pen and then we start to to the 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:49.460
 glue 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:54.850
 First, you stick those stripes the 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:05:02.290
 shortest strip and that makes you 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:09.740
 once a section about 2 cm 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:12.190
 rather above and two inches once 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.190
 below 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:44.360
 then you start on these pieces once 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.360
 just to glue on side by side 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.270
 when now comes our yellow stripes 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:56.270
 Of course you can also look for it 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.270
 we want to do that which takes color 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.820
 if nobody give 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:18.419
 that's what makes you roll club nice 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.610
 next to each other then we have one more 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.070
 oranges we have to cut and 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.130
 then you start again with pink yellow 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:29.070
 Orange city ​​sticking to the leaf end 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:33.199
 and when you 're done , I'll show you 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.199
 you in the second video how it goes on
