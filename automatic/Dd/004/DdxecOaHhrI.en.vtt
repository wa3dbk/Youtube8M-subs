00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
no I could just then not even have to

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.750 
no I could just then not even have to
pick<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.730> lock<00:03:12.560> break<00:03:13.560> again<00:03:13.920> I'd<00:03:14.370> even<00:03:14.580> hit

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
pick the lock break again I'd even hit

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.460 
pick the lock break again I'd even hit
the<00:03:14.850> door<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:15.239> somehow<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.660> broke<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:18.480> it's

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
the door but somehow it broke so it's

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.860 
the door but somehow it broke so it's
easy<00:03:19.680> they<00:03:20.640> would<00:03:20.820> pick<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.120> lock<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.540> don't

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
easy they would pick the lock I don't

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.600 
easy they would pick the lock I don't
think<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:23.340> breaking<00:03:23.940> works<00:03:24.709> for<00:03:25.709> more<00:03:25.830> mobs

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
think the breaking works for more mobs

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.170 
think the breaking works for more mobs
