into this project now for two hundred

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.050 
into this project now for two hundred
and<00:02:57.270> twenty<00:02:57.510> feet<00:02:57.690> long<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:59.580> seems<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.910> be

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
and twenty feet long and it seems to be

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.550 
and twenty feet long and it seems to be
a<00:03:00.090> good<00:03:00.300> solid<00:03:00.570> roof<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.170> we're<00:03:01.260> not<00:03:01.380> seeing

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
a good solid roof and we're not seeing

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.230 
a good solid roof and we're not seeing
any<00:03:01.770> movement<00:03:02.010> out<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.520> membrane<00:03:02.790> at<00:03:03.090> this

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
any movement out of the membrane at this

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.000 
any movement out of the membrane at this
point<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.660> seems<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.960> God<00:03:04.200> all<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.650> taken

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
point it seems to God all of that taken

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.280 
point it seems to God all of that taken
out<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.340> deck<00:03:05.570> yeah<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.810> think<00:03:07.050> the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
out of the deck yeah I think the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.290 
out of the deck yeah I think the
flexible<00:03:07.710> pest<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.610> doing<00:03:08.970> what<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.210> was

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
flexible pest is doing what it was

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.960 
flexible pest is doing what it was
designed<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.810> do<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.830> new<00:03:11.010> roof<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.460> expected

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
designed to do the new roof is expected

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.150
