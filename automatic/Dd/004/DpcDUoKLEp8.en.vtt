00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.570 
down and I'm going to keep it an inch or
so<00:00:43.909> from<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.600> existing<00:00:45.170> edge<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:46.040> that<00:00:46.070> it

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
so from the existing edge so that it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.060 
so from the existing edge so that it
also<00:00:46.820> curves<00:00:47.480> out<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.230> will<00:00:48.500> fit<00:00:48.680> around<00:00:48.860> my

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
also curves out and will fit around my

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.430 
also curves out and will fit around my
hips<00:00:49.309> since<00:00:49.820> it's<00:00:50.000> long<00:00:50.239> so<00:00:50.690> I'm<00:00:50.960> not<00:00:51.199> going<00:00:51.379> to

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
hips since it's long so I'm not going to

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.960 
hips since it's long so I'm not going to
make<00:00:51.559> it<00:00:51.620> completely<00:00:52.250> tight<00:00:52.580> all<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:52.850> way

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
make it completely tight all the way

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.200 
make it completely tight all the way
down<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:53.390> then<00:00:53.479> this<00:00:54.260> top<00:00:54.589> row<00:00:55.400> actually

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
down and then this top row actually

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.240 
down and then this top row actually
where<00:00:56.479> it<00:00:56.600> would<00:00:56.750> be<00:00:56.900> one<00:00:57.229> strip<00:00:57.559> here<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.070> one

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
where it would be one strip here and one

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.700 
where it would be one strip here and one
here<00:00:58.280> I'm<00:00:59.030> going<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.360> fold<00:00:59.570> it<00:00:59.720> over<00:00:59.839> to<00:01:00.530> make

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
here I'm going to fold it over to make

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.100 
here I'm going to fold it over to make
it<00:01:00.860> doubly<00:01:01.400> thick<00:01:01.670> at<00:01:01.909> the<00:01:02.150> top<00:01:02.360> so<00:01:02.690> hopefully

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
it doubly thick at the top so hopefully

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.930 
it doubly thick at the top so hopefully
it'll<00:01:03.290> help<00:01:03.620> stay<00:01:04.280> up<00:01:04.460> a<00:01:04.549> little<00:01:04.670> bit<00:01:04.850> better

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
it'll help stay up a little bit better

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.060 
it'll help stay up a little bit better
and<00:01:05.210> maybe<00:01:05.390> i<00:01:05.510> can<00:01:05.600> put<00:01:05.840> elastic<00:01:06.110> in<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.680> later

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
and maybe i can put elastic in it later

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.130 
and maybe i can put elastic in it later
on<00:01:08.320> on<00:01:09.820> me<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.000> final<00:01:11.180> project<00:01:11.780> is<00:01:11.930> long

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
on on me the final project is long

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.899 
on on me the final project is long
enough<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.620> be<00:01:12.740> addressed<00:01:13.040> but<00:01:13.430> I<00:01:13.490> just<00:01:13.700> hiked

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
enough to be addressed but I just hiked

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.730 
enough to be addressed but I just hiked
up<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.120> bottom<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:14.690> make<00:01:14.720> it<00:01:14.990> a<00:01:15.049> long<00:01:15.229> top<00:01:15.530> as

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
up the bottom to make it a long top as

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.219 
up the bottom to make it a long top as
you<00:01:16.039> can<00:01:16.159> see<00:01:16.430> here<00:01:16.789> I<00:01:16.820> have<00:01:16.969> the<00:01:17.420> first<00:01:17.750> row

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
you can see here I have the first row

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.310 
you can see here I have the first row
doubled<00:01:18.979> over<00:01:19.399> and<00:01:19.670> tied<00:01:20.060> into<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:20.960> second

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
doubled over and tied into the second

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.219 
doubled over and tied into the second
row<00:01:21.469> so<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:21.740> do<00:01:21.860> have<00:01:22.189> that<00:01:22.430> EE<00:01:23.420> thick<00:01:23.719> band<00:01:23.990> at

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
row so I do have that EE thick band at

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.050 
row so I do have that EE thick band at
the<00:01:24.320> top<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:24.680> it<00:01:24.770> actually<00:01:24.920> stayed<00:01:25.490> up<00:01:25.700> really

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
the top and it actually stayed up really

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.730 
the top and it actually stayed up really
well<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:26.689> i<00:01:26.719> don't<00:01:27.020> think<00:01:27.229> i'm<00:01:27.350> going<00:01:27.469> to<00:01:27.560> add

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
well so i don't think i'm going to add

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.370 
well so i don't think i'm going to add
straps<00:01:28.189> or<00:01:28.369> anything<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:28.969> it<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.990> ended<00:01:30.289> up

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
straps or anything to it and it ended up

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.469 
straps or anything to it and it ended up
being<00:01:30.649> fairly<00:01:31.070> tight<00:01:31.490> really<00:01:32.090> quick<00:01:32.270> though<00:01:32.420> i

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
being fairly tight really quick though i

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.359
