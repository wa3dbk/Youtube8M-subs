from<00:02:50.909> each<00:02:51.150> other<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.750> level<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.409> the<00:02:52.620> card

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
from each other is the level of the card

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.379 
from each other is the level of the card
which<00:02:53.670> makes<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.239> different<00:02:54.569> potential<00:02:56.389> for

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
which makes it a different potential for

sharecash<00:03:46.850> up<00:03:47.060> inventories<00:03:47.570> I<00:03:47.780> think<00:03:48.650> the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
sharecash up inventories I think the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.460 
sharecash up inventories I think the
obvious<00:03:49.340> answer<00:03:49.490> this<00:03:49.820> one<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.240> no<00:03:50.690> then<00:03:51.260> does

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
obvious answer this one is no then does

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.530 
obvious answer this one is no then does
not<00:03:51.740> share<00:03:52.100> cash<00:03:52.370> up<00:03:52.610> inventories<00:03:53.150> they<00:03:53.390> did

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
not share cash up inventories they did

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.380 
not share cash up inventories they did
away<00:03:53.630> with<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:54.050> seems<00:03:54.620> like<00:03:54.830> with<00:03:55.580> nice<00:03:56.209> of

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
away with that seems like with nice of

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.479 
away with that seems like with nice of
Cygnus<00:03:56.810> I<00:03:57.020> mean<00:03:57.170> they<00:03:57.770> haven't<00:03:57.920> given<00:03:58.130> us<00:03:58.340> a

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
Cygnus I mean they haven't given us a

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.150 
Cygnus I mean they haven't given us a
single<00:03:58.790> assets<00:03:59.300> at<00:03:59.959> a<00:04:00.020> cache<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.800> inventory

of<00:04:18.980> a<00:04:19.160> combo<00:04:19.579> system<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:20.810> can<00:04:20.959> use<00:04:21.109> as<00:04:21.260> a

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
of a combo system you can use as a

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.610 
of a combo system you can use as a
phantom<00:04:21.769> like<00:04:22.370> we<00:04:22.520> do<00:04:22.910> use<00:04:23.060> expand<00:04:23.479> them<00:04:23.630> where

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
phantom like we do use expand them where

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.219 
phantom like we do use expand them where
you<00:04:24.890> attack<00:04:25.250> you<00:04:25.850> can<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.330> can<00:04:26.479> have<00:04:27.140> a

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
you attack you can you can have a

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.409 
you attack you can you can have a
percent<00:04:27.620> chance<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:28.160> get<00:04:28.490> cards<00:04:28.970> from

percent chance to get cards from

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.810 
percent chance to get cards from
monsters<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.290> it<00:04:30.800> fills<00:04:31.040> up<00:04:31.130> your<00:04:31.190> stack<00:04:31.550> here

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
monsters and it fills up your stack here

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.630 
monsters and it fills up your stack here
once<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.210> gets<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:32.390> a<00:04:32.510> maximum<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:34.340> can<00:04:34.370> use<00:04:34.580> a

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
once it gets to a maximum you can use a

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.880 
once it gets to a maximum you can use a
beginner<00:04:34.880> skill<00:04:35.210> right<00:04:35.390> here<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:36.710> will

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
beginner skill right here that will

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.130 
beginner skill right here that will
shoot<00:04:37.400> those<00:04:37.550> cards<00:04:37.820> back<00:04:38.090> out<00:04:38.270> at<00:04:38.479> a<00:04:38.510> single

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
Monster it's kind of strong and I don't

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.530 
Monster it's kind of strong and I don't
know<00:04:41.870> it's<00:04:42.020> it's<00:04:42.229> um<00:04:43.150> it's<00:04:44.150> not<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.419> best

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
know it's it's um it's not the best

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.820 
know it's it's um it's not the best
skill<00:04:44.900> but<00:04:45.050> you<00:04:45.140> know<00:04:45.229> it<00:04:45.440> probably<00:04:45.650> gets

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
skill but you know it probably gets

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.680 
skill but you know it probably gets
better<00:04:46.070> than<00:04:46.250> for<00:04:46.400> long<00:04:46.610> for<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.210> long<00:04:47.419> ago

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
better than for long for the long ago

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.050 
better than for long for the long ago

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
along and my second part is that when

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.480 
along and my second part is that when
will<00:04:56.030> fantaz<00:04:56.419> be<00:04:56.570> in<00:04:56.660> GMS<00:04:57.050> is<00:04:57.320> my<00:04:57.530> actual<00:04:58.070> fifth

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
will fantaz be in GMS is my actual fifth

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.350 
will fantaz be in GMS is my actual fifth
question<00:05:00.220> it's<00:05:01.220> speculated<00:05:01.760> they'll<00:05:02.000> be<00:05:02.150> in

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
question it's speculated they'll be in

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.730 
question it's speculated they'll be in
GMS<00:05:02.720> sort<00:05:03.680> of<00:05:03.800> early<00:05:04.160> summer<00:05:04.640> of<00:05:05.380> two<00:05:06.380> thousand

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
GMS sort of early summer of two thousand

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.360 
GMS sort of early summer of two thousand
twelve<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:08.080> it's<00:05:09.080> just<00:05:09.260> speculation<00:05:09.470> but<00:05:10.310> it

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
twelve so it's just speculation but it

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.190 
twelve so it's just speculation but it
should<00:05:10.550> be<00:05:10.580> around<00:05:10.700> that<00:05:11.000> time<00:05:12.070> yeah<00:05:14.200> that's

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
should be around that time yeah that's
