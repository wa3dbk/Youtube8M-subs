00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:12.090
 hello to all and all these green ellis 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.710
 11 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.810
 today for a team tutorial 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:22.599
 fortress 2 the console controls 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.970
 So here we end on a pitch so 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:31.300
 for the console controls then 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:35.760
 I'm actually there the first part 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.760
 it's a little delusion about team fortress 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:46.090
 2 here is the oil died so a little 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.190
 deal yesterday which therefore consists a little to my 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.570
 fall it hurt me actually that 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.860
 is a little bit so there to have fun and to 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.489
 Then I will show you the facts 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:04.269
 the comments 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:05.860
 so I'll put I'll put all this in 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.649
 the description and I 'll notice you everything 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.460
 that on a notepad 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.470
 now I'm going out in not long 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.610
 so we just do a little delusion and 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:34.479
 then after I wanted but then so 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:39.100
 so no no I do not think ok he wants 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:44.159
 play his hyper good huh 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.159
 ok I have to get stopped dry 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.830
 super CEO in the hearth enix did in 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.210
 do there then the crate but our 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.930
 recovery I still do not know what 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.720
 it is yes so I also intend to make a 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.830
 series it's wikipedia team forteress 2g 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.459
 actually resume games take them back 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.569
 actually some of the sources of wikipedia on 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.900
 team fortress 2 so on the drop 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.170
 of objects for example I will learn that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.150
 while I will learn soon on the drop 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.519
 for days so here I am I 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.060
 will kill for the end then I will make a 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.400
 video 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:41.180
 how does the drug system work 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.890
 he will carry me that's all here I hope 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.040
 that it will not be one of my videos the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.890
 no longer good then we will spend all of 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.350
 following orders 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.930
 So here I have marked all 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.500
 common so what is it 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.530
 enders body cross hertz call number 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.570
 so changes the size of your viewfinder and 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.190
 so on so you see there is no 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.829
 badly there are quite a few commands 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.390
 then there are others but in fact 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.320
 it's more accounted for as 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:19.160
 cheats in fact so it's a source of the 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:20.570
 scrap site and so does the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.860
 others it's chic but I could 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.780
 always show them to you that's it 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.260
 it's already the basic commands that he 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.260
 need to know 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:39.350
 so I hope you enjoyed it so 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.190
 that's pretty good 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.370
 there is and so here I put you all 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.370
 worsens
