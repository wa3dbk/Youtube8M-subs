00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
how this thing works as you can see you

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.610 
how this thing works as you can see you
spawn<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.539> jump<00:01:03.780> into<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.050> lava<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.470> takes

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
spawn in you jump into the lava it takes

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.140 
spawn in you jump into the lava it takes
a<00:01:04.739> couple<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.010> seconds<00:01:05.370> for<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.700> die<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
then you can see the whole thing starts

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.540 
then you can see the whole thing starts
filling<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.720> performing<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.620> ground<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
filling in performing a ground that you

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.300 
filling in performing a ground that you
will<00:01:11.730> then<00:01:11.850> spawn<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.300> top<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.190> you've

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
showing you what's going on so if i just

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.780 
showing you what's going on so if i just
replace<00:01:34.500> some<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> these<00:01:34.800> blocks<00:01:35.100> which<00:01:35.430> oddly

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
replace some of these blocks which oddly

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.720 
replace some of these blocks which oddly
other<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.630> same<00:01:36.750> fire<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.620> yeah<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.430> normally

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
other the same fire so yeah the normally

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.100 
other the same fire so yeah the normally
will<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.970> iron<00:01:39.240> blocks<00:01:39.510> or<00:01:39.690> whatever<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
will be iron blocks or whatever you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.260 
will be iron blocks or whatever you
choose<00:01:40.350> surrounding<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:42.000> appears<00:01:42.240> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
choose surrounding it but it appears to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.210 
choose surrounding it but it appears to
be<00:01:42.390> setting<00:01:42.630> fire<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.140> which<00:01:43.410> i<00:01:43.710> might

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
be setting fire to that which i might

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.450 
be setting fire to that which i might
change<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.240> what's<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.440> on<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:47.280> your

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
change so what's going on is when your

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.840 
change so what's going on is when your
player<00:01:47.790> spawns<00:01:48.330> in<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.810> map<00:01:49.050> he<00:01:49.860> will<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.310> in

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
player spawns in this map he will be in

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.540 
player spawns in this map he will be in
the<00:01:51.210> center<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:51.870> any<00:01:52.050> way<00:01:52.230> in<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.430> when

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
the center or any way in here and when

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.630 
the center or any way in here and when
he<00:01:53.700> drops<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.180> will<00:01:54.360> go<00:01:54.480> inside<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.870> lava<00:01:55.640> now

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
he drops you will go inside the lava now

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.480 
he drops you will go inside the lava now
below<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.180> lava<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:58.560> bunch<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.100> pressure

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
below the lava is a bunch of pressure

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.810 
below the lava is a bunch of pressure
place<00:01:59.820> as<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.720> can<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:01.050> here<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.740> they'd<00:02:02.580> all

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
place as you can see here and they'd all

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.090 
place as you can see here and they'd all
be<00:02:03.659> any<00:02:03.900> one<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.140> these<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.560> gets<00:02:04.710> powered

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
be any one of these that gets powered

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.990 
be any one of these that gets powered
will<00:02:05.430> cause<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:07.099> redstone<00:02:08.099> not<00:02:08.459> rest<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.759> lock

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
will cause a redstone not rest on lock

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.559 
will cause a redstone not rest on lock
but<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:10.110> loop<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.619> repeat<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.909> basically

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
but and a loop of repeat is to basically

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.470 
but and a loop of repeat is to basically
lock<00:02:12.930> up<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.409> i<00:02:13.470> did<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.769> purpose<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
lock up and i did on purpose so the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.000 
lock up and i did on purpose so the
output<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.319> signal<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:16.740> stay

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
output of the signal will stay

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.340 
output of the signal will stay
constantly<00:02:17.550> on<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.940> then<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.750> blue<00:02:18.930> circuits

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
constantly on and then the blue circuits

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.020 
constantly on and then the blue circuits
coming<00:02:19.590> out<00:02:19.710> from<00:02:19.890> underneath<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.250> lava<00:02:20.460> will

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
coming out from underneath the lava will

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.230 
coming out from underneath the lava will
go

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
go

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.750 
go
over<00:02:21.480> here<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.980> will<00:02:23.220> activate<00:02:23.550> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
over here and this will activate the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.600 
over here and this will activate the
piston<00:02:24.120> worms<00:02:24.330> now<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.440> will<00:02:25.650> send<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.370> signal

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
piston worms now this will send a signal

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.860 
piston worms now this will send a signal
straight<00:02:27.030> through<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.450> turning<00:02:27.720> this

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
straight through to you turning this

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.150 
straight through to you turning this
torch<00:02:28.170> off<00:02:28.410> which<00:02:28.650> will<00:02:28.770> like<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
torch off which will like to be the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.370 
torch off which will like to be the
clock<00:02:29.430> which<00:02:30.180> will<00:02:30.450> activate<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.050> piston

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
clock which will activate the piston

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.340 
clock which will activate the piston
tape<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.860> then<00:02:32.580> 19<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.750> tick<00:02:34.020> report

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
tape and then 19 for tick report

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.280 
tape and then 19 for tick report
reporters<00:02:35.280> repeaters<00:02:35.700> later<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.330> will<00:02:36.930> power

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
reporters repeaters later it will power

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.810 
reporters repeaters later it will power
this<00:02:37.530> dust<00:02:37.800> again<00:02:37.980> locking<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.060> clock<00:02:40.490> so<00:02:41.490> all

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
this dust again locking the clock so all

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.330 
this dust again locking the clock so all
in<00:02:42.060> all<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.680> honestly<00:02:43.680> not<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:43.860> difficult<00:02:44.070> to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
in all is honestly not that difficult to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.550 
in all is honestly not that difficult to
make<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:44.940> was<00:02:45.270> just<00:02:45.540> doing<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.960> if<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.380> is

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
make so I was just doing it if this is

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.190 
make so I was just doing it if this is
you<00:02:47.490> know<00:02:47.640> if<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:48.030> need<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.900> single

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
you know if you need this for a single

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.450 
you know if you need this for a single
player<00:02:49.380> adventure<00:02:49.800> map<00:02:49.980> or<00:02:50.160> anything<00:02:50.430> like

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
player adventure map or anything like

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.310 
player adventure map or anything like
that<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.790> don't<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.210> use<00:02:51.360> iron<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.840> just

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
that you don't have to use iron I just

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.900 
that you don't have to use iron I just
thought<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.770> looks<00:02:53.010> pretty<00:02:53.220> clean<00:02:53.520> so<00:02:53.760> I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
thought it looks pretty clean so I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.690 
thought it looks pretty clean so I
thought<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.180> might<00:02:54.240> use<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.560> yeah<00:02:56.430> let's

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
thought I might use it so yeah let's

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.680 
thought I might use it so yeah let's
take<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.910> look<00:02:57.060> at<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.180> bad<00:02:57.360> boy<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.570> action

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
take a look at this bad boy in action

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.260 
take a look at this bad boy in action
again<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.710> spawn<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.160> you'll<00:02:59.460> land<00:02:59.640> on<00:02:59.850> here

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
again so in spawn it you'll land on here

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.810 
again so in spawn it you'll land on here
and<00:03:00.440> then<00:03:01.440> if<00:03:01.560> we<00:03:01.740> just<00:03:01.920> pop<00:03:02.130> out<00:03:02.280> quickly<00:03:02.550> you

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
and then if we just pop out quickly you

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.900 
and then if we just pop out quickly you
can<00:03:02.940> see<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:04.320> fifth<00:03:04.560> sandworms<00:03:04.950> activating

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
can see the fifth sandworms activating

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.970 
can see the fifth sandworms activating
causing<00:03:06.750> quite<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.990> lot<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.200> lag<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.770> that's<00:03:07.890> the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
causing quite a lot of lag so that's the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.000 
causing quite a lot of lag so that's the
line<00:03:08.190> can<00:03:08.460> don't<00:03:08.700> blame<00:03:08.940> me<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.800> yeah<00:03:10.800> we're

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
line can don't blame me and yeah we're

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.860 
line can don't blame me and yeah we're
missing<00:03:11.250> some<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.550> blocks<00:03:11.760> that's<00:03:12.690> why

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
missing some of the blocks that's why

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.260 
missing some of the blocks that's why
that<00:03:13.050> bust<00:03:13.350> but<00:03:13.710> yeah<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.520> should<00:03:14.730> work<00:03:14.850> if<00:03:15.090> you

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
that bust but yeah it should work if you

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.540 
that bust but yeah it should work if you
don't<00:03:15.420> have<00:03:15.510> any<00:03:15.690> other<00:03:15.810> blocks<00:03:15.990> missing<00:03:16.520> so<00:03:17.520> I

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
don't have any other blocks missing so I

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.920 
don't have any other blocks missing so I
thought<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:18.000> would<00:03:18.120> show<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.720> one<00:03:18.870> more

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
thought I would show you this one more

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.050 
thought I would show you this one more
time<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:19.590> everything<00:03:20.130> in<00:03:20.640> its<00:03:20.820> right<00:03:20.910> place

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
time with everything in its right place

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.110 
time with everything in its right place
and<00:03:21.600> not<00:03:21.720> half<00:03:22.020> burned<00:03:22.380> down<00:03:22.710> so<00:03:23.460> I<00:03:23.490> said<00:03:23.880> half

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
and not half burned down so I said half

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.990 
and not half burned down so I said half
half<00:03:24.600> anyway<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:25.740> unless<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.430> iron<00:03:26.580> blocks<00:03:26.850> in

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
half anyway so unless the iron blocks in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.360 
half anyway so unless the iron blocks in
this<00:03:27.150> time<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.510> he<00:03:27.600> should<00:03:27.780> work<00:03:27.990> perfectly

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
this time and he should work perfectly

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.950 
this time and he should work perfectly
so<00:03:29.370> yeah<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.090> just<00:03:30.300> came<00:03:30.420> up<00:03:30.450> with<00:03:30.570> his<00:03:30.780> pistol

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
so yeah I just came up with his pistol

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.110 
so yeah I just came up with his pistol
worm<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.410> didn't<00:03:31.590> even<00:03:31.650> intend<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.640> do<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.940> I

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
worm I didn't even intend to do it I

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.640 
worm I didn't even intend to do it I
didn't<00:03:33.600> think<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.810> was<00:03:33.870> possible<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.590> as

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
didn't think it was possible and as

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.230 
didn't think it was possible and as
messed<00:03:34.860> around<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.310> boom<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:35.760> got<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.940> piston

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
messed around and boom I got the piston

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.610 
messed around and boom I got the piston
work<00:03:36.390> it's<00:03:36.750> really<00:03:36.840> happy<00:03:37.050> with<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:37.590> i

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
work it's really happy with that so i

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.990 
work it's really happy with that so i
might<00:03:37.770> do<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.950> tutorial<00:03:38.100> in<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.490> piston<00:03:38.820> worm

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
might do a tutorial in that piston worm

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.250 
might do a tutorial in that piston worm
but<00:03:39.540> i<00:03:39.630> don't<00:03:39.780> think<00:03:39.810> i'll<00:03:39.990> be<00:03:40.020> doing<00:03:40.140> a

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
but i don't think i'll be doing a

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.590 
but i don't think i'll be doing a
tutorial<00:03:40.320> on<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:40.710> and<00:03:41.300> this<00:03:42.300> going<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.510> be

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
tutorial on this and this going to be

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.910 
tutorial on this and this going to be
mapped<00:03:42.750> downward<00:03:43.110> so<00:03:43.260> feel<00:03:43.440> free<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.650> download

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920

this<00:03:44.430> in<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.730> description<00:03:45.270> that<00:03:45.390> was<00:03:46.110> my

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
this in the description that was my

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.770 
this in the description that was my
first<00:03:46.590> attempt<00:03:47.130> using<00:03:47.280> sand<00:03:47.820> but<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.510> didn't

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
first attempt using sand but I didn't

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.720 
first attempt using sand but I didn't
like<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:48.930> might<00:03:49.410> cause<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.620> lot<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:49.890> lag<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.400> sun

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
like it might cause a lot of lag and sun

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.390 
like it might cause a lot of lag and sun
doesn't<00:03:50.910> fall<00:03:51.300> you<00:03:51.870> know<00:03:51.920> Tim<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.040> taneously

you this properly working now so you can
see<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.010> piston<00:04:02.370> worms

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
see the piston worms

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.210 
see the piston worms
bit<00:04:05.210> like<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:05.540> it's<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.900> lighting<00:04:06.319> again<00:04:06.800> but

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
bit like it it's the lighting again but

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.580 
bit like it it's the lighting again but
I<00:04:07.580> can't<00:04:07.970> do<00:04:08.090> anything<00:04:08.240> about<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.569> it's<00:04:09.260> not<00:04:09.440> my

as well the clock doesn't continue
running<00:04:18.140> say<00:04:18.709> won't<00:04:18.950> cause<00:04:19.190> any<00:04:19.430> more<00:04:19.790> lag

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
running say won't cause any more lag

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.120 
running say won't cause any more lag
than<00:04:20.390> you<00:04:20.480> should<00:04:20.540> do<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.140> then<00:04:21.739> when<00:04:22.010> you

how come up poor poor attempts from my
first<00:04:33.440> design<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:35.300> bad<00:04:35.540> so<00:04:36.200> bad<00:04:36.230> so<00:04:36.410> yeah<00:04:37.220> if
