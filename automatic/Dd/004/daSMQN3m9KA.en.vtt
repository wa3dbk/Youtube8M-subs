00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
how I'm doing them and so I decided to

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.820 
how I'm doing them and so I decided to
do<00:00:16.810> a<00:00:16.840> really<00:00:17.110> quick<00:00:17.430> tutorial<00:00:18.430> here<00:00:18.910> goes<00:00:19.090> I

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
do a really quick tutorial here goes I

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.730 
do a really quick tutorial here goes I
start<00:00:20.830> off<00:00:21.010> with<00:00:21.370> blow-dried<00:00:22.360> hair<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:23.710> I

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
start off with blow-dried hair that I

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.590 
start off with blow-dried hair that I
paddle<00:00:24.250> dry<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:26.260> is<00:00:26.410> actually<00:00:26.770> old<00:00:27.600> care

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
paddle dry this is actually old care

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.040 
paddle dry this is actually old care
about<00:00:29.020> 23<00:00:29.560> days<00:00:29.590> old<00:00:30.130> but<00:00:30.520> it<00:00:31.150> still<00:00:31.180> works<00:00:31.660> I

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
about 23 days old but it still works I

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.470 
about 23 days old but it still works I
do<00:00:32.320> it<00:00:32.529> this<00:00:32.619> way<00:00:32.829> because<00:00:33.180> when<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.300> paddle

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
do it this way because when you paddle

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.600 
do it this way because when you paddle
dry<00:00:34.840> a<00:00:34.870> lot<00:00:35.140> of<00:00:35.260> times<00:00:35.440> with<00:00:35.650> my<00:00:35.860> type<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.280> hair

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
dry a lot of times with my type of hair

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.700 
dry a lot of times with my type of hair
you<00:00:37.060> know<00:00:37.210> what's<00:00:37.450> frizzy<00:00:37.870> but<00:00:38.110> you<00:00:38.320> have<00:00:38.500> that

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
you know what's frizzy but you have that

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.630 
you know what's frizzy but you have that
volume<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.460> so<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:41.829> I'm<00:00:41.980> trying<00:00:42.220> to<00:00:42.280> do<00:00:42.460> is

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
volume and so what I'm trying to do is

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.600 
volume and so what I'm trying to do is
when<00:00:42.820> I<00:00:42.850> when<00:00:43.270> I<00:00:43.300> do<00:00:43.420> my<00:00:43.810> rock<00:00:44.079> my<00:00:44.380> roller<00:00:44.649> curls

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
when I when I do my rock my roller curls

when I when I do my rock my roller curls
I<00:00:45.850> want<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.300> like<00:00:46.770> keep<00:00:47.770> you<00:00:48.040> know<00:00:48.160> keep<00:00:48.190> the

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
I want to like keep you know keep the

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
volume but but put the volume in the

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.790 
volume but but put the volume in the
ways<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.500> basically<00:00:53.950> i<00:00:54.309> use<00:00:55.079> curl<00:00:56.079> rods<00:00:56.350> that<00:00:56.680> i

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
ways so basically i use curl rods that i

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.120 
ways so basically i use curl rods that i
got<00:00:57.040> from<00:00:57.280> CBS<00:00:58.320> they're<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.410> ones<00:00:59.620> that<00:00:59.770> are

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
got from CBS they're the ones that are

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.910 
got from CBS they're the ones that are
bendable<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:02.379> easy<00:01:02.770> easy<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.489> bend<00:01:03.700> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
bendable there easy easy to bend and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.779 
bendable there easy easy to bend and
what<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:05.950> do<00:01:06.070> is<00:01:06.219> I<00:01:06.909> take<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:08.259> rod<00:01:08.469> I<00:01:08.920> put<00:01:09.670> it

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
what I do is I take the rod I put it

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.330 
what I do is I take the rod I put it
close<00:01:09.969> to<00:01:09.999> my<00:01:10.299> scalp<00:01:10.659> then<00:01:11.439> I<00:01:11.560> wrap<00:01:11.889> the<00:01:11.920> hair

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
close to my scalp then I wrap the hair

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.010 
close to my scalp then I wrap the hair
around<00:01:12.959> the<00:01:13.959> rod<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:15.149> then<00:01:16.149> i<00:01:16.179> used<00:01:16.659> the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
around the rod and then i used the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.139 
around the rod and then i used the
actual<00:01:17.619> ride<00:01:17.799> itself<00:01:18.219> to<00:01:18.490> secure<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.090> ends

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
actual ride itself to secure the ends

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.789 
actual ride itself to secure the ends
and<00:01:22.149> then<00:01:22.299> I<00:01:22.420> secure<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:22.959> and<00:01:23.200> then<00:01:23.409> then<00:01:23.770> I

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
and then I secure that and then then I

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.649 
and then I secure that and then then I
secure<00:01:24.219> the<00:01:24.249> fun<00:01:24.579> I<00:01:24.819> roll<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.329> little<00:01:25.479> bit

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
secure the fun I roll it a little bit

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.609 
secure the fun I roll it a little bit
closer<00:01:25.899> to<00:01:26.170> my<00:01:26.289> scalp<00:01:26.619> so<00:01:26.889> it'll<00:01:27.310> hold<00:01:27.520> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
closer to my scalp so it'll hold and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.359 
closer to my scalp so it'll hold and
pretty<00:01:29.619> much<00:01:29.709> I<00:01:30.039> do<00:01:30.130> this<00:01:30.609> for<00:01:30.939> my<00:01:31.299> entire<00:01:31.689> head

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
pretty much I do this for my entire head

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.029 
pretty much I do this for my entire head
for<00:01:33.369> me<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.639> takes<00:01:33.880> about<00:01:34.740> about<00:01:35.740> eat

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
for me it takes about about eat

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.879 
for me it takes about about eat
different<00:01:37.029> rods<00:01:37.329> try<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.319> do<00:01:38.499> the<00:01:38.619> smaller

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:38.889 
different rods try to do the smaller

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.219 
different rods try to do the smaller
ones<00:01:39.219> in<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.520> front<00:01:39.670> for<00:01:40.149> like<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.509> smaller

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
ones in the front for like the smaller

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.059 
ones in the front for like the smaller
curls<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:43.450> can<00:01:43.630> use<00:01:43.840> more<00:01:44.200> rods<00:01:44.409> if<00:01:44.649> you<00:01:44.799> want

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
curls you can use more rods if you want

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.789 
curls you can use more rods if you want
if<00:01:45.279> you<00:01:45.340> want<00:01:45.789> a<00:01:45.909> more<00:01:45.939> defined<00:01:46.689> less<00:01:47.439> fluffy

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
if you want a more defined less fluffy

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.429 
if you want a more defined less fluffy
or<00:01:48.039> curl<00:01:48.340> but<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.299> like<00:01:49.569> for<00:01:49.899> mine<00:01:50.049> to<00:01:50.079> be<00:01:50.409> a

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
or curl but I like for mine to be a

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.359 
or curl but I like for mine to be a
little<00:01:50.679> bit<00:01:50.889> more<00:01:51.159> defined<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.590> pretty<00:01:53.799> much<00:01:53.919> I

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
little bit more defined so pretty much I

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.480 
little bit more defined so pretty much I
do<00:01:54.539> this<00:01:55.539> for<00:01:55.779> the<00:01:55.869> entire<00:01:56.259> head<00:01:56.649> doesn't<00:01:57.159> take

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
do this for the entire head doesn't take

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.809 
do this for the entire head doesn't take
long<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:58.689> it<00:01:58.810> just<00:01:59.020> fast<00:01:59.259> forward<00:01:59.709> for<00:02:00.459> threat

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
long and it just fast forward for threat

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:14.410 
long and it just fast forward for threat
baby<00:02:01.479> text<00:02:01.779> me<00:02:02.189> maybe<00:02:03.189> um<00:02:03.520> 10<00:02:04.239> minutes

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:03:25.790 

you

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.729 

so<00:03:26.800> now<00:03:27.010> I've<00:03:28.000> let<00:03:28.420> this<00:03:28.720> hair<00:03:29.019> sit<00:03:29.410> for<00:03:29.620> about

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
so now I've let this hair sit for about

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.880 
so now I've let this hair sit for about
six<00:03:30.459> hours<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:31.690> can<00:03:31.840> do<00:03:31.989> as<00:03:32.200> little<00:03:32.379> as<00:03:32.620> two

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
six hours you can do as little as two

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.140 
six hours you can do as little as two
the<00:03:33.220> longer<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:34.170> let<00:03:35.170> them<00:03:35.379> sit<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:36.370> longer

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
the longer you let them sit the longer

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.390 
the longer you let them sit the longer
the<00:03:37.300> better<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.140> hole<00:03:38.319> will<00:03:38.590> be<00:03:38.709> on<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.010> curls

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
the better the hole will be on the curls

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.650 
the better the hole will be on the curls
you<00:03:39.640> can<00:03:39.790> do<00:03:39.910> them<00:03:40.030> overnight<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:40.780> whatnot<00:03:41.549> so

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
you can do them overnight and whatnot so

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.699 
you can do them overnight and whatnot so
here<00:03:43.660> all<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:43.930> do<00:03:44.140> is<00:03:44.349> take<00:03:45.340> out<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.810> rods<00:03:47.049> try

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
here all I do is take out the rods try

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.330 
here all I do is take out the rods try
to<00:03:47.769> do<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.099> gently<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:50.860> can<00:03:51.040> keep<00:03:51.190> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
to do it gently so that you can keep the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.059 
to do it gently so that you can keep the
curls<00:03:51.640> intact<00:03:52.239> then<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.930> know<00:03:53.080> just<00:03:53.560> just<00:03:53.890> not

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
curls intact then you know just just not

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.240 
curls intact then you know just just not
pull<00:03:54.340> them<00:03:54.459> out<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:56.590> is<00:03:56.739> kind<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.040> how<00:03:57.190> the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
pull them out this is kind of how the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.780 
pull them out this is kind of how the
curl<00:03:57.610> looks<00:03:58.200> before<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.680> start<00:04:00.040> separation

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
curl looks before you start separation

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.110 
curl looks before you start separation
and<00:04:01.319> pretty<00:04:02.319> much<00:04:02.380> you<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:03.310> know<00:04:03.430> go<00:04:03.819> through

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
and pretty much you you know go through

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.170 
and pretty much you you know go through
each<00:04:04.329> curl<00:04:04.690> take<00:04:05.140> them<00:04:05.290> out<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.799> then<00:04:06.250> um<00:04:06.640> and

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
each curl take them out and then um and

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:17.069 
each curl take them out and then um and
then<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.690> begin<00:04:08.049> to<00:04:08.110> style

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:41.559 

you

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.540 

so<00:04:42.569> now<00:04:42.749> I<00:04:42.779> pretty<00:04:43.169> much<00:04:43.289> taken<00:04:43.889> out<00:04:44.039> all<00:04:44.249> the

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
so now I pretty much taken out all the

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.699 
so now I pretty much taken out all the
rods<00:04:44.759> you<00:04:45.149> can<00:04:45.330> see<00:04:45.569> that<00:04:45.899> it's<00:04:46.050> really<00:04:46.319> wavy

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:46.709 
rods you can see that it's really wavy

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:49.909 
rods you can see that it's really wavy
for<00:04:47.610> me<00:04:47.729> this<00:04:48.059> this<00:04:48.809> works<00:04:49.139> for<00:04:49.349> me<00:04:49.529> because

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
for me this this works for me because

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.100 
for me this this works for me because
like<00:04:49.949> I<00:04:50.309> want<00:04:50.580> to<00:04:50.669> have<00:04:50.819> volume<00:04:51.360> with<00:04:51.539> my<00:04:51.719> curls

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
like I want to have volume with my curls

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.279 
like I want to have volume with my curls
and<00:04:52.529> have<00:04:53.219> sort<00:04:53.669> of<00:04:53.789> an<00:04:54.029> afro<00:04:54.599> feel<00:04:54.959> but

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
and have sort of an afro feel but

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.679 
and have sort of an afro feel but
because<00:04:55.679> I<00:04:55.919> don't<00:04:56.249> get<00:04:56.789> a<00:04:56.819> lot<00:04:57.029> of<00:04:57.089> volume<00:04:57.389> from

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:57.689 
because I don't get a lot of volume from

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.809 
because I don't get a lot of volume from
the<00:04:57.809> root<00:04:58.019> of<00:04:58.169> my<00:04:58.319> ear<00:04:58.589> it<00:04:58.860> comes<00:04:59.459> from<00:04:59.580> the

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
the root of my ear it comes from the

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.389 
the root of my ear it comes from the
ends<00:05:00.330> sometimes<00:05:01.199> well<00:05:01.800> most<00:05:01.830> of<00:05:02.219> the<00:05:02.339> time

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:02.399 
ends sometimes well most of the time

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:05.570 
ends sometimes well most of the time
doing<00:05:03.389> if<00:05:03.749> I<00:05:03.899> were<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.110> do<00:05:04.319> do<00:05:04.679> this<00:05:04.889> wet<00:05:05.219> it

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
doing if I were to do do this wet it

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.489 
doing if I were to do do this wet it
wouldn't<00:05:06.119> give<00:05:06.269> me<00:05:06.389> a<00:05:06.419> volume<00:05:06.899> the<00:05:07.050> curls<00:05:07.379> will

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:07.499 
wouldn't give me a volume the curls will

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:09.350 
wouldn't give me a volume the curls will
be<00:05:07.589> really<00:05:07.979> tight<00:05:08.279> and<00:05:08.580> they<00:05:08.789> just<00:05:09.089> you<00:05:09.330> know

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
be really tight and they just you know

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.769 
be really tight and they just you know
they<00:05:09.689> wouldn't<00:05:10.139> be<00:05:10.199> they<00:05:10.679> wouldn't<00:05:10.919> be<00:05:11.159> fluffy

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:11.779 
they wouldn't be they wouldn't be fluffy

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.899 
they wouldn't be they wouldn't be fluffy
so<00:05:12.779> this<00:05:13.379> process<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:14.069> basically<00:05:14.610> just

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
so this process I basically just

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.109 
so this process I basically just
separate<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.659> curls<00:05:16.279> I'm<00:05:17.279> gentle<00:05:17.729> with<00:05:17.909> them

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:18.119 
separate the curls I'm gentle with them

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:21.019 
separate the curls I'm gentle with them
I<00:05:18.509> mean<00:05:18.779> they're<00:05:18.989> not<00:05:19.519> this<00:05:20.519> since<00:05:20.729> I<00:05:20.819> didn't

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.029 
I mean they're not this since I didn't

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.309 
I mean they're not this since I didn't
do<00:05:21.089> this<00:05:21.179> overnight<00:05:21.539> they're<00:05:21.899> not<00:05:22.079> super

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
do this overnight they're not super

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.839 
do this overnight they're not super
super<00:05:22.889> tight<00:05:23.129> but<00:05:24.029> I<00:05:24.829> basically<00:05:25.829> separate<00:05:26.579> in

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
super tight but I basically separate in

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.799 
super tight but I basically separate in
style<00:05:27.649> this<00:05:28.649> is<00:05:28.860> some<00:05:29.159> Chi<00:05:29.669> Hair<00:05:30.149> Spray<00:05:30.329> that

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.469 
I'm using for hold my hair doesn't like
to<00:05:33.479> hold<00:05:33.689> but<00:05:34.079> um<00:05:34.289> I<00:05:35.509> have<00:05:36.509> worn<00:05:37.229> this<00:05:37.469> style<00:05:37.919> um

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.979 
to hold but um I have worn this style um
basically<00:05:39.479> all<00:05:40.349> day<00:05:41.059> before<00:05:42.059> and<00:05:42.449> you<00:05:42.839> know

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:42.989 
basically all day before and you know

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:44.899 
basically all day before and you know
it'll<00:05:43.349> pretty<00:05:43.529> much<00:05:43.619> hold<00:05:44.069> but<00:05:44.369> I<00:05:44.399> should

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
it'll pretty much hold but I should

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.879 
it'll pretty much hold but I should
pretty<00:05:45.089> much<00:05:45.179> have<00:05:45.539> to<00:05:45.569> do<00:05:45.899> it<00:05:46.079> every<00:05:46.319> night<00:05:46.499> if

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
pretty much have to do it every night if

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.109 
pretty much have to do it every night if
I<00:05:47.039> want<00:05:47.279> those<00:05:47.459> types<00:05:47.759> of<00:05:47.939> ways<00:05:48.589> but<00:05:49.589> um<00:05:50.119> you

00:05:51.109 --> 00:05:51.119 
I want those types of ways but um you

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:53.119 
I want those types of ways but um you
know<00:05:51.240> you<00:05:51.329> just<00:05:51.599> dial<00:05:51.899> accordingly<00:05:52.439> how<00:05:52.740> how

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129 
know you just dial accordingly how how

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:56.299 
know you just dial accordingly how how
you<00:05:53.189> want<00:05:53.610> um<00:05:53.849> I<00:05:54.389> think<00:05:54.869> if<00:05:55.349> you<00:05:55.469> have<00:05:55.679> volume

00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:56.309 
you want um I think if you have volume

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:58.249 
you want um I think if you have volume
that<00:05:56.639> comes<00:05:56.939> from<00:05:57.269> like<00:05:57.479> your<00:05:57.689> scalp<00:05:58.050> and

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
that comes from like your scalp and

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.559 
that comes from like your scalp and
whatnot<00:05:58.589> then<00:05:58.949> I<00:05:58.979> think<00:05:59.279> the<00:05:59.369> wit<00:05:59.579> you<00:06:00.449> know

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:00.569 
whatnot then I think the wit you know

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.389 
whatnot then I think the wit you know
doing<00:06:00.839> this<00:06:01.079> wit<00:06:01.379> will<00:06:01.649> probably<00:06:02.009> work<00:06:02.129> better

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:02.399 
doing this wit will probably work better

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:04.249 
doing this wit will probably work better
for<00:06:02.729> you<00:06:02.849> I've<00:06:03.059> seen<00:06:03.300> some<00:06:03.329> tutorials<00:06:04.110> where

for you I've seen some tutorials where

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:07.459 
for you I've seen some tutorials where

that's work you know for girls who have

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.059 
that's work you know for girls who have
like<00:06:07.679> thicker<00:06:08.009> hair<00:06:08.459> in<00:06:08.579> the<00:06:08.699> scalp<00:06:08.939> area<00:06:10.069> for
