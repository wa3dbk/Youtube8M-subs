00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everyone and surely many of you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.340
 wondered what version of the game 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.160
 still more profitable to buy digital or 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.280
 same disk in this video I will consider 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.770
 The advantages of the digital version and the next 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.240
 video I will consider the advantages of the disk version 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.359
 well let's start first is not the one 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.439
 plus you don't need to go to the store sometimes 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.179
 there is mud slush and snow or even 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.489
 the shop is so uncomfortable 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.219
 the place that comes before it happens 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.770
 problematic in this case of course 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.640
 this is a plus not need anywhere 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.969
 go 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.239
 2+ is what you get 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.329
 instant access on release day that is 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.809
 bye man who buy disk 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.320
 version waits until it is delivered to the store 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 you have the game right away 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.309
 access download this game and this is 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.460
 Of course, a plus because wait until 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:10.890
 this drive will come to the store while they are his 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.260
 lay out that is it is very long and sometimes 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.479
 I once wanted to buy a game for the last 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.500
 of as remasters then and of course bought 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.390
 but I waited a week for the game to be brought 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:29.400
 shop and sometimes it happens as a case of fifa 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:31.619
 14 game somewhere two three weeks its just 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.070
 there was not and quickly bolder and you 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.909
 there was no game and only then sometime 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.450
 delivered 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.259
 well, what else are the advantages of digital 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.420
 versions 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.399
 this is something that does not need to change drives in 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.590
 prefix 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.119
 that is, if you for example you have 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.960
 several games 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.460
 the person who plays him 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.310
 will have to pull out 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.619
 one drive put it in the box then 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.250
 open another box lay down drive 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.720
 back and of course it's all a mess 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.420
 when you still have when you 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.550
 at the same time play a large number 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.150
 games, yes, that is, one played later 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.920
 wanted another and of course it 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.270
 problematic to change it so drives 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.950
 plus itâ€™s also private 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.560
 from this, too, yes a lot 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.170
 stiffens when he spits for 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.920
 a disc and of course it's not very 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.540
 good effect on the drive and 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.120
 Odessa version is so good that you 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.090
 you can play first one game later 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.200
 another completely immediately and play 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:48.150
 not putting out the discs further the next plus 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.300
 This is something that can not be broken drive and not 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.350
 lose the drive you have everything is in 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.390
 figure everything is like in the most 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.799
 playstation if you are playstation itself and 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:05.610
 break of course then play you 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:09.209
 there will be nothing further what else 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.590
 plus well, another such plus is important 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.970
 what's the pre-order 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.459
 games that is, you can quickly and easily 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.190
 pre-order the game in a digit and in the case 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.709
 In addition, if you buy a pre-order before 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.340
 in some store this box 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.340
 not necessary and in which there is no game she you 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.230
 will be at home she will take the place then 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.860
 there is in fact not even a game 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.590
 Yes, and it will have to throw out and therefore 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.070
 here it is not necessary waste paper all this 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:45.630
 box is better of course pre-order to do in 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.520
 digital form and there is such a plus 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.400
 what 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:55.920
 games are usually in the figure of 100 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:59.570
 rubles cheaper but that's all I think everything 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.460
 The pros I reviewed the digital version of a 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.290
 plus and disk versions see in 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.290
 next video for now
