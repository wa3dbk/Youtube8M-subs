00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 race eve 5 doors open to 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.940
 golden state facility center 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.460
 warriors in the center of auckland in 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.230
 these hours, however, a story has emerged 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.960
 very particular after the victory in 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.880
 race 4 of golden state warriors exit a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.580
 apparently from the dressing room of the golden 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.310
 state warriors tranquil flavio which 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.349
 this secret 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.779
 this secret of puffin and kanye 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.939
 cures and the twenty-eight year old secretary of 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.329
 steve for what normally bristles 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.820
 herranz commissions in English ha 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.280
 suggested in the middle of the night between 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.410
 race 3 and race 4 wolf face the 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.660
 possibility of imitating what 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.699
 would have done the san antonio spurs between 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.280
 gr2 gr3 of the last edition of the 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.159
 final series ie add a 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.829
 perimeter player to raise a long 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.739
 in that case splitter replaced from there to 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.900
 you in this case bogut replaced by 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.750
 he will naturally watch an extraordinary one 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.540
 history serves to understand how the ideas of 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.489
 steve for those to hear 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.659
 everyone's opinion to take input from 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.500
 all equally obviously would go 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.939
 contextualized also because the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.680
 small quintet of golden state has 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.600
 started the game but as he said 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.900
 lebron james is not that he then played 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.630
 40 or 48 minutes or rather by looking at the numbers 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.860
 the plus minus or result in the field 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.350
 of the team with the small quintet 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.060
 it even drops to one though it is 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.070
 of course we will probably see the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.899
 warriors with this deployment that 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.579
 so it worked and brought the 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.740
 team to score center three points in 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.359
 race 4 what we need to do 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.450
 wait on the cleveland side 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.520
 against this quintet how much 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.979
 david blatt would like to be able to do one 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.840
 something like that maybe, according to your feelings 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.329
 some of his Israeli friends there 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.149
 I'm having a problem with hundreds of black people 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.530
 to the players to make the countermoves 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.119
 sure he could use it better 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.490
 could use miller are gods 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.859
 veterans talked about it but the substance is 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.359
 that the vote reduced to the bone 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.069
 there is a player like jane smith who has 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.729
 a decidedly negative impact on 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.810
 this series but more the vat cannot do with it 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.350
 particularly unless what is the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.189
 problem 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.289
 the problem is that cairo is missing irving ce 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.490
 we have already forgotten it because of that 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.410
 that they did in race 2 in race 3 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.300
 kriva l'antares we all thought 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.940
 where there is no problem 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.890
 kevin love would also be missing with these 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.470
 two, yes, many could be done 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.970
 John Smith's reasoning would come back 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.220
 it's normal we're going to come back to his 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.680
 normal forest role would return to sorano 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.030
 normal beyond 28 points but le 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.030
 black choices are really small 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.140
 at the bone we will have many answers in the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.300
 night between Sunday and Monday 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.620
 the appointment at 2 am on 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.360
 tranquil sky flavio sports screens 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.670
 with davide pessina to tell you the 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.890
 game for the moment from auckland with 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.880
 quiet flavio for sky sport 24 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.880
