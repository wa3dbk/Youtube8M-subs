will fit you know fail and I'm not

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.270 
will fit you know fail and I'm not
failing<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.620> actually<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.160> its

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
failing it's actually going to do its

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.430 
failing it's actually going to do its
job<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.820> by<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.359> doing<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.690> job<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.170> doing

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
job and by not doing this job it's doing

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.709 
job and by not doing this job it's doing
its<00:01:01.559> job<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.070> figure<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.460> out<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:03.300> it's

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
its job so you figure that out but it's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.450 
its job so you figure that out but it's
going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.930> save<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.500> battery<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.369> to

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
cable put the end on it and I swage it

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.720 
cable put the end on it and I swage it
you<00:02:42.690> buy<00:02:42.870> these<00:02:42.930> little<00:02:43.140> swaging<00:02:43.590> blocks<00:02:43.950> put

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
you buy these little swaging blocks put

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.610 
you buy these little swaging blocks put
that<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.090> there<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.299> set<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.780> down<00:02:45.810> bracket

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
that in there you set it down bracket

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.890 
that in there you set it down bracket
whack<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.129> with<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.340> hammer<00:02:47.549> right<00:02:47.730> now<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.510> can

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
whack it with a hammer right now you can

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.479 
whack it with a hammer right now you can
see<00:02:48.989> what<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.170> original<00:02:49.260> look<00:02:49.680> like<00:02:49.890> here's

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
see what the original look like here's

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.250 
see what the original look like here's
the<00:02:50.640> shrink-wrap<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.480> can<00:02:51.599> see<00:02:51.720> how<00:02:51.870> far<00:02:52.140> it

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
the shrink-wrap you can see how far it

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.349 
the shrink-wrap you can see how far it
shrunk<00:02:52.470> down<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.519> dimpled<00:02:53.879> it<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.180> then

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
shrunk down so we dimpled it and then

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.270 
shrunk down so we dimpled it and then
also<00:02:54.540> soldered<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.799> take<00:02:55.950> solder

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
also soldered it you just take solder

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.280 
also soldered it you just take solder
heat<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:56.940> up<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.120> little<00:02:57.239> bit<00:02:57.390> with<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.569> torch<00:02:57.900> and

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
heat it up a little bit with a torch and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.170 
heat it up a little bit with a torch and
that's<00:02:58.440> good<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.739> go<00:02:58.769> yeah<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.579> makes<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.879> nice

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
that's good to go yeah that makes a nice

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.449 
that's good to go yeah that makes a nice
way<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.629> do<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.019> solder<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.530> real<00:03:01.680> good<00:03:01.890> of

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
way to do it in solder it's real good of

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.860 
way to do it in solder it's real good of
course<00:03:02.609> I<00:03:02.760> take<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.060> little<00:03:03.269> 14<00:03:03.660> gauge<00:03:03.840> wire

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
course I take this little 14 gauge wire

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.110 
course I take this little 14 gauge wire
heat<00:03:04.349> shrink<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.709> nice<00:03:04.890> stuff<00:03:05.160> look<00:03:05.730> at<00:03:05.790> that

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
heat shrink is nice stuff look at that

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.330 
heat shrink is nice stuff look at that
looks<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.540> factory<00:03:06.810> deal<00:03:07.200> especially<00:03:07.980> if
