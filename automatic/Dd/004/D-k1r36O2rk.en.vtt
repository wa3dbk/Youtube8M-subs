I have a couple dolls that are the same
resin<00:00:31.590> color<00:00:31.829> but<00:00:32.129> from<00:00:32.309> different<00:00:32.489> companies

resin color but from different companies

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.509 
resin color but from different companies
so<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.930> wanted<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.379> kind<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.680> show<00:00:34.949> what<00:00:35.340> those

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519

so I wanted to kind of show what those
resins<00:00:35.970> are<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:37.019> best<00:00:37.230> way<00:00:37.470> I<00:00:37.500> find<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.370> do

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
resins are and the best way I find to do

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.299 
resins are and the best way I find to do
that<00:00:38.699> is<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:38.970> use<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.449> head<00:00:39.629> caps<00:00:39.870> because

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
that is to use the head caps because

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.910 
that is to use the head caps because
those<00:00:41.309> aren't<00:00:41.550> really<00:00:42.350> touched<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.680> too

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920

much<00:00:46.850> like<00:00:48.559> coloring<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.159> body<00:00:50.670> blushing

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
much like coloring I do body blushing

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.869 
much like coloring I do body blushing
and<00:00:51.629> face<00:00:52.500> ups<00:00:52.769> and<00:00:52.979> such<00:00:53.220> and<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.519> head<00:00:53.640> caps

usually<00:00:54.300> aren't<00:00:54.449> involved<00:00:54.659> in<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.019> so

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
usually aren't involved in that so

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.910

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
a much paler gray than the decode all

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.349 
a much paler gray than the decode all
gray<00:04:06.569> this<00:04:06.900> is<00:04:06.959> kind<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.319> weird<00:04:07.500> it's<00:04:07.769> the

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
gray this is kind of weird it's the

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.910 
gray this is kind of weird it's the
decode<00:04:09.359> all<00:04:09.480> head<00:04:09.659> cap<00:04:09.900> with<00:04:10.139> a<00:04:10.170> little<00:04:11.239> hook

decode all head cap with a little hook

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.009 
decode all head cap with a little hook
method<00:04:13.920> instead<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.659> magnet<00:04:15.659> and<00:04:15.780> hook

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
method instead of the magnet and hook

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.379 
method instead of the magnet and hook
that<00:04:16.049> most<00:04:16.709> other<00:04:16.859> head<00:04:17.430> caps<00:04:17.669> off<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.209> it's

that most other head caps off so it's

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.930 
that most other head caps off so it's
kind<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.690> sitting<00:04:18.900> on<00:04:18.989> here<00:04:19.169> funny<00:04:19.880> anyway<00:04:20.880> so

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
only in fold all that you can get that

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.890

is<00:05:24.900> blue<00:05:25.610> they<00:05:26.610> did<00:05:26.820> some<00:05:27.090> Jasper's<00:05:27.690> which

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
is blue they did some Jasper's which

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.810 
is blue they did some Jasper's which
aren't<00:05:28.080> small<00:05:28.639> the<00:05:29.639> baby<00:05:29.969> size<00:05:30.270> which<00:05:30.510> is

same as this one my 10 0 onyx and I

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.640

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
think they had a blue one of that but

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.370 
think they had a blue one of that but
it's<00:05:38.800> not<00:05:39.010> you<00:05:39.190> can't<00:05:39.430> really<00:05:39.790> get<00:05:40.660> blue<00:05:41.020> of

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380
