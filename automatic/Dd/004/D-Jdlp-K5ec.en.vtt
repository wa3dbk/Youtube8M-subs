my<00:00:54.539> scalp<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.590> would<00:00:55.739> pick<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
my scalp and then I would pick up a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.670 
my scalp and then I would pick up a
bottle<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.850> head<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.239> shoulders<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:58.140> Nizoral
