00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
little bit cleaner maybe giving myself a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.859 
little bit cleaner maybe giving myself a
little<00:01:37.200> more<00:01:37.470> margin<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.700> very<00:01:39.180> aware<00:01:39.360> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
little more margin but be very aware of

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.319 
little more margin but be very aware of
whether<00:01:40.680> or<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.460> guys<00:01:41.640> think<00:01:42.090> you're

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
whether or not you guys think you're

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.300 
whether or not you guys think you're
basically<00:01:42.899> trying<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.350> beat<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> dead<00:01:43.770> horse

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
basically trying to beat a dead horse

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.090 
basically trying to beat a dead horse
and<00:01:44.700> try<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> keep<00:01:45.600> your<00:01:45.840> style<00:01:46.229> even<00:01:46.710> though

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and try to keep your style even though

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.580 
and try to keep your style even though
it's<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.430> working<00:01:47.909> or<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.290> clean<00:01:49.560> it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it's not working or can we just clean it

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.859 
it's not working or can we just clean it
up<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.950> little<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:51.149> think<00:01:51.479> what<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
up a little bit and I think what you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.399 
up a little bit and I think what you
will<00:01:52.020> find<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.939> if<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> latter

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
will find is that if if the latter

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.760 
will find is that if if the latter
occurs<00:01:56.040> where<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.149> guys<00:01:57.360> really<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:58.200> need<00:01:58.500> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
occurs where you guys really do need to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.980 
occurs where you guys really do need to
make<00:01:58.950> an<00:01:59.130> adjustment<00:01:59.219> because<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.869> know

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
make an adjustment because you know

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.670 
make an adjustment because you know
you've<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.409> lost<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.920> first<00:02:02.159> set<00:02:02.280> 6-2<00:02:02.909> and
