the<00:00:17.039> calibrations<00:00:18.770> show<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.920> little<00:00:20.039> bit

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the calibrations show you a little bit

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.529 
the calibrations show you a little bit
of<00:00:20.250> what<00:00:20.400> I'd<00:00:20.520> done<00:00:20.600> have<00:00:21.600> done<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:23.449> need<00:00:24.449> to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
of what I'd done have done I need to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.370 
of what I'd done have done I need to
clean<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> power<00:00:25.260> supply<00:00:25.760> wiring<00:00:27.380> I'll

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
clean up the power supply wiring I'll

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.200 
clean up the power supply wiring I'll
probably<00:00:28.650> take<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.099> apart<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.519> cut<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> wires

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
probably take it apart and cut the wires

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.319 
probably take it apart and cut the wires
back<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.989> then<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.260> noticed<00:00:34.910> notice<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.059> put<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
back and then I noticed notice I put the

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.740 
back and then I noticed notice I put the
ramps<00:00:40.309> mad<00:00:41.309> at<00:00:41.460> them<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> plastic<00:00:44.600> try<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
ramps mad at them on a plastic try and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.240 
ramps mad at them on a plastic try and
get<00:00:45.870> her<00:00:45.930> base<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:48.059> power<00:00:48.300> supply<00:00:49.250> it

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
get her base and the power supply it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.350 
get her base and the power supply it
made<00:00:50.550> for<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.440> good<00:00:52.440> build<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.489> held

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
made for a a good build and held

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.229 
made for a a good build and held
everything<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:55.520> to<00:00:56.520> where<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.879> carry<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
everything up to where you can carry it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.009 
everything up to where you can carry it
in<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.510> piece<00:01:01.520> show<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.699> little<00:01:03.019> something

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
in one piece show you a little something

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.420 
in one piece show you a little something
that<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.290> didn't<00:01:05.010> know<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.369> to

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
that I didn't know it was going to

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.609 
that I didn't know it was going to
happen<00:01:05.720> but<00:01:08.119> this<00:01:10.280> motor<00:01:11.280> stepper<00:01:12.270> motor<00:01:12.619> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
happen but this motor stepper motor is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.749 
happen but this motor stepper motor is
acting<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.220> generator<00:01:14.790> when<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> move<00:01:15.900> this

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
acting like a generator when I move this

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.710 
acting like a generator when I move this
plate<00:01:17.759> back<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.720> forth<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:20.299> LEDs<00:01:21.299> start

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
plate back and forth the LEDs start

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.190 
plate back and forth the LEDs start
lighting<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.470> three<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.250> them<00:01:23.930> for<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
lighting up all three of them for the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.109 
lighting up all three of them for the
hen<00:01:25.950> stops<00:01:27.409> that's<00:01:28.409> interesting<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.119> either

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
hen stops that's interesting that either

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.020 
hen stops that's interesting that either
way<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.900> will<00:01:31.020> light<00:01:31.229> them<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:34.759> just<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.909> little

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
way it will light them up just a little

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.320 
way it will light them up just a little
something<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.540> learned

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.810 

then<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:42.080> got<00:01:42.230> my<00:01:42.380> my<00:01:42.920> hottie<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:43.340> finished

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
then I got my my hottie and finished

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:55.470 
then I got my my hottie and finished
completely

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.900 

I<00:01:55.570> still<00:01:56.320> have<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.620> test<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.460> see<00:01:57.490> if<00:01:57.700> it's

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
I still have to test it to see if it's

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:08.350 
I still have to test it to see if it's
going<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.120> work<00:02:00.660> go<00:02:01.660> around<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.960> back<00:02:02.020> here

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.300 

all<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.080> wearing<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.560> secured<00:02:11.080> Arduino<00:02:12.310> all

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
all the wearing of secured Arduino all

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.380 
all the wearing of secured Arduino all
the<00:02:13.610> wiring<00:02:13.820> and<00:02:16.270> then<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:18.140> end<00:02:18.290> stop<00:02:19.390> I've

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
the wiring and then the end stop I've

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.180 
the wiring and then the end stop I've
built<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.810> end<00:02:20.960> stops<00:02:23.530> matter<00:02:24.530> just<00:02:24.800> parts

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
built the end stops matter just parts

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:35.430 
built the end stops matter just parts
that<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.430> add

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.760 

mhm

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
mhm

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.820 
mhm
well<00:02:38.730> well<00:02:39.240> well

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.550 

pretty<00:02:42.830> interesting<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:45.230> me<00:02:45.350> anyway

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.729 

putting<00:02:50.489> knobs<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:51.090> some<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.780> motors<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:52.680> I

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
putting knobs on some of the motors so I

00:02:52.739 --> 00:03:07.600 
putting knobs on some of the motors so I
could<00:02:52.950> turn<00:02:53.130> them<00:02:53.280> easily<00:02:53.810> like<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.989> z-axis

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.130 

so<00:03:08.180> now<00:03:08.390> i<00:03:10.270> don't<00:03:11.270> have<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.540> hooked<00:03:11.690> up<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
so now i don't have it hooked up to the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.420 
so now i don't have it hooked up to the
computer<00:03:12.170> anything<00:03:12.860> but<00:03:13.070> i'm<00:03:13.130> going<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.310> ahead

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
computer anything but i'm going to ahead

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.770 
computer anything but i'm going to ahead
and<00:03:13.580> power<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.940> out<00:03:15.610> this<00:03:16.610> is<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.850> way<00:03:17.030> my<00:03:17.360> leds

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
and power it out this is a way my leds

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.930 
and power it out this is a way my leds
are<00:03:18.050> going<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.260> be<00:03:18.380> until<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:21.160> put<00:03:22.160> transistors

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
are going to be until I put transistors

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.700 
are going to be until I put transistors
in<00:03:23.210> the<00:03:23.750> circuit<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:25.030> make<00:03:26.030> them<00:03:26.270> off<00:03:26.750> at<00:03:27.500> this

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
in the circuit to make them off at this

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:38.180 
in the circuit to make them off at this
point<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.610> then<00:03:29.390> when<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:29.750> when<00:03:30.440> the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.300 

when<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.340> little<00:03:39.550> flag<00:03:41.459> hits<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.700> end<00:03:42.849> stop

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
when the little flag hits the end stop

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.309 
when the little flag hits the end stop
then<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.459> will<00:03:45.580> turn<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.910> off<00:03:46.060> or<00:03:46.390> turn<00:03:46.870> turn

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
then it will turn it off or turn turn

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.970 
then it will turn it off or turn turn
the<00:03:47.470> LED<00:03:47.560> arm<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.430> got<00:03:48.970> them<00:03:49.090> just<00:03:49.300> backwards

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
the LED arm I got them just backwards

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.380 
the LED arm I got them just backwards
which<00:03:50.980> is<00:03:51.160> all<00:03:51.310> right<00:03:51.580> it's<00:03:52.030> not<00:03:52.180> going<00:03:52.300> to

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
which is all right it's not going to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:04.450 
which is all right it's not going to
hurt<00:03:52.510> anything<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:54.190> turns<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.610> off<00:03:54.730> right<00:03:55.000> now

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.410 

it<00:04:05.030> goes<00:04:05.270> high<00:04:05.540> when<00:04:05.990> it's<00:04:06.170> like<00:04:06.350> this<00:04:07.420> and

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
it goes high when it's like this and

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.120 
it goes high when it's like this and
it's<00:04:08.570> low<00:04:08.780> on<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.230> LEDs<00:04:09.620> on<00:04:09.860> I<00:04:11.950> just<00:04:12.950> have<00:04:13.100> to

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
it's low on the LEDs on I just have to

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.150 
it's low on the LEDs on I just have to
tweak<00:04:13.460> the<00:04:13.490> software<00:04:14.090> thing<00:04:18.010> sort<00:04:19.010> of<00:04:19.070> like

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
tweak the software thing sort of like

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.910 
tweak the software thing sort of like
the<00:04:19.310> LEDs<00:04:19.670> are<00:04:19.880> actually

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.800 

I<00:04:26.980> haven't<00:04:27.910> figured<00:04:28.090> out<00:04:28.270> what<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.510> red

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
I haven't figured out what the red

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.740 
I haven't figured out what the red
flashing<00:04:29.380> light<00:04:29.410> is<00:04:30.240> might<00:04:31.240> have<00:04:31.420> to<00:04:31.540> do<00:04:31.720> with

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
flashing light is might have to do with

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.090 
flashing light is might have to do with
the<00:04:32.140> software<00:04:32.620> trying<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:34.650> find<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.830> software

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
the software trying to find the software

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.000 
the software trying to find the software
or<00:04:36.520> something<00:04:36.700> I<00:04:36.970> don't<00:04:37.030> know<00:04:37.210> that<00:04:38.010> I'll

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
or something I don't know that I'll

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.750 
or something I don't know that I'll
figure<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.400> out<00:04:42.630> as<00:04:43.630> you<00:04:43.810> can<00:04:43.870> see<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.140> little

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
figure it out as you can see a little

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.990 
figure it out as you can see a little
green<00:04:45.760> LED<00:04:46.210> on<00:04:46.390> the<00:04:46.420> Arduino<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:48.490> flashing

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
green LED on the Arduino and a flashing

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.830 
green LED on the Arduino and a flashing
on<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:50.010> ramps<00:04:51.420> 1.4<00:04:52.420> board

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.909 

but<00:04:59.440> as<00:04:59.560> I<00:04:59.710> said<00:04:59.770> I'll<00:05:00.130> have<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:01.620> download<00:05:02.620> the

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
but as I said I'll have to download the

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:10.740 
but as I said I'll have to download the
software<00:05:03.160> and<00:05:07.110> load<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.290> computer<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:09.750> still

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
software and load the computer I still

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.110 
software and load the computer I still
have<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.460> repair<00:05:12.460> my<00:05:12.490> laptop<00:05:12.669> so<00:05:13.419> I<00:05:13.690> can<00:05:13.720> use<00:05:14.080> it

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
have to repair my laptop so I can use it

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.140 
have to repair my laptop so I can use it
which<00:05:16.120> is<00:05:16.300> no<00:05:16.449> big<00:05:16.630> deal<00:05:17.580> but<00:05:18.580> this<00:05:18.760> is<00:05:18.970> where

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
which is no big deal but this is where

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.330 
which is no big deal but this is where
