instead of using the drag-and-drop box
system<00:00:40.440> core<00:00:40.680> graph<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.129> are<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:41.460> to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
system core graph we are now going to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.700 
system core graph we are now going to
get<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.879> our<00:00:42.090> robot<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.480> do<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:42.899> speech<00:00:43.170> using

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
get on our robot to do some speech using

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.860 
get on our robot to do some speech using
coding<00:00:45.559> right<00:00:46.559> hi<00:00:46.800> guys<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.399> today<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.719> are

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
coding right hi guys and today we are

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.979 
coding right hi guys and today we are
looking<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> do<00:00:50.250> some<00:00:50.610> Python<00:00:51.000> coding

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
looking at how to do some Python coding

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.569 
looking at how to do some Python coding
so<00:00:52.289> we're<00:00:52.410> gonna<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.649> our<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:53.010> robot<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
so we're gonna get our now robot to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.750 
so we're gonna get our now robot to
speak<00:00:53.780> using<00:00:54.780> Python<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.280> way<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:56.610> this

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
speak using Python so the way we do this

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.970 
speak using Python so the way we do this
jump<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.210> straight<00:00:57.420> into<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.690> first<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:58.649> we

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
jump is straight into it first of all we

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.010 
jump is straight into it first of all we
always<00:00:59.100> check<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.640> now<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.210> let<00:01:00.480> me<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.690> lift

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
always check on now so let me just lift

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.869 
always check on now so let me just lift
up<00:01:01.170> his<00:01:01.320> arm<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:01.710> sure<00:01:01.829> he's<00:01:01.949> connected<00:01:02.399> yeah

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
up his arm make sure he's connected yeah

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.549 
up his arm make sure he's connected yeah
there<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.420> he's<00:01:03.750> connected<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.409> what

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
there we go he's connected that's what

description so this box will make our

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.550 
description so this box will make our
robots<00:01:51.979> speak<00:01:53.090> in

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
robots speak in

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.720 
robots speak in
speak<00:01:57.360> hello<00:01:58.560> hello<00:01:59.560> I<00:01:59.590> am<00:01:59.860> a<00:02:00.070> robot<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.460> say

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
speak hello hello I am a robot I say

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:09.660 
speak hello hello I am a robot I say
that<00:02:00.990> hello<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:03.570> am<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:05.350> robot<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:08.020> we<00:02:08.110> go<00:02:08.670> now

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
that hello I am a robot there we go now

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.850 
that hello I am a robot there we go now
what<00:02:10.360> we<00:02:10.479> can<00:02:10.630> do<00:02:10.840> is<00:02:11.140> obviously<00:02:11.440> at<00:02:11.800> the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
what we can do is obviously at the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.190 
what we can do is obviously at the
moment<00:02:11.980> it's<00:02:12.250> got<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.520> sort<00:02:12.820> of<00:02:12.850> Python<00:02:13.420> works

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
moment it's got a sort of Python works

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.900 
moment it's got a sort of Python works
got<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> little<00:02:14.709> triangle<00:02:15.130> with<00:02:15.370> image<00:02:15.760> on

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
got a little triangle with image on

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.760 
got a little triangle with image on
there<00:02:16.030> at<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.150> moment<00:02:16.240> now<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.050> can<00:02:17.380> start<00:02:17.650> to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
there at the moment now you can start to

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.470 
there at the moment now you can start to
input<00:02:18.130> your<00:02:18.250> own<00:02:18.280> images<00:02:18.850> I'm<00:02:19.090> probably<00:02:19.330> do

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
input your own images I'm probably do

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.850 
input your own images I'm probably do
another<00:02:19.690> tutorial<00:02:19.870> where<00:02:20.290> I'll<00:02:20.560> show<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.770> how

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
another tutorial where I'll show you how

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.790 
another tutorial where I'll show you how
to<00:02:21.340> make<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.850> new<00:02:22.810> image<00:02:23.110> but<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.560> one

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
to make a new image but for this one

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.190 
to make a new image but for this one
we're<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.040> around<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.910> list<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.420> Gorgoroth

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
we're just around the list so Gorgoroth

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.470 
we're just around the list so Gorgoroth
comes<00:02:26.500> with<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.709> whole<00:02:26.890> list<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.480> different

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
comes with a whole list of different

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.300 
comes with a whole list of different
pictures<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:29.080> can<00:02:29.200> use<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:30.070> as<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:30.250> can

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
pictures that you can use so as you can

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.890 
pictures that you can use so as you can
see<00:02:31.709> now<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:33.190> believe<00:02:33.640> there<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.030> say<00:02:34.390> one<00:02:34.750> in

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
see now I believe there is a say one in

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.199 
see now I believe there is a say one in
the<00:02:35.050> interaction<00:02:35.650> section<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.910> let's<00:02:37.060> have<00:02:37.150> a

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
the interaction section and let's have a

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.820 
the interaction section and let's have a
look<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.690> can<00:02:37.810> use<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.230> one<00:02:38.410> that's<00:02:38.709> what

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
look so you can use that one that's what

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.890 
look so you can use that one that's what
we're<00:02:38.920> doing<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:39.340> that's<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.180> bit<00:02:40.330> boring<00:02:40.570> such

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
we're doing but that's a bit boring such

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.180 
we're doing but that's a bit boring such
as<00:02:41.050> you<00:02:41.170> see<00:02:41.380> something<00:02:41.709> different<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.100> would

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
as you see something different you would

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.979 
as you see something different you would
normally<00:02:42.459> see<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:42.850> that's<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.209> use<00:02:43.420> ball<00:02:43.660> no<00:02:43.959> I

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
normally see so that's it use ball no I

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.470 
normally see so that's it use ball no I
do<00:02:44.250> no<00:02:45.250> particular<00:02:45.760> reason<00:02:46.060> why<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.209> just

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
do no particular reason why I just

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.780 
do no particular reason why I just
because<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:46.780> want<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:46.989> show<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.200> how<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
because I want to show you how the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.610 
because I want to show you how the
change<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.910> images<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.330> here<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:50.170> okay<00:02:50.290> that

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
change the images in here so okay that

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.500 
change the images in here so okay that
you<00:02:50.739> can<00:02:50.890> see<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.430> now<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.820> main<00:02:52.270> image

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
you can see that is now the main image

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.650 
you can see that is now the main image
now<00:02:53.470> if<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.650> go<00:02:53.739> down<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:54.070> type<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.180> or<00:02:55.540> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
now if we go down to type it in or the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.060 
now if we go down to type it in or the
input<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:55.959> output<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:56.380> we<00:02:56.440> come<00:02:56.590> down<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.770> type

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
input and output so we come down to type

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.509 
input and output so we come down to type
and<00:02:57.570> before<00:02:58.570> depending<00:02:59.170> on<00:02:59.260> what<00:02:59.470> way<00:02:59.890> which

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
and before depending on what way which

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.490 
and before depending on what way which
way<00:03:00.730> you'll<00:03:00.940> viewing<00:03:01.390> my<00:03:01.510> tutorials<00:03:02.049> it<00:03:02.290> I've

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
way you'll viewing my tutorials it I've

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500 
way you'll viewing my tutorials it I've
shown<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.489> timeline<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.330> flow

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
shown you the timeline and the flow

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.479 
shown you the timeline and the flow
diagram<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.799> time<00:03:06.010> we're<00:03:06.160> having<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.370> look

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
diagram so this time we're having a look

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.420 
diagram so this time we're having a look
at<00:03:06.760> script<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:07.989> go<00:03:08.200> into<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.470> scripts<00:03:08.739> and

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
at script so I go into the scripts and

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.970 
at script so I go into the scripts and
we'll<00:03:09.640> click<00:03:09.820> OK<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.900> there<00:03:11.140> we<00:03:11.230> have<00:03:11.470> on<00:03:11.769> our

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
we'll click OK and there we have on our

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.229 
we'll click OK and there we have on our
little<00:03:12.160> box<00:03:12.400> now<00:03:13.299> if<00:03:13.660> we<00:03:13.840> click<00:03:14.080> into<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:15.239> that

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
little box now if we click into it that

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.320 
little box now if we click into it that
are<00:03:16.420> we<00:03:17.019> have<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.799> Python<00:03:18.340> code<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:19.180> is

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
are we have the Python code so this is

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.580 
are we have the Python code so this is
this<00:03:19.570> is<00:03:19.690> where<00:03:19.810> we're<00:03:19.930> going<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.110> change<00:03:20.350> or

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
this is where we're going to change or

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.470 
this is where we're going to change or
you<00:03:21.130> can<00:03:21.250> see<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.459> sort<00:03:21.700> of<00:03:21.790> popped<00:03:22.030> up<00:03:22.269> there

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
you can see it sort of popped up there

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.240 
you can see it sort of popped up there
so<00:03:22.810> obviously<00:03:23.380> one<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.860> features<00:03:24.220> of

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
so obviously one of the features of

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.949 
so obviously one of the features of
choreograph<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.600> just<00:03:25.780> doesn't

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
choreograph is that you just doesn't

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.460 
choreograph is that you just doesn't
have<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.290> be<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:28.570> doesn't<00:03:28.810> have<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.019> be<00:03:29.110> set<00:03:29.320> for

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
have to be it doesn't have to be set for

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.990 
have to be it doesn't have to be set for
it<00:03:29.560> can<00:03:29.739> be<00:03:29.830> in<00:03:29.920> its<00:03:30.070> own<00:03:30.160> little<00:03:30.370> box<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.940> do

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
it can be in its own little box I do

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.280 
it can be in its own little box I do
actually<00:03:31.360> want<00:03:31.420> this<00:03:31.570> separate<00:03:32.019> which<00:03:32.170> is

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
actually want this separate which is

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.500 
actually want this separate which is
quite<00:03:32.470> annoying<00:03:32.650> there<00:03:33.280> we<00:03:33.370> go<00:03:33.519> so<00:03:34.030> just<00:03:34.360> drag

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
quite annoying there we go so just drag

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.330 
quite annoying there we go so just drag
it<00:03:34.660> out<00:03:34.810> so<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:35.260> separates<00:03:35.739> just<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.100> can

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
it out so it separates just so I can

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.819 
it out so it separates just so I can
show<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.610> what's<00:03:36.910> going<00:03:37.299> on<00:03:37.420> but<00:03:38.079> yet<00:03:38.260> if<00:03:38.410> you

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
show you what's going on but yet if you

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.590 
show you what's going on but yet if you
pick<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.190> up<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.549> hold<00:03:39.850> hover<00:03:40.150> over<00:03:40.299> a

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
pick it up and hold hover over a

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.050 
pick it up and hold hover over a
particular<00:03:40.840> part<00:03:41.380> of<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:42.640> the

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
particular part of the of the

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.850 
particular part of the of the
choreograph<00:03:43.510> windows<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:44.049> will<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:44.470> pop<00:03:44.650> in

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
choreograph windows it will just pop in

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.080 
choreograph windows it will just pop in
there<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.549> have<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.700> bit<00:03:45.910> more<00:03:45.940> space

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
there so you can have a bit more space

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.930 
there so you can have a bit more space

we're going to do is we are going to
change<00:03:51.459> some<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.850> codes<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.299> when<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.420> get

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
change some of the codes and when I get

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.080 
change some of the codes and when I get
over<00:03:52.840> able<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.170> speak<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.310> piece<00:03:54.519> of<00:03:54.790> code

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
over able to speak and the piece of code

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.210 
over able to speak and the piece of code
that<00:03:55.299> we<00:03:55.420> want<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.690> have<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.810> look<00:03:56.019> at<00:03:56.260> is<00:03:56.470> this

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
that we want to have a look at is this

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.870 
that we want to have a look at is this
one<00:03:57.459> here<00:03:57.790> so<00:03:58.329> this<00:03:58.510> def<00:03:58.810> on<00:03:59.100> input<00:04:00.100> app<00:04:00.340> on

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
one here so this def on input app on

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.990 
one here so this def on input app on
star<00:04:01.630> itself<00:04:02.110> so<00:04:02.860> this<00:04:03.340> is<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.609> one<00:04:03.760> that<00:04:03.880> we

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
star itself so this is the one that we

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.610 
star itself so this is the one that we
need<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.299> alter<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.840> actually<00:04:05.169> get<00:04:05.320> our<00:04:05.440> robot

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
need to alter to actually get our robot

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.760 
need to alter to actually get our robot
to<00:04:05.799> speak<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:07.209> what<00:04:07.750> we're<00:04:07.870> going<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.019> do

easy basic tutorial to start with the
first<00:05:10.810> line<00:05:11.110> creates<00:05:11.710> an<00:05:11.830> object<00:05:11.980> that<00:05:12.790> gives

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
first line creates an object that gives

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.030 
first line creates an object that gives
us<00:05:13.180> access<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.840> robot's<00:05:14.320> text<00:05:14.500> to<00:05:14.890> speech

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
us access to the robot's text to speech

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.090 
us access to the robot's text to speech
capabilities<00:05:16.110> this<00:05:17.110> objects<00:05:17.470> is<00:05:17.620> assigned<00:05:17.980> to

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
capabilities this objects is assigned to

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.720 
capabilities this objects is assigned to
the<00:05:18.280> variable

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
the variable

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.140 
the variable
TTS<00:05:19.330> proxy<00:05:19.780> we<00:05:20.410> can<00:05:20.680> access<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.700> object<00:05:21.790> later

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
TTS proxy we can access the object later

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.630 
TTS proxy we can access the object later
through<00:05:22.450> the<00:05:22.510> name<00:05:22.720> TTS<00:05:23.290> proxy<00:05:23.710> so<00:05:23.980> the<00:05:24.460> top

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
through the name TTS proxy so the top

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.190 
through the name TTS proxy so the top
line<00:05:24.820> here<00:05:25.120> which<00:05:25.360> I'm<00:05:25.540> song<00:05:25.720> them<00:05:25.870> out

line here which I'm song them out

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.530 
line here which I'm song them out
obviously<00:05:26.650> all<00:05:26.770> speech<00:05:27.100> is<00:05:27.130> there<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:28.180> second

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
obviously all speech is there the second

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.040 
obviously all speech is there the second
line<00:05:28.660> calls<00:05:28.960> a<00:05:29.320> different<00:05:29.890> function<00:05:30.400> say

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
line calls a different function say

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.500 
line calls a different function say
let's<00:05:32.050> say<00:05:32.260> they're<00:05:32.610> long<00:05:33.610> belonging<00:05:34.300> to<00:05:34.450> the

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
let's say they're long belonging to the

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.480 
let's say they're long belonging to the
object<00:05:34.870> we<00:05:35.110> just<00:05:35.350> created<00:05:35.650> this<00:05:36.070> function

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
object we just created this function

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.800 
object we just created this function
takes<00:05:36.640> an<00:05:36.850> argument<00:05:37.020> hello<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.320> am<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.710> robot<00:05:38.830> and

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
takes an argument hello I am a robot and

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.570 
takes an argument hello I am a robot and
then<00:05:40.810> it<00:05:40.930> uses<00:05:41.140> a<00:05:41.320> string<00:05:41.830> or<00:05:41.980> sequence<00:05:42.430> of

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
then it uses a string or sequence of

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.430 
then it uses a string or sequence of
characters<00:05:42.820> now<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.210> double<00:05:43.510> quoted<00:05:43.930> marks

the wrote will speak the string that

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.990 
the wrote will speak the string that

will pass to the same method allowed so

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.120 
will pass to the same method allowed so

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
lots of other boxes in there you can

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.130 
lots of other boxes in there you can
just<00:06:39.370> have<00:06:39.490> simply<00:06:39.880> have<00:06:40.000> one<00:06:40.240> box<00:06:40.540> and<00:06:40.780> this

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
just have simply have one box and this

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.220 
just have simply have one box and this
is<00:06:41.200> what<00:06:41.940> the<00:06:42.940> program<00:06:43.420> in<00:06:43.630> Python<00:06:43.810> is<00:06:44.140> all

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
is what the program in Python is all

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.350 
is what the program in Python is all
about<00:06:44.500> so<00:06:44.710> having<00:06:45.010> lots<00:06:45.220> of<00:06:45.340> drag<00:06:45.580> drag<00:06:45.910> boxes

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
about so having lots of drag drag boxes

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.880 
about so having lots of drag drag boxes
in<00:06:46.480> there<00:06:46.660> you<00:06:46.780> just<00:06:46.870> have<00:06:47.080> one<00:06:47.290> box<00:06:47.500> that<00:06:47.650> has

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
in there you just have one box that has

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.220 
in there you just have one box that has
all<00:06:48.490> the<00:06:48.700> codes<00:06:48.910> you<00:06:49.030> need<00:06:49.270> so<00:06:49.600> we<00:06:49.720> sit<00:06:49.990> on<00:06:50.020> it

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230 
all the codes you need so we sit on it

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.110 
all the codes you need so we sit on it
so<00:06:50.770> it<00:06:50.890> makes<00:06:51.100> things<00:06:51.280> tidy<00:06:51.730> and<00:06:51.820> neat<00:06:51.970> and

also<00:06:52.450> it<00:06:52.540> makes<00:06:52.660> the<00:06:52.810> robot<00:06:52.990> work<00:06:53.290> a<00:06:53.410> little

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
also it makes the robot work a little

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.280 
also it makes the robot work a little
bit<00:06:53.860> faster<00:06:54.220> as<00:06:54.340> well<00:06:54.990> brilliant<00:06:55.990> that's<00:06:56.110> it
