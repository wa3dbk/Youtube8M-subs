00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello people I was more happy 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.730
 When I built my table that way 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.319
 much that so cool and found the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.420
 wanted to save and generally cool 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.800
 found that you also build something yourself and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.179
 Building yourself is also really easy 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.710
 good and I have built something myself 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.820
 and I'm very proud of that, too 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.500
 I think that has become very nice 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.210
 that is an idea that already exists 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.460
 quite a long time and although I have one 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.830
 piece of furniture from wine boxes 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 or fruit boxes built and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.160
 You can also do finished designer things 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.599
 but build from these boxes if 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.460
 I just myself these boxes 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.050
 and then myself and it 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.880
 It's really easy, you do not need it 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.559
 three things for three things 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.000
 maybe you need and then you can 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.940
 to lay down about the world 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.129
 because you can build everything and 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.629
 mainz has become a sideboard and that 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.070
 I'll show you now us would be me 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.910
 happy if you like it 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.460
 zuzugucken 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.640
 So you need three things and im 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.680
 the essentials are the wine crates 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.690
 or fruit crates are main 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.430
 now fruit crates why because they are from me 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.780
 have the sense like it better because you must 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.850
 Just look what they look like 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.539
 which measure in which corner the whole 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.450
 should come 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.700
 and i ordered my online at 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.930
 onlineshop that leads and there you can 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.850
 which can easily be ordered either 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.950
 first hand or second hand how to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.229
 Lust has and you can see that they are 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.520
 original fruit boxes that is it is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.200
 not somehow made and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.659
 sanded and painted or something else 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.450
 then you really need real fruit boxes 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.820
 long with imprint with stamp 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.439
 And of course they have one too 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.479
 a little bit of their quirks because they just 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.130
 already been used and I think so 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.600
 but very nice and charming from there 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.880
 I'll link the shop where I am 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.500
 my her have down in the infobox and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.930
 then you just look what 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.400
 I like you scare the can 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.899
 be dusty as can a possibly 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.579
 be spider web in there and if you like her 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.960
 you can find them too rustic too 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.700
 I still paint this now 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.149
 left because I'm just beautiful 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.149
 find 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.700
 then you need a drill and 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.860
 bora are best suited naturally 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.299
 Wood bora and then just needed 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.939
 in the right size that explains me 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.920
 right now and screw it with you 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.720
 that's what our nuts will do 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.069
 There is a connection piece for it completely 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.510
 many possibilities the boxes 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.890
 to connect with each other and I have 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.319
 now the variant you choose 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.150
 will see like that and they are the same 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.959
 three things we need and then 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.330
 Let's go 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.800
 I call the first puzzle then as 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.720
 First, it should be your crates 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.310
 watch if they have gross errors 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.930
 grab them so that they do not end up 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.970
 somehow to be seen if it is you 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.099
 disturbs and otherwise you jigsaw yourself 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.099
 just something together 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.540
 that could be something like that or you could ask 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.040
 they are very different here they can cross 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.690
 You can try turning them over 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.610
 Just what I like from you 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.290
 I also tried several variants 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.390
 to watch for yourself 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.370
 show and it is also very funny because 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.000
 you are totally creative and free 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.000
 can do it 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.750
 and what I just with the drill 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.120
 I'm looking for a drill from the of 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.640
 the size of heart expensive screws fits 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.319
 logically the one with her in the hole 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.640
 gets and hole bonn wants now and 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.010
 for the boxes presented simply 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.840
 she fits each other again properly 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.030
 that they are like them and then volt 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.980
 with the drill just by both 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.450
 crates by bornich then eats it 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.190
 always a little bit out 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.500
 then I am in a happy position 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.930
 to own a cordless screwdriver 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.940
 with whom I simply screw through 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.709
 can screw them on the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.239
 the other side comes out again you see 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.890
 the length has been good for it 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.750
 and then just comes the only 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.459
 Then I'll take care of that 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.409
 then screw with the two boxes 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.200
 hold together really well and that is 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.030
 really easy going and keeps great and that 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.650
 I do now in all possible corners 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.120
 and edges of the crates where i just 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.129
 want them to be attached 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.329
 You do not need much for it but you 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.590
 You should already be sure that 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.590
 whole construct also keeps 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.349
 and that's how I act with everyone 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.610
 other boxes just look like that 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.709
 makes sense as you do the things 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.700
 does not screw together like that 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.440
 that you only have two boxes 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.879
 screwed together and then I realize 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.500
 yes still in the corner but makes 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.450
 you who thought this is just before 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:23.520
 but pretty easy and then it works 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:24.810
 play the whole time just as I have 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.760
 First of all, all the floors together 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.500
 connected and then you see what it am 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.120
 that is, the end has become quite the same 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.280
 but I have the bottom boxes 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.530
 turned around and then the other boxes like that 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.150
 as shelf it asked that I at 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.660
 a sideboard so kind of a small one 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.550
 deposit have with me this design so 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.039
 did not like it very much and 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.070
 still like it and that is now 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.770
 Everything screwed up and at the end 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.750
 After this construct I have just 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.090
 right and left again set up 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.770
 crates mounted because I just still there 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.389
 times a higher stock wanted to have for 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.430
 something coming in then and 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.650
 Overall, I think it's really nice 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.780
 is somehow symmetrical but somehow 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.060
 not and I like that very much 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.530
 and that will be my sideboard where in the best 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.870
 Eventually my tv will be on 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.060
 comes up and everything so no idea 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.560
 belongs to it and I find just this 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.110
 Wine boxes have a beautiful 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.910
 charm the whole thing is cheap yet 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.590
 you can really well because the 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.030
 screwing in just more is easy 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.710
 just screw it again 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.240
 Take out the whole thing together again 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.160
 puzzle if it does not suit you or something 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.919
 because you can be great tastier happy 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.070
 and I like my sideboard very much 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.470
 Well 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.660
 yes and that's it you've seen how 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.789
 many possibilities with this wine 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.280
 or fruit boxes has the 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.520
 cost up again and me 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.960
 believe in this case under 70 euro 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.490
 Try a cool sideboard 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.979
 to find for 70 euros or just in the 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.810
 shelf if you make it and me 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.740
 think that's super cool I already have that 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.240
 seen a couple of times I got it in 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.949
 marie internet seen a lot has 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.570
 at home and then had 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.010
 i just make fun of that was im 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.510
 compared to the table at all 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.270
 no work so if you one 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.420
 bookshelf needs or just sideboard 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.830
 or you can come up with something yourself 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.290
 turn it into a coffee table 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.080
 theoretically that would be in any case 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.540
 an idea and I hope that you 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.040
 liked this video it is more like that 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.630
 an inspiration on how to get the inspiration 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.950
 crates together that's up to you 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.810
 let there be a thousand 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.370
 possibilities but that's what I wanted you 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.050
 like to show and I'm very glad that 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.200
 another piece of furniture to come 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.760
 is where your own heart love sweat 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.360
 and so on, blood is actually 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.000
 not inside 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.950
 is in it and hope this video has 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.210
 you like let me happy 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.590
 feedback about that gives me a name 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.020
 high if you now realize that I am 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.180
 about the construction and the furniture if I have it 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.140
 really possible to build yourself and that 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.120
 share with you 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.440
 and he gives me a thumbs down though 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.150
 I thought it was stupid but I would 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.690
 look forward to your position 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.180
 and I wish you one 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.130
 today and we see and then im 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.410
 next video again many cordial 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.410
 thanks for being up to july
